Carl Levin at the  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Hearing   Tax Haven Abuses  The Enablers  The Tools   Secrecy             Report     PDF    This morning  this Subcommittee is releasing the results of a year long  bipartisan investigation into tax haven abuses   I want to thank our Chairman Norm Coleman and his staff for the support they have given to this investigation  which included the issuance of more than 70 subpoenas  the scheduling of more than 80 interviews  and the review of more than 2 million pages of documents   I believe the findings are explosive   the report blows the lid off tax haven abuses that make use of sham trusts  shell corporations  and fake economic transactions to help some people dodge taxes owed to the U S  Treasury         Experts estimate that tax haven abuses by individuals cost the U S  Treasury between  40 billion and  70 billion every year in taxes that are owed but not collected   Ultimately  that tax gap must be made up by average  honest taxpayers whose faith in the fairness of our tax system is eroding         Our report lays out six case studies illustrating the scope and seriousness of the problem   Today   s hearing focuses on two of them      Inside the Black Box   The key features of offshore tax havens are low or no taxes and a legal system that favors secrecy over transparency   Tax havens sell secrecy to attract business   And they are very successful   About 50 tax havens operate in the world today   Those tax havens have  in effect  declared war on honest U S  taxpayers  by giving tax dodgers the means to avoid their tax bills and leave them for others to pay        These schemes are shrouded in the secrecy of tax havens because they can   t stand the light of day   Trusts and shell corporations established in offshore secrecy jurisdictions operate in a legal black box that allows them to hide assets  mask who controls them  and obscure how their assets are used       An armada of    offshore service providers     lawyers  bankers  brokers  and others then joins forces to exploit the black box secrecy and help clients skirt U S  tax  securities  and anti money laundering laws   Many of the firms concocting or facilitating these schemes are respected names here in the United States         Our focus today is on two different schemes   The first scheme was used to avoid paying taxes on stock option compensation and investment income flowing from it   The second hid income from capital gains   At its core  each scheme relied on a key deception made possible by tax haven secrecy      Wyly Case Study   The first case study looks at the tax haven schemes of Sam and Charles Wyly   For thirteen years  the Wylys used the black box and its facilitators to direct and enjoy the benefits of hundreds of millions of dollars in stock option income that they sent offshore to supposedly independent entities        Between 1992 and 2005  Sam and Charles Wyly transferred over 17 million stock options and warrants worth about  190 million to a complex array of 19 offshore trusts and 39 shell corporations   The 19 offshore trusts were either established by the Wylys or named them as beneficiaries   These  trusts owned the 39 shell corporations in the Isle of Man or the Cayman Islands   In return for most of the stock options  the offshore corporations gave the Wylys private annuities designed to make payments starting many years later   The Wylys took the position  on the advice of legal counsel  that because they exchanged their stock options for annuities of equivalent value  they didn   t have to pay any taxes on the compensation until the annuities paid out        In the meantime  the offshore entities began cashing in the stock options   The proceeds were invested in securities  Wyly hedge funds  Wyly businesses  and real estate   The Subcommittee traced about  500 million in offshore dollars invested in Wyly business investments  about  85 million used to acquire or improve real estate used by Wyly family members  and about  30 million spent on art  furnishings  and jewelry for the personal use of Wyly family members    In addition  about  140 million of the offshore dollars went back to the Wylys in the form of loans funneled through a Cayman shell corporation called Security Capital        This chart sums up the Wyly offshore empire   It started with untaxed stock option compensation  most of which     124 million    remains untaxed today   It grew with untaxed investment gains   And it provided a ready source of untaxed  offshore cash for loans or other uses the Wylys wanted          The key deception in this scheme is the Wyly claim that the 58 offshore trusts and corporations were independent   Under U S  law  the tax on the income of a truly independent trust is paid by the trustees   But if a U S  person controls the trust   s assets and investments  then the trust   s income is generally taxable to that person        The claim that the offshore trusts were independent of the Wylys is contradicted by overwhelming evidence   This is not a case where the Wylys handed over their stock options and awaited the annuity payments  while independent trustees operated the trusts   Instead  for thirteen years  the Wylys and their representatives continually told the trusts what to do     when to exercise the stock options  when to sell the shares  and what to do with the money   The Wylys conveyed their directions through so called    trust protectors     individuals selected by the Wylys  who worked for the Wylys  and who were empowered to fire any offshore trustee   The protectors transmitted the Wyly directions to the offshore trustees who consistently carried them out        The offshore entities exercised options and traded shares from three companies  Michaels Stores Inc   Sterling Software Inc  and Sterling Commerce Inc   where the Wylys were founders and directors   The Wylys  on the advice of counsel  generally did not include the stock holdings of the offshore entities in their SEC filings  claiming  again  that the offshore entities were independent   When the offshore entities opened securities accounts at Bank of America and were asked to name their beneficial owners as required by new U S  anti money laundering laws  they refused to do so  claiming again they were independent   Bank of America allowed the accounts to operate without getting the information required by law       By promoting the fiction that the trusts were independent  the Wylys participated in a 13 year sham to circumvent U S  tax  securities  and anti money laundering requirements        POINT Case Study    The Wyly case study traces the building of an offshore empire over 13 years   The next case study  by contrast  focuses on one time  abusive tax shelter transactions        This scheme used the tax haven black box to facilitate the creation of a fake stock portfolio with phantom securities used to generate billions of dollars of fake losses   Once again  the armada was hard at work  generating hefty fees for themselves by designing complex partnership structures  circular transactions  and impenetrable legal opinions to justify the deferral or elimination of taxes owed on  2 billion in real capital gains       A Seattle based securities firm called Quellos designed  promoted  and implemented the tax shelter known as POINT     Personally Optimized Investment Transaction     which it sold to five wealthy clients in six separate transactions          The POINT strategy was designed to be impossible to pierce   Take a look at this chart   It   s a bowl of spaghetti and may look comical  but the sobering fact is that these six transactions cost the Treasury about  300 million in lost revenue     revenue which  if these transactions aren   t reversed  will have to be made up by honest taxpayers        POINT worked like this   Quellos put together a list of high tech stocks  together worth about  9 5 billion  many of which had stock prices that were expected to drop   The list went to a shell corporation in the Isle of Man called Jackstones   Although Jackstones did not actually own any of the stocks  it conducted a fake stock sale to another shell corporation called Barnville   On paper  Barnville paid  9 5 billion which  of course  it didn   t have   Barnville then immediately lent the stock back to Jackstones in exchange for the same enormous sum  and the money which didn   t exist then became security for the loan of the non existent stock   Because the two companies did these deals simultaneously  the amounts of stock and cash they owed each other cancelled out   In a sleight of hand worthy of Houdini  Barnville was left with a huge paper portfolio   Barnville then picked from its paper portfolio a selection of stocks with the amount of capital losses needed by a client to offset their capital gains  and transferred those losses to a trading partnership owned by the client        So  to review  a phony Isle of Man corporation sold stock it didn   t own to another phony Isle of Man corporation for money it didn   t have   The fake stock was lent back with fake cash as security for repayment of the loan  and the fake loss on the stock price was transferred out to offset real gains   No real economic activity took place  but one critical thing happened     a  9 billion paper portfolio was created   This paper portfolio originated with Jackstones and Barnville  shell operations with no employees  no offices  and paid in capital of   2     that   s about  5 each          The final step in the POINT scheme was for Barnville to sell the paper losses to wealthy individuals  including Haim Saban and Robert Wood Johnson IV   These clients used the paper losses to offset real capital gains   Mr  Saban used POINT to offset about  1 5 billion in capital gains  Mr  Johnson offset about  143 million   Together  the fees they paid to Quellos  the lawyers  the bankers  and others totaled about  75 million   One more proof that this sordid tale was used to concoct tax losses is the fact that the greater the paper loss generated for a client  the greater the fees charged by Quellos          The POINT tax shelter included transactions to create the appearance of a complex investment with real economic substance   In reality  the transactions were expertly designed to remove all risk  using circular transactions that cancelled out or were unwound   A 5 year warrant  for example  which was included in the transactions to produce the illusion of a profit potential  was always terminated before any profits were realized   In a transaction involving Mr  Saban  an  800 million loan and stock purchase were added to provide a patina of economic substance  but the way the transaction was structured  it could not realize a profit in comparison to the transaction   s fees and other costs   For example  the cost of a collar that capped possible profits at 8  of the total investment reduced a  130 million profit to  13 million  which was then dwarfed by fees totaling  53 million       Mr  Saban told the Subcommittee staff that POINT was not sold to him as an investment strategy  it was sold to him as a way to avoid taxes that he otherwise would have had to pay on a big capital gain   In his words  he was promised    tax deferral ad infinitum    on a  1 5 billion capital gain  and that   s what he paid for       The key deception in POINT was the fake offshore portfolio that generated fake stock losses sold to partnerships with a false business purpose   The end result was  2 billion in real and taxable capital gains that were supposedly erased      Professional Blinders   One of the most disturbing aspects of the POINT scheme was the degree to which reputable professionals aided and abetted this abusive tax shelter   Each of the facilitators    the lawyers  bankers  and brokers     played critical roles  pulled in hefty fees  but then acted surprised at what the Subcommittee found when it lifted the lid off the black box   Most claimed they had been unaware that no securities had actually been bought or sold  and no real losses generated   No one knew who was behind the tax haven corporations with the  9 billion portfolio  Jackstones and Barnville   The professionals hid behind shaky legal opinions to justify their roles and donned blinders to block out indicators of the sordid business they were involved in   Each participant essentially told the Subcommittee      I was only responsible for my little piece of this   I didn   t know the other parts   It   s not my fault           Quellos  the architect of the sham  says it doesn   t know who owns Barnville and Jackstones       EURAM  the UK company that served as the agent in all the deals between Barnville and Jackstones and was paid millions in fees  says it doesn   t know who is behind the shell corporations       HSBC  the global bank that loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to fuel some of these transactions and knew it was financing deals set up to avoid taxes  says it didn   t know who Barnville and Jackstones were  didn   t know about key steps in the transactions  and relied on the tax opinions provided by legal counsel       The Cravath Swaine partner who put the law firm   s seal of approval on POINT and made  125 000 in fees  says he didn   t know about the fake trades or the role of Barnville and Jackstones         Bryan Cave  another law firm that put its seal of approval on POINT and made over  1 million in fees  disavows knowledge of how the paper portfolio was formed and of the corporations that formed it         Could it be true that the banks and brokers and lawyers who participated in POINT didn   t know what they were involved with   Or is it that they didn   t want to know        Conclusion   The Wyly chart and the POINT chart say it all   They show how broken the system is  and how serious the tax haven abuses have become        These tax haven abuses are eating away at the fabric of the U S  tax system  and undermining U S  laws intended to safeguard our capital markets and financial systems from financial crime   It is long  long past time for our country to shut down their use by U S  citizens       One of the reforms recommended in our report would address the key deceptions in the two case studies examined here   the fake economic activity offshore and the fake independence of the offshore trusts and corporations       This reform would create a presumption regarding who controls an offshore entity and what purpose it is serving  if that entity is located in a jurisdiction deemed to be a tax haven by the U S  Treasury Secretary   Today  the government has the burden of proving that an individual controls a tax haven trust or shell corporation   It is time to reverse that presumption       In other words  if you create a trust or corporation in a tax haven jurisdiction  send it assets  or benefit from its actions  Congress should reform the tax law to presume that you control it  that any income is your income  and treat that income and that entity accordingly for tax  securities  and money laundering purposes   An individual could still establish that an offshore entity was independent  but the burden of proof would be on that individual  not the government       Congress should also enact S  1565  the Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act that Senator Coleman and I introduced last year which  among other provisions  would authorize the Treasury Secretary to issue a list of tax havens that don   t cooperate with U S  tax enforcement and eliminate U S  tax benefits for income in those jurisdictions   The ability to penalize uncooperative tax havens would hand our government a mighty club to combat tax haven abuses       This hearing and the report we are releasing today shine a needed spotlight into the black box of offshore tax havens   It reveals a system that is corrupt and corrupting   Honest Americans are footing the bill for tax haven abuses  and we need to shut those abuses down         Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for the important role you and your staff have played in this matter   Bipartisanship has been the hallmark of this Subcommittee  and you are helping to preserve that critically important tradition   I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses
