                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON     Today  citing  570 million in cost savings for federal taxpayers  Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn   introduced   PDF  to modernize the federal tax lien system by moving it from paper based filings in local recording offices to electronic filings on a national tax lien registry accessible through the Internet          Outdated laws are forcing the IRS to waste taxpayer dollars on an old fashioned  inefficient  and burdensome paper tax lien filing system that could be easily replaced by a modern electronic filing system that could save taxpayers a half a billion dollars over the next ten years     said Levin      Using a centralized  electronic filing system instead of a decentralized system requiring tax liens to be filed on paper in over 4 000 local recording offices across the country would save millions of taxpayer dollars  while actually improving taxpayer service   Liens would be filed faster  errors would be easier to correct  and  once resolved  liens could be released quicker    in 10 days instead of the 30 days now permitted             The current federal tax lien system is costly  antiquated  and generally unreliable  Tax liens are an essential tool to recover unpaid taxes  which is why we need to bring the system into the twenty first century     said Senator Coleman      Our legislation is a common sense solution that would modernize the tax lien system and save more than  500 million over the next ten years   In short  the bill would enable the IRS to file federal tax liens electronically and would post all federal tax liens on the IRS website   Registering federal tax liens on line will dramatically reduce paperwork and will save more than  220 million dollars in filing fees alone   Posting the liens on line will make tax lien information more readily available to the public and will make it easier for federal contracting officials to make sure that the federal government is not handing over hard earned taxpayer dollars to tax cheating federal contractors           Tax liens are a principal tool used by the IRS to collect funds from persons who are delinquent in paying their taxes   Notices of tax liens must be made public   Currently  tax lien notices are made public by filing them in one or more of 4 100 local recording offices          The bipartisan Tax Lien Simplification Act is the result of investigations into abusive tax shelters  offshore tax havens  and tax delinquent federal contractors conducted over the last four years by the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  on which Levin serves as the Chairman and Coleman serves as the Ranking Member   During the course of those investigations  the Subcommittee learned of the existing  decentralized system for filing federal tax liens and the high costs of maintaining it   The Internal Revenue Service  IRS   for example  maintains a service center dedicated to monitoring dozens of varying local requirements regulating the format and legal styling applicable to tax lien filings  preparing those liens in the proper format  requesting local officials to file the liens  paying lien filing fees  tracing and replacing lost filings  correcting errors  and  once resolved  releasing appropriate liens        The bill would replace the local filing system with a centralized  federal tax lien registry that would be operated by the IRS and made accessible and searchable by the public on the Internet at no cost   Each federal tax lien would use the same format and be made effective from the date and time of its recording in the national registry  in the same manner as now occurs with local filings   Once the underlying tax liability was resolved  the IRS would have 10 days instead of the current 30 days to release the tax lien and remove it from the registry       The bill would give the Treasury Secretary authority to issue regulations or other guidance for the tax lien registry   Treasury would be required to make the registry secure and prevent data tampering   Before the registry was implemented  the Treasury Secretary would also be required to review the information currently included in public tax lien filings to determine whether any of that information should be excluded or protected from public viewing on the Internet   For example  the Treasury Secretary would be expected to prevent the disclosure of social security numbers that currently are included in many public tax lien filings  but  if disclosed on the Internet  could facilitate identity theft   The bill is thus expected to provide greater protection of some taxpayer information than occurs in current tax lien filings   The bill would require the registry to be operational by January 1  2009  but would allow continued use of the existing local filing system for an appropriate time to ensure a smooth transition       The IRS has estimated that  over ten years  the new system would result in taxpayer savings of approximately  570 million   The savings would come from the elimination of state filing fees  IRS personnel costs  travel costs related to local filing problems  and the cost of lost taxes when the IRS makes an error or a tax lien filing is misplaced or delayed       Download a copy of the bill    PDF       Read Senator Levin s floor statement on the bill        Read a summary of the bill
