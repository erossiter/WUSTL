                                                                                                                                                             Bill targets  100 billion in lost tax revenue  each year from offshore tax dodges      WASHINGTON     Today  citing  100 billion in revenue drained from the U S  Treasury at the expense of honest  hardworking American families who pay their fair share  Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn   and Sen  Barack Obama  D Ill   introduced comprehensive  to stop offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses       For more than four years  Levin and Coleman  the Chairman and senior Republican of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  have led an in depth Subcommittee investigation into offshore tax havens  abusive tax shelters  and the professionals who design  market  and implement these tax dodges  Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury from offshore tax evasion alone approaches  100 billion per year  including  40 to  70 billion from individuals and another  30 billion from corporations engaging in offshore tax evasion   Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of dollars more            With a  345 billion annual tax gap and a  248 billion annual deficit     said Levin     we cannot tolerate a  100 billion drain on our Treasury each year from offshore tax abuses   We cannot tolerate tax cheats offloading their unpaid taxes onto the backs of honest taxpayers   Offshore tax havens have declared economic war on honest U S  taxpayers by helping tax cheats hide income and assets that should be taxed in the same way as other Americans   This bill provides a powerful set of new tools to clamp down on offshore tax and tax shelter abuses             It is simply unacceptable that some individuals are using offshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions to shelter trillions of dollars in assets from taxation     said Coleman     These tax schemes cause a massive revenue shortfall and  sadly  it is the honest American taxpayer who must bear a disproportionate burden of investing in areas like education and healthcare   We are introducing this bill to close these loopholes  shut down offshore tax schemes  and ensure that every American pays their fair share of taxes                This is a basic issue of fairness and integrity     said Obama      We need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our tax laws so that those who work hard and play by the rules aren   t disadvantaged          The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act is a strengthened version of a tax reform bill that Levin  Coleman  and Obama introduced in the last Congress   The legislation was strengthened as a result of a year long Subcommittee investigation which resulted in a hearing and report on August 1  2006  examining a series of case studies showing how U S  taxpayers are using offshore secrecy jurisdictions to dodge U S  taxes             None of these offshore schemes would work     said Levin     without the secrecy that prevents U S  agencies from enforcing our laws   Our bill offers innovative ways to combat offshore secrecy   We can   t let the offshore tax havens hide  100 billion in U S  tax revenues which are needed to protect our troops  fund health care and education  and meet the other needs of American families          Among other measures  the 68 page bill would    ESTABLISH PRESUMPTIONS TO COMBAT OFFSHORE SECRECY by allowing U S  tax and securities law enforcement to presume that non publicly traded  offshore corporations and trusts are controlled by the U S  taxpayers who formed them or sent them assets  unless the taxpayer proves otherwise      IMPOSE TOUGHER REQUIREMENTS ON U S  TAXPAYERS USING OFFSHORE SECRECY JURISDICTIONS by listing 34 jurisdictions which have already been named in IRS court filings as probable locations for U S  tax evasion      AUTHORIZE SPECIAL MEASURES TO STOP OFFSHORE TAX ABUSES by giving Treasury authority to take special measures against foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions that impede U S  tax enforcement      STRENGTHEN DETECTION OF OFFSHORE ACTIVITIES by requiring U S  financial institutions that open accounts for foreign entities controlled by U S  clients  open accounts in offshore secrecy jurisdictions for U S  clients  or establish entities in offshore secrecy jurisdictions for U S  clients  to report such actions to the IRS      CLOSE OFFSHORE TRUST LOOPHOLES by taxing offshore trust income used to buy real estate  artwork and jewelry for U S  persons  and treating as trust beneficiaries those persons who actually receive offshore trust assets      STRENGTHEN PENALTIES on tax shelter promoters by increasing the maximum fine to 150  of their ill gotten gains  and on corporate insiders who hide offshore stock holdings by increasing the maximum fine on them to  1 million per violation of U S  securities laws      STOP TAX SHELTER PATENTS by prohibiting the U S  Patent and Trademark Office from issuing patents for    inventions designed to minimize  avoid  defer  or otherwise affect liability for Federal  State  local  or foreign tax     and     REQUIRE HEDGE FUNDS AND COMPANY FORMATION AGENTS TO KNOW THEIR OFFSHORE CLIENTS by requiring them to establish anti money laundering programs like other U S  financial institutions  under regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department      Read Senator Levin s Senate  on the bill       Read a  of the bill       Click here for  of the bill
