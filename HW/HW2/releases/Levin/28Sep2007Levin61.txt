                                                                                                                                                             Current Tax Practice Encourages Large Stock Option Grants to Corporate Executives  Fuels Huge Pay Gap  and Costs Billions in Lost Tax Revenue               WASHINGTON     Today  citing a mismatch between the requirements for book and tax treatment of executive stock options  Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  introduced  to require the federal corporate tax deduction for stock option compensation to be the same as the expense shown on corporate financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC           Current stock option accounting and tax rules are out of kilter  lead to corporations reporting inconsistent stock option expenses on their financial books versus their tax returns  and often produce huge tax windfalls for companies that pay their executives with large stock option grants     said Levin      Our bill would end the double standard of companies deducting more from their taxes than the stock option expenses shown on their books   By eliminating this outdated and overly generous corporate tax deduction  we would eliminate a tax incentive that encourages corporate boards to hand out huge executive stock option pay which  in turn  fuels the growing chasm between executive pay and the earnings of rank and file workers   The tycoon J P  Morgan said about a century ago that CEO pay should not exceed 20 times average worker pay   Right now  in the United States  average CEO pay is nearly 400 times average worker pay          The Levin bill  the Ending Corporate Tax Favors For Stock Options Act  has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of America  Citizens for Tax Justice  Tax Justice Network USA  OMBWatch  the Financial Policy Forum  and the AFL CIO         Stock options give the holder the right to buy company stock at a set price for a specified period of time  typically ten years   Most U S  CEOs receive stock options as part of their pay   According to Forbes magazine  in 2006  the average pay of CEOs at 500 of the largest U S  companies was  15 2 million   Nearly half of that amount  48   came from stock options that had been cashed in for an average gain of  7 3 million       The bill is the product of an investigation by Levin   s Subcommittee into the different book and tax reporting requirements for executive stock options         Current accounting rules  under Financial Accounting Standard 123R  require companies to report stock option expenses on financial statements filed with the SEC using the fair value of the options on the date they are granted to executives   These rules  which took effect in 2005  are the result of more than 15 years of work by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to devise a fair and accurate method for calculating stock option expenses   Section 83 of the tax code  on the other hand  provides that companies that want to deduct stock option expenses on their tax returns must use the value realized when the stock options are exercised  an event which often occurs years after the options were granted   These tax rules  essentially unchanged since 1969  have yet to be coordinated with the new accounting rules        Under current law  stock options are the only compensation expense where the tax code allows corporations to deduct more than their actual expenses         A Levin Subcommittee hearing  in June 2007  showed that stock option expenses calculated on the exercise date typically result in tax deductions that are many times larger than the grant date expenses shown on company books   Nine companies cooperating with the Subcommittee calculated  for example  that the amount of stock option tax deductions they claimed from 2002 through 2006 was about 5 times greater than the expenses they would have reported to the SEC if the new accounting rules had been in effect when the options were granted   The nine companies reported about  1 2 billion in total tax deductions for stock option expenses that would have totaled about  217 million on their books  for a book tax difference of about  1 billion       The Subcommittee also asked the IRS for data on stock option book tax differences for U S  corporations as a whole   This data  compiled by the IRS from a new M 3 tax return requiring U S  corporations to explain their book tax differences  shows that  for corporate tax returns filed primarily in 2004  companies reported a total of about  43 billion more in stock option tax deductions than the stock option expenses shown on their books   The IRS data found that only 250 companies accounted for 82  of this total difference   The IRS also determined that stock options were a key factor in why corporations reported different income on their books compared to their tax returns          Requiring companies to limit their stock option tax deductions to the amount of stock option expenses shown on their books would eliminate billions of dollars in unwarranted corporate tax deductions each year     said Levin     Eliminating unwarranted and excess stock option deductions could mean as much as  5 to  10 billion annually in additional corporate tax revenues that we can   t afford to lose              It makes no sense to have two sets of rules for expensing stock options for accounting and tax purposes     he added     and it makes no sense for taxpayers to be subsidizing stock option pay for corporate executives   The bill would eliminate this stock option double standard  end existing tax favors for stock options  and remove a federal tax policy that now inadvertently fuels sky high executive pay           In addition to revising the corporate tax deduction for stock options  the bill would make stock option pay for top corporate executives part of the same  1 million cap on the tax deductions that can now be claimed by publicly traded corporations for other forms of executive pay under Section 162 m  of the tax code      Bill Summary   The bill would    match the corporate tax deduction for stock option compensation to the stock option book expense shown on the corporation   s financial statement      allow corporations to deduct stock option compensation in the same year it is recorded on the company books  without waiting for the options to be exercised      ensure research tax credits use the same stock option deduction when computing the    wages    eligible for this tax credit      create a transition rule which would apply the new tax deduction to stock option exercises occurring after enactment  permit the old tax deduction rule to apply to options vested prior to adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 123R  June 15  2005   and allow a catch up deduction in the first year after enactment for options that vested after adoption of FAS 123R but before the date of enactment  and     eliminate favored treatment of corporate executive stock options under tax code section 162 m  by making executive stock option compensation deductions part of the exising  1 million cap on corporate deductions that applies to other types of compensation paid to the top executives of publicly held corporations
