Companies Who Pay Taxes      WASHINGTON  D C      House and Senate lawmakers today argued against adding a special provision to the tax technical corrections bill that would shield Accenture from paying millions of dollars in U S  taxes on its international profits   Accenture  which was formerly a part of Arthur Anderson  moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to Bermuda in 2001   News reports have stated that Accenture has been lobbying for this provision to be included in the bill  which is expected to be introduced shortly       U S  Senator Carl Levin  and U S  Representatives Rosa L  DeLauro  Conn  3   Richard Neal  MA 2   Louise Slaughter  NY 28   Lloyd Doggett  TX 25   Marion Berry  AR 01   and John Lewis  GA 05  today sent a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and Ranking Member Max Baucus and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas and Ranking Member Charlie Rangel           This is a question of responsibility     wrote the lawmakers      Hard working Americans  Mom and Pop small businesses  and thousands of corporations with integrity meet their responsibilities by paying their fair share of taxes   Accenture chose a different path  pushing its share of the burden onto others   The Committee had it right last year  Accenture   s inversion transaction was obviously a means of avoiding U S  taxes and it should be curtailed     not condoned and rewarded     wrote the lawmakers           The lawmakers stated that they would oppose the normally non controversial corrections bill should this provision be included       Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act last year  specifically condemning the practice of corporate expatriation  while exempting those companies which had already incorporated overseas       The full

20515   Dear Chairmen Grassley and Thomas and Ranking Members Baucus and Rangel   The Wall Street Journal  reported July 14th that  as drafters of a technical corrections bill  you are contemplating including a special provision to shield Accenture from the anti inversion provisions passed as part of last year s international tax law  Writing new rules with the specific purpose of allowing Accenture to avoid paying millions of dollars in U S  taxes on its international profits would be extremely unfair to U S  companies who pay their fair share  We urge you not to incorporate these controversial measures into the legislation   When Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act last year  it specifically condemned the practice of corporate expatriation  The House report accompanying the legislation states     The Committee believes that certain inversion transactions are a means of avoiding U S  tax and should be curtailed     The Committee had it right last year  Accenture s inversion transaction was obviously a means of avoiding U S  taxes and it should  be curtailed    not condoned and rewarded   This is a question of responsibility  Hard working Americans  Mom and Pop small businesses  and thousands of corporations with integrity meet their responsibilities by paying their fair share of taxes  Accenture chose a different path  pushing its share of the burden onto others  The Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committees both have responsibilities of their own  to protect the taxpayers who play by the rules  Those Committees will hopefully assume that responsibility and reject this unworthy effort to flout the laws that bind everyone else   The technical corrections bill need not be a contentious piece of legislation  However  if the provisions exempting Accenture remain  we will oppose the legislation vigorously   Sincerely       Senator Carl Levin Richard Neal    Lloyd Doggett Rosa DeLauro    Marion Berry Louise Slaughter    John Lewis
