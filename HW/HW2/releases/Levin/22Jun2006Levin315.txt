All seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday pressed Chairman Susan Collins to hold hearings on the billions of dollars in Iraqi reconstruction funds that have been squandered due to waste  fraud  abuse  and mismanagement                   Auditors and investigators have issued repeated reports of waste and mismanagement over the past three years   Last year  the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction  SIGIR  concluded that the Coalition Provisional Authority  CPA  could not track over  8 billion it had transferred to Iraqi ministries and that CPA officials left millions of dollars in cash unsecured in their offices  Numerous SIGIR reports have documented a range of procurement problems  including excessive reliance on sole source contracts  instances of outright contractor fraud  insufficient ability to trace the disposition of funds  repeated instances of unsupported contractor costs  and widespread deficiencies in contract oversight                      Waste  mismanagement and corruption undermine America   s mission in Iraq     the Senators said in their letter     And in some instances  the failure of contractors to fulfill their obligations has jeopardized the health  welfare and safety of American troops and civilian personnel                        As the Committee responsible for the oversight of federal contracting  it is our duty to understand what has gone wrong with the process for awarding and managing contracts  to identify deficiencies  and to ensure appropriate remedies are enacted                      The letter came on the heels of an unsuccessful Senate vote to create a special committee to investigate Iraqi contracting mismanagement  similar to a commission established under President Harry Truman to investigate waste  fraud  and abuse during World War II  The Truman commission saved taxpayers billions of dollars  All Senators who signed the letter to Collins also voted in favour of the amendment                   Senators Joe Lieberman  D Conn   and Frank Lautenberg  D N J   have previously requested Chairman Collins conduct oversight of Iraqi reconstruction contracts     particularly Halliburton contracts   The Chairman refused their requests                    In addition to Lieberman and Lautenberg  other Senators signing onto the letter include Carl Levin  D Mich   Daniel Akaka  D Hi   Tom Carper  D Del   Mark Dayton  D Minn   and Mark Pryor  D Ark                 A copy of the letter appears below        June 20  2006      The Honorable Susan M  Collins  Chairman  Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510         Dear Chairman Collins      We are requesting that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hold hearings on waste  fraud  and abuse associated with contracts related to Iraqi reconstruction and support of U S  military operations in Iraq                                 We are deeply concerned over the repeated reports of the misuse of funds under the Iraqi contracts   As you noted at the nomination hearing of Ambassador Robert Portman as Director of the Office of Management and Budget  the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR  has found excessive reliance on sole source contracts  instances of outright contractor fraud  and an insufficient ability to trace the disposition of the funds   The SIGIR also has identified repeated instances of unsupported contractor costs and significant deficiencies in contract administration processes and controls         Waste  mismanagement  and corruption undermine America   s mission in Iraq   The latest reports from the SIGIR are replete with examples of reconstruction projects that are behind schedule     or even incapable of completion     due in large part to poor contract planning and oversight   And in some instances  the failure of contractors to fulfill their obligations has jeopardized the health  welfare  and safety of American troops and civilian personnel        As the Committee responsible for the oversight of federal contracting  it is our duty to understand what has gone wrong with the process for awarding and managing contracts  to identify deficiencies  and to ensure appropriate remedies are enacted   For example  the no bid    Restore Iraqi Oil    contract awarded to Halliburton   s subsidiary KBR continues to raise troubling questions   The Defense Contract Audit Agency  DCAA  identified approximately  263 million as    potentially excessive or unjustified    costs charged by KBR under this contract   Yet the Department of Defense  DOD   without clear justification  elected to pay  253 million     over 96      of the disputed costs  despite a determination by the auditors that the charges were inflated and not properly supported by documentation   The settlement with KBR stands in sharp contrast to the outcome under thousands of other military contracts  where audits resulted in DOD paying  on average  only 25  of disputed costs in 2004 and 44  in 2005   DOD   s decision is even more disturbing given that auditors  through last June  had identified more than  1 4 billion in questioned and unsupported costs submitted by Halliburton and its subsidiaries under various contracts        David Norquist   s testimony at his May 8  2006  confirmation hearing to be Chief Financial Officer for the Department of Homeland Security also was a stark reminder that Congressional oversight is needed to ensure that federal agencies do not shirk their duty to confront waste  fraud  and abuse forcefully   As discussed at the hearing  when a U N  monitoring board requested copies of the DCAA audits of the Restore Iraqi Oil contracts  DOD provided copies of the audits that struck every reference to every overcharge in every audit     463 redactions in all that had been made at Halliburton   s request   We still have no satisfactory explanation of why DOD decided to give a contractor implicated in an overcharging scheme the final say on what information to provide to the legal entity responsible for oversight of the Iraqi funds        Unfortunately  auditors and investigators have uncovered extensive waste  fraud  and abuse involving numerous government entities and many contractors        Last year  the SIGIR reported that the Coalition Provisional Authority  CPA  could not track over  8 billion it had transferred to Iraqi ministries and that CPA officials left millions of dollars in cash unsecured in their offices    Auditors in one region found that contract managers could not account for  97 million disbursed from the Development Fund for Iraq    An audit of programs designed to train guards to protect Iraq   s oil and electrical infrastructure concluded that U S  agencies could not provide reasonable assurance that  147 million expended under these programs was used for its intended purpose    In one case the SIGIR found that a company which was awarded a security management contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars could provide no assurance that it was providing the best possible safety for government and reconstruction personnel  as required by the contract  and could not even show that its employees authorized to carry weapons were trained to use those weapons    As a result of federal investigations  a U S  contractor and a CPA regional comptroller recently pleaded guilty in a case involving a bribery  fraud  conspiracy  and money laundering scheme that defrauded the CPA of millions of dollars     These are but a few examples that raise serious questions about the adequacy of planning and oversight by U S  agencies of the contracts under their control   The SIGIR also has identified many other instances of insufficient documentation to substantiate fee payments  failure to account for millions of dollars in cash grants  active circumvention of grant requirements  violation of conflict of interest rules  needless expenditure of funds for duplicative projects  over expenditure of interest penalty payments  and a general lack of oversight   We know about many of these abuses because the SIGIR has established and maintains a permanent office with a large staff in Iraq   It is quite likely  however  that a large amount of waste  fraud  and abuse has gone undetected   For example  it is our understanding that the DOD Inspector General has never had any staff based in Iraq   As the United States continues to spend billions of dollars on Iraqi reconstruction  we must ensure that better oversight is in place to prevent the loss of still greater sums        Under your leadership  the Committee has conducted many hearings to expose waste  fraud  and abuse   Just recently  the Committee held two hearings on fraudulent and abusive spending practices associated with Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery  The Committee   s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation is currently looking into one example of contractor abuse involving allegations that U S  troops were exposed to contaminated water in Iraq   We ask that the Committee exercise similar oversight more broadly of the Iraqi reconstruction contracts to prevent further waste of precious tax payer dollars and to hold accountable those who misused Iraqi funds entrusted to U S  government management          During World War II  Senator Harry S  Truman led the Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program which investigated waste and corruption in the war effort  saving as much as  15 billion dollars   In that same tradition  we believe aggressive oversight by our Committee would result in a similar reduction of waste and mismanagement        We look forward to working with you on this important initiative        Sincerely       Joseph I  Lieberman  Ranking Member  Frank R  Lautenberg
