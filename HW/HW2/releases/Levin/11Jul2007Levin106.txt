                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON    A bipartisan group of senators today introduced an   PDF  that would require the president to begin reducing the number of American troops in Iraq within four months and to transition the mission of our remaining military forces there to force protection  training of Iraqi Security Forces  and counterterrorism missions   It would further provide that our troops be out of Iraq by April 30  2008  except for those needed for the specified limited missions       The senators introducing the amendment include Sens  Carl Levin  D MI   Jack Reed  D RI   Gordon Smith  R OR   Chuck Hagel  R NE   John Kerry  D MA   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Joe Biden  D DE   Barack Obama  D IL   and Hillary Clinton  D NY            The open ended occupation of a Muslim country by western countries has played into the hands of Al Qaeda     Sen  Levin said      If there is any hope of forcing the Iraqi political leaders to take responsibility for their own country  it is to have a timetable for the reduction of American forces and the redeployment of those forces to more limited support missions  instead of being everybody s target in the middle of a civil war   Passage of this bipartisan amendment will hopefully prod the Iraqi government to reach a political settlement  which everybody agrees is necessary to end the violence             Today  a bipartisan group of senators are coming together to responsibly change course in Iraq     said Sen  Reed      Our amendment directs the President to undertake a policy that is consistent with the reality in Iraq  consistent with the advice of our commanders in the field  and consistent with keeping our nation safe   Our troops are fighting hard and doing a magnificent job  and we owe them a strategy that is worthy of their sacrifice   I hope a significant number of our colleagues will join us in supporting this measure             We need to be fighting terrorists not civil wars     Sen  Smith said      Iraq   s peace is one they must win on their own  we cannot win it for them   Our might should be focused on stopping terrorists who are plotting to bring harm to the United States              This amendment is about more than redefining the mission for our troops and establishing a timeline for a phased withdrawal of combat troops     said Sen  Hagel      It establishes the creation    of an international mediator under UN auspices who can work toward a political accommodation to break the cycle of violence in Iraq  Greater international involvement which removes the American face from Iraq is the only way to political accommodation             No more talk  no more excuses  it   s time to vote and choose between the Bush escalation and a change of course  This is a test of whether Bush critics will still tow the line or whether they   ll join us to establish a firm deadline to redeploy our troops out of Iraq and force Iraqis to finally stand up for Iraq     Sen  Kerry said     It   s stunning to me that this war costs American taxpayers  10 billion a month  and that even after the ill advised escalation we still have little to show for the brave sacrifices our men and women have made in Iraq  This policy isn   t working  We need to change course  we need to end this war             We have arrived at the crossroads of hope and reality  and we must now address the reality     said Sen  Snowe      We need to send a strong message from the United States Congress on behalf of the American people that the current strategy is unacceptable and that we must move in a different course  As I have stated for months and underscored in the bipartisan legislation I introduced in May  if the Iraqi government failed meet the political benchmarks necessary for success than we would transition to a more tailored mission in Iraq  one that does not limit our ability to counter Al Qaeda operations in the region  and redeploy the remaining forces  We are past non binding resolutions but we are also not abandoning the mission in Iraq  We cannot continue to keep our brave military men and women on the front lines if the Iraqi government is unwilling to put national interests above their own sectarian interests          This amendment is identical to one unveiled by Levin and Reed yesterday  with the addition of language     originally included in an amendment by Sen  Hagel     that provides that the president direct the U S  Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice  vote  and influence of the United States at the U N  to seek the appointment of an international mediator in Iraq to engage political  religious  ethnic  and tribal leaders in Iraq in an inclusive political process
