                                                                                                                                                       Continuing PSI investigation shows 3 800 GSA contractors owing  1 4 billion continue to do business as usual with the government      WASHINGTON    In the third Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing on federal contractors who owe billions in back taxes while continuing to do business as usual with the government  PSI Chairman Senator Norm Coleman  R MN   and ranking member Senator Carl Levin  D MI  today revealed that 3 800 companies that contract with the General Services Administration  GSA  owe back taxes adding up to  1 4 billion  Working in concert with the of the Government Accountability Office  GAO    the Subcommittee   s investigation found that some of this money has been used to  bankroll luxury  cars  multi million dollar properties  and casino gambling sprees         In the most recent findings  GAO has identified 25 egregious GSA contractor cases of outright tax fraud   Examples include the following          One contractor that provides security services for the federal government was paid more than  1 million from the American taxpayers over the past two years  even though he owes more than  12 million in payroll taxes   Over the last few years  as his company failed to turn over payroll taxes it withheld from its employees paychecks  the owner made large cash withdrawals from the company for his personal use   Over  100 000 of that money was spent on gambling           Another contractor who provides public communications services to the federal government was paid  100 000 and owes more than  2 million in payroll taxes   While he kept his employees    payroll taxes  the owner purchased a residential property valued at  1 million  and made numerous cash withdrawals totaling  500 000 at casinos           A third contractor who sells emergency supplies was paid  100 000 by the federal government  while simultaneously owing more than  700 000 in back taxes   The Internal Revenue Service assessed a penalty against the owner for failing to remit payroll taxes and imposed a federal tax lien that was in effect when the contractor received a federal contract   While refusing to pay his employees    payroll taxes  the owner made several real estate purchases  including a million dollar home              We have allowed this problem to fester for far too long and today   s hearing brought us one step closer to rooting out and preventing American taxpayers from being cheated     Coleman said     These are not your everyday tax delinquents  but rather federal contractors who make their livelihood from the federal government  These contractors receive billions of dollars from American taxpayers each year and then do not pay their taxes  instead  they use a great deal of this money for personal use  Today   s hearing further illuminated this problem               Most federal contractors provide valuable goods or services  and do so while paying the taxes they owe   Other contractors stuff taxpayer dollars in their pockets with one hand  while stiffing Uncle Sam with the other     said Levin      Tax dodging by federal contractors is not only unfair to the honest taxpayers left to make up the difference  but also to the honest companies that have to compete against the tax dodgers that aren   t paying what they owe           At today   s hearing  Coleman also identified inherent flaws in the GSA contractor screening system that have allowed contractors with a fraudulent past to go virtually undetected throughout the vetting process  The key application asks potential GSA contractors if they have been indicted for or convicted of tax evasion  but fails to ask about the existence of other tax related indictments or convictions  tax liens or outstanding tax debt            Currently  we have a system in place that is too narrow to actually weed out tax delinquent contractors     Coleman added     The simple fact is that not all tax fraud results in a conviction for tax evasion  GSA needs to expand the tax related questions on the Representations and Certifications Application to ensure that contractors and applicants are required to identify all tax related violations  We   re dealing with too much money to be making such decisions without knowing if federal contractors are complying with the tax laws              As a result of the Subcommittee   s oversight efforts  levies against federal contractors have increased by 600   from  7 million in fiscal year 2003 to  42 million in fiscal year 2005  Similarly  levy collections from DOD contractors have risen by nearly 3 000  from  686 888 to  20 4 million        In response to the Subcommittee   s February 12  2004  hearing  the IRS and other federal agencies established the Federal Contractor Tax Compliance Tax Force  Based on the Task Force   s recommendations  contractors    TINs  taxpayer identification numbers  are being verified by the IRS   For the first time  no federal contractor can get a federal contract without a verified TIN  which will positively affect levy collection   Also  a recent survey by FMS shows that there is now a 99 percent compliance rate by federal agencies with the TIN requirement   FMS is working on other types of payments to ensure that they are subject to the levy program        Chairman Coleman and Senator Levin recommended that federal contractors    compliance with tax laws be determined before they are given federal contracts
