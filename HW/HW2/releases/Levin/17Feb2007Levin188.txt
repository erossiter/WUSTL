                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D    Mich   spoke today on the Senate floor regarding the cloture vote on the Sense of Congress resolution disapproving of the President   s    surge    in Iraq   Below are his remarks as prepared for delivery                 Mr  President  we have been bogged down in Iraq for nearly four years  which is longer than the Korean Conflict or our involvement in World War II   The war has cost more than 3 100 American lives  seven times that many wounded  and about  400 billion                    We desperately need to change course   Shifting responsibility to the Iraqi political leaders to reach a political settlement is the only hope of ending the violence   That   s why the Iraq Study Group urged less U S  military involvement when they concluded     An open ended commitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take the political actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian violence   In the absence of such an incentive  the Iraqi government might continue to delay taking those difficult actions                       But instead of putting pressure on Iraqi leaders to settle their political differences as the only hope of a successful outcome in Iraq  the President would get us in deeper militarily   The Iraqis didn   t ask for more U S  troops to occupy their neighborhoods in Baghdad   Indeed they suggested we move out of Baghdad   The idea for this so called surge of troops in Baghdad was ours                      It may be called a surge  but I believe it   s a plunge     a plunge right into a sectarian cauldron   A plunge into the unknown and perhaps the unknowable                      Supporters of the surge argue that a Senate resolution disagreeing with the President   s plan    emboldens    the enemy   But that   s an extraordinarily na  ve view of the    enemy      What emboldens the sectarian fighters is the inability of the Iraqi leaders to make political compromises so essential to finally reining in the Sunni insurgents and Shia militias                      The enemy cares little what Congress says   it is emboldened by what the Iraqi leaders don   t do   The enemy isn   t emboldened by Congressional debate   it is emboldened by an open ended occupation of a Muslim country by western troops                      The enemy is emboldened by the current course  which has seen over 1 million Iraqis leave the country and become refugees  with thousands more leaving daily                    The enemy is emboldened by years of blunders and bravado  false assumptions and wishful thinking  and ignorance of the history of the land being occupied                      The enemy is emboldened by an Administration which says it is changing course  which acknowledges that a political settlement by Iraqi leaders is essential to ending the violence   but then plunges us more deeply militarily into a sectarian witch   s brew                     The only hope of ending the violence and succeeding against the enemies of an Iraqi nation is if the leaders of that nation work out their political differences and unite against forces that would destroy any chance of nationhood   That takes political will  and that takes pressure from us   Sending more U S  troops takes the pressure off   It sends the false message that we can save the Iraqis from themselves                    Sending more troops does what our Centcom Commander John Abizaid warned about when he said     It s easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work  I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future                       Does speaking out against a surge undermine our troops   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Peter Pace firmly answered that argument just last week when he said     There   s no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in Washington strengthens our democracy     period    From the standpoint of our troops  I believe that they understand how our legislature works and that they understand that there   s going to be this kind of debate                       And last week  Secretary Gates answered the charge that our debate hurts troop morale with these compelling words     I think that our troops do understand that everybody involved in this debate is looking to do the right thing for our country and for our troops  and that everybody is looking for the best way to avoid an outcome that leaves Iraq in chaos   And I think they   re sophisticated enough to understand that that   s what the debate   s really about   I think they understand that that debate   s being carried on by patriotic people who care about them and who care about their mission                       We owe our troops everything  equipment and training  adequate rest  support of them and their families   We also owe them our honest assessments   A majority of the American people feel that a deeper military involvement won   t make success in Iraq more likely   I believe a majority of Senators feel the same way   I hope the majority will be allowed to so vote                    If we believe plunging into Baghdad neighborhoods with more American troops will not increase chances of success  we are duty bound to say so  and a minority of Senators should not thwart that expression   We owe that to the troops   We owe that to their families   And we owe that to the American people
