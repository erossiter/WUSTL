                                                                                                                                                                Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for scheduling this important hearing   I join you in welcoming our witnesses this morning        Last week the American people delivered a clear   indeed a dramatic   message to the Administration  to the Congress  and to the Iraqi Government that    Stay the Course    is not a strategy for success in Iraq   It was a message heard around the world       The American people don   t accept the President   s recent assessment that    absolutely we   re winning    in Iraq   Nor should we         The American people have said forcefully that they are impatient with Iraqi leaders who will not make the political compromises required to blunt the sectarian violence and unite the Iraqi people   They are impatient with Iraqi government leaders who have not disbanded the militias and death squads that are a plague on Iraqi society   And they have lost patience with the Iraqi leaders who won   t condemn Sunni Shia enmity  tribal rivalries  and ethnic hatred         America has given the Iraqi people the opportunity to build a new nation at the cost of nearly 3 000 American lives and over twenty thousand wounded   But the American people do not want our valiant troops to get caught in a crossfire between Iraqis if they insist on squandering that opportunity through civil war and sectarian strife         We were assured by the President over a year ago that    as the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down      Even though the Pentagon claims that almost 90 percent of the Iraqi Security Forces are now trained and equipped  our troop level remains about the same   We were momentarily hopeful when the Iraqi leaders signed a four point agreement on October 2nd to end the sectarian violence   That turned out to be another false hope          Recently  Ambassador Khalilzad announced that Iraqi officials had agreed to a timeline for reaching benchmarks to confront the sectarian militias  to implement a reconciliation program  to share oil revenues  and to recommend changes to the constitution   Prime Minister Maliki repudiated that timeline the next day  providing additional evidence that the Iraqi political leaders do not understand that there is a limit to the blood and treasure that Americans are willing to spend given the unwillingness of the Iraqis themselves to put their political house in order        Our uniformed military leaders have repeatedly told us that there is no military solution to the violence in Iraq  and that a political agreement between the Iraqis sectarian factions themselves is the only way to end the violence   Just last month  at his October 25th press conference  President Bush said that    In the end  the Iraqi people and their government will have to make the difficult decisions necessary to solve these problems      In the end   We are 3 and one half years into a conflict which has already lasted longer than the Korean Conflict and almost as long as World War II   We should put the responsibility for Iraq   s future squarely where it belongs      on the Iraqis   We cannot save the Iraqis from themselves          The only way for Iraqi leaders to squarely face that reality is for President Bush to tell them that the United States will begin a phased redeployment of our forces within four to six months   That is not precipitous    It is a responsible way to change the dynamic in Iraq  to stop the march down the path to full blown civil war on which the Iraqis are now embarked   Yes  some U S  troops would need to remain in Iraq for the limited missions of counter terrorism and training of Iraqi Security Forces  and to provide logistical support and force protection   And yes  we should also convene an international conference to support a political settlement and to provide resources for Iraq   s reconstruction         We are grateful to our witnesses for their service to our Nation and we are especially grateful and united in support of the brave troops who are serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere   We look forward to the witnesses    best professional judgment on the issues we will be grappling with in the weeks and months to come
