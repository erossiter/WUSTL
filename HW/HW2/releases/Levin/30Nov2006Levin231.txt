Mich   gave the keynote address today at a policy forum on credit card markets  Exploring Issues in and Policy Solutions for Credit Card Markets  sponsored by the Center for American Progress         Levin   s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow   His remarks as delivered varied from the text below      Remarks of Senator Carl Levin Exploring Issues in and Policy Solutions for Credit Card Markets  Center for American Progress Forum   Thank you  Winnie  Stachelberg   for that kind introduction       I want to thank the Center for American Progress and Derek Douglas for holding this event and gathering together some of the leaders who have spent many years fighting credit card abuses       America   s working families and the middle class owe you a debt of gratitude  and I   m honored to make a payment on their behalf by saying     Thank you for your hard work  your dedication  and your persistence in protecting consumers       You know  the columnist Ann Landers once remarked     If you think no one cares whether you   re alive or dead  try missing a couple of car payments          With credit cards  however  you can make all your payments on time and still find yourself in the crosshairs of a powerful industry that is thriving in part on unfair and confusing practices   And  if you   re late even once     prepare to be doubly gouged       The issue of credit card practices directly impacts the financial stability of the middle class   Millions of Americans use their credit cards every day to purchase essentials like groceries and gas   As Winnie mentioned  Americans last year used nearly 700 million credit cards to purchase more than  1 8 trillion in goods and services       And the offers for new credit cards keep rolling in   Americans are bombarded by more than 3 billion credit card solicitations in the mail each year   My wife says she gets about one third of them   As a member of my staff put it     I wouldn   t even give my own kids credit  but plenty of banks will       Not surprisingly  this increased use of credit cards has helped put many families in debt  The Federal Reserve estimates that the average American household owed about  5 100 in credit card debt in 2004   And because of the bankruptcy bill that the credit card companies fought so hard for last year  that debt is now even harder to discharge       One of the most frequent complaints I hear from constituents is that they are having a hard time climbing out of credit card debt because they are being socked by outrageous fees and practices or didn   t realize or couldn   t figure out the terms of their credit card agreement       In 2005  I asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the billing practices of credit card companies  Released in October  the GAO report is the first federal study to compile in one place a description of the recent fees  interest rates  and disclosure practices of 28 popular credit cards from the six largest credit card issuers         It shows all the ways that credit card issuers are charging consumers  information which is very hard to obtain and which is so complicated that we all need a scorecard to keep track       The GAO found that credit card companies are making more and more of their money off of climbing fees  complex interest charges and poor disclosure practices that take advantage of working families         Let me run through a few of the practices that I find most egregious       First is the practice of charging interest on debt that has already been repaid   Some call this    double cycle    billing     a confusing name for a practice that ought to be called    you   re kidding me      It is simply unfair and may be the only example of financial institutions charging interest on debt that   s already been repaid  A third of the credit card issuers studied by the GAO currently use this practice         As an example  imagine a cardholder who begins a billing cycle with a zero balance  charges  500 on his or her credit card and makes an on time payment of  490  In the next billing cycle  he or she would be charged interest on the full  500  rather than on only the  10 that is still owed   That is a dishonest way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of the pockets of a responsible consumer       In 2001  I introduced a bill to ban this practice  and Senator Dodd has included the ban in his comprehensive bill to stop credit card abuses       Second  the GAO identified some fees that I believe are plain unfair   For instance  some card issuers charge a fee of  5 to  15 to make an on time payment by telephone  even with an automated telephone system   We   ve also heard that some card issuers have started charging a fee for folks to pay their bill on time on the internet         I believe the reason the credit card companies are charging these fees is to encourage people to mail in their payments  which most people do in advance of the due date to ensure it arrives on time   By getting payments earlier  a company can earn interest on that money   Charging families a fee to pay their bill on time is outrageous  however  and there ought to be a law against it       Another disturbing practice is when a borrower has debt at two different interest rates     for example  one rate for purchases and one rate for a cash advance     and the credit card company forces the consumer to pay off the debt at the lower interest rate before they are allowed to pay off the debt at the higher rate   Consumers ought to be able to pay off the higher interest rate debt first  not last       Fourth  the report found that penalty interest rates and fees are higher now than they ever have been   In 1995  the average fee for a late payment or for going over a credit limit was  13   By 2005  those fees had more than doubled to an average of  34 for a late payment and  31 for going over a credit limit   Some late fees are now nearing  40 per month   In addition  interest rates for those who pay late or exceed their credit limit can reach over 30 percent        These hefty penalties are taking a real bite out of family budgets and hindering good faith efforts to pay off debt        The report also relayed complaints from cardholders who were pushed over their credit limits after being hit by late fees and were then hit with additional penalties for being over their credit limits   Fee piled upon fee piled upon penalty       The final practice I   ll mention is that the GAO found that the way account information is currently provided to consumers is ineffective  Current fee disclosures are difficult to understand and poorly organized  with much of the important information buried deep in the fine print  and it is often unclear when or under what circumstances late fees or penalty interest will be charged          During debate on the bankruptcy bill last year  Senator Akaka offered an amendment that would have strengthened disclosure rules by requiring that credit card holders be given clear information about the consequences of making only the minimum required payment   But this and dozens of other pro consumer amendments were rejected by the Senate       The Federal Reserve is now conducting its first major review of credit card disclosure rules in Regulation Z since 1980  and the GAO report provides important data to support that effort to simplify and clarify credit card disclosures   My staff has already met with the Federal Reserve about the GAO report and has urged them to make full use of its data       The bottom line is that many credit card companies are using hidden fees  penalty interest charges  and unfair practices to squeeze money out of working families   American families simply cannot afford to hire a lawyer to decipher their credit card statements or fight for fair treatment  and they shouldn   t have to        If credit card companies do not promptly take the initiative to clean up their industry  Congress and the regulators     including the Federal Reserve  the Federal Trade Commission  and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency     must take action         Next year holds great promise for making progress in the battle against credit card abuses   My friend Senator Chris Dodd  who is a longtime leader in this area  will be the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and will have the opportunity to push the legislation he has been championing on this issue         I hope to support these efforts by building a legislative record at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations showing the need for reform  not only from the work in the GAO report but from hearings I plan to hold next year   I   m also planning to introduce legislation to correct some of the abuses identified in the GAO report       We know  however  that changing the current system won   t be easy   The credit card industry demonstrated last year during the debate on the bankruptcy bill just how powerful it has become   That bill was a ripe opportunity to address some of the abusive credit card practices I ve highlighted today    But  as any consumer advocate will tell you  the bankruptcy bill missed that opportunity by a country mile and made many things far worse       This is going to be a tough fight  but thank goodness we have the strong leadership of the Center for American Progress on our side   CAP has already made a big difference in your short history   The intellectual spadework being done here is helping give progressives a robust agenda and a clear voice       The Center for American Progress is the antidote to the powerful interests that seek special influence with our government   And I want to thank you in particular for item number 11 on your list of policy priorities for the new Congress        Level the playing field between credit card companies and consumers      That   s exactly what we need to do  and  with your help  we will
