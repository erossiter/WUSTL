                                                                                                                                                                    Thank you to the Brookings Institution for hosting this seminar on U S  National Security Policy Issues and for always putting wise policies and the greater good ahead of any political party   For the past 90 years  Brookings has provided a forum for discussing how to make America fairer  stronger  and safer  and this forum continues in that tradition        You may have already heard my ideas about Iraq  and I just want to assure you that I take no joy in repeating myself   So  let me pledge to you today     as the President stands up and faces reality in Iraq  I will stand down        Clearly  Iraq is the overriding national security issue today   We have been bogged down in this war for more than three and a half years  which is longer than the Korean Conflict or our involvement in World War II   The war has cost nearly 3 000 American lives  seven times that many wounded  and around  330 billion        And yet for a war that is costing us dearly in blood and treasure  the mantra from the Bush Administration has only been the bumper sticker slogan     stay the course     The President even made the incredible claim a few weeks ago that    absolutely we   re winning    in Iraq   As the President   s own choice for Secretary of Defense has acknowledged  however  we are not winning in Iraq  and we need to change course if we have hope of stabilizing that country   Even Secretary Rumsfeld has said    It is time for a major adjustment           Three things have happened recently to change the dynamic here at home on the need to change the dynamic in Iraq   First  the elections in November were a major blow to the President   s stay the course policy   The American people rose up against staying the course in Iraq  because that course is not working         The testimony of the new Secretary of Defense  Dr  Gates  was a second significant blow to the President   s policy   With compelling directness  Dr  Gates made clear he believes we need to change course   He was so direct that two    stay the course Republicans    voted against confirmation  with one of them saying that     Mr  Gates has repeatedly criticized our efforts in Iraq           And the release last week of the Iraq Study Group Report was an additional blow to    stay the course             Before proposing to you the way of changing course that I believe holds out the only hope of succeeding  let me give you the premise on which it is based  the violence will end only if the Iraqis resolve their political differences        I actually believe that a consensus exists about the validity of that fundamental point  only a political solution among the Iraqi leaders themselves can salvage that country   Such a political settlement is the rock  the foundation  upon which a new strategy must be built        General Peter Chiarelli  Commanding General of the Multi National Corps in Iraq stated last week      We need a commitment by all Iraqis of all of the ethno sectarian groups to commit first to nonviolence and to resolving their differences through the political process    This situation cannot be resolved by military forces alone       He continued     I happen to believe that we have done everything militarily we possibly can           At his confirmation hearing  I asked Dr  Gates      Do you believe that the end to violence in Iraq requires a political settlement and that we need to communicate a sense of urgency to the Iraqis to pressure them to reach a settlement that only their politicians can reach      And Dr  Gates replied     Yes  sir  I do           The Iraq Study Group Report stated that the violence in Iraq cannot be stopped or even contained    if there is no underlying political agreement among Iraqis about the future of their country           Last month  I asked the Director of Central Intelligence  General Hayden     Is a political settlement by the Iraqis essential  in your judgment  if failure is to be avoided in Iraq     And General Hayden replied     Absolutely  I believe that  in fact  the parties have to be brought together and it has to be a political approach  And the government of Iraq has to be in the lead in doing that           And most telling perhaps was Iraq Prime Minister Maliki   s acknowledgement of this essential point a few weeks ago when he stated     The crisis is political  and the ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the politicians           All of the other debates     about troop levels  embedding more advisors  training of Iraqi forces  and other issues     are secondary   For instance  although the question of whether to embed U S  troops with Iraqi units is a serious issue  it doesn   t get to the heart of the issue because that is a military question        Likewise  the question is not how many trained and capable battalions there are in the Iraqi army   The question is whether that army is loyal to a sectarian cause or to the whole country   That   s a problem requiring a political resolution        If a political settlement among the Iraqis is the right goal  how do we get there   How do we persuade  pressure  cajole  or inspire the Iraqi leaders to come to a political solution   How do we get them to make the compromises that only they can make        I believe the only way to stop the Iraqi leaders    fiddling while Baghdad burns is to tell them that our presence in Iraq is not open ended    We need to deliver a cold dose of reality to the Iraqi leaders and tell them that we are not going to be their security blanket without end and that we will begin a phased redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq within four to six months          Nothing will get the attention of the Iraqi leaders like the prospect of some American troops leaving Iraq   When they finally understand that our military presence in Iraq is neither permanent nor unconditional  they are far more likely to take the political steps necessary to deal with sectarian violence and to defeat the insurgency         It will not be easy   It will require concession and compromise on all sides  The militias must be disarmed to avoid all out civil war  political power and oil revenues must be equitably distributed among regions and peoples so Iraqis believe they have a stake in the Iraq nation   No  it won   t be easy  but a fair political settlement in Iraq is the only hope        The Iraq Study Group specifically drew the connection between the importance of ending the open ended commitment of American troops and persuading the Iraqis to make political compromises   Their report said the following     An open ended commitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take the political actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian violence   In the absence of such an incentive  the Iraqi government might continue to delay taking those difficult actions           But whether or not most agree that that form of pressure is needed  at least I can confidently say that in one area there is a near consensus  that we need to change course in Iraq by pressing for a political settlement   That consensus needs to grow by one more person     President Bush  who has an opportunity later this week to show a willingness to at least take one important step in a new direction        Up to now  the President   s policy has been the epitome of an open ended commitment    For example  the President said a few weeks ago that    we are going to stay in Iraq as long as the Iraqis ask us to be there      That open ended commitment gives the dangerous impression to the Iraqis that their future is in our hands  instead of theirs   It removes the pressure from the Iraqis to take responsibility for their security   It suggests we can save them from themselves        That was not the first time the President has made an open ended commitment to the Iraqis   It   s been a constant refrain   For instance  after Iraq   s President Talabani met with President Bush in September  he said that President Bush had assured him that the U S  troops    will remain  in Iraq  until we ask them to leave           The President   s position contains the same flaw that General Abizaid has pointed to when explaining why it would be unwise to increase the number of U S  troops   General Abizaid stated      We want the Iraqis to do more   It   s easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us    More American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more  from taking more responsibility for their own future           Last week  I met with President Bush  and I urged him directly to end the open ended commitment of American troops to Iraq  which his statement makes   He responded that my point was    well taken             This weekend  there is a national reconciliation conference taking place in Baghdad   The Iraqi participants at that meeting know the results of our election in November  they heard Dr  Gates    testimony at his confirmation hearing  and they have likely read the report of the Iraq Study Group   But they also know that the voice that matters most is the President   s   They know that pressure is building in America  but that the President continues to provide them with soothing assurances that    we   re there until the Iraqis ask us to leave           This week  the President needs to send a new message to the Iraqis in advance of their conference and make that    well taken    point  the U S  commitment to Iraq is not open ended and not unconditional   If he does  it could be the beginning of a critical course correction that is long overdue
