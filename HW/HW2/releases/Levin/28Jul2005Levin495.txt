                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate is expected to approve and send to the president a  286 4 billion multi year transportation funding bill that will provide more than  1 123 billion annually to fund transportation projects in Michigan  and create 61 500 new jobs across the state  U S  Senators Carl Levin  D MI  and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  said today        The legislation is an extension of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  or TEA 21  which was enacted in 1998  It authorizes surface transportation projects such as highways and highway safety projects through fiscal year 2009   In final negotiations on the legislation this week  Levin and Stabenow won an additional  100 million for Michigan highway work termed Projects of National and Regional Significance          This bill recognizes that the Detroit Riverfront is one of Michigan   s finest assets and moves forward with the revitalization initiative that is recapturing the riverfront for the people of Detroit     said Levin     The funding in this bill will provide funds intended to acquire land for a major walkway and greenway along the Detroit River west of Cobo Hall which would also spur adjacent economic development including housing  retail and public recreation facilities  In addition to riverfront revitalization  this bill includes Michigan initiatives such as Ann Arbor to Detroit transit projects  the Pinnacle Aeropark Access Project  and many others that will increase mobility  reduce traffic congestion  and improve air quality in our state             This transportation bill will create good paying jobs in Michigan  provide funds that are desperately needed for Michigan roads  and provide essential assistance to Michigan   s public transportation     Stabenow said     This bill is vitally important in Southeast Michigan  where it will allow major projects like the Detroit Ann Arbor rail project and I 696 freeway ramp in Southfield to move forward           Michigan would receive more than  594 8 million in transit formula funding  an increase of  167 million  or 39 percent  over TEA 21      In addition to the  594 8 million  as a member of the Senate Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs Committee  I was able to include an additional  164 4 million for bus and rail projects in Michigan     Stabenow said       The bill also allows funds to be used by the State of Michigan for the operation and maintenance of intelligent transportation systems to reduce congestion  The continued use of these systems is critical for Michigan to achieve its air quality goals  as reduced congestion results in lower automobile emissions   Allowing the continued use of these funds to operate ITS systems thus will help the state meet EPA s new ozone standards        The bill will provide funding for the following Southeast Michigan projects        Ann Arbor      1 5 million     University of Michigan Health Systems auto crash notification system     Auburn Hills      4 million     Widen and reconstruct Walton Boulevard
