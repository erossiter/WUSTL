                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON     A bipartisan group of lawmakers today urged the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to change the formula used to distribute beach monitoring funds to coastal states under the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health  BEACH  Act in accordance with a new study by the Government Accountability Office  GAO    The GAO is the watchdog arm of the United States Congress        In 2000  Congress approved the BEACH Act to improve states    beach monitoring programs and processes for notifying the public of potential health risks from contamination at beaches   In the seven years since then  EPA has distributed approximately  51 million in BEACH Act grants to help states and localities develop beach monitoring and public notification programs for their recreational beaches         Last year  a bipartisan group of 7 U S  Senators and 12 members of the House of Representatives called on the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the BEACH Act and make recommendations for improving the program   GAO   s report found that    EPA   s BEACH Act grant formula does not adequately reflect states    monitoring needs      Specifically  the report underscores that EPA   s funding formula includes three factors  length of beach season  beach use  and beach miles   The report states that EPA officials intended that the three factors receive relatively equal weight  however  in practice  approximately 82 percent of the BEACH Act grants have been distributed on the basis of the length of the beach season         GAO noted that the current formula allocations have resulted in states with comparatively little shoreline receiving nearly the same amount of BEACH funding as states with much longer shorelines      For example  Indiana  which has 45 miles of shoreline and a coastal population of 741 468  received about  205 800 in 2006  while Michigan  which has 3 224 miles of shoreline and a coastal population of 4 842 023  receive about  278 450 in 2006      If EPA reweighted the formula  GAO estimates that Michigan   s share would rise by nearly  117 000         Commenting on the GAO report  Rep  Levin said     The EPA formula for distributing BEACH funds is badly broken to the detriment of states like Michigan with long coastlines   Two thing need to happen here   EPA needs to revise the formula  and Congress needs to provide more federal resources to help states monitor water quality at our beaches              Michigan has thousands of miles of shoreline with hundreds of public beaches and millions of people who live along the coast     Sen  Levin said      Protecting those who visit our beaches and swim in our waters is critical  and by fairly apportioning BEACH program funds  Michigan will be better able to monitor its beaches          Responding to GAO   s findings  a group of Senators and Representatives wrote to EPA Administer Stephen Johnson and urged EPA to reconsider how the federal government distributes BEACH Act funds to states   Among those signing the letter were Michigan Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow  and Congressmen Sander Levin and John Dingell        The text of the letter follows         The Honorable Stephen Johnson  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave   N W   Washington  DC 20460   Dear Administrator Johnson       We are writing to follow up on concerns raised by a recently released Government Accountability Office  GAO  report titled    GREAT LAKES  EPA and States Have Made Progress in Implementing the BEACH Act  but Additional Actions Could Improve Public Health Protection       While we appreciate the ability of the EPA to stretch funding  we encourage you to reconsider how your agency distributes BEACH Act grant funds to states       Contaminated water along Great Lakes beaches continues to be a human health threat to swimmers and others that come in contact with the water   Water borne illnesses have been reported in several states  some with serious consequences   The Natural Resources Defense Council reported that in 2005 beaches in the Great Lakes had at least 2 740 days of health advisories or beach closures  Considering that beaches in the Great Lakes are only open on a seasonal basis  the information about advisories and closures is concerning       In the GAO   s report  the GAO found that EPA   s formula to distribute grants    does not accurately reflect the monitoring needs of the states      The BEACH Act requires EPA to consider three factors in the formula for distributing grant funds   length of beach season  beach miles  and beach use   In practice  EPA places considerably more weight on the beach season factor than the other factors   Because of that emphasis  states that have seasonal beaches but differing coastlines and coastal populations will receive about the same amount of grant funding   Therefore  we strongly encourage you to reconsider the formula used to distribute BEACH Act grants to states       We appreciate your support for improving the Great Lakes and look forward to working with you on this issue           John D  Dingell  D MI   Brian Higgins  D NY   Dale Kildee  D MI   Mark Kirk  R
