                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON     U S  Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   and George Voinovich  R Ohio   the co chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force  today introduced a bipartisan Great Lakes restoration bill that would help to reduce the threat of invasive species in the lakes  restore fish and wildlife  clean up contaminated sediments  and coordinate water quality management in the Great Lakes basin  Senators Chuck Schumer  D N Y    Debbie Stabenow  D Mich    Norm Coleman  R Minn    and Hillary Clinton  D N Y   are cosponsors of the bill       Recognizing the need for a cohesive restoration plan in the Great Lakes  numerous groups     more than 1 500 people     joined forces in 2005 to form the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration   The collaboration worked to compile recommendations on how to best restore the Great Lakes ecosystem  and their recommendations were released in December 2005    The purpose of the bill being introduced today is to implement the recommendations made by the collaboration       Senator Levin     For a long time  one of the challenges of Great Lakes restoration was the lack of a cohesive strategy  but the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration united the divergent voices and laid out a way forward     Levin said      Now our responsibility is to implement their blueprint to ensure that our magnificent Great Lakes remain a treasure for generations to come          Senator Voinovich   This pivotal legislation sends a clear message to the country that we are committed to restoring the Great Lakes and protecting them from further deterioration   Sen  Voinovich said   It is vital that Americans understand this is not a regional problem     the deterioration of the Great Lakes affects the country as a whole  I am pleased that we finally have a coordinated and unified strategy that is absolutely necessary to saving one of our nation   s greatest natural resources  I will work with my colleagues to ensure this vital plan is implemented        Senator Schumer     The Great Lakes are threatened by invasive species and contaminated sediments that threaten to spoil these unique national treasures     said Schumer      You may need a microscope to find them  but their impact is enormous   I will push forward on all fronts to rid the lakes of these serious threats so that the lakes can remain a cornerstone of New York   s economy and future generations are able to enjoy their beauty          Senator Stabenow   The Great Lakes not only serve as a symbol of Michigan  but also as an economic engine for the region and a national treasure that must be protected  preserved and restored   said Stabenow    I was proud to author the first ever ban on drilling for oil and gas in the Great Lakes  and will continue to work with the rest of the Michigan delegation to preserve the Great Lakes as a vital natural resource and job creator for generations to come        Senator Coleman     Minnesota   s lakes  rivers and fishing are among the state   s greatest treasures     said Senator Coleman     We need to take action now to ensure that these natural resources will continue to be enjoyed by future generations  This legislation makes great strides toward this aim by implementing many of the policy recommendations by the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration  From containing invasive species to authorizing assistance to rebuild our coastal areas  the bill will benefit our lakes     both Great and small     for generations to come           Senator Clinton      The Great Lakes are a treasure for New York  the nation and the world  but they need our help     said Senator Clinton     Leaders from throughout the Great Lakes basin have developed a plan for protecting and restoring the Great Lakes and it   s time to put that plan into action           The Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act of 2007 notes that deterioration of the Great Lakes ecosystem is accelerating  and it lays out restoration plans for the Great Lakes basin    Some of the specific provisions of the bill include the following           The bill would reduce the threat of new invasive species by enacting comprehensive invasive species legislation and put ballast technology on board ships   It specifically targets Asian carp by authorizing the operation and maintenance of the dispersal barrier   It also stops NOBOBS     No Ballast on Board ships     from entering the lakes without flushing their tanks           The bill provides additional resources to states and cities for their water infrastructure that will help protect wildlife habitat            The bill would provide additional funding for contaminated sediment cleanup and would give the EPA additional tools under the Great Lakes Legacy Act to move projects along faster             The bill would create a new grant program to phase out mercury in products and identify emerging contaminants             It would authorize additional research through existing federal programs as well as our non federal research institutions  and it would authorize coordination of federal programs        Reps  Vern Ehlers  R Mich   and Rahm Emanuel  D Ill   have introduced a companion measure in the House of Representatives
