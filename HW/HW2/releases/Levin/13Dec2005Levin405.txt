Message to U S  Negotiators on Auto related Issues at WTO

Congressional Delegation sent a letter to the United States Trade Representative  USTR   Ambassador Rob Portman  on the eve of the upcoming World Trade Organization  WTO  Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong regarding Non Tariff Barriers  NTBs  in the automobile sector within the context of the Non Agricultural Market Access  NAMA  negotiations  As a strong automotive industry is vital to the U S  economy overall and a critical part of the U S  manufacturing sector  the Delegation believes it is critical that the U S  take a position during the Hong Kong Ministerial meeting that will further advance this important issue and achieve an outcome that is beneficial to the U S  automotive sector   This letter was discussed at the recent bipartisan meeting with Governor Granholm and was circulated by Reps  Sander Levin and Dave Camp  both Members of the Ways and Means Committee          Nontariff barriers pose a far greater impediment than do tariffs to U S  auto companies trying to sell their cars and parts in overseas markets   said U S  Rep  Sander Levin  D Royal Oak     I fought four years ago at the Cancun WTO meeting to make sure that NTBs were on par with tariff reductions in the text for these negotiations  now we want to ensure that parity is implemented in the negotiations in a manner that achieves results for the auto sector            A tariff by any other name is still a tariff   said U S  Rep  Dave Camp  R Midland     Foreign countries have successfully thrown up barriers and kept their markets virtually off limits to American manufacturers   It is time to break down those barriers and level the playing field for our workers   A series of victories on non tariff barriers at the WTO greatly increases the chances for recovery within our domestic auto industry         The letter also highlights the emerging trend that is likely to further substantial opening of the U S  auto market to imports  with little change in access for U S  auto and auto parts with major competitors like Japan and Korea whose respective markets remain virtually closed to U S  products  The Delegation noted a number of concerns with USTR s Draft Proposal on Negotiating NTBs  one of which is the proposal s lack of an explicit call for a single package of commitments in this area  Another concern is the failure to propose or push for parties to specifically link progress on NTBs to tariff rate reduction           The U S  market has seen increases in imports of autos and auto parts without our trade partners making any moves to break down the barriers keeping U S  products out of their markets   U S  Senator Carl Levin said    This inequality greatly hurts our auto and auto parts manufacturers  at a time when our country already is suffering due to great losses in manufacturing jobs   We must insist on taking steps toward a level playing field          Unfair trade barriers like currency manipulation are hurting our auto manufacturers and costing Michigan jobs   U S  Senator Debbie Stabenow  D MI  said today   We need Ambassador Portman to take a strong stand for our manufacturers and demand that these countries play by the rules         Experience has demonstrated that the benefits of tariff reduction should be linked to progress on eliminating NTBs   Trade in the automobile sector is restricted globally by a variety of NTBs including engine displacement taxes and import licensing requirements   A significant NTB to the automotive industry is currency manipulation   Asia s policy of  mercantilist  exchange rate management  particularly the massive intervention by Japan stretching back a decade  has acted as a subsidy to its exports and a barrier to U S  auto manufacturers efforts to compete fairly            The Delegation continues by writing   If NTBs are truly an  integral  and  equally important  part of the NAMA negotiations  any agreement on a tariff rate reduction formula should take into account the impact on automobile or auto parts tariffs  and how such reductions may  in turn  shape or influence NTB negotiations   NTBs should be considered in tandem with  and not after  tariff reduction formula negotiations have concluded          See below for the text of the Delegation letter  PDF also attached          December 12  2005         The Honorable Robert J  Portman      United States Trade Representative      Office of the U S  Trade Representative      600 17th Street  NW      Washington  DC  20508       Dear Mr  Ambassador        In advance of the upcoming WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong  we write to urge invigorated efforts as to the objectives and desired outcome of the United States regarding Non Tariff Barriers  NTBs  in the automobile sector within the context of the Non Agricultural Market Access  NAMA  negotiations  In particular  we are writing to express to you the need for the Doha Round to result in a clear  positive outcome for the U S  automotive sector and the need for a defined  measurable beneficial result         A strong automotive industry is vital to the U S  economy overall and a critical part of the U S  manufacturing sector   The forthcoming WTO negotiations provide an opportunity for the U S  to take meaningful and concrete action to benefit this critical sector in the global marketplace   Specifically  the NAMA negotiations present an important opportunity to seek a more level global playing field for U S  auto and auto parts companies by increasing access to foreign markets for U S  exports of these products          As you are well aware  NTBs pose a far greater impediment to market access than tariffs for the automotive industry   On previous occasions  we have noted with approval USTR s pursuit of a vertical NTB initiative in the automobile sector   We are pleased that USTR has taken steps to mobilize this initiative through a series of informal meetings to identify NTBs and discuss potential solutions   We are also encouraged by language in Chairman Johannesson s progress report of the NAMA negotiation  which not only re affirms  but also expands upon the principle that NTBs are an  integral  and  equally important  part of the NAMA negotiations   While we acknowledge that progress has been made in underscoring the importance of this issue  we continue to have a number of concerns regarding the direction in which the current negotiations are headed and their possible outcome          Based on the Doha progress to date  we see emerging a disturbing trend that is likely to further substantial opening of the U S  auto market to imports  with little change in access for U S  auto and auto parts with our major competitors like Japan and Korea whose respective markets remain virtually closed to our products   Further exacerbating this trend is Asia s policy of  mercantilist  exchange rate management  particularly the massive intervention by Japan stretching back a decade that has acted as a subsidy to its exports and a barrier to U S  auto manufacturers efforts to compete fairly   The U S  automotive industry views this as the most significant NTB and has sought to have this issue addressed within the WTO negotiations   We are very disappointed that the Administration has declined to raise currency manipulation within this multilateral context    Failure to act on this issue will result in further job cuts  further plant closures  and a continuing erosion of the U S  automotive and broader national manufacturing base          As to the NTBs that the Administration has agreed to pursue  we have previously noted a number of concerns with USTR s Draft Proposal on Negotiating NTBs  one of which was the proposal s lack of an explicit call for a single package of commitments in this area   This issue continues to be a major concern   While much of USTR s focus to date has been on party consensus building and identification of NTBS   both of which are important and necessary to advancing this issue   there has been no indication that USTR has included  or is willing to include as part of its strategy  the pursuit of a package of NTB commitments in the automotive sector          Another concern is USTR s failure to propose or push for parties to specifically link progress on NTBs to tariff rate reduction   Trade in the automobile sector is restricted globally by a variety of NTBs   Experience has demonstrated that the benefits of tariff reduction should be linked to progress on NTBs   This is especially true  as in the case of Japan  where tariffs on autos and auto parts either are low or duty free   Within the context of the NAMA negotiations and the broader Doha Round overall  NTBs appear to be a  back burner  issue to which parties will turn only after ironing out differences in tariff rate reduction formulas   We believe that such a strategy is short sighted and could potentially compromise the U S  negotiation position on NTBs         If NTBs are truly an  integral  and  equally important  part of the NAMA negotiations  any agreement on a tariff rate reduction formula should take into account the impact on automobile or auto parts tariffs  and how such reductions may  in turn  shape or influence NTB negotiations   NTBs should be considered in tandem with  and not after  tariff reduction formula negotiations have concluded   Specifically  USTR should seek flexible formulas and provide assurance that tariff reduction concessions will be balanced against a meaningful NTB package  which guarantees that U S  automotive companies will have access to foreign markets where U S  import penetration as been substantially low  or even declining         Another area of concern outside of the NAMA discussions that could negatively impact the U S  auto industry involves Trade Related Investment Measures  TRIMs    The WTO TRIMs agreement is the single most important achievement for the auto sector that emerged from the Uruguay Round   We are surprised and troubled  to see language in the Ministerial draft that allows developing countries to maintain existing TRIMs and to introduce new TRIMs  as we have been told throughout this Round that no language re opening agreements  such as the TRIMs agreement  would be permitted                      During the Hong Kong Ministerial  it is critical that the U S  takes a position that will further advance this important issue and achieve an outcome that is beneficial to the U S  automotive sector  We stand ready to assist you in moving forward on this issue  which will help strengthen U S  auto and auto parts companies by opening markets and leveling the global playing field for their products           Sincerely         s        The Michigan Congressional Delegation
