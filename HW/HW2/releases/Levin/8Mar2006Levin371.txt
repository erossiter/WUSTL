Hearing on the Quadrennial Defense Review with Deputy Secretary of Defense England and Admiral Giambastiani                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr  Chairman  I join you in welcoming our witnesses this afternoon          In the past decade  our military has made great strides in transforming itself to be lighter yet more lethal   We can deploy faster and attack more precisely   Our military has proven itself to be flexible and adaptable  and we have done all this as the preeminent military power in the world  without a peer competitor to spur us on   As the QDR report puts it     Sustaining continuous operational change and innovation are a hallmark of U S  forces      Americans are justly proud of our military         However  to quote your report     The United States will not win the war on terrorism or achieve other crucial national security objectives discussed in this Report by military means alone     Both the Congress and the Executive Branch can do more to integrate all the instruments of national power     offense  defense  and prevention     to promote and protect our security both at home and abroad   The QDR talks about extending the Goldwater Nichols spirit of jointness into the interagency process  and I think that should be done   But we should think beyond the government   s role as well        In his testimony to our Committee last month  General Pace wrote     Thankfully  the daily life of the average American citizen reflects none of the hardships or shortages we associate with a nation at war      That is true  but there is another side to that coin   An Army officer returning from Iraq last summer was quoted in the New York Times as saying    Nobody in America is asked to sacrifice  except us           If we are truly engaged in a    long war    against terrorism  then the nation  not just the soldier and the Marine  need to be involved   Yet so far  that has not been the case   To date  the President has not asked those of us who are not serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to even make the most obvious sacrifice of paying the bill to support the few of us who are asked to serve   Every penny of the cost of these operations has been borrowed and added to the national debt our children must repay  If this is a long war  our children will end up paying our share as well as their own if this practice persists        In October 2003  Secretary Rumsfeld wrote a memo to the senior DOD leadership that stated in part     we are putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop terrorists  The cost benefit ratio is against us  Our cost is billions against the terrorists  costs of millions            Secretary Rumsfeld wrote that memo in the opening weeks of fiscal year 2004  In the two years that would follow  we spent  160 billion on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan   Last month  the administration submitted yet another supplemental request that would push the total spent in connection with these operations to  122 billion in fiscal year 2006  the highest level ever   That is over  10 billion a month   Clearly we have not yet found the right solution to the problem the Secretary posed   This is not a sustainable path for our nation   The QDR states that    the United States must constantly strive to minimize its own costs in terms of lives and treasure  while imposing unsustainable costs on its adversaries      I do not believe any of us could tell the American people we are doing so today        One step in forging the national consensus we all seek is to start budgeting for this long war honestly     telling the American people what it costs and deciding how to pay the bill now   That is why I have written to the Budget Committee asking that the costs relative to these operations not be added to the budget above the line as emergencies  but included into the budget itself  and into the normal authorization and appropriation process          Honest budgeting could also help spark a fuller public debate about whether we are relying too much on costly military methods to fight terrorism   If the American taxpayer was actually being presented with a  10 billion per month bill  the public would demand that we would all work harder at finding alternative solutions        I am also concerned that maintaining our current troop levels in Iraq is not sustainable over the long term   Despite the Department   s belief that we are in a    long war     the QDR calls for returning our Army and Marine Corps personnel strengths to their lower pre Iraq levels despite the significant increase in our demands on our ground forces   How does the Department believe a smaller ground force will sustain itself for this long war        The QDR raises other questions as well         How confident are we that we can bring over 50 000 military personnel presently stationed overseas back to the United States with no increase in our strategic lift requirements and no impact on our alliances and regional engagement         The report states that    There is growing and deep concern in the Department of Defense   s senior leadership and in the Congress about the acquisition processes   This lack of confidence results from an inability to determine accurately the true state of major acquisition programs when measured by cost  schedule  and performance      The report makes this very troubling description of our acquisition process  but it is not clear what changes you have in mind to address this issue         The QDR calls for the need for more language skills and cultural knowledge in our military   The report then states the logical conclusion that people with such skills should probably    serve on long term assignments in key strategic regions of the world rather than assuming the traditional career path of multiple  short term assignments      Few people outside the military may understand how potentially revolutionary a change in DOD   s culture this could turn out to be   How broadly might such a change in our assignment policies extend         The QDR talks about the threat of terrorists or others obtaining and using weapons of mass destruction   Yet there is not a single mention of truly preventative measures like the cooperative threat reduction program   Why is the Department calling for new efforts to locate or defend against weapons of mass destruction  but giving inadequate attention to ways of destroying fissile material before it can get into the hands of those who would use it to make the weapon         Finally  the QDR repeatedly calls for    more flexible authorities from the Congress    on a number of fronts  including training foreign military and police forces  providing them with logistical support and equipment  and allowing US military personnel to spend funds under the Commander   s Emergency Response Program around the globe   The need to act quickly in the modern world is evident  and I understand why the Department would seek as much flexibility and authority as it can get  but you need to recognize that Congress has its role  and that checks and balances have their place in an democratic society  in order to ensure oversight and accountability   There is a natural tension between the executive branch   s desire for sweeping authority and the need for accountability   Additionally  such authorities  in a narrower form  have been provided to the Department of State and overseen by the Foreign Relations Committee   Why should these authorities be broadened and provided to the Department of Defense   This report discusses the need for more    jointness    between executive branch agencies    How would DOD work with or through other agencies if given additional authorities        Secretary England  I very much appreciate and agree with the words in your prepared testimony     America needs a strong  bipartisan consensus on national security      Your actions as well as your words have shown your commitment to that in the past   On a number of fronts  from Iraq to the Patriot Act  we do not have that consensus today   I hope that our conversation this afternoon will be part of building such a consensus
