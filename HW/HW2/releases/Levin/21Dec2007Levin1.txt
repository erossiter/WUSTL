D Mich   today joined a bipartisan group of 36 Senate colleagues in urging President Bush to release  586 million in contingency funds for the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  as soon as he signs the fy2008 Consolidated Appropriations bill into law   The legislation  passed this week by Congress  directs a total of  2 57 billion to LIHEAP  including  586 million in emergency contingency funds that are released to states at the President   s discretion       The senators wrote     We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder             Congress approved this important funding to provide relief to seniors and American families who are struggling with the rising energy bills     said Levin     With so many cold days ahead  many families in Michigan are depending on LIHEAP assistance and I am hopeful that President Bush will recognize that and promptly release these emergency funds          The text of the letter follows         December 21  2007         The President  The White House  Washington  D C   20500        Dear Mr  President       The Consolidated Appropriations bill for FY2008 included  2 57 billion in funding for the Low Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   including  586 million in contingency funds to be released at your discretion   We are writing to urge you to release the LIHEAP funds immediately   The high energy prices facing consumers and the severe weather of the past few weeks warrant this release         This winter  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  and many of these families are carrying energy debt from previous years   As such  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden on families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens to ensure their health and safety through the cold winter months       Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population   During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305   Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise   Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02   As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the program   s purchasing power    According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding   The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million       LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Children   s Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children   In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances         We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder
