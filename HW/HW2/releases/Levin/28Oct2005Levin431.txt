Oil and U S  and U N  Oversight Failures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON   Today  Senator Carl Levin  D Mich   Ranking Minority Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  announced that he would release on Monday a  examining actions taken by Bayoil USA to sell Iraqi oil in unapproved markets and reap millions of dollars in illicit revenue   The report also addresses inadequate U S  and U N  oversight efforts and failure to stop Bayoil   s illicit activities        Bayoil USA is an American company that was the largest importer of Iraqi oil into the United States during the United Nations Oil for Food  OFF  program          This report lays out convincing evidence that the U N  oil experts were correct in suspecting that Bayoil was playing a transatlantic shell game with Iraqi oil  using the Suez Canal oil pipeline to secretly load millions of barrels of oil onto unapproved ships sailing for unapproved ports in circumvention of the OFF program     Levin said          Bayoil   s deceptive conduct generated millions of dollars in illicit revenue for the company     illicit revenue which may then have been used to finance millions of dollars in illegal surcharges paid to the Hussein regime     said Levin      By not responding to repeated U N  requests for help in investigating this scheme  the U S  Treasury Department failed in its oversight obligations and missed an opportunity to stop a U S  corporation from contributing to Saddam   s efforts to corrupt the Oil for Food Program           The 36 page report     Bayoil Diversions of Iraqi Oil and Related Oversight Failures     will be released in connection with a Subcommittee hearing on Monday afternoon  October 31  examining problems with the OFF program  including Saddam Hussein   s efforts to compel OFF participants to pay kickbacks to his regime   The Subcommittee hearing will also examine the need for U N  management reforms        During the OFF program  Bayoil imported into the United States over 200 million barrels of Iraqi oil  for which  37 million in illegal surcharges were paid to the Iraqi Government according to an earlier Levin report entitled     Illegal Surcharges on Oil for Food Contracts and Illegal Oil Shipments from Khor al Amaya     released May 17  2005   In April  Bayoil was indicted by the United States for paying and causing to be paid millions of dollars in secret illegal surcharges to Iraq         The report to be released Monday presents new evidence indicating that  in 2001  Bayoil diverted 4 million barrels of Iraqi oil to unapproved markets in violation of the relevant U N  contracts  OFF Program requirements  and U S  regulations   As a result of these diversions  Bayoil appears to have obtained at least  7 5 million in illicit revenue that may have been used to finance illegal surcharges paid to the Hussein regime         U N  oil experts repeatedly sought specific information about these suspect Bayoil shipments  as explained in the prior Levin report   When Bayoil refused to cooperate by providing the information  the United Nations twice asked the United States for help  in 2001 and 2002  but the United States  particularly the U S  Treasury Department   s Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC   failed to provide any assistance   The U S  government also failed to exercise any independent oversight of Bayoil  despite the company   s significance as an Iraqi oil importer and U N  concerns about suspect Bayoil shipments        The report also presents new evidence that  when questioned by U N  oil experts about one of the shipments  Bayoil and Rosnefteimpex  a Russian firm which sold the Iraqi oil at issue to Bayoil  provided materially false information that mischaracterized the oil shipment   s timing  transport  and final destination       Additionally  the report presents new evidence that  when told about the suspect oil shipments and Bayoil   s failure to cooperate with U N  information requests  the head of the U N  Office of Iraq Programme  OIP   Benon Sevan  rejected without explanation a request by U N  oil experts to present the facts to the U N  661 Committee responsible for U N  sanctions on Iraq          The Bayoil episode illustrates the basic fact that the United Nations    ability to detect and prevent corruption in the Oil for Food program depended in large measure on the willingness of member countries like the United States to police their own nationals     said Levin      When it came to Bayoil  however  the United States failed to meet its own oversight obligations to ensure that Iraqi oil revenues were used to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people instead of lining Saddam   s pockets            The Levin staff report makes the following findings        Illegal Surcharge Demands   In early 2001  Bayoil financed the payment of illegal surcharges demanded by the Hussein regime by paying increased fees for Iraqi oil that Bayoil purchased from intermediaries who paid the surcharges to Iraq      Millions in Illicit Revenue   In early 2001  Bayoil appears to have generated millions of dollars in illicit revenue by diverting Iraqi oil shipments to unapproved destinations in violation of OFF requirements and U S  sanctions on Iraq        Bayoil and Rosnefteimpex  a Russian company that bought and sold Iraqi oil  provided the United Nations with false information about the timing  transport  and final destination of Iraqi oil which Rosnefteimpex had purchased from Iraq and sold to Bayoil         The false information provided by Bayoil and Rosnefteimpex misled the United Nations       Bayoil appears to have diverted at least 4 million barrels of Iraqi oil to unapproved destinations       Bayoil   s delivery of Iraqi oil to unapproved destinations violated OFF requirements and U S  regulations restricting trade with Iraq       Bayoil appears to have generated at least  7 5 million in illicit revenue by delivering 4 million barrels of Iraqi oil to unapproved destinations   This illicit revenue provided Bayoil with a source of funds to pay higher fees to companies paying illegal surcharges to Iraq         U S  Oversight Failure   The U S  failure to investigate or help the United Nations to investigate suspect Bayoil shipments involving several million barrels of Iraqi oil impaired oversight of the OFF program and efforts to deter the payment of illegal surcharges       U N  Oversight Failure   The failure of the U N  Office of Iraqi Programme to notify the U N  661 Committee of Bayoil   s failure to provide requested documentation on suspect shipments involving several million barrels of Iraqi oil impaired oversight of the OFF program and efforts to deter the payment of illegal surcharges
