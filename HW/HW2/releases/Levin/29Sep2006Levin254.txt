safely carry more hydrogen  increasing driving range and reducing refueling frequency and cost   Issues to be addressed include development of materials to maximize storage potential  improving the ability to charge and recharge the solid storage systems with hydrogen quickly after use  devising hydrogen release systems that can extract hydrogen from a solid storage system into fuel cells in a controlled  repeatable manner  and making the entire storage systems cost effective relative to other storage systems or more traditional engine technologies         3 9 million for a project to optimize the use of fuel cell technology to support the continuity of operations in the event of a terrorist attack or other catastrophic event  Under this project  the DoD will work jointly with industry to develop fuel cell systems that meet the unique power requirements of the small and dispersed satellite locations which would house critical functions of government and military during an emergency  Selfridge Air National Guard Base and other facilities will conduct the testing  evaluation and demonstration of these prototype units       1 95 million for the Hydrogen Logistics Fuel Initiative   This funding will continue the hydrogen logistics initiative established in fiscal year 2006 at the Defense Logistics Agency  DLA    The purpose of this program is to establish an oversight structure and focal point within DoD to monitor technology and policy developments in the area of hydrogen  and to develop a comprehensive and integrated strategy  plan for the appropriate use of hydrogen and acquisition of hydrogen to meet those DoD requirements for the future  and make appropriate technology development investments to those requirements   A significant focus will be on the development of a DoD hydrogen strategy and roadmap and a pilot demonstration of hydrogen refueling infrastructure        Robotics   6 5 million for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Development
