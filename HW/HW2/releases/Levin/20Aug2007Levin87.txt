Senate Armed Services Committee  and Senator John Warner  Former Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           We completed a very productive two day visit to Iraq on August 18   We came to Iraq to assess the progress being achieved by    the surge     whose purpose is to provide Iraqi politicians with the    breathing space    to achieve political reconciliation and to evaluate the extent to which they are taking advantage of the opportunity   On August 19  we visited Jordan for a series of meetings concerning Iraq  refugees  and regional security       We visited forward operating bases in Mosul and Baghdad   In these areas  as well as a number of others in Iraq  the military aspects of President Bush   s new strategy in Iraq  as articulated by him on January 10  2007  appear to have produced some credible and positive results   While visiting U S  forces in Baghdad  we visited a Joint Security Station  a key component of the surge strategy  in eastern Baghdad and met with the U S  forces and Iraqi Police and Iraqi Army forces that are housed together and conduct combined operations in one of the dangerous areas of Baghdad       We met with senior U S  and Iraqi civilian officials and military leaders   We conducted candid and very constructive meetings with General Petraeus  the Commander of Multi National Forces Iraq  General Odierno  the Commander of Multi National Corps Iraq  and Lieutenant General Dubik  the Commander of the Multi National Security Training Command Iraq  to discuss the military aspects of the President   s strategy and progress on the training  equipping and readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces   We continued discussions about the readiness of the Iraqi Army in meetings with Iraq   s Minister of Defense and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Armed Forces       We consulted with Ambassador Crocker  the U S  Ambassador to Iraq  on three occasions to discuss progress on the political components of the President   s new strategy   We met with the Ambassador once in a combined session with General Petraeus and later in two meetings with Senior Iraqi leaders that included President Jalal Talabani  Deputy Presidents Adil Abd Al Mahdi and Tariq Al Hashimi  and Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih       While in Baghdad  we also met with Stuart Bowen  the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR   and members of the SIGIR staff to discuss the findings of their July 2007 report and their ongoing audits and investigations   In addition  we met with members of Iraq   s Christian community  composed of groups who have lived in the region for centuries  to learn more about their situation       The meetings in Jordan included consultations with the U S  Ambassador and members of his staff  as well as Jordanian officials and members of the Iraqi Parliament   We also wanted to gain more knowledge about Iraqi citizens currently residing in Jordan and met with a senior official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the Amman office of Save the Children  and a group of Iraqis currently residing in Jordan       Most important  we continue to be in awe of the dedication  commitment  and courageous performance of our troops  wherever they are in Iraq  and government and private sector civilians who risk their lives daily to give Iraqis the chance to build their nation   Their heroism cannot be overstated       We have seen indications that the surge of additional brigades to Baghdad and its immediate vicinity and the revitalized counter insurgency strategy being employed have produced tangible results in making several areas of the capital more secure   We are also encouraged by continuing positive results    in al Anbar Province  from the recent decisions of some of the Sunni tribes to turn against al Qaeda and cooperate with coalition force efforts to kill or capture its adherents   We remain concerned  however  that in the absence of overall    national    political reconciliation  we may be inadvertently helping to create another militia which will have to be dealt with in the future       We note the continuing improvement in the ability and willingness of the Iraqi Army to conduct combat operations against the insurgents  but remain concerned about the lack of experience of some of its leadership and the lack of critical military capabilities needed before more of its units can operate independently   Chief among these are modern small arms  artillery  combat and lift aviation  explosive ordnance disposal  transportation assets  and engineer capability essential for force protection   Logistics capabilities are virtually non existent and are a major hindrance to independent action       We were also informed of problems within our own United States bureaucracy which are hindering the delivery of badly needed military equipment for Iraqi forces purchased with Iraqi funds through the Foreign Military Sales program   We will be looking into that problem and urge the Secretaries of Defense and State to take immediate action to cut through the red tape that is delaying those purchases       While we believe that the    surge    is having measurable results  and has provided a degree of    breathing space    for Iraqi politicians to make the political compromises which are essential for a political solution in Iraq  we are not optimistic about the prospects for those compromises   We were in Iraq both during the recent initial meeting of the Iraq Presidency Council  the Prime Minister and the President of the Kurdish region and during the immediately following expanded meeting  which were intended to reach political compromises   We would like to be optimistic that those meetings will lead to substantive progress  however    given the performance of the Iraqi political leadership to date    we remain extremely cautious in our expectations  as does our distinguished U S  Ambassador to Iraq  Ambassador Ryan Crocker       In many meetings with Iraqi political leaders  of all different backgrounds  we told them of the deep impatience of the American people and the Congress with the lack of political progress  impressed upon them that time has run out in that regard  and told them of the urgent need to make the essential compromises   In all of our meetings we witnessed a great deal of apprehension regarding the capabilities of the current Iraqi government to shed its sectarian biases and act in a unifying manner       We believe that the recent high level meetings among Iraqi political leaders could be the last chance for this government to solve the Iraqi political crisis  and should it fail  we believe  the Iraqi Council of Representatives and the Iraqi people need to judge the Government of Iraq   s record and determine what actions should be taken    consistent with the Iraqi Constitution    to form a true unity government to meet those responsibilities
