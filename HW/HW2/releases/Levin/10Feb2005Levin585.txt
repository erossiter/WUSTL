                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON   Today  Senator Norm Coleman  R Minn   and Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  released a bipartisan Subcommittee  with ten recommendations to combat abusive and illegal tax shelters          Abusive tax shelters hurt the American people  the honest hard working families that pay their fair share     Coleman said     This Report details how accountants  lawyers  bankers  and investment advisors developed  implemented  and mass marketed cookie cutter tax shelters used to rip off the Treasury of billions of dollars in taxes   I am against regulation just for the sake of more regulation  the preferable way is for professional firms to self impost high ethical standards without requiring Congressional review to highlight their transgressions   I am pleased to note that in response to our investigation the accounting firms examined in this Report have committed to change their ways and this Report details those changes  However  stronger penalties and the recommendations in this report to reign in other firms and bankers and lawyers are still needed to restore the public trust in our tax laws               The Senate must take the lead in clamping down on abusive tax shelters that steal tens of billions of dollars from the U S  treasury and force honest taxpayers to make up the difference     said Levin      I believe we have the bipartisan support necessary to pass real penalties on abusive tax shelter promoters  enact stronger prohibitions on transactions with no business purpose other than tax avoidance  and take tough action against the accountants  lawyers  and bankers hawking these deceptive and abusive tax shelters          The Subcommittee held hearings in November 2003  and released a Minority staff report showing how accounting firms  law firms  banks and security advisory firms had joined forces to develop  market  and carry out abusive or illegal tax shelters       The bipartisan Subcommittee report released today provides new details about the abusive tax shelters promoted by KPMG  Ernst   Young  or PricewaterhouseCoopers  as well as the commitments each accounting firm has since made to end their abusive tax shelter business   It also provides new information on how other professional firms helped promote these tax shelters  including Sidley Austin Brown   Wood  Deutsche Bank  HVB  Wachovia Bank  Presidio and Quellos   The report also provides new information about how two charitable organizations  the Los Angeles Department of Fire   Police Pensions System and Austin Fire Fighters Relief and Retirement Fund  became involved with an abusive tax shelter       The Subcommittee made the following ten bipartisan recommendations to combat abusive tax shelters        Enforcement Focus  The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice should continue enforcement efforts aimed at stopping accounting firms and law firms from aiding and abetting tax evasion  promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters  and violating federal tax shelter regulations  and should impose substantial penalties on wrongdoers to punish and deter such misconduct      Promoter Penalties  Congress should enact legislation to increase the civil penalties on aiders and abettors of tax evasion and promoters of potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters  to ensure that they disgorge not only all illicit proceeds from such activities  but also pay a substantial monetary fine to punish and deter such misconduct      IRS Appropriations  Congress should appropriate additional funds to enable the IRS to hire more enforcement personnel and increase enforcement activities to stop the promotion of potentially abusive and illegal tax shelters by lawyers  accountants  and other financial professionals      Economic Substance Doctrine  Congress should enact legislation to clarify and strengthen the economic substance doctrine and to strengthen civil penalties on transactions with no economic substance or business purpose apart from their alleged tax benefits      Interagency Cooperation  Congress should enact legislation authorizing the IRS to disclose relevant tax shelter information to other federal agencies  such as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  federal bank regulators  and the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   to strengthen their efforts to stop the entities they oversee from aiding or abetting tax evasion or promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters      Accountant Rules  The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board should strengthen and finalize proposed rules restricting certain accounting firms from providing aggressive tax services to their audit clients  charging companies a contingent fee for providing tax services  and using aggressive marketing efforts to promote generic tax products to potential clients      Bank Oversight  Federal bank regulators  in consultation with the IRS  should review tax shelter activities at major banks  and clarify and strengthen rules preventing banks from aiding or abetting tax evasion by third parties or promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters      Securities Firm Oversight  The SEC  in consultation with the IRS  should review tax shelter activities at investment advisory and securities firms it oversees  and clarify and strengthen rules preventing such firms from aiding or abetting tax evasion by third parties or promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters      Tax Opinion Letters  The IRS should further strengthen federal tax practitioner rules issued under Circular 230 regarding the issuance of tax opinion letters to ensure that such practitioners  including law firms and accounting firms  have written procedures for issuing tax opinions  resolving internal disputes over legal issues addressed in such opinions  and preventing practitioners or their firms from aiding or abetting tax evasion by clients or promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters      Charitable Organizations  The IRS should review tax shelter activities at charitable organizations  and clarify and strengthen rules preventing such organizations from aiding or abetting tax evasion by third parties or promoting potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters
