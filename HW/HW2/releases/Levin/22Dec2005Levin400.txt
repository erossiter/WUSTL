Mich   and Sen  Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   announced that the authorization bill for the Department of Defense  DOD  approved by the Senate late yesterday continues to utilize the vital services of Michigan institutions that support DOD and also improves the quality of life for our service members and their families          Strong partnerships between Michigan   s automotive industry  the research and development community  and the Department of Defense have helped to keep our troops equipped with the best cutting edge technology available in the world and have provided important test beds for the auto industry s work on fuel cell and other advanced vehicle technologies     said Levin  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee      This bill continues to encourage these important partnerships while also paying tribute to the vital work performed by our service members by increasing their pay and improving health benefits             This is important legislation for our troops and their families  because it authorizes a pay raise for all military personnel and a greatly increased survivor benefit for their families     Stabenow said     The bill also authorizes additional spending for equipment to protect our troops in the field  and it aids Michigan   s economy with research funding for Michigan colleges and universities  In addition  it calls on the president to provide progress reports on the Iraq efforts and sets a goal of moving toward Iraq led security during 2006  This is a good bill for Michigan  for the nation  and for our armed forces          The bill authorizes over  260 million for Army research on combat vehicle and automotive technologies  including systems to protect Army vehicles against rocket propelled grenades  RPGs  and improvised explosive devices  IEDs   more efficient engines  fuel cell and hybrid electric vehicles  advanced materials for tank and Humvee armor  robotics  computer simulations for vehicle design and training of Army personnel  and technology partnerships with the automotive industry  This research is performed and managed by the Army Tank and Automotive Research  Development and Engineering Command  TARDEC  and its National Automotive Center  NAC   both located in Warren  Michigan  TARDEC is the leading laboratory for research and development of advanced military vehicle technologies for the Department of Defense  DOD        The bill would also improve the quality of life for our service members and their families by providing a 3 1 percent pay raise for all military personnel and by authorizing government subsidized access to TRICARE Standard for every member of the Selected Reserve     and their families    who commits to continued service in the Selected Reserve   Nearly 3 000 Michigan Guard and Reserve Members are currently mobilized       Some of the provisions that are important to Michigan companies  universities  and institutions include the following          The bill establishes a pilot program to accelerate the transition of technologies from the Small Business Innovative Research  SBIR  program into traditional defense acquisition programs  supporting a number of innovative Michigan firms on the cutting edge of defense technology  including Cybernet in Ann Arbor and Thermoanalytics in Calumet   The SBIR program  like the Department of Commerce   s Advanced Technology Program  serves as one of the few government programs that invests in innovative businesses in order to produce new technologies for commercial or national security purposes           The bill provides a  40 million increase for competitive  merit based university defense research programs  including increasing support for DOD science and engineering fellowships and research in computer science and cybersecurity   The University of Michigan  Michigan State University  Wayne State University  and a number of other Michigan colleges and universities have tapped into this important source of funding for basic research          The bill includes a provision to enhance DOD   s ability to develop revolutionary manufacturing technologies and processes and ensure that they are disseminated widely in the defense industrial base   Focus  HOPE of Detroit has already worked with the Army on a number of advanced manufacturing initiatives  and their contributions will continue to be critical to these efforts   The legislation also calls for DOD to partner with industry and produce technology development roadmaps in selected sectors of importance to the military to ensure that the U S  retains global leadership in innovation and manufacturing          The bill calls on the Department of Defense to update Congress on the development and deployment of fuel cell vehicles to support the special operations military mission  highlighting the work of the National Automotive Center in developing these vehicles   Fuel cell vehicles support critical missions by improving minimizing the heat and noise signature for vehicles and providing systems to produce electrical power for radios and other electronics equipment on the battlefield          The bill includes a provision proposed by Senator Levin to highlight the importance of robotics and unmanned ground vehicles systems in DOD   The provision directs DOD to provide a comprehensive report on the development and deployment of these systems in DOD  as well as analyze the robotics industrial base and international capabilities in this critical area   Michigan   s auto industry and R community  TARDEC  and TACOM are leaders in the development of these robotic and unmanned ground vehicles systems     currently being used for a number of missions in Iraq  including the destruction of roadside bombs and the identification of potential Improvised Explosive Devices  IEDs    These systems are envisioned to become one third of the military ground vehicle fleet by 2015  performing missions ranging from combat to surveillance and reconnaissance
