released the following statement on the provisions of the defense conference agreement addressing the treatment of detainees   This legislative package includes both the McCain amendment and the Graham Levin amendment    Throughout the conference  we were pressed by Administration officials and their allies in the House to make changes to the Senate provisions on the treatment of detainees   We were asked to strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases  to eliminate any review of the constitutionality of procedures established by the Department of Defense  to expand the habeas corpus limitations to detainees held anywhere in the world  to expand these provisions to strip legal rights from detainees held by the CIA and other agencies  to bar detainees from ever bringing any legal action challenging any aspect of their detention  to prohibit the courts from providing legal relief for detainees who are found to be improperly held  and to grant immunity to individuals engaged in detention and interrogation operations   We successfully opposed all of these changes       The jurisdiction stripping provision in the Graham amendment initially approved by the Senate over my objections would have applied retroactively to all pending cases in federal court     stripping the courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases  including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court   The revised amendment that we were able to work out with Senator Graham     the so called Graham Levin Kyl amendment     does not apply to or alter any habeas case pending in the courts at the time of enactment   The conference report retains the same effective date as the Senate bill  thereby adopting the Senate position that this provision will not strip the courts of jurisdiction in pending cases       The conference report does make two changes to the Senate language which  in my view  are problematic         First  the Senate passed provision would have established an exclusionary rule prohibiting status review tribunals from considering evidence obtained through    undue coercion      I was troubled by the phrase    undue coercion     because of the implication that there might be such a thing as    due        or appropriate     coercion   I do not believe that coerced testimony is ever appropriate        We were able to modify the provision in the conference report to eliminate the word    undue    and address any coercion at all     an improvement over the Senate language   At the same time  however  the provision was modified so that it only provides for an    assessment    of whether there was any coerced testimony and requires the tribunal to decide  subject to review in the courts  if there is any probative value to such testimony         It is a centuries old principle of Anglo American law  enshrined in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution  that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself   Regardless whether this rule of law is expressly incorporated into the procedures for status review tribunals  I hope and believe that the courts will enforce the rule of law and ensure that evidence obtained through coercion is excluded from any administrative or judicial proceedings       Second  while the Senate passed provision would have eliminated federal court jurisdiction only for habeas corpus actions  the conference report would eliminate such jurisdiction for    any other action against the United States or its agents    relating to detention at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba         This new language is limited to detainees who either   1  remain in military custody at Guantanamo  or  2  although they have been released from Guantanamo  have been determined by the United States Court of Appeals  subject to Supreme Court review  to have been properly detained as enemy combatants   Nonetheless  it places yet another limitation on the avenues of legal recourse available to detainees       In sum  Administration officials and their allies in the House have sought at every turn to deny any legal right or recourse to detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere   I do not believe that we should have gone down the road of limiting legal remedies for detainees in the manner that we did   However  we have done our best to preserve a meaningful opportunity for detainees to challenge the legality of their detention in federal court   While we have not succeeded as well as I would have liked  the provision in the conference report does not  in my view  justify opposing a defense authorization bill which includes both the many provisions needed by our troops in a time of war and the McCain amendment barring  cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment   Indeed  I am pleased that we were able to work with Senator McCain to preserve his amendment intact and to avoid any changes elsewhere in the detainees title of the bill that would have undermined his amendment
