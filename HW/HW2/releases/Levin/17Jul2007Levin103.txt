Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON     Senator Carl Levin  D MI  and Congressman Bart Stupak  D Menominee  today wrote Secretary of State Condolezza Rice to urge the State Department to delay implementing new rules on which agencies may process applications for passports          With so many travelers in Michigan and around the country facing long delays in getting their passports  now is not the time to cut back on the number of facilities accepting applications   said Levin    This change would place an unfair burden on rural communities and put more pressure on a system that is already stretched to the breaking point           These new rules penalize rural Americans who may now have to drive great distances if they are not allowed to apply for a passport from the same County Clerk that issued their birth certificate     Stupak said      This ill conceived policy will make many rural Americans pay more  travel farther  and endure further delay to process their passport applications          The State Department recently instituted a policy that prohibits passport facilities that also have birth record functions  like County Clerks  offices  from accepting passport applications with birth certificates issued from the same office          The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative has already caused enormous delays for travelers  and I fear this policy change will only make the mess worse     Stupak added      This latest passport policy change was rolled out with little notice and no opportunity for public comment            Many rural communities in Michigan depend on local facilities for their passport needs  and I am hopeful that Secretary Rice will take that into account and allow for a public discussion of this important change   Levin said       County Clerks offices were informed of the new policy on June 25th   The following day  Stupak wrote Rice  asking that the policy be suspended and that the State Department explain the justification for the new policy and why there was no public comment period before the policy was implemented    The State Department has not responded to Stupak   s first letter             NOTE  The text of the Levin Stupak letter is below    The Honorable Condolezza Rice  United States Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington  D C   20520   Dear Secretary Rice     We request that you immediately delay implementation of the Passport Agency requirements on Passport Application Acceptance facilities   This directive places an unfair and unnecessary burden on rural communities         This policy requires Passport Application Acceptance facilities that issue birth records not to accept passport applications from individuals who have birth certificates issued from the same agency   As a result  individuals will have to travel to another acceptance facility or must present a state issued birth certificate to apply for a passport   Under these new regulations  our constituents will experience increased travel time  costs  and delays         Throughout Michigan our constituents will be forced to travel long distances to obtain their passports   For example  if a constituent is turned away from the Marquette County Clerk  because they have a Marquette County issued birth certificate  the nearest county clerk   s office is in Munising which is approximately 60 miles away       In Michigan  it is county clerks    offices that have traditionally processed birth certificates   Serving as the vital records keeper for counties  these offices are in a better position to verify an individual   s legal identity than the state or some other county   In addition  county clerks    offices charge between  8 and  10 for a birth certificate and it can be obtained within a day   The State of Michigan charges individuals  26 for a state issued birth certificate and can take weeks to process       It is our understanding that this policy will make it more difficult for Michiganders in rural communities to apply for a passport   We urge you to allow Michigan county clerks to continue to process all passport requests until the Department of State  Members of Congress  and state officials can discuss the need for this policy change and the difficulties it imposes on state and local governments       Thank you for your prompt response to our concerns       Sincerely     Carl Levin  Bart Stupak    United States Senator  Member of Congress
