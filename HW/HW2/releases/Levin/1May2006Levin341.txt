Nation    Remarks of Senator Carl Levin before the Detroit Economic Club                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Remarks as prepared for delivery      Thank you for that very kind introduction   I always look forward speaking at the Detroit Economic Club   Not only is it one of the premiere public affairs forums in the nation  but for me being here is being home         It is wonderful to be with so many old friends and some new faces today   At the Detroit Economic Club  the audience is knowledgeable  the discussion is lively  and the questions are anonymous     the perfect combination for a lasting relationship        I also enjoy speaking here for the opportunity it affords me to think a little bigger  a little more broadly  than the everyday   Today I want to use that opportunity to discuss a vital long term project that could have cascading benefits for the nation and for the planet          For years  we have repeated as a mantra that America is the world s lone superpower   Some have gone so far as to say we are a    hyperpower      But today  that status is more at risk than at any time since the end of the Cold War   We are bogged down in a long and costly war in Iraq   We are hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs   Religious extremists threaten our security   And India and China are rising to assume the economic power that springs from hitching their enormous populations to the global economy        These challenges are not a cause for pessimism  but they should be a call to action   At difficult times in our history  America has acted with firm purpose   Whether it was saving the world from tyranny during World War II or staring down the communist threat during the Cold War that followed  America has been at its greatest when the stakes are at their highest         45 years ago  President John F  Kennedy faced the Soviet surge into space   He responded to that challenge by launching the Apollo program     a bold national mission to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade   And because he did  we did        Today  I want to talk about a long term  Apollo like effort to meet many of the greatest challenges of our time   It begins with an issue that has hit Michigan hard     the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs      Economy and Jobs    As we have seen firsthand in Michigan  our nation is hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs   America has lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs in the last five years  and nearly 180 000 of those jobs have been in Michigan   In fact  Michigan has lost nearly one out of every three manufacturing jobs we had in 1999        Not only is this bad for the affected workers  it is a crisis for the country because America s economy and well being are directly linked to the health of our manufacturing sector        If that statement sounds strong to you  then you heard me right   We cannot speak strongly enough in defense of manufacturing   We cannot give in to the canard that says we only need an economy based on services and technology  and the only things we need to build are websites and Wal Marts that retail foreign made goods          The fact is that the rise and fall in the number of manufacturing jobs in America is directly related to the rise and fall of median family income   Between 1993 and 2000  the number of manufacturing jobs rose and so did median family income    Between 2000 and 2004  manufacturing jobs fell  and so did median family income        Manufacturing has also historically been a major contributor to American economic growth   Even during the boom of the 1990s  which was largely seen as driven by technology companies  manufacturing accounted for 22 percent of economic growth   And  aside from the computer industry itself  Silicon Valley   s number one private sector customer for its computers is the auto industry       A New Apollo Program    To revitalize our manufacturing sector  we need to revitalize our auto industry  which has led before     as an engine of the economy and a driver of new technologies     and can do so again   We need our own moon shot     our own Apollo program     for this generation  a comprehensive initiative to produce  in the near term  a large number of vehicles that are capable of operating on alternative fuels  and to create  in the long term  the leap ahead technologies that will boost our auto industry and help end our dependence on imported oil   And we must provide the resources to match that vision        This initiative must involve industry  academia  and government in an active partnership   Here are some critical steps that must be taken        For the near term  we need to vastly increase the availability of flex fuel vehicles  which can run on either gasoline or an ethanol or biofuel blend  and increase the availability of the fuels themselves   We need to exploit this existing technology to the fullest because America does not have enough domestic oil to meet our current needs  but we do have huge amounts of renewable resources that can produce ethanol and other biofuels          We now produce ethanol in the United States primarily from corn and other feedstocks  but with leap ahead advances in technology we could also produce ethanol from cellulosic materials  such as recycled paper  grass  or even fast growing trees   Making that leap to those type of materials is critical for achieving overall reductions in carbon dioxide emissions   To accelerate and leverage efforts of industry and academia  the government must invest heavily in the research and development of this technology and the fuel it uses        There are six million vehicles on the road today capable of running on the 85 percent ethanol blend called E 85   Of those  however  less than five percent actually use E 85  in large part because of the 170 000 gas stations in the United States  only 600 sell E 85   That   s less than half of one percent of all gas stations   We could adopt a relatively short term goal of having the majority of the 17 million vehicles sold each year be flex fuel vehicles that can run on E 85  and by providing tax incentives for the installation of pumps for ethanol refueling at large numbers of gas stations in an attempt to assure that the ethanol fuels they can run on are widely available        But that attempt may fail if the oil industry doesn   t co operate  and won   t install ethanol pumps at its gas stations   Ethanol competes with the oil industry   s own gasoline and gives flex fuel vehicle owners the choice between the two fuels   So it may require a government mandate requiring oil companies that own  say  50 or more fueling stations  to pump ethanol at stations with four or more pumps   Or it may take a large tax incentive to bring in new  independent ethanol stations          All in all  by significantly increasing production of flex fuel vehicles and ethanol  there is a relatively short term opportunity to provide an alternative to gasoline for tens of millions of vehicles     an alternative which could drive down the price of gasoline  and which is far better for the air  emitting perhaps 15 percent less carbon dioxide using corn based ethanol and up to 75 percent less carbon dioxide if we can develop ethanol from materials like recycled paper and grass         But  again  this relatively short term boost toward energy independence and reduced use of fossil fuels works only if there is a major boost in ethanol   s availability and if its distribution and price aren   t manipulated by the oil industry        There   s another threat to this scenario   If a serious competitor  like ethanol and a growing number of flex fuel cars that can use it  appeared on the horizon  OPEC could drastically increase the supply of oil  thereby lowering its price and undercutting ethanol   s competitiveness    If OPEC succeeded in that tactic  as it has before  it could go back to manipulating price and supply once its monopoly position is restored   Our government would need to be authorized to prevent such OPEC monopolistic action from succeeding with even higher subsidies for ethanol than exist today   But if America is going to fight back  and control our energy destiny  we must give OPEC a run for its money   Only we the people  acting together through our government  can do that        That   s all about one relatively short term way of promoting US manufacturing     production of flex fuel vehicles and the alternatives to fossil fuels they can utilize   For the longer term  we need to invest in partnerships with the auto industry to develop advanced technologies that go way beyond anything proposed so far   Through joint industry government R  we can unlock the enormous promise of hydrogen and fuel cells  advanced hybrids and clean diesels  advanced batteries  and other technologies   And when we combine these advances with using ethanol and other biofuels instead of gasoline  the benefits could multiply exponentially        To promote further the development and production of these technologies  we also need to make far reaching changes in the tax code   We should provide domestic manufacturers with a refundable investment tax credit for re equipping or expanding existing plants to produce advanced technology vehicles or parts   Without federal tax incentives  the investments needed to develop advanced technology vehicles will be prohibitively expensive for our domestic manufacturers   And we will never get to a hydrogen economy     the ultimate goal     without tax incentives for developing the necessary hydrogen refueling infrastructure      Beyond Bailout    Pursuing an Apollo size vision and paying for it will not be easy   There are many who would stand in the way or reach for the old excuses for inaction   That   s why the first step in achieving this vision must be changing perceptions about the proper role of government in promoting manufacturing        The debate on manufacturing is haunted by what I call the    killer B    word     bailout   When that word is used  we are put on the defensive   So let s go on the offensive on the need for aggressive government policies   Government policies supporting other sectors aren   t called a bailout          There s a tariff of up to 48 percent on imported footwear  but it   s not called a    footwear bailout      There   s a 64 percent tariff on imported infant formula but no    infant formula bailout     And there   s a 132 percent tariff on imported peanut butter     and that   s not peanuts     but no one calls it a bailout   By the way  the tariff on peanuts  Up to 164 percent   Our support program for dairy farmers costs  500 million a year   It   s not called a bailout     it   s a dairy support program           The inconsistency is even worse when you consider what foreign countries do for their industries  including their automakers   Germany doesn   t call it a bailout when it provides  18 billion in direct assistance to its industries  nor does Japan when it offers billions in assistance for small and medium sized manufacturers        What our manufacturers need     and what an Apollo program would provide     is simply a level playing field  not a bailout   You   ve heard that before  but we need to say it again   And again  And again  until our manufacturers are operating on a level playing field        Our domestic manufacturers are currently playing uphill at a huge competitive disadvantage   Billions in health care costs for both workers and retirees cut sharply into our automakers  bottom lines   We need to find a different way to deal with legacy costs taken on by industry in a radically different economic climate   A true Apollo like program could remove some of the burden of health care by having the government pick up a significant share of catastrophic health care costs  say annual costs above  30 000       And surely the manipulation of currency exchange by foreign governments     which subsidizes their exports and restricts our exports     must be attacked directly   Japanese currency manipulation  for example  means that a  20 000 car imported from Japan has essentially been subsidized by between  2 400 and  7 000  depending on how undervalued the yen is   A new Apollo program would direct the President to begin bilateral and multilateral negotiations with any nations engaged in currency manipulation  and to initiate trade action under domestic or international laws if no resolution can be reached through those talks        We also need to force open export markets for our products blocked by trade barriers by threatening reciprocal restrictions  and meaning it        The notion of a level playing field has been traced all the way back to the Book of Kings  where it is written   Their gods are gods of the hills  That is why they were too strong for us  But if we fight them on the plains  surely we will be stronger than they         If our automakers are fighting on the plains  they can compete   Period      Catching Up to Asian and European Support for Manufacturing    To level that field  we need to be clear that our companies are not up against foreign manufacturers  they are up against foreign governments  The first task of a new Apollo program would be Catching Up to Asian and European Support for Manufacturing    The catchy acronym for that is  CUAESM    I   m not known as glamorous     my acronyms aren   t either         Just listen to the President of India in his recent address to Parliament   My government intends to launch a Ten Year National Manufacturing Initiative to make the manufacturing sector the prime driving force for employment and economic growth         Or German Chancellor Angela Merkel  in her policy statement in the German Bundestag     Without its car industry  Germany today would no longer be such a high tech country           Now I d like to compare that with what President Bush said about manufacturing in the State of the Union message   I d like to  but I can t   The President did not mention manufacturing in his most important address of the year        The Administration has actually moved in the opposite direction   The Manufacturing Extension Partnership has created more than 100 000 manufacturing jobs  but the President wants to cut its budget in half   The Advanced Technology Partnership offers an eight to one return in economic activity on our investment in it  but the President wants to eliminate it         We need to change directions   We need an activist federal government that fights as hard for our manufacturing industries and jobs as other countries fight for theirs   Our manufacturers don t need a bailout  but we do need to Catch Up to Asian and European Support for Manufacturing     CUAESM        By this point  you are probably thinking to yourselves     This all sounds well and good  Carl  but how are we going to afford it      My answer is  We should fund this vital national project by ending the tax avoidance schemes used by too many U S  corporations and wealthy individuals  particularly those schemes which transfer hundreds of billions in income to shell companies in tax haven countries          For example  Enron had 881 offshore subsidiaries  98 percent of which were incorporated in tiny island nations  where there was no real economic activity engaged in by the shell corporations  only avoiding taxes   Nearly 600 of these subsidiaries used the same post office box in the Cayman Islands   The major accounting firm KPMG aided and abetted tax avoidance in the billions by peddling illegal tax shelters that had had no economic purpose        We can make the investments in innovation and infrastructure I   ve called for today for about  15 billion over the next five years   And we can raise more than twice that much by ending tax avoidance schemes and collecting the taxes due   How can we afford to embark on this new Apollo program   How can we afford not to      Security    The benefits of a new Apollo program will help address two other immense challenges   Indeed  when you consider the most pressing problems we have  it is striking how many of them can be ameliorated with this one policy of support for manufacturing   From a policy perspective  developing new vehicles that run on alternatives to oil is a silver bullet that will slay many beasts  Or  to use a gentler metaphor  it is a triple play  or a three fer        Investing in advanced flex fuel autos and ethanol  and developing leap ahead advanced vehicle technologies is not only good for our manufacturing base  it is critical for our security   The struggle over energy supplies is a great and growing source of friction in the world   Today  we depend on a highly unstable region for the oil that our economy is so dependent on  and we have been forced to make alliances with countries that do not share our values        Iran   s leader believes he has us over a barrel     an oil barrel   While the world will hopefully unite to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon  if we act aggressively we can take away the oil weapon Iran and OPEC and others aim at the heart of our economy   By tapping the vast renewable bio resources of our own Midwest and elsewhere instead of the oil in the Middle East  and by investing heavily now in future technologies  we can change the dynamic of oil politics and end the strategic chokehold the oil producing countries have on us and the rest of the world        We can also finally end our dependence on countries whose values are antithetical to our own  such as Equatorial Guinea  the third largest oil producer in Africa   The State Department says Equatorial Guinea   s    government continue s  to commit or condone serious  human rights  abuses      Yet  a few days ago  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice posed next to the President of that country  and welcomed him as America   s    good friend      That picture and her words turned our stomachs  and it should add some more steel to our backbone for developing alternatives to oil      Iraq    Right now  we are engaged in a war in the Middle East that has its roots in our demand for energy   Saddam Hussein ruled through fear  but his regime   s power came from the vast quantities of oil that he controlled   The war has cost 2 400 American lives and more than  300 billion and rising   While most of my remarks today are about how we can end the dependence on foreign oil that helped lead to this morass  I want to detour for a moment to discuss how we can extricate ourselves from Iraq  hopefully leaving it in better condition than we found it and not as a breeding ground for terrorists    This will also keep me honest by matching the speech title I sent the Economic Club a month ago with what I say today         On my recent trip to Iraq  our military leaders again told us what they have been saying for years  There is no military solution to the violence in Iraq and no way to defeat the insurgency without a political solution among the Iraqis themselves   To stop the dangerous drift toward all out civil war in Iraq  we must grasp that it is an Iraqi political solution  not an American military solution  that is lacking        One useful step was taken a week ago when the Iraqis  after a four month delay  designated a new prime minister   Iraq now faces two great tasks with two rapidly approaching deadlines that they set for themselves in their constitution  putting together a unity cabinet within 30 days  including an interior minister  a defense minister  and an oil minister  and recommending changes to the constitution within 4 months        A unity cabinet is essential for the new government to succeed in Iraq   An independent minister of the interior  for example  is critical for standing up an independent police force  untainted by sectarian militias whose loyalty extends only to their sectarian leaders   Likewise  the current Iraqi constitution is a divisive document that is not accepted by all three main ethnic groups in Iraq   It needs to be amended to become a unifying framework for the future of Iraq        Last week  I introduced a bipartisan amendment in the Senate that would put significant pressure on the Iraqis to stick to their own  constitutionally imposed timeline   We urge the President to clearly condition the continued presence of American forces on the Iraqis meeting their self imposed deadlines        We cannot dictate to the Iraqis who their leaders should be or what compromises they should make  but we can make clear the stakes if they fail to meet the two deadlines they have set for themselves  that our continued presence depends on their doing so      Environment    That is my abridged version of how we can maximize our chances of success in Iraq   But my theme today is not our near term strategy in Iraq but the initiative that will make us less dependent on the resources of that volatile region   So now I want to return to the Apollo program to promote advanced auto manufacturing in America and to its third great benefit  environmental security and the very survival of our planet   By developing advanced vehicles and accompanying energy alternatives  we can hopefully avoid the environmental disaster that otherwise is our future        Nearly all of our scientists agree that climate change is occurring  primarily because of our use of fossil fuels  and that it is a threat to the planet  Climate change is a global problem  and it must be addressed globally  through international treaties and agreements that include India and China   But we must lead  not be dragged along        Leadership requires the vision and the will to finance that vision   Federal support for technology development     across a wide spectrum of vehicle technologies     with a minimum of federal mandates  can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions which are the product of our fossil fuel consumption   It will take willpower and resources  but the resources would be a fraction of the cost of the Iraq war   And the environmental future of our planet requires us to exercise that willpower and invest the resources      A National Decision    This new Apollo program will require new ways of thinking about manufacturing and new leadership from the federal government   Achieving this vision and financing it will require us to come together as a people to agree on this course and to accept this challenge because it is time to write a new chapter in American history          The United States began as an experiment in self government and religious liberty  and that founding in freedom inspired the world  We then pushed west and built railroads across a continent   We overcame a great depression  won two world wars  and put a man on the moon          Now  we need to do the work that has fallen to this generation   Three streams     our economy  our security  and our environment     are converging into one great river     one clear new direction for our country   Earlier generations of Americans would have set out to harness that river  and we should too          A new Apollo program to produce advanced automotive technologies  renewable non polluting energy sources  and energy independence is our opportunity and our responsibility   It should also be our legacy to the next generation of Americans
