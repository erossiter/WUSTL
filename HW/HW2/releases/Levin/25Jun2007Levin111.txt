                                                                                                                                                          Finds Hedge Fund Amaranth Distorted Prices Last Summer      WASHINGTON     On Monday  Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  and Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn    Ranking Minority Member  will hold a hearing and release a 130 page report entitled  Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market  examining how trading by a single hedge fund  Amaranth LLC  led to high prices and extreme price volatility in the U S  natural gas market in 2006           In 2006  excessive speculation by a single large hedge fund  Amaranth Advisors  altered natural gas prices  caused wild price swings  and socked consumers with high prices     said Levin      It   s one thing when speculators gamble with their own money  it   s another when they turn U S  energy markets into a lottery where everybody is forced to gamble with them  betting on prices driven by aggressive trading practices   Current commodity laws are riddled with exemptions  exclusions  and limitations that make it virtually impossible for regulators to police U S  energy markets  particularly the Enron loophole which means regulators can apply excessive speculation limits to regulated markets like NYMEX  but not unregulated markets like ICE      Levin added     We need to put the cop back on the beat in all U S  energy markets with stronger tools to stop price manipulation  excessive speculation  and trading abuses               This Report represents the culmination of the Subcommittee   s extensive bipartisan investigation into the impact of speculative trading on U S  energy markets     said Coleman      We agree on the need to protect the integrity of our markets and I join with Senator Levin in making several bipartisan recommendations to do just that   The ongoing shift of energy trading to unregulated  over the counter electronic exchanges undermines the CFTC   s ability to monitor and prevent excessive speculation and price manipulation   Having said that  we must ensure that any proposed cure is not worse than the disease   The implementation of these recommendations must be clearly defined and targeted to preserve the integrity of our energy markets   If we extend CFTC oversight and regulation to electronic  over the counter exchanges  we must avoid unintended consequences     namely  we cannot drive traders to the far less transparent and unregulated markets             A nine month bipartisan Subcommittee investigation examined millions of trading records from the New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX  and the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  to track and analyze natural gas prices during 2006   The Subcommittee report found that  from early 2006 until its September 2006 collapse  Amaranth dominated trading in the U S  natural gas market  buying thousands of contracts for future delivery of natural gas on a daily basis   At some points in 2006  Amaranth held 100 000 natural gas contracts in a single month  and held 40  or more of the outstanding contracts on NYMEX for 2006         Amaranth traded natural gas contracts on both NYMEX and ICE  the two main U S  energy exchanges   NYMEX is fully regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC   but ICE is exempt from regulation under the so called Enron loophole that exempts from CFTC oversight electronic energy exchanges used by large traders   Trading data analyzed by the Subcommittee proves that both exchanges affect energy prices  that prices on one exchange affect prices on the other  and that traders treat NYMEX futures contracts as equivalent to ICE swaps for purposes of risk management and profit taking   The key difference between the two exchanges is that one is regulated and the other is not       Because Amaranth traded extensively on ICE  which operates outside CFTC authority  neither the CFTC nor NYMEX had complete information about its natural gas holdings or trades   NYMEX was forced to make significant regulatory decisions on Amaranth   s trading based upon incomplete information        In August 2006  NYMEX told Amaranth to reduce its positions in certain NYMEX natural gas contracts   In response  Amaranth reduced its NYMEX holdings  but increased its holdings on ICE  where there are no trading limits   Amaranth   s actions demonstrate the inability of NYMEX and the CFTC to stop excessive speculation in energy while energy trades can occur on ICE without limit        To stop price manipulation and excessive speculation  the report recommends that Congress close the Enron loophole  which would enable the CFTC police both markets   It recommends that the CFTC strengthen its policies to stop excessive speculation   It also recommends that Congress provide increased CFTC funding and authorize the CFTC to collect user fees from commodity markets to help pay the expense       The Subcommittee has scheduled two days of hearings   The first day  on Monday  June 25th at 11 00 a m  in Room 106 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building  will hear from natural gas consumers  academics  and Amaranth   The second day  on Monday  July 9th at 2 00 p m   in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building  will feature the CFTC  NYMEX  and ICE      Report     PDF
