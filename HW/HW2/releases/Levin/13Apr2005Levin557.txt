                                                                                                                                                                     WASHINGTON     With U S  waters facing increasing threats from aquatic invasive species  Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   and Susan Collins  R Maine  introduced legislation today to prevent these harmful species from damaging U S  aquatic ecosystems and natural resources            The serious problem of aquatic invasive species costs the American public billions of dollars a year     said Levin      In particular  invasive species threaten the health of the Great Lakes  one of our most magnificent and important natural resources   This bill provides crucial protection for the Great Lakes and our nation   s waterways from these harmful organisms                As a Great Lakes senator  I feel a special responsibility to protect these great national treasures  which are the source of clean drinking water for more than 30 million people in the region and are vital to Michigan   s economy     Stabenow said     This bill provides the necessary resources we need to stop invasive species from entering and damaging the Great Lakes              The proposal  the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005  will reauthorize and strengthen the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 to protect U S  waters by preventing new introductions of aquatic invasive species   This legislation contains provisions to   regulate ballast discharge from commercial vessels  prevent invasive species introductions from other pathways  support state management plans  screen live aquatic organisms entering the United States for the first time in trade  authorize rapid response funds  create education and outreach programs  conduct research on invasion pathways  and prevention and control technologies  authorize funds for state and regional grants  and strengthen specific prevention efforts in the Great Lakes       Aquatic invasive species threaten biodiversity nationwide  especially in the Great Lakes    The leading pathway for these aquatic invaders is maritime commerce   In the late 1980s  zebra mussels were released in the Great Lakes after crossing the Atlantic Ocean in the ballast tanks of ships from the Mediterranean   Zebra mussels created such a problem for the Great Lakes that Congress passed legislation in 1990 and 1996 requiring ballast water management for ships entering the Great Lakes  which has reduced  but not eliminated  the threat of new aquatic invasions         Invasive species are also an economic drain   Estimates of the annual economic damage caused nationwide by invasive species range as high as  137 billion   Because the Great Lakes fisheries are valued at  4 billion annually  preventing invasions into the Great Lakes from ballast water  hulls or the system of canals connecting the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and Atlantic Ocean is critical   Once an exotic species establishes itself  it is almost impossible to eradicate and usually difficult to prevent from moving throughout the nation            As the old adage goes     An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure        Levin said      This legislation is that ounce of prevention that is crucial to controlling invasive species in our waterways before it   s too late          In the House  Reps  Wayne Gilchrest  R Maryland  Vern Ehlers  R Mich   Mark Kirk  R Ill   Peter DeFazio  D Ore   and Earl Blumenaur  D Ore   are introducing complementary legislation today as part of a coordinated bipartisan  bicameral effort to address the threat from aquatic invasive species        The other senate cosponsors are Senators Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii  Evan Bayh  D Ind   Mark Dayton  D Minn   Mike DeWine  R Ohio  Jim Jeffords  I Vt   Ted Kennedy  D Mass   Frank Lautenberg  D N J   Pat Leahy  D Vt   Jack Reed  D R I   and John Warner  R Va       Levin is co chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force and Collins is co chair of the Northeast Midwest Senate Coalition    Ehlers is co chair of the House Great Lakes Task Force and Gilchrest is co chair of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Task Force        An outline of the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 follows   The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act  NAISA  of 2005   U S  waters face increasing threats from aquatic invasive species   The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act  NAISA  will prevent these harmful invasive species from damaging the U S  aquatic ecosystems and natural resources by      Reducing invasive species introductions from ships by    Establishing a mandatory ballast water management program for the whole United States      Requiring ships to have an Invasive Species Management Plan which outlines ways to minimize transfers on a    whole ship    basis      Creating a ballast water treatment technology certification program      Including incentives for ship owners to install experimental ballast treatment technology    Preventing invasive species introductions from other pathways by    Identifying and managing pathways that pose the highest risk of introducing invasive species     Creating a screening process for planned importations of live aquatic organisms    Supporting development and implementation of State Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plans  including early detection  screening and rapid response activities at state and regional levels     Conducting ecological surveys for early detection of invasive species and analysis of invasion rates and patterns     Making available federal funding and resources for rapid response to introductions of invasive species     Preventing interbasin transfer of organisms by increasing funding and resources for dispersal barrier projects and research     Establishing environmental soundness criteria to ensure all prevention and control measures enacted do not further harm the environment     Creating education and outreach programs to inform the public on preventing transfers of invasive species by proper cleaning of recreational boats  and proper disposal of non native organisms for home aquaria      Conducting research on high risk invasion pathways and alternative prevention and control technologies     Making available  170 million in federal funds for aquatic invasive species prevention  control  and research      Strengthening the Great Lakes program by improving the dispersal barrier in the Chicago Ship   Sanitary Canal  requiring the Coast Guard to review the existing ballast management program  and authorizing the International Joint Commission to analyze the prevention efforts in the Great Lakes  and requiring ships entering the system to comply with the mandatory water management programs
