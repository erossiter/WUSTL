access   to riverfront and expand wildlife refuge on Grosse Ile      WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   announced that the National Defense Authorization Act  which the Senate approved by a vote of 92 3 late yesterday  includes a provision to assist efforts in the City of Detroit to advance a waterfront walk along the Detroit River and another provision to clean up a former missile site on Grosse Ile so that it can be incorporated into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge   Both amendments were approved by the Senate by unanimous consent          The Detroit River has always been home to rich  diverse fish and wildlife  but pollution and development have taken their toll on the waterfront     Levin said      This is a river we need to protect   We   re always looking for ways to conserve the land  both for ecological preservation and also to improve public access to the water   These two provisions will help with those efforts         Grosse Ile Land Transfer    This Levin amendment would transfer a former missile site on the southern tip of Grosse Ile from the EPA to the Department of the Interior for inclusion in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge   The provision also requires the Department of Defense to carry out environmental cleanup activities at the property   The land being transferred sits in what is known locally as the  conservation crescent  of the Detroit River and holds great potential for restoration of fish and wildlife habitat   Congressman John Dingell  D Dearborn  has authored a similar provision in the House of Representatives       The property covered by this amendment was a NIKE Missile site from 1955 1963   In 1955  the US Army installed a NIKE AJAX guided missile base and underground missile silos on Gross Ile to guard against the threat of Soviet long range bombers crossing the Arctic and Canada  In 1963  the NIKE AJAX base was declared obsolete and decommissioned  In 1970  the property was transferred from the control of the Department of Defense  DoD  to the EPA  In the early 1990 s  the DoD demolished most of the structures on the property   The land being transferred currently has about 6 8 acres with concentrations of arsenic and lead that exceed ecological risk thresholds         In August 2007  the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service completed a survey of the property and determined that remediation was required before the land could be usable for fish and wildlife habitat  The Department of Defense  through the Army Corps of Engineers  continues to have primary responsibility for clean up and remediation of the property       The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is one of 540 refuges managed by the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service   It is approximately 48 miles long and is located along the Detroit River and the western shore of Lake Erie from the City of Detroit to the Michigan Ohio border   It was established by a 2001 bill sponsored by Congressman John Dingell in the House of Representatives and Sens  Levin and Debbie Stabenow in the Senate      Detroit Riverfront Land Transfer    This provision  authored by Senator Levin  would authorize a land exchange between the City of Detroit and the U S  Coast Guard along the Detroit River waterfront  The land exchange will allow the Coast Guard to enhance their operations and facilities and enable the City of Detroit to connect two segments of the riverfront walk       The waterfront property currently owned by the Coast Guard     1 26 acres located at 2660 Atwater Street     will be incorporated into the city   s riverfront revitalization project   Once the city acquires the property from the Coast Guard  it will be turned over to the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy for a 99 year lease   The city   s  74 acre parcel  located at 119 Mount Elliott Street approximately a mile away from the Coast Guard property  is a vacant lot behind the current Coast Guard station   The Coast Guard plans to use the land for a parking lot and to expand their boat maintenance facility       The Detroit Riverfront Conservancy seeks to establish a five mile walkway along the Detroit Riverfront  spanning from the Ambassador Bridge to beyond the MacArthur Bridge at Belle Isle   For over 30 years  Levin has been deeply involved in the effort and has helped to secure funding  facilitate and negotiate agreements  and assist with planning   More information on the effort can be found
