                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   received the World Affairs Council   s Global Service Award last night   In announcing the award  Council Chairman Hon  Franklin Kramer said that Levin was selected    for his principled leadership throughout his career in public service and for his ongoing efforts to improve international understanding          Following are Levin   s remarks to the council    Thank you  Katherine Van Hollen  for that kind introduction   It is a privilege to be with the World Affairs Council as you focus on education tonight   By bringing international affairs into the lives of young Americans and by continuing to educate and engage Americans of all ages  you strengthen our democracy       I want to thank you all for this Global Service Award   Last year  you made a wonderful choice by recognizing the men and women of our armed forces  and I am humbled to be in their company in this manner   One of the most rewarding parts of my work as the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee is spending time with our troops   Our nation is divided on war policies but we are united in support of our troops   They deserve the finest training  equipment  family support  and medical care we can provide   They also deserve wise policies that honor their sacrifice       We are seeing today in Iraq that there are limits to what even the very best military can accomplish   I have argued for a long time that there needs to be a political solution among the Iraqi leaders and that the best leverage we have with those leaders is to end our open ended military commitment which allows the Iraqi leaders to fiddle while Baghdad burns   Beginning a phased reduction of American troops in four months would hopefully put adequate pressure on Iraqi leaders to reach a political settlement  which is the only hope of ending the civil war and maximizing the chances for success in Iraq   Even Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki has acknowledged     The crisis is political  and the ones who can stop the cycle of   bloodletting of innocents are the  Iraqi  politicians          America   s security requires that we use our full strength as a nation  not just our military might   So tonight  I   d like to focus on some other sources of power     the power of our ideals and values  the loss to our security when we violate those ideals and values  and the power for good which would be unleashed if we regain our standing in the world   I also want to discuss one particular issue which is undermining our security in a way no military can make up for     the abusive treatment of detainees under American control       The hard truth is that we need allies   We need allies to confront the radical leaders of Iran   We need allies to deal with the threat from North Korea   And most importantly  we need allies to defeat the threat from religious fanatics who despise modernity and the West and who use terror as their weapon       Although we wouldn   t hesitate to use force unilaterally if we face an imminent threat  harnessing the power of international institutions  such as the United Nations and NATO  is important to our security   Meeting the threats we face     including international terrorism  rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction  and failed states among others     requires cooperation among like minded nations and compromises with nations we don   t like at all       Today  the struggle against extremism is being undermined by how America is viewed by the world   Because of the unilateral and reckless policies of this Administration and the dramatic and vivid reports of our abusing prisoners  America   s standing in the world has taken a nosedive since the world embraced us after 9 11   In a 2007 international BBC poll  only 29 percent of people around the world said the United States is a generally positive influence in the world       That number should be setting off alarm bells in Washington because we need the goodwill of the world for our own security   That   s not some mushy headed intellectual musing   It is hard headed pragmatism   We need that goodwill to deal with the greatest threat we face     terrorism    Information is the key to preventing terrorist attacks   One person halfway around the world overhearing a terrorist plotting an attack could prevent the mass murder of our citizens if that citizen will report it   He   s less likely to do so if he views us as an arrogant bully         Last week  I visited with our veterans at a Michigan VA hospital   I stopped and asked one veteran who was lying in his bed  What can we do to help you   And do you know what he said     Win back the respect of people around the world for America      That veteran understands that the erosion of support for America weakens us in a way that military force can not remedy       While the tarnishing of America   s image is partly the result of the decision to go to war with Iraq and the way it has been conducted  the problem goes much deeper   As Steven Kull  the director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes  stated     The thing that comes up repeatedly is not just anger about Iraq   The common theme is hypocrisy   The reaction tends to be     You were a champion of a certain set of rules   Now you are breaking your own rules          America at its best is a beacon for human rights and human liberty  and that   s how we like to see ourselves   But much of the world sees us in a very different way when we fail to live up to the standards we profess   To much of the world  the symbol of American values is no longer the Statue of Liberty  it is that horrific photograph of a hooded prisoner at Abu Ghraib  standing on a box  strung up with wires         In 2002  the Administration decided to permit the use of aggressive  indeed abusive  interrogation techniques that had previously been considered inconsistent with our laws  our international commitments  and our shared American values   On August 1  2002  the Department of Justice   s Office of Legal Counsel issued what   s now known as the    torture memo     which stated that for physical pain to amount to torture it    must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury  such as organ failure  impairment of bodily function  or even death          That in turn led to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorizing military interrogators to keep detainees naked  deprive them of light and auditory stimuli  place them in so called    stress positions     and exploit their fears  such as a fear of dogs   Although the Rumsfeld authorization was later rescinded  the President himself has acknowledged that the United States maintained secret prisons outside the purview of international monitoring  and he has made public reference to    an alternative set of procedures    used by the CIA to interrogate prisoners in the secret program  which he characterized as    tough          And just in the last Congress  the Administration successfully persuaded a majority of my colleagues to   narrow the accepted definitions of    cruel and inhuman treatment      authorize the Administration to unilaterally redefine its obligations under the Geneva Conventions    allow the use of hearsay and coerced testimony in criminal trials of detainees    insulate senior administration officials from accountability for detainee abuses   bar detainees from ever bringing any legal action challenging any aspect of their detention  and  prohibit the courts from providing legal relief for detainees who are found to be improperly held     In pursuing aggressive tactics  the Administration overruled the objections of the top military JAG officers about detainee treatment   It fought the Supreme Court   s ruling in the Hamdan case  which declared that the Administration   s military commissions at Guantanamo Bay  violate both the  Uniform Code of Military Justice  and the four Geneva Conventions    And it opposed and successfully derailed the original  bipartisan version of the Military Commissions Act drafted by the Senate Armed Services Committee  which met the Supreme Court   s standard in Hamdan and the Geneva Conventions    requirements for trials       For America   s standing to be restored we must adopt policies and procedures that reflect our values and international law   We must also insist on some accountability for abuses that have occurred   The standards for humane treatment in the revised Army Field Manual are a good first step  but they are not enough   Some of the legislation of the last two years  and the regulations written to implement that legislation  fail to provide a fair process for detainees   For example  a person can be detained for life as an enemy combatant without ever having had a lawyer or knowing what the evidence was against him  since that evidence can be totally classified       We also need to get to the bottom of what went wrong at Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo and elsewhere   The investigations to date of detainee abuse have left significant gaps   For instance  there has been inadequate accountability for the authorization by senior officials  both military and civilian  of inappropriate interrogation and detention techniques   As Chairman  one of my first actions was to create a new investigative staff at the Armed Services Committee  and that staff is building on my work in the last Congress to fill in the missing pieces of the detainee abuse story   The new Secretary of Defense has pledged that the Department will cooperate in this investigation       As part of the Committee   s oversight on detainee issues  I traveled recently to Guantanamo with Senator Lindsey Graham to observe the hearing to determine the status of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad  known as    KSM         to determine  in other words  if KSM is an enemy combatant   We viewed the proceeding on closed circuit television from an adjoining room       In the course of the proceeding  a personal representative for KSM     not a lawyer     read a statement on KSM   s behalf  acknowledging  indeed proclaiming  his leadership in planning the 9 11 attacks and many other terrorist activities   KSM was asked by the tribunal president if this statement was accurate  and he replied in English that it was   It was clear that KSM wanted to record for history his part in a war of terror he has unabashedly waged        KSM also presented a written statement alleging he was mistreated during his captivity by the CIA in the years prior to his arrival at Guantanamo   Unlike KSM   s confession  this statement was immediately classified and has not been released to the public or  as of now  to any of us       It   s hard to care about due process for someone like KSM   But  as Senator Graham has said  it   s not about him   It   s about us   Senator Graham and I issued a statement on our return which committed us to review the hearing process and to explore possible ways to improve it through Congressional action       There are many reasons not to tolerate torture     it   s morally wrong  it produces unreliable information  it violates domestic and international law  and it jeopardizes our own troops if they are captured   But there   s also this  people are less likely to believe that a confession was freely given if there have been abuses of detainees   Even with an admitted terrorist like Khalid Sheikh Mohammad  I   m afraid the world will focus too much on how we treated him  not what  by his own words  he did to us   It is essential for our security that we and the world focus on understanding what KSM did  what he would do if released  what motivates the KSMs of the world  and what methods and capabilities they have and use   That focus gets blurred when serious allegations of torture get thrown into the mix       America can be     and must always strive to be    the    shining city on a hill    that President Ronald Reagan described   But the sheen is gone in the eyes of much of the world   By understanding the credibility that comes to our actions when we work through international organizations and alliances and by returning to our highest ideals  we can regain that luster   We can     as that veteran in the VA hospital in Michigan urged me        Win back the respect of people around the world for America     and that is something we must do for the sake of the security of our nation         Thank you
