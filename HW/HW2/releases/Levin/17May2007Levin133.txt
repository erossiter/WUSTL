                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON    Michigan Democrats today laid out a comprehensive agenda to revitalize our domestic manufacturing industry and respond to the loss of millions of U S  manufacturing jobs   Their  would bring together government  private industry  and academia in a robust partnership aimed at turning around the manufacturing sector of the U S  economy       The Michigan Democrats     including Governor Jennifer M  Granholm  Sen  Carl Levin  Rep  John Dingell  Sen  Debbie Stabenow  Rep  John Conyers  Rep  Dale Kildee  Rep  Sander Levin  Rep  Bart Stupak  and Rep  Carolyn Kilpatrick    said that they will push to enact the provisions into law  and they will also press presidential candidates of both parties to take a position on the AMI          We are determined to get manufacturing issues into the presidential campaign     the Michigan Democrats said      No other country stands by and watches its manufacturing sector decline   Other governments aggressively provide tax incentives  research and development grants  and health insurance   The Bush administration does none of these and even tolerates other countries manipulating their currency to subsidize their exports and placing barriers to our products entering their countries          The American Manufacturing Initiative focuses on six areas   manufacturing incentives   trade policies  including currency manipulation and barriers to U S  products   health care support    advanced vehicle development    fuel conservation and biofuels  and   Department of Defense initiatives      Through major government investment in the development of advanced technology vehicles and vigorous promotion of the use of alternative fuels  the AMI would stimulate manufacturing job creation in America  increase our security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil  and help our environment by reducing greenhouse gases and emissions      Governor Granholm     Michigan   s workers and employers need fast action on the AMI to ensure our success in the global economy   The American Manufacturing Initiative sets the federal government in motion to help rejuvenate manufacturing throughout the Great Lakes states and across the nation   After years of damaging and neglectful federal manufacturing policies  our leaders in Washington have positioned themselves to fight back with a prescription for relief  including federal automotive and fuel technology incentives  health care cost relief  and better policing of foreign trade practices         Senator Levin    We   ve lost three million manufacturing jobs in America in the last six years and this administration has done nothing to match what other governments do to promote manufacturing   That neglect must end   Our manufacturers aren   t competing with companies abroad  they are competing with countries that aggressively support their manufacturers   We need to do the same          Rep  Dingell   Manufacturers are hurting in large part due to this Administration   s lax attitude toward unfair trade practices  currency manipulation  spiraling health care costs  and pension insecurity   A plan to expand our manufacturing capacity is long overdue        Sen  Stabenow     America needs a comprehensive manufacturing policy that strengthens our economy and creates good jobs here at home  We need to make a real investment in education and innovation  take the skyrocketing cost of health care off the back of business  and insist that foreign competitors play by the same rules as our manufacturers   On a level playing field American manufacturers can compete with anyone and win   This isn   t just an economic issue  this is a fight for our way of life  and we must stand up for American jobs  American businesses and America   s working families         Rep  Levin    From health care  tax policy and especially international trade policy  the federal government must be a more active partner in addressing the national manufacturing jobs crisis   Michigan businesses and workers can compete in the global marketplace if the playing field is level and trading rules are enforced        Domestic manufacturers are at a huge competitive disadvantage compared to foreign governments   They have billions in legacy costs    health care costs assumed by U S  automakers add about  1 000 to the cost of each American car sold in this country   And they face the manipulation of currency exchange by foreign governments  which subsidize their competitors    exports  as well as trade barriers blocking our products   For example  Japan   s aggressive currency manipulation results in Japanese cars being sold for  3 000  10 000 cheaper than they otherwise would     essentially a Japanese government subsidy   Likewise  American exports to Japan essentially face a    tax    of that amount       The Michigan Democrats argue that our government needs to create a level playing field for our manufacturers as aggressively as the actions of governments of our trading partners
