Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Medicaid Providers that Cheat on Their Taxes and What Should be Done About It                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Today   s hearing is the fifth in a series before this Subcommittee on federal contractors who get paid with taxpayer dollars but fail to pay their taxes   Prior hearings have exposed as tax delinquents over 100 000 defense and civilian contractors and Medicare service providers who collectively owe billions in unpaid taxes   The spotlight today is on the Medicaid program  in particular on the doctors  nursing homes  and other medical providers who get paid taxpayer dollars through Medicaid  but have failed to meet their tax obligations   A review of just seven states has identified nearly 30 000 Medicaid providers who collectively owe delinquent taxes that date as far back as ten years and which collectively exceed  1 billion   Most of these unpaid taxes consist of payroll taxes that the Medicaid providers withheld from their employees    paychecks but didn   t remit to the federal government  which is a crime        Medicaid is a key federal program that helps fund health care for America   s poor   The vast majority of physicians and companies who participate in the Medicaid program are true public servants who deserve our admiration and gratitude   But a small portion of Medicaid providers are benefiting from the program  while taking advantage of honest taxpayers   These Medicaid providers are putting taxpayer dollars in their pocket with one hand  while using the other to stiff Uncle Sam by not paying their taxes          Federal programs exist to stop this type of abuse   One key program is the Federal Payment Levy Program  which was established about ten years ago to enable the federal government to identify federal payments being made to tax delinquents  and authorize the withholding of a portion of those payments to apply to the person   s tax debt         When this series of hearings began in 2004  the tax levy program was weighed down by bureaucratic requirements and endless red tape   In response to the Subcommittee   s request  the key federal agencies  including the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   the Financial Management Service  FMS  at Treasury  and others  formed a government wide task force to streamline the tax levy program   That task force took on many of the problems that have been identified in this series of hearings        As a result  the tax levy program has taken on new life   It has moved from covering 10  to all of the payment systems at the Department of Defense   It has doubled the number of check screenings per week   It has laid plans to add the  400 billion in Medicare payments to the federal payments being screened for tax delinquents   And tax levy collections from federal contractors have more than doubled from about  20 million in FY 2004 to over  47 million this last fiscal year          That   s the good news   The not so good news is that there is still a long way to go    Last year  the tax levy program collected a total of about  343 million in unpaid taxes from all types of federal payments  only  47 million  or less than 15 percent  came from federal contract payments   In light of the billions of dollars in unpaid taxes owed by federal contractors   47 million is still far  far too low   More needs to be done to cut the red tape hindering the tax levy program        The tax delinquents we are tackling today are the tax dodgers taking advantage of the Medicaid program   Last year  the Subcommittee asked the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to estimate the number of Medicaid providers with unpaid taxes   GAO examined records in seven states that together account for roughly 40  of the total Medicaid contract dollars spent by the federal government each year   In those seven states  by comparing Medicaid payment records to the IRS list of delinquent taxpayers  GAO was able to identify about 30 000 medical providers  about 5  of the total number of Medicaid providers in those states  with unpaid taxes of  1 billion         In addition  GAO identified 25 examples of blatant tax dodging  each of which involved a medical service provider who received at least  100 000 in Medicaid payments last year   GAO identified one physician  for example  who owes over  300 000 in unpaid federal taxes and claims    limited ability to pay taxes      Yet GAO was able to determine that this same physician owns residential property worth over  1 million dollars  received over  100 000 in Medicaid payments last year  and also received tens of thousands of dollars in Medicare payments         In another instance  GAO identified a nursing home that owes approximately  2 million in back taxes  but received 2006 Medicaid payments totaling about  6 million   The same nursing home has also been cited by the state for jeopardizing the health and safety of its patients   A third example involves a dentist who received  200 000 in Medicaid payments last year but who hasn   t made any federal tax payments in several years        GAO also determined that not a single Medicaid tax delinquent has had a single Medicaid payment screened under the tax levy program   When we asked why  we learned that the entire Medicaid program     all  185 billion paid by the federal government last year     is exempt from the tax levy program  because Medicaid payments are not considered    federal payments           The Medicaid program works like this   The key federal agency overseeing the Medicaid program is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  or CMS   But CMS does not pay Medicaid service providers directly   Instead  CMS issues large grants to the states  which actually run the Medicaid program on a day to day basis   It is the states  for example  which select the Medicaid service providers  establish the scope of services to be provided  set the rates  and make the actual payments   The amounts paid by the states to Medicaid providers include a mix of federal and state dollars   Typically  the state makes the payment to the Medicaid providers  and then seeks reimbursement for part of the cost from the federal government         Right now  the tax levy program is authorized to withhold funds only from    federal payments      There is no provision in the law for tax levies to be applied to payments that are a mix of federal and state dollars  which is what Medicaid payments are   The question we   d like to examine today is  in light of the tax dodging going on by providers who receive payments from the Medicaid program  could the tax levy law be amended to allow the federal government to attach a portion of Medicaid payments being made to tax delinquents   We   d also be interested in any other solution to the problem        I hope the agencies gathered here today  GAO  IRS  FMS and CMS  will lend us their expertise to help analyze the problem and identify possible solutions         The vast majority of Medicaid providers are law abiding citizens who pay their taxes on time   In too many cases  these honest and hardworking providers have to compete against a small number of Medicaid providers who gain a competitive edge by not paying or delaying payment on their taxes   It is long past time to find a way to withhold Medicaid payments from those providers who are shortchanging the very taxpayers who are supplying their paychecks and  thereby  forcing taxpayers who pay their taxes on time to shoulder the taxes they are shirking   We need to figure out how to enlist the tax levy program to stop this abuse          Senator Coleman got the ball rolling on these hearings into tax delinquent federal contractors  and we commend him for that   Our staffs have always worked closely together on this issue  and we thank them for their efforts as well
