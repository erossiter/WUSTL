and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  announced today that the Department of Defense plans to award six grants to the University of Michigan and Oakland University totaling  3 931 042  The funding will come as part of the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program  DURIP  and the Multi disciplinary University Research Initiative  MURI           Michigan has a proud tradition of supporting our nation   s military services  and with this funding the University of Michigan and Oakland University will continue to play an important role in critical defense research programs     said Levin     These investments in military technology  vehicle damage assessment systems and advanced replacement limbs help ensure that our armed forces remain the best equipped and most advanced in the world             Michigan   s Universities have a strong tradition of being on the cutting edge of innovation and research     said Stabenow      I am pleased that the University of Michigan and Oakland University are receiving the funding they need to continue their state of the art research and further solidify our state   s position as a leader in defense technologies          The DURIP program assists university researchers with defense related research by providing funding for critical  state of the art equipment   Expensive equipment needs are often difficult for researchers to fill under existing research contracts and grants   These awards are the result of a merit competition conducted by the Army Research Office  the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Office Scientific Research   The research offices received a total of 780 proposals  199 awards were made to 112 academic institutions       The MURI program supports multi disciplinary defense related research that intersects more than one traditional science and engineering field   By involving researchers working in varied disciplines  the MURI program seeks to accelerate both the pace of the research and the transition from results to practical applications   For the fiscal year 2007 competition  the Army  Navy and Air Force research offices solicited proposals in 29 topic areas and received a total of 129 proposals  36 projects were selected for funding by a panel of experts in the relevant science and engineering fields       Details on the awards are below   Each award is subject to the successful completion of negotiations between the research offices and the universities  the size of each award reflects the amount proposed      University of Michigan    2 700 000   Air Force Office of Scientific Research  MURI   Biologically Inspired  Anisotrophic Flexible Wing for Optimal Flapping Flight   This funding will support a five year project  in conjunction with the University of Florida  the University of Maryland College Park and the California Institute of Technology  that will use insights gained from biological flight to advance knowledge of micro air vehicles  MAVs   with an emphasis on the intrinsically unsteady environment due to wind gusts and the flapping motion  The objective is to develop the fundamental scientific foundation necessary to enable agile  autonomous MAV flight operation in an urban environment       U of M was also a member institution on another MURI award to study quantum simulations of condensed matter systems using ultra cold atomic gases      University of Michigan    258 720   Air Force Office of Scientific Research  DURIP   Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer for Structural Damage Assessment   This funding will support ongoing research to develop an advanced damage detection method for integrated vehicle health management systems   This method would be able to examine a vehicle structure   s    health    in near real time  inform the user about any incipient damage  and provide an estimate of the remaining useful life of the structure      University of Michigan    304 222   Air Force Office of Scientific Research  DURIP   Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy  CRDS  Diagnostic for Hall Thruster Erosion Analysis   This funding will support cavity ring down spectroscopy  CRDS   an ultra sensitive laser based absorption technique that may be used to measure the degradation  and useable life  of Closed Drift Hall Thrusters  used in spacecraft propulsion for the United States Air Force       University of Michigan    242 100   Army Research Office  DURIP   Metal Semiconductor Nanocomposites for Negative Index Metamaterials   This funding will support the development of novel nanocomposite materials that can bend light waves  backwards     i e   in the opposite direction of substances found in nature   Possible applications include perfect lenses which can be tailored to operate in the radio frequency to the visible range      University of Michigan    136 000   Army Research Office  DURIP   Low Voltage Electron Microscope   This funding will support a low voltage electron microscope  which will be used to image nano structured conducting polymers that interface electronic biomedical devices with living tissue   The long term goal is to create fully bionic limbs that can restore function to individuals who have lost their arms due to trauma or disease      Oakland University    290 000   Office of Naval Research  DURIP   Vector Network Analyzer for Studies of Tunable Millimeter Wave Devices   This funding will be used to purchase a vector network analyzer for the frequency range 10 kHz   330 GHz  which is necessary for microwave and millimeter wave device research
