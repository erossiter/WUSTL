 D MI  and Carl Levin  D MI  announced today that the Senate has approved the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water appropriations bill  which contains millions in funding for initiatives to maintain  rehabilitate and restore Michigan waterways and coastlines and make improvements to municipal sewer and water infrastructure       The measure  one of 13 annual appropriations bills required to fund the federal government  has now been approved in separate versions by the House and Senate and heads to a conference committee to resolve differences between the two bills  The legislation also directs the Department of Energy to prepare a report with information critical to moving forward with the site selection for the Rare Isotope Accelerator          The harbor projects in this legislation are extremely important for recreational boating and commercial activity in Michigan  and the sea lamprey and Asian carp barriers are essential for our battle against invasive species     Stabenow said     In addition  the report of the Department of Energy on RIA could be of vital importance to Michigan  Locating this project in Michigan would mean almost  2 billion for Michigan   s economy over 20 years and 400 new jobs in the state              Michigan s waters will benefit greatly with the passage of this legislation     said Levin     The funding for these water related projects is vital to the Great Lakes environment and economy  Further  Michigan s alternative energy initiatives recommended by the appropriations committee may lead to technologies that will reduce the nation s dependence on imported energy supplies  and protect the environment         ARMY CORPS  General Investigation    150 000 for Detroit River Army Corps investigations   315 000 for Great
