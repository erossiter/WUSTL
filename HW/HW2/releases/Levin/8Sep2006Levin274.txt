  and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   today announced funding for many Michigan projects in the Senate version of the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  which the Senate passed unanimously last night            Michigan has a long and proud history of providing top notch defense research and high quality equipment for our nation   s military services     said Levin  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee      This defense bill invests in advanced military technology  energy development  robotics  and next generation automotive research   Investments such as these will ensure that our armed forces will continue to be the best equipped and best trained of any in the world             Michigan is a leader in defense technology  research and manufacturing  and our local businesses provide critical support for our men and women in uniform     said Stabenow     Michigan   s industries and workers have always been an important part of our national defense  and this funding will expand those capabilities and create new jobs in Michigan          The bill appropriates over  264 3 million for Army research on combat vehicle and automotive technologies   This research is performed and managed by the Army   s Tank Automotive Research  Development and Engineering Command  TARDEC  and its National Automotive Center  both located in Warren  Michigan        TARDEC is involved with the research  development  acquisition and sustainment of more critical Army materiel than any another Research  Development and Engineering Center  including over 3 000 fielded systems  46 vehicles in production and 14 vehicles in development   Through this work  TARDEC supports the members of our armed forces deployed in Iraq  Afghanistan  and around the globe and
