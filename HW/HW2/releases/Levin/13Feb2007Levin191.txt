                                                                                                                                                             Legislation has the support of leading energy utilities and associations      Washington  DC     U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Olympia Snowe  R Maine   Carl Levin  D Mich    and Maria Cantwell  D Wash   today joined with a bipartisan coalition to introduce legislation to increase transparency and oversight for the electronic over the counter trading of energy commodities  such as oil  natural gas  coal and electricity        Specifically  the bill would    Require U S  energy traders who electronically trade futures in the U S  to keep records and report large positions carried by their market participants in energy commodities for five years or longer  These are the same requirements that apply to traders that do business on the New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX        Energy commodities include  coal  crude oil  gasoline  heating oil  diesel fuel  electricity  propane  and natural gas      Require traders to provide such records to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  or the Justice Department upon request  the same reporting requirements for NYMEX traders       Require persons in the United States  who trade U S  energy commodities delivered in the U S  on foreign futures exchanges  to keep similar records and report large trades      The bill is also cosponsored by Senators Barbara Boxer  D Calif    Russ Feingold  D Wisc    Jeff Bingaman  D New Mex    Joe Lieberman  I Conn    Frank Lautenberg  D N J    and Barbara Mikulski  D Md            The integrity of the markets where futures of oil and natural gas are traded has never been more important     Senator Feinstein said     But we   ve learned the hard way from cases like Enron and Amaranth that the federal agency tasked with oversight in these markets     the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC     lacks the tools to detect and prevent manipulation and fraud  Meanwhile  consumers are forced to foot the bill while oil companies and traders only get richer  The time has come to require record keeping and an audit trail that will shine light on energy market trading             This legislation will restore transparency to electronic and foreign markets for U S  energy commodities and ensure the American people pay a fair  and not an artificially inflated price  for oil products     Senator Snowe said      The Senate should recognize that giving the Commodity Futures Trade Commission the authority it needs to identify and prevent speculation  manipulation  or even hoarding of crude oil markets is the right course of action we should act accordingly             I am pleased once again to co sponsor the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act which is aimed at putting the cop back on the beat in our energy markets   Speculation and trading on unregulated exchanges are fueling wild swings in energy prices that are harming U S  families  businesses  and the economy as a whole   With an impressive array of industrial  consumer  and natural gas utilities supporting this legislation  and the new leadership in Congress  the signs are good that this Congress will finally enact legislation to close the Enron loophole  increase market transparency  and strengthen federal oversight of energy pricing     Senator Levin said          Closing loopholes exploited by companies like Enron to keep their actions hidden and beyond the reach of federal regulators is key to preventing market manipulation in the future and ensuring fair energy prices for American families and businesses     said Senator Cantwell  a member of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committees      By requiring open books and transparent markets  we can catch patterns of irregular trading  stop dishonest energy traders  and avoid a repeat of the western energy crisis              This is important because of one word   Enron   Californians suffered during the electricity crisis because Enron was working in secret     operating in a market that was not transparent   This sort of crisis must not happen again   Thankfully this bill will provide the necessary government oversight     Senator Boxer said          I ve asked top federal regulators some tough questions about potential anomalies in natural gas pricing last year  but it will be hard to have much confidence in their conclusions if they remain blind to major segments of these energy markets     said Senator Bingaman  Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee      This legislation will restore some consistency to the existing patchwork of market transparency rules  so consumers and businesses alike can have more confidence they are paying energy prices free from manipulation             The last thing Americans need at the gas pump is runaway speculation further inflating fuel prices     said Senator Lieberman      This bill will help protect consumers who are already suffering at the hands of skyrocketing demand and industry over consolidation          The legislation has the support of the following organizations      Agricultural Retailers Association  Air Transport Association of America  American Public Gas Association  American Public Power Association  Consumer Federation of America  Consumers Union  Industrial Energy Consumers of America  National Association of Wheat Growers  National Barley Growers Association  New England Fuel Initiative  Pacific Northwest Oil Heat Council  Petroleum Transportation and Storage Association  Petroleum Marketers Association of America  PG Corporation  Sempra  Southern California Edison   Background   Prior to 2000  U S  energy futures were traded exclusively on regulated markets like NYMEX  where the CFTC polices the market for price manipulation or fraud  Since 2000  however  there has been a tremendous growth in the trading of oil and gas futures on unregulated  electronic markets         These electronic trades were exempted from CFTC oversight by a provision inserted at the behest of Enron and other large energy traders into the conference report on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000         The lack of oversight in these markets has resulted in billions of dollars of losses    During the Western Energy Crisis in 2000 2001  energy costs for California soared from roughly  8 billion in 1999 to  27 billion in 2000  and then  27 5 billion in 2001   In 2003  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  charged four energy companies     Enron Power Marketing  Enron Energy Services  Reliant Energy Services and BP Energy Company     of engaging in market manipulation      In September 2006  Amaranth Advisers  LLC announced that previously undisclosed speculation in natural gas trading had resulted in a loss of  6 billion  Among other clients who suffered massive setbacks  the collapse of the hedge fund reportedly cost the County of San Diego as much as  87 million in investments set aside for employee pensions     In January  the CFTC announced that the Intercontinental Exchange  or ICE  the largest electronic trading company  has agreed to voluntarily provide information on over the counter trades  The legislation introduced today by the Senators would ensure that this reporting process becomes law  and therefore is not subject to an administrative decision within an individual company
