Habeas Corpus Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Last week  Senator Kyl placed a statement in the Congressional Record regarding the Graham Levin amendment  which was enacted last year as Section 1405 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006  and as section 1005 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005  as included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act  2006    Senator Kyl and Senator Reid co sponsored the Graham Levin amendment in the Senate         Senator Kyl argues that this provision was intended to retroactively strip the federal courts  including the Supreme Court  of jurisdiction over pending cases   Senator Kyl   s statement attached a January 18  2006 letter from Senator Kyl and Senator Graham to Attorney General Gonzales  which makes the same argument         As I stated when the Graham Levin amendment was before the Senate and reiterated when the Senate adopted the conference report containing the legislation  this is not the case   The statute that we enacted does not retroactively strip the Supreme Court and other federal courts of cases over which they had already assumed jurisdiction at the time the statute was passed        I do not believe that the unexpressed intentions or after the fact statements of Senators     Senator Kyl  myself  or anyone else     can change the facts or the legislative history that existed at the time Congress acted on a piece of legislation   The relevant considerations are the language of the law itself  the changes that were made to that law as it went through the drafting process  and what was clearly stated before the bill was voted on by the Senate   I make this statement today for the sole purpose of reiterating that history        While section 1405 e  1  provides that    no court  justice  or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus     the applicability of this language to pending cases is addressed in a separate provision      section 1405 h      the structure and history of which make it clear that the courts are not stripped of cases over which they have already assumed jurisdiction          Section 1405 h  clearly provides that only one portion of the Act applies to pending cases   sections  e  2  and  e  3   which govern direct appeals from final decisions by military commissions and CSRTs   The rest of the statute becomes effective    on the date of enactment     which as Justice Scalia has pointed out     is presumed to mean    shall have prospective effect upon enactment        Landgraf v  USI Films  511 U S  244  288  1994   Scalia  J   concurring           Senator Kyl argues that the original Graham amendment was never    modified to carve out pending litigation       152 Cong  Rec  S970   He is incorrect   In fact  the amendment was modified  and it was modified for the precise purpose of carving out pending litigation        The original Graham amendment specified that all provisions   including the restrictions on habeas petitions   applied to pending cases   On November 10  2005  the original Graham amendment was debated and adopted by the Senate by a vote of 49 42   At that time  I objected to the Graham amendment   s provision stripping jurisdiction in pending cases   In fact  I explicitly urged that we not adopt this amendment  in part  because    It would eliminate the jurisdiction already accepted by the Supreme Court in Hamdan      151 Cong  Rec  S12 663 64           Because of my concerns  after the original Graham amendment was adopted  I began working on a revised version of the amendment  which became known as the Graham Levin amendment   This new version removed the language applying the habeas restrictions to pending cases  and instead limited its retroactive effect only to the standards applicable to direct appeals of final determinations that may have been made by CSRTs or military commissions          On November 14  2005  Senator Graham and I introduced this new version to the Senate together   In introducing the new Graham Levin amendment  Senator Graham did not specifically address the issue of the amendment   s effect on pending cases before yielding the floor to me   I did address the issue   In particular  I explained to the Senate that one of the principal reasons that so many of us voted against the prior version of the amendment was its effect on pending cases  and that this problem had been addressed in the Graham Levin amendment that was then before us   I stated            The other problem which I focused on last Thursday  November 10  with the first Graham amendment was that it would have stripped all the courts  including the Supreme Court  of jurisdiction over pending cases  What we have done in this amendment  we have said that the standards in the amendment will be applied in pending cases  but the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over those cases  For instance  the Supreme Court jurisdiction in Hamdan is not affected          I cosponsored the Graham amendment with Senator Graham because I believe it is a significant improvement over the provision which the Senate approved last Thursday          The direct review will provide for convictions by the military commissions  and because it would not strip courts of jurisdiction over these matters where they have taken jurisdiction  it does  again  apply the substantive law and assume that the courts would apply the substantive law if this amendment is agreed to   However  it does not strip the courts of jurisdiction          Id  at S12 755  emphasis added           Senator Graham took the floor again immediately after I concluded my explanation of what our new amendment accomplished   He did not disagree with my statement about the effect of the revised bill on pending cases anywhere in his remarks   Indeed  neither Senator Graham nor Senator Kyl said anything at that time to contest my very clear statement that the new amendment did not retroactively strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases         When the Senate approved the Graham Levin Amendment by a vote of 84 14 on November 15  2005  I explained again that our amendment would not strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases            The Graham Levin Kyl amendment would not apply the habeas prohibition in paragraph  1  to pending cases   So  although the amendment would change the substantive law applicable to pending cases  it would not strip the courts of jurisdiction to hear them   Under the Graham Levin Kyl amendment  the habeas prohibition would take effect on the date of enactment of the legislation   Thus  this prohibition would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment   The approach in this amendment preserves comity between the judiciary and legislative branches  It avoids repeating the unfortunate precedent in Ex parte McCardle  in which Congress intervened to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over a case which was pending before that Court         151 Cong  Rec  S12 802   Again  neither Senator Graham nor Senator Kyl offered a contrary interpretation of the Graham Levin amendment at that time        The bill then went to a House Senate conference   At this time  the inapplicability of the jurisdiction stripping provision to pending cases was so clear that the Administration   s allies in the House tried in vain to alter the language of the effective date provision to make the jurisdiction stripping provision apply retroactively to pending cases  as it had in the original Graham amendment   I objected to this language and it was rejected by the Senate conferees          I explained this history when the Senate adopted the conference report on December 21  2005            Under the Supreme Court   s ruling in Lindh v  Murphy  521 U S  320  the fact that Congress has chosen not to apply the habeas stripping provision to pending cases means that the courts retain jurisdiction to consider these appeals    Again  the Senate voted affirmatively to remove language from the original Graham amendment that would have applied this provision to pending cases   The conference report retains the same effective date as the Senate bill  thereby adopting the Senate position that this provision will not strip the courts of jurisdiction in pending cases              Let me be specific              The original Graham amendment approved by the Senate contained language stating that the habeas stripping provision    shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act      We objected to this language and it was not included in the Senate passed bill              An early draft of the Graham Levin Kyl amendment contained language stating that the habeas stripping provision    shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act  except that the Supreme Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of the removal  pursuant to such amendment  of its jurisdiction to hear any case in which certiorari has been granted as of such date      We objected to this language and it was not included in the Senate passed bill            A House proposal during the conference contained language stating that the habeas stripping provision    shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act      We objected to this language and it was not included in the conference report            Rather  the conference report states that the provision    shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act      These words have their ordinary meaning     that the provision is prospective in its application  and does not apply to pending cases   By taking this position  we preserve comity between the judicial and legislative branches and avoid repeating the unfortunate precedent in Ex parte McCardle  in which Congress intervened to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over a case which was pending before that Court           151 Cong  Rec  S14 258   As a result  the language sought by the Administration and its allies  which would have applied the jurisdiction stripping provision to pending cases  was not included in the final version of the bill        It was not until after we concluded the conference and the conference report passed the Senate on December 21  2005 that Senator Kyl placed a colloquy in the Congressional Record arguing that Section 1005 should be interpreted to retroactively strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases   At the same time  a number of other Senators placed statements in the Congressional Record stating their belief that the provision would not strip the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases          Those statements  coming as they did after the conclusion of the conference and final action on the bill in both the House and the Senate  carry no more weight as legislative history than the statement that Senator Kyl placed in the Congressional Record last week or any other after the fact statement in the Congressional Record   Both the contemporaneous legislative history and the language and structure of the Graham Levin amendment itself demonstrate that this provision was not intended to  and did not  retroactively strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over pending cases
