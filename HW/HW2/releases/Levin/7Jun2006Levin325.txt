China Economic and Security Review Commission Hearing on  Intellectual Property Rights Issues and Dangers of Counterfeited Goods  Imported Into the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                         Thank you for holding this hearing on intellectual property rights issues and the dangers of counterfeited goods imported into the United States   I appreciate the opportunity to testify on the issue of counterfeit auto parts  which is a growing problem with public health  safety as well as economic implications   Product counterfeiting is one of the U S  auto parts industry   s greatest concerns with China     along with currency manipulation and the ongoing U S   European Union and Canadian WTO case challenging China   s auto parts tariffs   So this morning   s hearing is both timely and critical        Today  I   d like to discuss the scope of the auto parts counterfeiting problem  why it matters  and how we can attack it effectively      Scope of the Problem    Product counterfeiting and piracy has long been associated with knock off watches and handbags   But counterfeiting has exploded in recent years across many industries to become a serious threat to the competitiveness of the U S  economy   One of the greatest assets of American businesses is their intellectual property  but when American innovations can quickly be stolen by competitors around the world the vitality of those businesses is at risk   The FBI estimates that counterfeiting costs U S  businesses  200 billion to  250 billion annually  and growing   Counterfeiting money is a serious crime and treated as such   Counterfeiting auto parts should be treated the same way          China is one of the worst piracy offenders  accounting for 70 percent of all imported counterfeit products seized by U S  Customs and Border Protection in 2003   It is estimated that counterfeits constitute an alarming 15 percent to 20 percent of all products made in China and account for about 8 percent of China   s total GDP          The U S  auto parts industry conservatively estimates it loses  12 billion in annually to counterfeit auto parts   9 billion outside the United States and  3 billion inside the U S   China is responsible for about 75 percent of those counterfeit auto parts  according to estimates by American automotive suppliers   The auto parts industry estimates millions of counterfeit auto parts enter the U S  every year and only a fraction of them are ever detected at the border by U S  enforcement officials         Virtually every automotive part has turned up in the counterfeit trade  including windshield glass  brake fluid  headlights  taillights  emissions components  structural parts  sheet metal parts  suspension parts  tires  belts  hoses  and alternators   The industry has found enough different fake parts being sold in U S  stores to construct an entire car          And the problem is now spreading beyond just auto parts   The theft of intellectual property in China has become so widespread and bold that recently an entire car was copied  manufactured and sold under a different name     sold not as a    Chevy    but a    Chery QQ      The counterfeiter even had plans to export the knock off to the United States        Why it Matters    Counterfeiting hurts U S  manufacturers and the unsuspecting public that buys fake parts in many ways   Here are a few of the biggest problems     Counterfeit and pirated automotive parts mean lost revenue and jobs in the United States   The FTC estimates that the auto industry could hire 250 000 additional American workers if the sale of counterfeit parts were eliminated   This is in an industry that has already suffered many layoffs and bankruptcies in recent years      American manufacturers have a difficult enough time to get a foothold in the Chinese market  if that market is permeated by counterfeit products American manufacturers should rightly be making  it is that much more difficult      Counterfeit parts hurt the legitimate producer   s brand name and reputation here and abroad because these products are substandard    The U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   has noticed connections between counterfeiting and organized crime  gang activity and terrorism   Because it is easier  more lucrative  and carries fewer penalties than drug smuggling  counterfeiting is becoming the activity of choice of criminal groups and even terrorists      Fake parts also undermine U S  safety standards and put customers at risk   For example  components such as brakes have been found that were made of compressed grass and wood       I brought some examples of counterfeit parts to show you how sophisticated counterfeiters have become in making fake products that look and feel identical to the originals           Here are connecting rods for a Ford car  one genuine and one counterfeit   These are steel structural parts that connect the front end of the car to the body   While the products may look identical  including the Ford logo cast into the fake product  the quality and strength of the steel in Ford   s product is much higher and the machining of the grooves  or    teeth    in the circular ring is much better   If those grooves wear down too quickly with use  the front end of the car could wobble and become unstable   This in turn will put stress on the arm  increasing wear  metal fatigue  and risking failure  in a collision or even normal use    In short  this is a safety related item  and the fake product presents a hazard to an unsuspecting driver        I also have a genuine Ford spark plug wire set and a counterfeit set   Again  although these parts and their packaging may look identical to the untrained eye  the counterfeit part uses substandard gauge wire  substandard insulation  and substandard connectors  which can lead to overheating and fire         With counterfeit auto parts  the concern goes way beyond the monetary losses like those suffered by a company when a handbag is copied or a high end watch counterfeited   When the connecting rod on your car is fake or your brakes are made of compressed grass and wood  your life and the lives of your loved ones are at risk      What to do about it    To date there has been a lack of willingness to initiate criminal cases against auto parts counterfeiters because it was not viewed as a serious enough problem by the Department of Justice   Ten thousand sets of counterfeit automobile brakes isn   t viewed the same way as a drug case but string the counterfeits together and it adds up to  12 billion lost to industry each year   The increasing risk to the health of our economy  loss of jobs  the safety of unsuspecting consumers makes changing that perception a vital national priority  The bottom line is that counterfeiting is a serious and growing crime  and the Justice Department should be doing more to fight it          To date industry knows of only one prosecution for auto parts counterfeiting   The Department of Justice told us they were unaware of any pending case        The WTO TRIPS Agreement China signed requires member countries to have an effective intellectual property rights  IPR  enforcement mechanism   China may have IPR laws that appear reasonable on the books  but it is not enforcing them   USTR warned China it was considering bringing a case in the WTO against China for failing to enforce its IPR laws  but nothing has materialized to date          USTR is a paper tiger  I   m afraid   On April 29  2005  the USTR placed China on the Special 301 Priority Watch List because of its failure to improve protections for U S  intellectual property rights there   Yet China continues to fail to do so   There China sits while our government dawdles   We need to stop merely putting China on lists and start taking more effective action  We need an enforcement office to pursue trade cases against countries that fail to meet commitments to reduce IPR infringement levels           Because of the lack of government leadership  the auto industry has had to do too much of the policing itself and at great expense   The automotive industry through its trade associations is working to educate its suppliers and distributors and to train employees purchasing parts on how to detect counterfeit products   U S  parts companies know they are on the front line          So to coordinate its efforts  the U S  auto parts industry created the Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy  CACP    CACP   s detection and Enforcement task force issued a report last fall on ways to improve detection and enforcement of counterfeiting and piracy   I want to mention four of their proposals that involve government action   The first is to deploy Intellectual Property Rights staff at foreign embassies   The second is for the government to share information about intellectual property violators so companies can avoid becoming victims of known offenders   The third is to address the needs of small and medium sized enterprises  which are particularly vulnerable   And the fourth is to raise standards at foreign trade shows   I urge the Commission take a serious look at these proposals and to encourage their implementation       I ask that the report and its recommendations be included in the hearing record        We need strong and fast prosecution of auto parts counterfeiters   If the government won   t act against currency manipulation by our trading partners as they should  if it won   t force open export markets for U S  products blocked by tariff and non tariff barriers and aggressively enforce U S  trade laws as they should  the least it can do is enforce our anti counterfeiting laws        Counterfeiting auto parts is a booming industry  and allowing it to continue unabated would have huge consequences for our country   Counterfeiting presents a grave threat to our automakers  auto parts makers  to our economy and also to the safety and security of all Americans   China is a particularly grave offender  and its violations must be addressed immediately  The U S  China Economic and Security Review Commission is uniquely positioned to give this issue the weight it deserves  and I hope you will do so   Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today
