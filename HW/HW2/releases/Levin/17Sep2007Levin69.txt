Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich    Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  today introduced legislation to help prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation that are leading to high energy prices for U S  consumers         The bill targets energy commodity markets that are currently exempt from government oversight under the    Enron loophole     a provision inserted at the behest of Enron and other large energy traders  without debate  into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000   The    Close the Enron Loophole Act    would subject those energy markets to Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  oversight to prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation          Right now  the Enron loophole makes it impossible for regulators to prevent major price distortions in U S  energy markets     said Levin      The result has been higher energy prices for millions of Americans   Stable and affordable energy prices are vital to our national and economic security     to heat and cool American homes  generate electricity for lighting  and power U S  manufacturing  agriculture  and transportation   We need to put the cop back on the beat in all U S  energy markets with effective tools to stop price manipulation  excessive speculation  and trading abuses   The legislation I am introducing today is critical to ensuring fair energy prices that reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand          Since 2001  the Subcommittee has investigated the vulnerability of U S  energy markets to price manipulation and excessive speculation   Earlier this year  the Subcommittee released a report     Excessive Speculation in the Natural Gas Market     which found that a single hedge fund named Amaranth dominated the U S  natural gas market during the spring and summer of 2006  and that its large scale trading significantly distorted natural gas prices from their fundamental values   The investigation examined millions of trading records from the New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX  and the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  to track and analyze natural gas trading in 2006   The report concluded that the current regulatory system was unable to prevent price distortions and excessive speculation  because much of Amaranth   s trading occurred on an unregulated market   The report recommended closing the Enron loophole to restore the CFTC   s ability to police all U S  energy markets        At a Subcommittee hearing in June 2007  the American Public Gas Association and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America testified that Amaranth   s trading activity increased hedging costs for natural gas purchasers  which ultimately led to increased costs for American industries and households   The Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia calculated that Amaranth   s excesses increased the cost of its winter gas purchases by  18 million            Amaranth   s massive trades turned the natural gas market into a giant electronic casino     Levin added     where all natural gas buyers and sellers were forced to bet either with or against Amaranth   American businesses and consumers were socked with higher prices for natural gas last winter as a result   We cannot afford to let large energy traders continue to play speculation and manipulation games with U S  energy prices and supplies   It   s way past time to close the Enron loophole and put the cop back on the beat in all U S  energy markets            A 2006 Subcommittee staff report entitled     The Role of Market Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices  A Need to Put the Cop Back on the Beat     also analyzed the extent to which increasing financial speculation in energy markets contributed to the steep rise in energy prices over the past few years  especially for crude oil   The report concluded    s peculation has contributed to rising U S  energy prices   and endorsed the estimate of various analysts that the influx of speculative investments into crude oil futures accounted for about  20 of the then prevailing crude oil price of  70 per barrel    Bill Summary   Key provisions of the Close the Enron Loophole Act would      Require energy trading facilities  ETFs  to register with the CFTC and comply with the same standards as apply to futures exchanges  like NYMEX  for trading futures contracts  except for standards governing retail trading since ETFs are restricted to large traders trading amongst themselves   ETFs would function as self regulatory organizations under CFTC oversight in the same manner as futures exchanges          Require ETFs to establish trading limits on traders  such as position limits or accountability levels  to prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation  subject to CFTC approval  in the same manner as futures exchanges   Position limits set a ceiling on the number of contracts that a trader can hold at one time on a trading facility  accountability levels  when exceeded  trigger a review by regulators of a trader   s holdings in order to prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation   The CFTC would ensure that position limits and accountability levels for similar contracts on different exchanges are on parity with each other and applied in a functionally equivalent manner   The CFTC would also ensure that a trader   s positions on multiple exchanges  when combined  are not excessive  and that trading limits are not circumvented through a trader   s use of an unregulated market        Require large trader reporting for domestic trades on foreign exchanges   Large trades of U S  energy commodities taking place from the United States on foreign exchanges would have to be reported to the CFTC   Traders would be relieved of this reporting requirement if the CFTC reached agreement with a foreign board of trade to obtain the same information        Define an    energy trading facility    as one that facilitates trading of contracts in an energy commodity  other than in the cash or spot market  between large traders     eligible commercial entities      and either provides for the clearing of those contracts or provides a price discovery function in the futures or cash market for that energy commodity   Clearing services  which are already subject to CFTC oversight  generally provide payment guarantees for trades   A trading facility performs a price discovery function when its prices become publicly known and affect the prices of subsequent transactions      Define    energy commodity    as a commodity which is used as a source of energy  including crude oil  gasoline  heating oil  diesel fuel  natural gas  and electricity  or results from the burning of fossil fuels  including carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide
