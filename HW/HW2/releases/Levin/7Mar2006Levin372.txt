                                                                                                                                                         Senators work to defeat new tax that will cost Michigan jobs      WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Carl Levin  D MI  today led the effort to defeat President Bush   s proposal to levy new tolls on commercial ships passing through the St  Lawrence Seaway   The proposed tolls would cost Great Lakes shippers an estimated  8 million in the first year alone  doubling to  16 million the following year  and increasing each year thereafter           In a bipartisan letter to the Senate Budget Committee  Stabenow  Levin and others expressed their strong concerns that the proposed tolls would result in the loss of jobs in Michigan   The proposed toll would make goods and raw materials shipped through the Great Lakes more expensive  deny Michigan farmers access to foreign markets and drive commercial shipping away from the Great Lakes          We should be doing everything we can to bring jobs to Michigan     Stabenow said      This new tax being proposed by the President would take us in the wrong direction   New tolls for shipping on the Great Lakes would hurt Michigan   s economy and should be rejected          The President s proposal would drive business and jobs out of our state at a time when Michigan is struggling to create more economic opportunity   Levin said    The tolls would unfairly target Great Lakes shippers as well as the countless Michigan businesses that depend on the St  Lawrence Seaway to ship their products        In their letter  Stabenow and Levin noted that shippers on the Great Lakes already pay a user fee to support the operation and maintenance of the St  Lawrence Seaway   Revenue from that tax is deposited into the Harbor Maritime Trust Fund  which now has a  3 billion surplus   The President   s proposed commercial toll would be an additional tax on the Great Lakes shipping industry     one that is not being proposed for shippers in any other region in the United States       In his budget last year  President Bush proposed commercial tolls for shipping on the St  Lawrence Seaway  but the new tolls were rejected by Congress   Stabenow and Levin called on the Senate Budget Committee to reject the proposed tax again this year       Full text of the letter is below            March 7  2006     The Honorable Judd Gregg     Chairman    Senate Budget Committee     624 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington   DC 20510      The Honorable Kent Conrad      Ranking Member     Senate Budget Committee      624 Dirksen Senate Office Building     Washington   DC 20510   Dear Mr  Chairman and Ranking Member  As Senators from the Great Lakes region  we are writing to urge you to reject a proposal in the Administration s Fiscal Year 2007 budget that calls for new commercial tolls on the United States section of the St  Lawrence Seaway   This same proposal was included in the Administration s Fiscal Year 2006 budget and rejected by Congress last year  We ask that it be rejected once again  The Great Lakes   St  Lawrence Seaway shipping system connects Great Lakes states with international markets and provides a cost effective means of export for both farmers and manufacturers from our region  An estimated  400 billion worth of cargo has moved through the Seaway in its 46 year history  This shipping system supports thousands of maritime related jobs including longshoremen  truckers  crane operators  warehousemen  shipyard workers  tug operators  vessel agents  and marine pilots   A commercial toll would act as a new tax on our shipping system  hurting the Great Lakes maritime economy and costing the region jobs  This toll is particularly troublesome since no similar tax or maritime user fee has been proposed for any other region of the country  It is also important to note that Great Lakes navigation system users are already paying a user fee to support the operation and maintenance of the St  Lawrence Seaway   The Harbor Maintenance Tax was enacted in 1986 for that specific purpose and is currently assessed at all Great Lakes and coastal ports  Revenue from the tax is deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund  which today carries a surplus balance of more than  3 billion  We appreciate the Committee s sensitivity to our concerns last year and we urge you to once again reject the Administration s toll proposal  Sincerely   Debbie Stabenow    Carl Levin    Mike DeWine  Richard Lugar  George Voinovich  Herb Kohl  Russ Feingold  Barack Obama  Mark Dayton
