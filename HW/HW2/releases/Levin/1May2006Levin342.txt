Levin  D Mich   outlined the need for a program on the scale of President John F  Kennedy   s historic Apollo program to respond to the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs  an issue that Levin called one of    the greatest challenges of our time              As we have seen firsthand in Michigan  our nation is hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs     Levin told the audience      To revitalize our manufacturing sector  we need to revitalize our auto industry  which has led before     as an engine of the economy and a driver of new technologies     and can do so again   We need our own moon shot     our own Apollo program     for this generation   a comprehensive initiative to produce  in the near term  a large number of vehicles that are capable of operating on alternative fuels and to create  in the long term  the leap ahead technologies that will boost our auto industry and help end our dependence on imported oil           In the last five years  America has lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs  and nearly 180 000 of those jobs have been in Michigan   The state has lost nearly one out of every three manufacturing jobs we had in 1999        Levin stressed that such a revitalization effort would require a partnership between industry  academia and government   He laid out some of the critical steps that would be required      We need to vastly increase the availability of flex fuel vehicles  which can run on either gasoline or an ethanol or biofuel blend  and increase the availability of the fuels themselves      We need to invest in partnerships with the auto industry to develop advanced technologies  including unlocking the enormous promise of hydrogen and fuel cells  advanced hybrids and clean diesels  advanced batteries  and other technologies        We need to change the tax code to provide domestic manufacturers with a refundable investment tax credit for re equipping or expanding existing plants to produce advanced technology vehicles or parts       Levin discussed the numerous ways in which our domestic manufacturers are at a huge competitive disadvantage     the billions in legacy costs  the manipulation of currency exchange by foreign governments  the trade barriers blocking our products to export markets without reciprocal restrictions     and argued that our government needs to create a level playing field for our manufacturers similar to the role played by the governments of our trading partners        To fund such a program  Levin argued  the government should end the tax avoidance schemes used by many U S  corporations and wealthy individuals  particularly those schemes that transfer hundreds of billions in income to shell companies in tax haven countries             We can make the investments in innovation and infrastructure I   ve called for today for about  15 billion over the next five years   And we can raise more than twice that much by ending tax avoidance schemes and collecting the taxes due     Levin told the Economic Club      How can we afford to embark on this new Apollo program   How can we afford not to           Levin told the audience that an Apollo type program would assist with two other immense challenges  as well         By investing in advanced flex fuel autos and ethanol  we would increase our security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil      By developing advanced vehicles and accompanying energy alternatives  we promote environmental security and the very survival of our planet         Three streams     our economy  our security  and our environment     are converging into one great river     one clear new direction for our country     Levin told the audience in closing      Earlier generations of Americans would have set out to harness that river  and we should too   A new Apollo program to produce advanced automotive technologies  renewable non polluting energy sources  and energy independence is our opportunity and our responsibility   It should also be our legacy to the next generation of Americans
