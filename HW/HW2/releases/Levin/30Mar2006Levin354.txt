America   s programs that secure the global supply chain  annual GDP cost of attack at ports could exceed  70 billion      Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Carl Levin  D MI  today held  the second of a two day Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  PSI  hearing to examine the threat of nuclear terrorism and assess various programs to secure  detect and interdict nuclear and radiological materials domestically and abroad   During the hearing  titled    Neutralizing the Nuclear and Radiological Threat  Securing the Global Supply Chain     the Subcommittee released a  assessing the state of global supply chain security  the projected cost analysis of an attack by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO    and offered recommendations based on their independent investigation of the issue   The Subcommittee outlined a number of troubling findings that reveal America   s vulnerability to the potential smuggling of nuclear or radioactive material across U S  borders           We are safer today than we were yesterday     said Coleman     But it is still not enough  My three year investigation into America   s programs that secure the global supply chain identified numerous weaknesses  It is clear we have many gaps in the systems   If we think that the terrorists are going to ignore our vulnerabilities and not find the kinks in our supply chain  we are mistaken   We must change our pre 9 11 mindset to fit a post 9 11 reality  We have the potential  When visiting Hong Kong in December  I witnessed a promising concept that demonstrates the potential to screen 100 percent of maritime containers with both an x ray and radiation detection equipment without impeding commerce   I urge DHS to make system must become a reality            While 24 million containers come into this country each year by ship  truck  and rail  the vast majority of these containers are never inspected  and the challenge facing our country is what to do to address the national security threats posed by them   Levin said    The Subcommittee s report lays out the weaknesses in our current inspection systems    including the inadequate inspection of trash trucks entering the country    and makes some recommendations that would help to enhance the security of our entry points and our nation   The Department of Homeland Security must act quickly to fix the problems and adopt the recommendations outlined in our report         Throughout the course of its three year investigation  the Subcommittee has identified numerous weaknesses in America   s programs that secure the global supply chain       In the Container Security Initiative  CSI   a critical program designed to inspect high risk shipping containers before they enter U S  ports  the Subcommittee found that only a small number of such high risk containers are actually inspected   In fact  the vast majority of high risk containers are simply not inspected overseas   To make matters worse  the U S  Government has not established minimum standards for these inspections             Under the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism  C TPAT   the U S  Government grants benefits to private sector companies that make specific security commitments   The Subcommittee found  however  that an overwhelming proportion of participating companies receive benefits prior to having their security profile validated   Only 27 percent of the participating companies have been subjected to a validation   Therefore  73 percent of companies have not been subjected to any legitimate  on site review to ensure that their security practices pass muster               The targeting system employed by the U S  Government to identify high risk shipping containers entering U S  ports is largely dependent on    the least reliable    form of data for targeting purposes   Moreover  the Subcommittee has found that this targeting system has never been tested or validated  and may not discern actual  realistic risks           Less than 40 percent of cargo containers entering U S  ports are screened for nuclear or radiological materials   One part of the problem is that the deployment of radiation detection equipment is woefully behind schedule   As of March 2006  the Department of Homeland Security has deployed only 30 8 percent of the necessary radiation monitors      To further highlight the severity of this potential threat  Senator Coleman requested that the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  initiate a study of the economic consequences of an attack on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach   This study found that the United States    gross domestic product  GDP  would decline by about  150 million per day for each day that the ports were closed and that the annual cost would be approximately  70 billion           Although CBO did not analyze the cost to human life and property of such a terrorist attack  the economic impact of closing the ports could be comparable to both the attacks of 9 11 and Hurricane Katrina     continued Coleman     We cannot afford the devastation these findings imply  We must secure our supply chain before we pay the high price of an attack           The hearing today listened to the testimony of two panels that spoke on the issue of global supply chain security   The first panel consisted of The Honorable Michael P  Jackson  Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security  while the second panel was comprised of 1  Mr  Christopher L  Koch  President and CEO of the World Shipping Council  2  Mr  Gary D  Gilbert  Senior Vice President of Hutchinson Port Holdings and 3  Mr  John P  Clancey  Chairman of Maersk Inc  Agency        This was the second part of a two day hearing that began on Tuesday March 28  2006   The first hearing released a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report on their findings of their investigation into the security of the global supply chain   The Subcommittee held an earlier hearing on May 26  2005 to examine potential vulnerabilities in the global supply chain system   The Container Security Initiative and Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism  Securing the Global Supply
