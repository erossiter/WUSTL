Chairman Carl Levin  D Mich   today wrote the following   PDF  to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates regarding the Administration   s estimate of North Korea   s highly enriched uranium program       Levin   s letter follows        March 2  2007       The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  Department of State  2201 C Street  NW  Washington  DC 20520    The Honorable Robert Gates  Secretary of Defense  Department of Defense  1000 Defense Pentagon  Washington  DC 20301 1000    Dear Madam Secretary and Mr  Secretary    We are writing with regard to testimony by Administration officials before Congress this week and subsequent media reporting regarding the administration   s estimate of North Korea   s highly enriched uranium program       The issue of whether North Korea has or had a highly enriched uranium program  and the state of that program  in terms of progress made towards developing nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium  is of critical significance   We have received briefings and testimony from intelligence and other Administration officials since 2002 regarding  North Korea   s nuclear activities  including a highly enriched uranium program  and this committee has relied upon this information as it pertains to U S  policy towards North Korea        The testimony and media reports that appeared this week indicate that the intelligence community may have reassessed the level of confidence it has about whether North Korea has or had a highly enriched uranium program  or to what extent such a program existed or exists   We are writing now to ask you to clarify for us the following       Has the assessment of the intelligence community regarding North Korea   s highly enriched uranium program  including the confidence level in its assessment  changed since the November 2002 National Intelligence Estimate       If so  when did it change  why did it change  and how did it change        In the unclassified November 19  2002 estimate for Congress  the CIA states     we recently learned that the North is constructing a plant that could produce enough weapons grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational     which could be as soon as mid decade      Has the level of confidence of that assessment changed   Is this still the intelligence community   s assessment  If not  why  and when did the intelligence community revise this assessment    What is the current intelligence community assessment       What was the basis for the assessment that there was an HEU plant under construction       Does the intelligence community assess that North Korea has a large scale centrifuge facility       What are possible alternative uses for items  such as aluminum tubes  that North Korea may have procured for use in an enriched uranium nuclear program   How likely is it that each of these items was for use in an enriched uranium nuclear program or for another purpose        Are the assessments of North Korea   s highly enriched uranium program contained in the November 2005 National Intelligence Estimate on North Korea   s nuclear and missile activities  and an intelligence community memorandum of December 2006  still the assessments of the intelligence community        From 2001 to the present  did the intelligence community provide special assessments on North Korea   s highly enriched uranium program to the State Department  Defense Department  White House  NSC  or the Office of the Vice President  If so  when were such special assessments provided   Please provide copies of those assessments       Has North Korea  provided any information on the highly enriched uranium program to the United States since the initial bilateral meeting in October 2002   If so  what information did North Korea provide       Please provide an unclassified and classified chronology regarding the changes in the Intelligence Community views on North Korean highly enriched uranium capabilities since 2002        The committee also looks forward to the latest assessment of North Korea   s nuclear and missile capabilities  as required by Section 1211 of the Fiscal Year  FY  2007 National Defense Authorization Act  NDAA   which the Director of National Intelligence   s office informs us will be delivered soon   Thank you for your prompt response to this letter          Sincerely      Carl Levin  Chairman  Senate Armed Services Committee
