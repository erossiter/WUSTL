EPA Record Keeping and Spill Prevention Program      WASHINGTON     Senators Carl Levin  D MI  and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Representative Sander Levin  D Royal Oak  announced the results of a   PDF   GAO  that identified a number of serious concerns about the accuracy of the Environmental Protection Agency   s  EPA  data concerning oil and chemical spills in the St  Clair River Lake St  Clair Detroit River corridor as well as deficiencies in the EPA   s procedures to prevent and respond to spills         The three lawmakers asked GAO to investigate how many oil and hazardous chemical spills greater than 50 gallons had occurred within the corridor from 1994 to 2004  the processes used for notification of spills  and the extent of EPA and Coast Guard spill prevention efforts and enforcement activities       A key finding of the GAO report released today is that EPA   s spill data are unreliable   The GAO report noted that EPA    does not remove all duplicate spill reports  or update its data after investigating spills    and so  unlike the Canadian spill data  the U S  data contain multiple reports of the same spill   As a result  GAO concluded    EPA   s spill data set is of limited use      According to the flawed data available  there were 991 spill reports from the U S  side of the corridor while Canadian authorities reported only 157 spills   However  GAO noted that    these reports do not accurately portray the actual number or volume of spills             This GAO report demonstrates that the Environmental Protection Agency simply doesn   t have the accurate data needed to assess the impact and severity of spills in the St  Clair     Detroit River corridor     Sen  Levin said      EPA needs to address this crucial first step of collecting reliable data and move to correct the other shortcomings described in the GAO report             The quality of our waterways is critical to Michigan   s economic viability and quality of life for our families     said Sen  Stabenow       This GAO study reveals serious issues that must be addressed by the Environmental Protection Agency in order to respond to and prevent oil and chemical spills in this vital waterway          Rep  Levin said     The GAO report revealed serious problems with EPA   s spill prevention efforts   EPA doesn   t even have a clear idea of what specific facilities it is supposed to be inspecting under its spill prevention program   EPA needs to bring more resources to bear on spill investigations  spill prevention inspections  and basic record keeping            GAO also found that spill notification on both sides of the corridor is largely dependent upon reporting by parties responsible for the spill  and that many spills likely go unreported by responsible parties   The report noted that while EPA has the authority to address spill prevention for both oil and hazardous chemicals  the EPA Spill Prevention  Control  and Countermeasure  SPCC  program address only oil spills   Even then  the GAO report noted     EPA is uncertain of which specific facilities are subject to regulation under its spill prevention program            Further  EPA conducts only a handful of inspections within the corridor every year   The report indicated that EPA relies on only three inspectors to conduct all inspection and compliance activities for six states   GAO stated that    according to  EPA  officials  with current SPCC resource constraints  they could only inspect facilities once every 500 years or more      The report noted that the EPA inspections that had occurred often disclosed    significant and numerous spill prevention deficiencies     yet EPA issued only four fines from 1994 to 2004       In a letter sent today to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  Senators Levin and Stabenow and Congressman Levin wrote     The situation described in the GAO report is simply not acceptable   There is a longstanding problem with oil and chemical spills in the corridor  but no one is keeping track of the number of spills or their severity   Further  the regulated facilities within the corridor are largely left to their own devices when it comes to reporting spills and implementing spill control and prevention measures          The lawmakers called on EPA to immediately gather information on which facilities are currently regulated under its current spill prevention program   They also urged EPA to undertake a rulemaking to address spill prevention from hazardous substances   Currently  EPA   s spill prevention program addresses only oil   Finally  they called on EPA to significantly increase funding for inspection and compliance activities within the corridor         The lawmakers complimented Michigan for investing over  1 million to install spill detection monitoring systems that will be operational in the St  Clair and Detroit Rivers in 2007   These systems are based on the successful Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission s  ORSANCO  spill detection and notification system that was established in 1978 to protect drinking water intakes on the Ohio River from chemical contamination              The Government Accountability Office report GAO 06 639    PDF  can be found on    The text of the lawmakers    letter to the EPA follows     July 7  2006      Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20515      Dear Administrator Johnson       We are writing to bring to your attention a new study by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  that raises serious concerns about the uncertainties of data concerning oil and chemical spills in the St  Clair River Lake St  Clair Detroit River corridor as well as deficiencies in the EPA   s procedures to prevent and respond to spills within the corridor         The St  Clair River Lake St  Clair Detroit River corridor is one of the main connecting channels of the Great Lakes System   The 98 mile corridor is part of the boundary between the United States and Canada and more than 5 million people receive their drinking water from these bodies of water   Approximately 500 industrial facilities  including chemical companies  oil refineries and power plants  are located within the corridor         For many years  there have been chronic oil and hazardous chemical spills within the corridor   Following a number of severe spills in 2003 and 2004  we requested the Comptroller General to investigate how many oil and hazardous chemical spills greater than 50 gallons had occurred within the corridor from 1994 to 2004  and how accurately reported spills reflect the extent of actual spills   We also asked GAO to examine the extent of EPA   s and the Coast Guard   s spill prevention efforts and enforcement activities       The GAO study revealed a number of serious problems        The available spill data are unreliable   Between 1994 and 2004  GAO documented 991 spill reports from the U S  side of the corridor  with an additional 157 spill reports from Canada   However  GAO underscored that    these reports do not accurately portray the actual number or volume of spills      Moreover  with regard to the number of U S  spills  GAO noted that    EPA Region 5 does not remove all duplicate spill reports  or update its data after investigating spills     Unlike the Canadian spill data  the U S  data contain multiple reports of the same spill   As a result  GAO concludes that    EPA   s spill data set is of limited use         GAO found that spill notification is largely dependent upon reporting by parties responsible for the spill  but that many spills go unreported by responsible parties   The study found that a full 67 percent of the spills reported in the corridor were released from an unknown source   The report noted that U S  and Canadian officials suggested that responsible parties    may not be aware of the spills  may not understand the reporting requirements  or that they may not want to receive    bad press    or be forced to pay the costs of the cleanup         GAO noted that while EPA has the authority to address spill prevention for both oil and hazardous substances  its Spill Prevention  Control  and Countermeasure  SPCC  program addresses only oil spills   Further  GAO reported that    EPA is uncertain of which specific facilities are subject to regulation under its spill prevention program              The GAO report indicated that EPA conducts only a handful of inspections of regulated facilities within the corridor each year   The report noted that EPA relies on roughly three SPCC inspectors to conduct all plan reviews and provide all compliance assistance for covered facilities in Michigan and five other states   GAO noted further that    according to  EPA  officials  with current SPCC resource constraints  they could only inspect facilities once every 500 years or more          The report indicated that the inspections that have been conducted within the corridor between 1994 and 2004 often    disclosed significant and numerous spill prevention deficiencies     yet EPA issued only four fines during that eleven year period              The situation described in the GAO report is simply not acceptable   There is a longstanding problem with oil and chemical spills in the corridor  but no one is keeping track of the number of spills or their severity   Further  the regulated facilities within the corridor are largely left to their own devices when it comes to reporting spills and implementing spill control and prevention measures        The State of Michigan is to be commended for investing over  1 million to install spill detection monitoring systems that will be operational in the St  Clair and Detroit Rivers in 2007   These monitoring systems will not only provide notice and protection for drinking water intakes  but will serve as a deterrent to spills because monitoring information can be used in enforcement actions         The best way to reduce the number of spills is to prevent them before they happen in the first place   Therefore  we recommend a number of steps to address the shortcomings outlined in the GAO report       EPA should immediately gather information on which facilities are currently regulated under its spill prevention program   We note that EPA has previously identified at least 59 facilities within the corridor that are required to meet SPCC requirements   There is an obvious need to identify the entire universe of covered facilities       EPA should undertake a rulemaking to address spill prevention for hazardous substances within the corridor   Currently  EPA   s spill prevention program addresses only oil   As noted above  Congress has previously called for regulations to prevent discharges of both oil and hazardous substances  indeed  EPA proposed hazardous spill prevention regulations in the late 1970s  but they were never finalized   The fact is that many of the most serious spills that have been reported within the corridor are hazardous substances        Additional resources must be brought to bear to investigate spills and inspect currently covered facilities within the corridor   We urge you in the strongest terms to include a significant increase in funding for inspection and compliance activities in the Administration   s next budget request to Congress   In the meantime  we ask you to focus existing resources and step up inspection of facilities with the potential for serious future spills within the corridor             We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response       Sincerely      Senator Carl Levin  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Representative Sander Levin
