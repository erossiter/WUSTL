                                                                                                                                                                      Excerpts from Senate Floor Debate  March 17  2005   Mr  LEVIN    Mr  President  first of all  I want to thank people who have worked out the changes in this bill  which make it a better bill  From my perspective  it is still a mistake  and I intend to vote no if there is a roll call vote        A number of people have asked me whether I now favor this bill with the changes  My answer is no  I think it is a better bill with the changes  It is a bill which avoids some damaging precedents      We can explain the changes  The most important one is explicitly this does not create a precedent  Secondly  it is not a 12 month period the parents can proceed in  It is a 30 day period that they have  So we do not have a situation where they wait 12 months prior to initiating the case        The court has discretion to issue a stay  It is not mandatory                Mr  LEVIN  Mr  President  I want to make it clear that although I believe it is a mistake for Congress to be moving into this area with this haste and speed  in the most difficult decision making a family could ever face     I intend to vote no     the language in section 1 also makes it clear that a federal court would have to find a violation of a constitutional right or a right under U S  law in order to provide an order that she be maintained on life support            Excerpts from CNN Late Edition  March 20  2005   LEVIN  I think it s unwise for Congress to intervene in a very deeply personal matter such as this  There are many  many such individual cases that exist around the country that are in the courts  This one has been in the courts for 12 years  so I don t think it s wise as a general matter for Congress to intervene in these specific cases  However  if Congress is going to intervene  it is critically important that we not try to prejudge the outcome  that we not try to restrict the discretion of a federal judge and that we make it clear  as this bill now does  as a result of some modifications  that the federal judge would determine whether or not there is an existing constitutional or federal statutory right which has been violated here or which can be invoked in order to protect her       So if there is going to be this kind of an intervention and I think it s a mistake  at least it should be carefully constructed so  again  it does not restrict discretion on part of the federal judge or require     for instance     he issue a stay       At one point the Senate bill and the House bill required that the federal court issue a stay  We have now decided not to put that explicit language in there and allow the court to exercise the type of discretion on that matter that it ordinarily would under existing federal rules             LEVIN  I wonder  Wolf  if I could just take 10 seconds to answer the question you did not ask me about that GOP memo to simply say that  if in fact that memo which said that the Schiavo matter should be made a political matter  is in fact a real memo  it will backfire on the person that wrote that memo  or on the Republicans  if they embrace it       The people do not want that issue to be politicized       Colloquy Between Senators Levin and Frist Regarding Federal Court Discretion in Relation to the Private Relief Bill for Parents of Terri Schiavo  Senate Floor Debate  March 20  2005  Senator Levin s purpose in entering this colloquy was to make clear that the Schiavo bill takes no position on whether the court should take any action in considering the Terri Schiavo case  including whether it should issue a stay       Mr  LEVIN   I rise to seek clarification from the Majority Leader about one aspect of this bill  the issue of whether Congress has mandated that a federal court issue a stay pending determination of the case          Mr  FRIST   I would be pleased to help clarify this issue          Mr  LEVIN   Section 5 of the original version of the Martinez bill conferred jurisdiction on a federal court to hear a case like this  and then stated that the federal court    shall    issue a stay of state court proceedings pending determination of the federal case   I was opposed to that provision because I believe Congress should not mandate that a federal judge issue a stay   Under longstanding law and practice  the decision to issue a stay is a matter of discretion for the federal judge based on the facts of the case   The Majority Leader and the other bill sponsors accepted my suggestion that the word    shall    in section 5 be changed to    may             The version of the bill we are now considering strikes section 5 altogether   Although nothing in the text of the new bill mandates a stay  the omission of this section  which in the earlier Senate passed bill made a stay permissive  might be read to mean that Congress intends to mandate a stay   I believe that reading is incorrect   The absence of any stay provision in the new bill simply means that Congress relies on current law   Under current law  a judge may decide whether or not a stay is appropriate         Does the Majority Leader share my understanding of the bill          Mr  FRIST   I share the understanding of the Senator from Michigan  as does the junior Senator from Florida who is the chief sponsor of this bill   Nothing in the current bill or its legislative history mandates a stay   I would assume  however  the federal court would grant a stay based on the facts of this case because Mrs  Schiavo would need to be alive in order for the court to make its determination   Nevertheless  this bill does not change current law under which a stay is discretionary          Mr  LEVIN   In light of that assurance  I do not object to the unanimous consent agreement under which the bill will be considered by the Senate   I do not make the same assumption as the Majority Leader makes about what a federal court will do   Because the discretion of the federal court is left unrestricted in the bill  I will not exercise my right to block its consideration
