Levin  D MI  and Jack Reed  D R I   said today that the Bush Administration   s pattern of misleading statements about pre war Iraq intelligence continues  and released a collection of statements made by Administration officials before the war regarding Iraq  contrasted with what the Intelligence Community believed to be true at the time         Levin said     The Bush Administration   s current mantra is that it followed  as National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley said recently     the best collective judgment of the Intelligence Community      That statement is not true relative to the key allegations of the Administration regarding   a cooperative relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda  and   Iraq   s nuclear weapons program         Before the war  the classified Intelligence Community position did not support Bush Administration statements that there was a cooperative relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda   The Administration made that allegation so frequently before the war that 53 percent of the American people came to believe that Saddam Hussein was    personally involved    in the 9 11 attacks   The Administration   s argument was based on two assertions   that Iraq had provided training to al Qaeda in chemical and biological weapons  and   that the lead 9 11 hijacker  Mohammed Atta  met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April  2001      However  the Intelligence Community did not support either of those assertions   It either disagreed or at best was divided        Before the war  the classified Intelligence Community position also did not support or was divided on Bush Administration statements relative to key aspects of Iraq   s nuclear weapons program  including   whether Iraq sought aluminum tubes to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons  and   whether Saddam Hussein was trying to obtain uranium from Africa           President Bush and Vice President Cheney have recently accused members of Congress of    rewriting history      This is just the latest in a long chain of deceptive statements about pre war intelligence     Levin said       The following charts  which compare Bush Administration statements before the war with declassified  pre war Intelligence Community views  show the real history of how the Administration made misleading statements prior to the war to make its case for attacking Iraq

Terrorism Summary       This paper s conclusions     especially regarding the difficult and elusive question of the exact nature of Iraq s relations with al Qaida     are based on currently available information that is at times contradictory and derived from sources of varying degrees of reliability      emphasis added      CIA report    Iraqi Support for Terrorism     January 2003       Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable   or possibly for revenge     Saddam  if sufficiently desperate   might decide that only an organization such as al Qa ida     could perpetrate the type of terrorist attack that he would hope to conduct  In such circumstances  he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United states would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him      emphasis added    October 1  2002  National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction          Issue  Iraq Training al Qaeda in Chemical

chemical and biological weapons training         February 6  2003  Statement in the Roosevelt Room    National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice     We know from a detainee that  the head of training

conclusions based on solid intelligence      I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative  Ibn al Shaykh al Libi  telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al Qaida      The support that this detainee describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two al Qaida associates beginning in December 2000  He says that a militant known as Abdallah al Iraqi had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gasses  Abdallah al Iraqi characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful         February 5  2003  Address to the United Nations Security Council      This is the first report from Ibn al Shaykh in which he claims Iraq assisted al Qaida s CBRN efforts  However  he lacks specific details on the Iraqis involved  the CBRN materials associated with the assistance  and the location where training occurred  It is possible he does not know any further details  it is more likely this individual is intentionally misleading the debriefers   Ibn al Shaykh has been undergoing debriefs for several weeks and may be describing scenarios to the debriefers that he knows will retain their interest      emphasis added      Defense Intelligence Agency  Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summary  February 2002       In January 2003  the CIA produced an updated version of the report    Iraqi Support for Terrorism   That report cited the  al Libi  claims that al Qa ida sent operatives to Iraq to acquire chemical and biological weapons and related training but noted the detainee was not in a position to know if any training had taken place       emphasis added      CIA statement describing January 2003 CIA Report    Iraqi Support for Terrorism     declassified

declassified       Vice President Cheney     It s been pretty well confirmed that he  Mohammed Atta  did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April  several months before the attack       December 9  2001  NBC Meet the Press    Vice President Cheney     Mohammed Atta  who was the lead hijacker  did apparently travel to Prague on a number of occasions  And on at least one occasion  we have reporting that places him in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official a few months before the attack on the World Trade Center         Tim Russert     What does the CIA say about that  Is it credible     Vice President Cheney      It s credible        September 8  2002  NBC Meet the Press     In January 2004  Vice President Cheney said     We did have reporting that was public  that came out shortly after the 9 11 attack  provided by the Czech government  suggesting that there had been a meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta  the lead hijacker  and a man named al Ani  who was an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague  at the embassy there  in April of  01  prior to the 9 11 attacks    That s the one that possibly tied the two together to 9 11        interview with the Rocky Mountain News  January 9  2004           Reporting is contradictory on hijacker Mohammed Atta s alleged trip to Prague and meeting with an Iraqi intelligence officer  and we have not verified his travels       emphasis added    June 21  2002  CIA Report    Iraq and al Qaida  Interpreting a Murky Relationship          Some information asserts that Atta met with IIS chief    al Ani  but the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility       A CIA and FBI review of intelligence and open source reporting

Administration Statements Before the War  What the Intelligence Community Said Before the War  now declassified       Vice President Cheney     Specifically aluminum tubes      We do know  with absolute certainty   that he is using his procurement system to acquire the equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon       September 8  2002  Meet the Press    National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice     We do know that there have been shipments going     into Iraq  for instance  of aluminum tubes     that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs  centrifuge programs       September 8  2002  CNN Late Edition    Vice President Cheney     We now have irrefutable evidence that he has once again set up and reconstituted his program to take uranium  to enrich it to sufficiently high grade  so that it will function as the base material as a nuclear weapon       September 20  2002  Associated Press       In INR  s  State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research  view Iraq s efforts to acquire aluminum tubes is central to the argument that Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program  but INR is not persuaded that the tubes in question are intended for use as centrifuge rotors   INR accepts the judgment of technical experts at the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  who have concluded that the tubes Iraq seeks to acquire are poorly suited for use in gas centrifuges to be used for uranium enrichment and finds unpersuasive the arguments advanced by others to make the case that they are intended for that purpose  INR considers it far more likely that the tubes are intended for another purpose   most likely the production of artillery rockets  The very large quantities being sought  the way the tubes were tested by the Iraqis  and the atypical lack of attention to operational security in the procurement efforts are among the factors  in addition to the DOE assessment  that lead INR to conclude that the tubes are not intended for use in Iraq s nuclear weapon program       emphasis added    October 1  2002  National Intelligence Estimate on    Iraq s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction

learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa       January 28  2003  State of the Union address    Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld      Saddam s  regime     recently was discovered seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa       January 29  2003    State Department     The  Iraqi  Declaration ignores efforts to procure uranium from

Mass Destruction        On July 11  2003  Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said     There was fragmentary intelligence gathered in late 2001 and early 2002 on the allegations of Saddam s efforts to obtain additional raw uranium from Africa     I n the fall of 2002  our British colleagues told us they were planning to publish an unclassified dossier that mentioned reports of Iraqi attempts to obtain uranium in Africa  Because we viewed the reporting on such acquisition attempts to be inconclusive   we expressed our reservations about its inclusion     In September and October 2002     senior intelligence officials     told members of Congress that we differed with the British dossier on the reliability of the uranium reporting        CIA  officials who were reviewing the draft  State of the Union  remarks on uranium raised several concerns about the fragmentary nature of the intelligence with  NSC  colleagues       emphasis added
