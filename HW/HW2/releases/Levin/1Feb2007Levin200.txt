China Economic and Security Review Commission Hearing on  The U S  China Relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the subject of the U S     China relationship   I   d like to focus the majority of my statement on trade and then mention the strategic relationship   This hearing is timely as the one sided nature of the U S  China relationship in trade is causing increased impatience in America   s heartland as well as in the U S  Congress          We need a more balanced trading relationship with China   We need to take bold action and insist that trade with China be a two way street for American manufacturers  farmers and service providers trying to do business there       The one sided nature of the U S  China trade relationship is evident when you look at the trade deficit figures   In 2005  China exported  243 billion worth of goods to the U S      six times the amount that the U S  exported to China  This left us with a deficit of  202 billion in 2005     our largest deficit with any country   In 2006  the U S  China trade deficit is expected to exceed  230 billion       One reason for this glaring trade imbalance is China   s continued non compliance with its WTO obligations and our failure to challenge this non compliance   When China jointed the WTO it committed to abide by international trade laws   But in case after case China has thumbed its nose at these laws and we   ve not objected   We should be bringing trade cases against China on currency manipulation and Intellectual Property Rights  IPR  violations and against its industrial policies that discriminate against imports       As a result of the administration   s lack of action in the face of China   s WTO noncompliance  Congress will need to take greater legislative initiative to force action         There are many facets to our failed trade relationship with China   This morning I   d like to run through the most glaring complaints that we should be taking up at the WTO      Intellectual Property   Counterfeiting has exploded in recent years across many industries to become a serious threat to the competitiveness of the U S  economy  Intellectual property theft is rampant in China  and counterfeit products make their way back into the U S  and third country markets  hurting the companies that are the victims of this theft         I testified before this Committee last June on the topic of auto parts counterfeiting   We know that China is the primary source of counterfeit auto parts and components and counterfeiting is one of the U S  auto parts industry   s greatest concerns with China   The U S  auto parts industry loses  12 billion annually to counterfeit auto parts  and China is responsible for about 75 percent of those counterfeit auto parts   A new U S  Chamber of Commerce study reported that counterfeiting and piracy cost the Ford Motor Company about  1 billion annually  not including the health and safety costs associated with the fake items   The Justice Department and other federal agencies need to do more to fight auto parts piracy   Intellectual property theft is a serious crime with serious consequences and should be treated as such         On April 29  2005  the USTR placed China on the Special 301 Priority Watch List because of its failure to improve protections for U S  intellectual property rights   Yet China has not changed its behavior   We need an enforcement office at USTR to pursue trade cases against countries that fail to meet commitments to reduce IPR infringement levels  and to prosecute counterfeiting more aggressively        Currency manipulation  The Bush administration has also failed to take action on China   s currency manipulation   The continued undervaluation of the Yuan has made Chinese products artificially cheaper  harming U S  workers and businesses  and has exacerbated the U S  China trade deficit   By rigging its currency at between 15 and 40 percent below its appropriate value  China is giving a subsidy to its imports to the United States and imposing a direct cost on U S  exports to China         China has pegged the value of its exchange rate to a basket of currencies heavily weighted to the dollar and intervenes massively to maintain that peg   So why has China not been cited by the Treasury Department in its semi annual report   We should challenge China   s currency manipulation in the WTO by initiating either a Section 301 unfair trade case or filing a case with the World Trade Organization s Dispute Settlement Body against China s currency peg   U S  manufacturers and many members of Congress are wondering  why has the U S  Trade Representative not taken such actions         We should also be honest about what currency manipulation really is     Currency manipulation is a government subsidy  and it should be treated as such   That is why I will work with Senator Stabenow and others to develop legislation to make currency manipulation subject to U S  countervailing duty laws and to direct the U S  government to pursue countervailing duty cases in non market economies such as China      Import Surges  The administration has also failed to use China specific safeguards that were built into China   s accession agreement precisely to defend American industries harmed by surging Chinese imports   Despite the International Trade Commission finding that U S  manufacturers are being harmed by a flood of Chinese imports in various sectors  the administration has denied cases involving standard pipe  ductile ironworks  wire hangars  and pedestal actuators   We should be pursuing these cases and defending our manufacturers      Industrial Policy  This administration has been dragging its feet for years on using international trade laws to fight for a two way street on trade   The USTR has finally requested a WTO dispute settlement panel with China over its unfair tax regime on imported auto parts   This is a long overdue step which will hopefully end some of the discriminatory treatment of American auto parts by China   By vigorously pressing our case against these and other egregious violations of the very WTO rules that China has agreed to abide by  we can hopefully help force an end to the one way street on trade with China         We have a huge and growing trade imbalance with China   So far  our government has done nothing to stop China   s unfair trade practices  and this is costing us jobs         This Commission can help exert pressure on the administration by continuing to expose these egregious practices and by making strong recommendations for actions to address them          Finally  as the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee I want to say a few words about the U S  China strategic relationship   Over the last several years  the United States and China have pursued a constructive strategic relationship  addressing common concerns such as North Korea   s nuclear programs  bilaterally and multilaterally  China has demonstrated a greater willingness to play a responsible role on the world stage  contributing police forces to the U N  operation in Haiti  for example         Yet  at the same time  China is still unwilling to join the international community and pressure the Sudanese government to end the genocide in Darfur   The Chinese government speaks in favor of export controls  but still appears to have a way to go in establishing its own regime to prevent proliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons   And most shockingly  a few weeks ago  the Chinese government  authorized the shooting down of their own weather satellite  raising questions about whether they are indeed     contrary to their protestations     pursuing the weaponization of space         So  while the U S  China strategic relationship has been strengthened through the pursuit of common national security objectives  through diplomatic efforts and increased military contacts  it is a fragile accommodation for the United States  fraught with uncertainty about China   s true intentions          The Commission will hopefully offer recommendations to Congress regarding how the Untied States might more effectively further its interests vis    vis China  and how Congress can help the Administration to foster greater transparency and cooperation from China
