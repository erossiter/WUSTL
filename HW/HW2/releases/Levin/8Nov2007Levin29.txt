                                                                                                                                                           Bill   s provisions will help to preserve and protect Michigan waterways      WASHINGTON     Sens  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   today hailed the 79 14 Senate vote to override President Bush   s veto of the Water Resources Development Act  which includes numerous provisions for Michigan and the Great Lakes   The House voted to override the veto earlier this week  so the bill now becomes law          In overriding President Bush   s veto today  the Senate stood up for America   s waterways and water infrastructure     said Levin      The strong bipartisan vote shows that we   ll fight to protect the Great Lakes from invasive species  and we   ll fight to help make our waters safe and clean   We   ll fight to address the serious dredging backlog in our harbors and channels  which hurts many Michigan businesses that rely on these waterways every day   The Senate showed that we   ll protect our residents from sewer overflows and we   ll enhance the security of our dams to keep our communities safe              I am so pleased that working together  we were able to override this President   s veto and pass this bipartisan legislation     said Stabenow      From protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species  to providing crucial maintenance for harbors across our state  this bill serves as a critical framework for protecting and maintaining the lakes  rivers  harbors and other waterways that are such a crucial part of Michigan   s identity and economy           This bill authorizes projects  but funding for the projects still needs to be secured through the appropriations process   Following are provisions of the bill important to Michigan and the Great Lakes       Great Lakes Navigation and Protection  Directs the Army Corps to expedite the operation and maintenance  including dredging  of the Great Lakes commercial navigation channels and infrastructure   This provision aims to address the very serious dredging backlog in the Great Lakes  which has been exacerbated by historic low water levels   The backlog has resulted in ships having to carry reduced loads  freighters getting stuck in channels  and some shipments that have ceased altogether   Every year  hundreds of millions of tons of goods are transported through the Great Lakes waterways  and communities throughout the Great Lakes are economically tied to waterborne commerce   Dredging to the needed depths and maintaining other navigational features of the system are critical   Also directs the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  in coordination with the Corps and other federal agencies  to carry out a pilot project to control and prevent further spreading of viral hemorrhagic septicemia in the Great Lakes      Dispersal Barrier on Chicago River  Converts the existing dispersal barrier  Barrier I  into a permanent barrier at full federal expense   Completes construction of the second barrier  Barrier II  at full federal expense  Any states that provided funds to the effort will be reimbursed through cost sharing of other projects in their state  and both barriers will be operated and maintained at full federal expense  The Corps will also conduct a feasibility study on ways to prevent the spread of invasives between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River      Sault Ste  Marie     Replacement Lock  Authorizes construction of a second Poe sized lock  at full Federal expense  at a total cost of  341 714 000   Two thirds of the carrying capacity of the U S  Great Lakes fleet is currently limited to the one large lock  the Poe lock  If the Poe lock should fail  shipping between Lake Superior and Lake Huron would essentially cease  and the steel industry  coal reliant and agricultural industries dependent on farm exports would be severely harmed  This authorization  which waives the non federal cost share requirement  is a critical step for ensuring the viability of the Great Lakes shipping infrastructure      Budgeting for Harbor Dredging Projects  States that it is the sense of Congress that the Corps    budget should incorporate all available economic data rather than focus on a single metric such as the amount of cargo being moved   Beginning in fiscal year 2005  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  and the Army Corps began implementing new budget guidelines and criteria for funding the Operation and Maintenance of commercial harbors  which rely primarily on the amount of tonnage a port handles   In setting this policy  harbors that do not move a large tonnage but are still important to the economic success of a community are unfairly biased against in the President   s budget   By expressing this Sense of the Congress  we are hopeful that these budgeting criteria will be corrected          Environmental Infrastructure for Michigan  Authorizes  35 million for the correction of combined sewer overflows in Michigan   Many of Michigan   s communities have sewer systems dating back to the turn of the century  and sanitary sewage and storm water runoff are combined into one system   During heavy rains  these combined systems can overflow  also known as combined sewer overflows   polluting streams  rivers  and lakes   This important provision would help Michigan communities upgrade combined sewer systems  improving water quality in Michigan and the Great Lakes        Au Sable River  Authorizes a project for navigation  including dredging of the Au Sable River in the vicinity of Oscoda  Michigan   This dredging is crucial so that boaters have access to local marinas  restaurants  and other businesses   Without this dredging  boaters could be prevented from accessing the river  which would be devastating for the economy      Cass River  Authorizes a flood damage reduction project for the Cass River  in Vassar  Michigan and vicinity   The Cass River has regularly flooded residential and business properties over the past 30 years   Some of these floods have submerged major highways  limiting emergency rescue services   The existing levees are in poor condition and need to be repaired   This project is critical for protecting lives and properties        Clinton River     Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project  Authorizes a project for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the Clinton River   This would improve the water quality and natural habitat of the Clinton River   The project could also examine a means to    daylight    the Clinton River under the City of Pontiac   In past years  the river was enclosed in a series of conduits under the city   By restoring the surface flow through the city  the river ecology could be restored   Clinton River     Project for Navigation  Authorizes a project for navigation at the Clinton River to make it easier for boaters to get to Lake St  Clair      Detroit River Shoreline  Authorizes  3 million for emergency streambank and shoreline protection  which would include measures to enhance public access   This project would improve the riverfront walkway that allows for public access  and provides open space and recreational opportunities   The Army Corps has been engaged throughout the planning process  serving as staff on the planning committee and observers on the Board   This authorization is needed to ensure the integration of the numerous shoreline protections  flood control  navigation  and other hydrological and logistical elements along the river        Ecorse Creek  Retains the authorization of the Ecorse Creek project located in Wayne County  which was originally authorized in WRDA 1990  and would help correct the flooding of Ecorse Creek   Ecorse Creek has a long history of flooding  which is expected to be a recurring problem unless corrective measures are implemented   In the long run  mitigation of the flooding problem would significantly reduce recurrent property loss and Federal disaster assistance expenditures        Hamilton Dam  Flint River  Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to enhance dam safety at the Hamilton Dam  in the Flint River  in Flint  Michigan   Built in 1920  the Hamilton dam is rapidly deteriorating and the prospect of dam failure and what that would mean to those living downstream continues to be a major concern   The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has determined that this dam is in critical condition and could possibly fail in the near future   Also  the Army Corps has recommended replacement of the dam in a study conducted in 2000   This important authorization would allow for the rehabilitation of the Hamilton Dam    Hamburg and Green Oak Townships  Authorizes a study to determine the feasibility of carrying out a project for flood damage reduction on Ore Lake and the Huron River for Hamburg and Green Oak Townships in Michigan   Floods in May 2004 destroyed or damaged about 200 homes   A flood control project is important for this growing area      Kalamazoo River Watershed  Battle Creek  Authorizes a project for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the Kalamazoo River watershed in Battle Creek  Michigan   The Corps modified a portion of the Kalamazoo River flowing through Battle Creek   s downtown nearly fifty years ago   The river was redirected through a concrete channel for flood control   Although the project has alleviated flooding  the concrete channel created undesirable effects on the ecosystem of the river   This project would help the city of Battle Creek to meet their watershed management goals       Luna Pier     along Lake Erie  Authorizes a study to determine the feasibility of carrying out a project for storm damage reduction and other related purposes along Lake Erie at Luna Pier  Michigan   The shoreline dike system and beach sills that were installed at Luna Pier continue to deteriorate because they are subjected to Lake Erie   s severe storms   This study is a first step in making the necessary repairs at Luna Pier to provide adequate storm damage reduction  beach erosion protection  and flood prevention      Menominee Harbor     Outer Channel and Inner Harbor  Authorizes a project for navigation at Menominee   This provision would authorize dredging and other navigation related projects that would accommodate access to warehousing and commercial operations   The additional depth would benefit deep draft commercial vessel traffic  which has increased over the years and is expected to continue to increase       Ontonagon River  Authorizes a project for navigation for the Ontonagon River   This provision would allow the Corps to extend the commercial navigation on the Ontonagon River and to deepen the channel   These changes are necessary to allow for better access to Ontonagon   s port facilities   Currently  there is only one vessel that can enter the harbor that handles the required volume of material for Ontonagon   s industrial community   Other ships have to back into the harbor to reach the dock and are unwilling to do so because of the prevailing currents at the mouth of the harbor   This authorization would help protect the vital shipping infrastructure in Ontonagon      Ontonagon Harbor     Shore Damage Study  Authorizes a study of shore damage at Ontonagon harbor to determine if the damage is the result of a Federal navigation project   If the study concludes that the damage is a result of a Federal navigation project  then the Army Corps is authorized to mitigate the damages        Sebewaing River  Authorizes a navigation project at the Sebewaing River   This provision would authorize the Corps to make repairs and improvements to the river to prevent the river walls from eroding  which is causing excessive sedimentation that is requiring more dredging      St  Clair River and Lake St  Clair  Authorizes  20 million for the environmental restoration of the St  Clair River and Lake St  Clair   The pollution in Lake St  Clair and the St  Clair River has gone unaddressed for too long   By authorizing this project  which would use a collaboratively developed cleanup plan  federal resources would be utilized more efficiently     St  Joseph Harbor  Directs the Army Corps to expedite development of the dredged material management plan for the project for navigation at St  Joseph Harbor   Historically  the dredged materials were disposed of offshore  in deeper waters in Lake Michigan   The dredged materials now are used to protect against shoreline erosion and for beach nourishment   The Corps of Engineers estimates that 700 000 cubic yards of dredged materials will need to be managed over the next 20 years   For environmental reasons  the dredged materials in the inner harbors need an alternative management plan   This provision would help to expedite the planning process and evaluation of alternatives       Traverse City Harbor   Authorizes the Corps to reconstruct the harbor at Northwestern Michigan College in Traverse City  Michigan   The provision also allows the Secretary to review the locally prepared plan for the project  and if the Secretary determines that the plan is feasible and meets the Corps    standards  the Secretary may use that plan to carry out the project  and provide credit toward the non Federal share of the cost of the project for the cost of work carried out by the local sponsor before the date of the partnership agreement   The renovated harbor would support the operations of the Great Lakes Maritime Academy  our nation   s only freshwater state maritime academy  and vessels associated with the program  including the federally owned and operated T S State of Michigan   The project would include dredging  construction of an eastern arm  reconstruction of the inner harbor area  and general site improvements        Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystems Restoration Program  Clarifies the existing program authority that a reconnaissance study is to be performed at full federal expense   Under this program  the Corps cooperates with other agencies to plan  implement and evaluate projects supporting the restoration of the fishery  ecosystem and beneficial uses of the Great Lakes  Also clarifies that in kind contributions may be used to satisfy the non federal cost share requirement      John Glenn Great Lakes Basin Program  Allows in kind contributions to satisfy the non federal cost share requirement of a recreational boating study being carried out by the Commission and the Corps as part of the John Glenn Great Lakes Basin Program      Aquatic Ecosystem   Estuary Restoration  Modifies the existing authority to increases the authorization of appropriations levels for this national program and to include dam removal projects  This authority is used throughout the Great Lakes to restore and protect the environment      Modification of Projects for Improvement of the Quality of the Environment  Modifies the existing authority to increase the authorization of appropriations level for this program to  40 million  While a national program  this authority is used throughout the Great Lakes including projects utilizing sea lamprey dispersal barriers to prevent the spread of this aquatic invasive species      Great Lakes Tributary Models Program  Extends the authorization of the Great Lakes Sediment Management Program  which calls for the Corps to develop sediment transport models for Great Lakes tributaries  to 2011  These computer models simulate the erosion  transport and deposition of sediments within a watershed  and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of soil conservation and other source control measures on the loadings of sediments and sediment contaminants to Great Lakes harbors and navigation channels      Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans and Sediment Remediation Program  Extends authorization of the Great Lakes Remedial Action Plans and Sediment Remediation Program  in which the Corps provides technical support to states and Remedial Action Plan committees so that the United States can meet its international obligations  to 2011  Through the 1987 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement  the United States and Canada agreed to develop remedial action plans  RAPs  for the Areas of Concern  26 of which are wholly located in the United States       St  Lawrence Seaway  Allows the St  Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation to carry out repair and rehabilitation projects  including associated maintenance dredging  of the Eisenhower and Snell lock facilities and related navigational infrastructure for the Saint Lawrence Seaway  at a total cost of  134 650 000
