introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting U S  waters from the threats posed by aquatic invasive species   The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act and the Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act would help combat these harmful species that damage U S  aquatic ecosystems and natural resources           Invasive species wreak havoc on our waterways and cost us billions each year     said Levin  who is a co chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force      Because it has proven immeasurably difficult to fight invasive species once they have entered our waters  these bills are focused on preventative measures that will tackle the problem at the source            Details of the two bills follow        The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act would reauthorize and strengthen the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 to protect U S  waters by preventing new introductions of aquatic invasive species   The legislation  which Levin is sponsoring along with Sen  Susan Collins  R Maine  would regulate ballast discharge from commercial vessels  prevent invasive species introductions from other pathways  support state management plans  screen live aquatic organisms entering the United States for the first time in trade  authorize rapid response funds  create education and outreach programs  conduct research on invasion pathways  and prevention and control technologies  authorize funds for state and regional grants  and strengthen specific prevention efforts in the Great Lakes   A summary of the bill can be found             What is so important about the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act is that it to takes a comprehensive approach toward the problem of aquatic invasive species rather than just focusing on species after they are established and a nuisance     Levin said      The bill deals with the prevention of new introductions of species  the screening of live aquatic organisms imported into the country  the rapid response to new invasions before they become established  and the research to implement the provisions of this bill            The Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act  which Levin is sponsoring with Sen  George Voinovich  R Ohio  and Sen  Russell Feingold  D Wisc   would list three species of Asian carp     the bighead  black and silver carp     as injurious wildlife under the Lacey Act   By doing so  Congress would prevent the intentional introduction of these species into the Great Lakes by prohibiting the interstate transportation or importation of live Asian carp without a permit  Congress passed the original Lacey Act in 1900 and the Lacey Act Amendments in 1981  which make it unlawful to import  export  transport  buy or sell fish  wildlife and plants taken or possessed in violation of federal  state or tribal law  This legislation would not interfere with existing state regulations of Asian carp  and permits to transport or purchase live Asian carp could be issued for scientific  medical or educational purposes        In addition to Levin  Voinovich and Feingold  other cosponsors of the Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act include Sens  Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   Norm Coleman  R Minn   Sherrod Brown  D Ohio  Barack Obama  D Ill   and Richard Durbin  D Ill        Aquatic invasive species threaten biodiversity nationwide  especially in the Great Lakes    The leading pathway for these aquatic invaders is maritime commerce   In the late 1980s  zebra mussels were released in the Great Lakes after crossing the Atlantic Ocean in the ballast tanks of ships from the Mediterranean   Zebra mussels created such a problem for the Great Lakes that Congress passed legislation in 1990 and 1996 requiring ballast water management for ships entering the Great Lakes  which has reduced  but not eliminated  the threat of new aquatic invasions         Invasive species are also an economic drain   Estimates of the annual economic damage caused nationwide by invasive species range as high as  137 billion   Because the Great Lakes fisheries are valued at  4 billion annually  preventing invasions into the Great Lakes from ballast water  hulls or the system of canals connecting the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and Atlantic Ocean is critical   Once an exotic species establishes itself  it is almost impossible to eradicate and usually difficult to prevent from moving throughout the nation
