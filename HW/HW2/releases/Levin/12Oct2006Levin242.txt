                                                                                       Itinerary    Along with Senators John Warner  Jeff Sessions and Mark Pryor  I visited Jordan  Iraq and Israel   A planned visit to Lebanon had to be canceled when our plane experienced mechanical trouble        In Jordan  we had an opportunity to visit with King Abdullah         In Iraq  we met with U S  Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad  General George Casey  Commander  Multinational Force   Iraq  Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli  Commanding General  Multinational Corps   Iraq  Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki  President Jalal Talabani  and Deputy President Tarik Al Hashimi in Baghdad   We also visited Al Taqqadum Air Base in Al Anbar province  where we met with Marine Major General Richard Zilmer  Commanding General  Multinational Force   West   Finally  we met with General John Abizaid  the Commander  Central Command  in Amman  Jordan  upon our return from Iraq          In Israel we met with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert  Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni  Defense Minister Amir Peretz  U S  Ambassador Richard Jones and his country team  and U S  Consul General Jacob Walles      Discussions    We had a good discussion with King Abdullah about Iraq and learned of his concerns about the growing influence of Iran in the region   This was a concern that was echoed throughout our visit        In Iraq  we learned from Prime Minister Maliki  President Talibani and Vice President Hashimi of an agreement in principle on a plan to end the sectarian violence during the holy season of Ramadan and beyond   The agreement  whose details were still being worked out  had the concurrence of the representatives of all political parties  including those who controlled the militias   The agreement  which was to be signed by all the parties was to contain a series of principles or rules that would lead to a cessation of violence   Prime Minister Maliki publicly announced the plan subsequent to our departure from Iraq but the details were sketchy and thus far the plan does not appear to have resulted in even a diminution of sectarian violence   It appears to be tenuous and omits the most important element   specific steps leading to disarming and disbanding the militias        From our military leaders  we learned of the continuing progress in training and equipping the Iraqi Army and of the operation to secure Baghdad   The operation is designed to clear Baghdad  neighborhood by neighborhood with U S  forces in the lead and Iraqi forces in support  followed by holding those neighborhoods with Iraqi forces in the lead  and then a building or reconstruction program by the Iraqi government to provide essential services and improve the lives of all residents of Baghdad   To date  no reconstruction had taken place and no clearing had been attempted in Sadr City  the area in which the Mahdi Army  the largest and most violent militia  is located        Prime Minister Maliki advised that the political conditions had to be set before the operation could be extended to Sadr City   According to both Iraqi and U S  officials  this would involve a commitment of hitherto radical cleric Moqtada al Sadr and his followers to advancement of their interests through the political process rather than by force so that as many members of the Mahdi Army as possible would voluntarily disarm   The fact that Sadr ordered his followers on the previous Friday to lay their weapons aside for the time being provides some hope  but the continuation of sectarian violence  including kidnapings and assassinations  may mean that Sadr is not serious or that he lacks control of a sizeable portion of the Mahdi Army   Both Prime Minister Maliki and Deputy President Hashimi are strongly opposed to any discussion about U S  troop reductions  calling it premature          In our visit to al Anbar province  we learned that  unlike elsewhere in Iraq where sectarian violence is the biggest threat  the insurgency  which is increasingly dominated and led by al Qaeda  is the main threat   Our Marine leadership in al Anbar advises that 30 percent of all contracts  including U S  Government let contracts paid for with U S  taxpayer dollars  goes to al Qaeda   Although this province  which is almost exclusively populated by Sunni Arabs  violently opposes the perceived occupation by the U S  led Coalition  local tribal leaders over the last several weeks are seeking to come together to oppose the insurgency  as they view the Coalition as less of a threat to them than al Qaeda   We also learned that an obstacle to defeating the insurgency is the fact that the central government has been withholding funds from Al Anbar province and although the Iraqi Army has been developing fairly well  there are insufficient numbers in the province due to a lack of focus by the central government there        Meanwhile  U S  Commanders continue to work with the Iraqi leadership on a plan  including benchmarks and goals for the turnover of additional areas to the Iraqi security forces   a roadmap which  if followed  would result in a reduction in the number of U S  forces   General Casey said the plan would be ready by the end of the year   He believes that the Iraqi Army will be in a position to take on the insurgency throughout Iraq by the end of 2007  with limited support from the Coalition          Ambassador Khalilzad said that Iraqi leaders need to show real progress on governance and violence by the end of the year        Our visit to Israel came as the last Israeli forces in southern Lebanon were replaced by the UN Interim Force in Lebanon  UNIFIL  and the Lebanese Army   While others may debate who lost or won the conflict and whether Hezbollah is strengthened or weakened  President Olmert and his Ministers are firmly of the view that Hezbollah leader Nasrallah did not anticipate the destructive reaction of Israel to his provocations and  although  he had not been deterred in the past  they are convinced that Hezbollah will be deterred in the future by the knowledge that Israel   s response would be strong      Concluding Thoughts    There appears to be a consensus in the region that Iran   s influence has been enhanced   As the supporter  supplier and trainer of Hezbollah and Hamas  Iran has emerged as the primary concern of Israel and moderate Arab nations in the region  Israel is determined  however  not to make concessions against its interests to advance the peace process   Syria is also a concern  given its role as a bridge between Iran and Hezbollah   Nations in the region are looking to the United States to take the lead in dealing with Iran  including preventing it from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability        The Middle East region presents a number of challenges to the United States and its interests   Iraq continues to burden the United States  putting a strain on our military forces and their families at a substantial human and economic cost   There is a glimmer of hope in Prime Minister Maliki   s plan  but details are sketchy  results thus far are not encouraging  and  if the success of his initial reconciliation plan that he issued when he came into office in April is a predictor  it will fail   Meanwhile  Iran   s influence in Iraq is gaining strength and is growing elsewhere in the region   Moderate Arab Governments view this development with increasing concern  perhaps opening up an opportunity for advances in relations between those governments and Israel because of Iran being a common threat          The Iraqis must take the steps necessary to deal with sectarian violence and to defeat the insurgency   This will require concession and compromise on all sides   The militias must be disarmed  peacefully if possible  to avoid all out civil war  oil revenues must be equitably distributed  and all Iraqis must believe they have a stake in the Iraq nation   Iraqi leaders must be convinced that U S  forces will not put themselves in a crossfire of a civil war   I remain convinced that a phased redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq should commence by the end of this year  accompanied by a change in the mission of those forces to one of training and supporting Iraqi security forces  targeted counterinsurgency operations  and protection of U S  personnel and facilities  so that the Iraqi leaders will understand that our military presence in Iraq is neither permanent nor unconditional or open ended   Only then will they be forced to make the necessary political compromises  i e  sharing political power and oil resources        The best hope of success in Iraq  where hope is in short supply  if one is a realist  is that Iraqi political leaders be given a heavy dose of reality        The status quo is not working   The Administration needs to deliver that message   While it is useful for Members of Congress to deliver it  and President Bush and Ambassador Khalilzad have specifically said it is useful for Iraqi leaders to hear it from Members of Congress   it does not have the same impact without the Administration delivering it directly        The Administration needs to tell the Iraqi leaders to end their illusion that our presence is open ended  that  as President Talabani put it  we are there until the Iraqis ask us to leave  regardless of whether they do their part to end the political gridlock   The Administration must deliver the straight message that the Iraqi leaders  and they alone  can defeat the insurgency and they and they alone will decide whether they want to unify their country or whether they want to have a civil war        The Iraqi leaders  if informed that our presence is going to be reduced at a specific point down the road  will be forced to meet a deadline  and only such an action forcing mechanism will have the desired results   In other words  the Iraqis need to look into the abyss of all out civil war in order to avoid it        I appreciate the opportunity I had to meet with U S  military personnel of all ranks and rates  a number of whom hail from Michigan   I found their morale high  their dedication firm  and their professionalism extraordinary   America is well served by these outstanding people and all Americans are proud of their service and awed by their sacrifice
