                                                               Opening Statement of Senator Carl Levin  Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on the DOD Inspector General   s Tanker Accountability Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr  Chairman  I would like to start by thanking Senator McCain for the critical role that he has played in bringing to light the problems with the Air Force tanker lease program that we will hear about at today   s hearing   I think we all know that  but for Senator McCain   s tenacity  these problems probably would not have come to light        The Inspector General   s tanker accountability report identifies serious deficiencies in the tanker lease program   It is no small matter that the report finds a number of senior OSD and Air Force officials responsible for actions that are inconsistent with the requirements of law and regulation        Unfortunately  Mr  Schmitz  I believe that critical gaps in this report have placed a cloud over it and indeed over the Inspector General   s office   In my view  the report fails to discuss critical issues  omits critical material  and redacts key portions of the report in a manner that raises serious questions about whether this report meets applicable requirements for the independence of Inspectors General   In particular         In a January 19  2005  letter to the Inspector General  the former Secretary of the Air Force defended his conduct of the tanker lease program  in part  by stating that White House  OMB and OSD officials played a significant role in moving the program forward and that it is therefore unfair to judge the actions of Air Force officials without reference to the actions of White House  OMB and OSD officials   The letter reads in part           L imiting any review to the Air Force  and not OSD  Office of the Secretary of Defense   only contributes to the myth that this  the tanker lease  was exclusively an Air Force proposal   It was not   It was a proposal of the Department of Defense and the Administration  and it consistently was supported by three of the four congressional defense committees                 Indeed  it would be difficult to preserve the credibility of the inspector general process or the investigation results if the investigation is arbitrarily limited to Air Force personnel or Air Force processes  or even DOD personnel and processes                  M embers and committees of congress  as well as the White House  the Office of Management and Budget in particular  were involved from the earliest days and frequently along the way   You simply cannot gain a proper perspective of how good and decent people tried to do the right thing by our warfighters and the American taxpayer without looking at every aspect of how this program developed and evolved   If you are going to undertake this investigation  then I believe you should in all fairness obtain the full cooperation of the Secretary of Defense  the White House and congressional leadership for your inquiry         Mr  Schmitz  your tanker accountability report does not contain any response to that point   If in fact you inquired about the role played by the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense and senior White House officials in the tanker lease program  that information is not reflected in the report   The extent to which the Secretary  Deputy Secretary  or senior White House officials authorized  approved  encouraged or directed the actions of the officials who are named in the report has a direct bearing on the responsibility of those officials  and the omission of this information makes the report so incomplete as to be misleading        Our ability to fully and fairly assess the responsibility of senior OSD officials is further undermined by your decision to redact references to the role of the White House out of the report   In the absence of this material  it is not possible for us to assess whether the responsibility of the officials named in the report is mitigated by the actions of other unnamed officials who are their superiors   These redactions are made not only from e mails between Department of Defense officials  but also from Secretary Roche   s letter  from Boeing e mails and even the text of the report itself   There is no legal authority that would conceivably justify the redaction of this material from the report       Equally disturbing is the fact that these omissions and redactions in your Inspector General report appear to have been undertaken in consultation with staff in the Office of White House Counsel   In an April 29  2005  letter to the Committee  you specifically stated that       The report is complete except for the review by White House Counsel to ensure compliance with the protocols agreed to by  Senator Warner   Senator McCain  Majority Leader Frist  and Judge Gonzales      The report itself footnotes some  but not all  of the redactions with the statement that material has been omitted    because staff of the White House counsel has indicated its intent to invoke an agreement between Members of Congress and the White House             I am told that you conducted some two weeks of negotiations with the White House over these redactions and omissions          Mr  Schmitz  when you were confirmed by this Committee  you assured us that every audit and investigation you conducted as Inspector General would be    independent  unbiased  and free from outside interference      The Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General require no less   Those standards state that Inspectors General    report both to the head of their respective agencies and to the Congress      They also provide that          The Inspector General and OIG staff must be free both in fact and appearance from personal  external  and organizational impairments to independence        The Inspector General and OIG staff should avoid situations that could lead reasonable third parties with knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances to conclude that the OIG is not able to maintain independence in conducting its work          The Standards specifically enjoin Inspectors General to avoid     external interference or influence that could improperly or imprudently limit or modify the scope of OIG work or threaten to do so             Mr  Schmitz  regardless of any agreement that may have been reached between the White House and some Members of Congress relative to the handling of raw documents that were provided to them or to a congressional committee  your report is governed by the requirements of the Inspector General Act and the Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General   You are required by these laws and standards to report your findings to the entire Congress independent of interference from any outside party   You are not and cannot be absolved of your duties as an Inspector General by an agreement between Members of Congress and the White House relative to materials submitted by the executive branch to some Members of Congress   You are required to issue a thorough and independent report   It appears to me that you have done neither
