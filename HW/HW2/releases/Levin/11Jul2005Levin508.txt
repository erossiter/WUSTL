issued a report detailing his three day trip to Iraq and Jordan last week   During the visit  Levin met with Iraqi President Talabani  Iraqi Prime Minister Jaafari  leaders of the Sunni Arab community  senior U S  military and civilian officials  and troops from Michigan        In his report  Levin concludes that he heard surprising optimism for meeting the August 15th deadline for adopting a draft constitution  but that there is great uncertainty that the insurgency will be eliminated or lessened in the near term even if that timetable is met   Levin believes that we need to develop a plan for drawing down coalition forces  which will assure the American public that U S  forces will not be in Iraq indefinitely         Trip Report of Senator Carl Levin  D MI   Iraq and Jordan  July 5   7  2005   I spent two days   July 5 and 6   in Iraq and the morning of July 7 in Jordan   I believe mine was the first Congressional delegation to overnight in Iraq since the start of the war   It was also my fifth post war trip to Iraq       In Iraq  I spent a day and a half in Baghdad meeting with U S  Embassy and military personnel and with Members of the Government of Iraq  including the President and Prime Minister   Additionally  I met with numerous Sunni Arabs  including officials of the Government  a member of the Iraqi National Assembly  and representatives of political groups  including some who had just been added to the Assembly s constitutional drafting committee   I also met with the Chairman of the constitutional drafting committee and the UN Special Representative  whose staff is advising on the drafting of the constitution       I spent the remainder of the second day in Iraq in Fallujah in the Sunni Triangle  where I was able to meet with a number of U S  servicemen and women  and was privileged to have dinner with ten Marine Corps and Navy personnel from Michigan       Once again  I was deeply impressed by the dedication and professionalism of our servicemen and women and with their very high morale   I told them that the Congress and the American people are proud of them and back them one hundred percent  regardless of differing positions on the Administration s policies       One purpose of my trip was to gauge the level of the insurgency   I found strong support for the recent assessment of General Abizaid  the regional U S  Commander  that the insurgency is not weakening and that the flow of foreign jihadists into Iraq has increased   I found no support for Vice President Cheney s view that the insurgency is in its    last throes          Another purpose of my trip was to assess the current and potential level of participation of the Sunni Arabs in the political and constitutional drafting processes  including the likelihood that the Iraqi constitution would be completed by August 15th  and therefore not needing to utilize the one six month extension allowed under Iraqi law    I was surprised by the optimism of most Iraqis that the constitution would be agreed by August 15th and particularly that the Sunni Arab participants  recently increased by 15  would likely be supportive of the draft   If that is true  that will pave the way for a referendum on the draft constitution on October 15th and a national election on December 15th        If this optimism is not borne out  however  a way must be found to bring pressure to bear on the parties to make the reasonable compromises that will be required for agreement on the constitution   Everyone whom I met on this trip advised that none of the Iraqis   not just Shia and Kurd  but also Sunni Arab   want U S  forces to leave now   They want our forces to be less visible and Iraqi security forces to be more visible  but they want us to stay for now         Given that fact and given the consensus that a political solution is necessary if there is any prospect of defeating the insurgency  we need to make clear to the Iraqis that if they are unable to reach agreement on the constitution  we will reconsider our presence in Iraq and that all options will be on the table  including withdrawal    The logic of that position is that if a political settlement is essential if there is a chance of lessening the insurgency  that without a political settlement the insurgency is not going to be defeated even with our presence          I focused on meeting with members of the Sunni Arab community  as I believe they are the key to a successful political process in Iraq   Most of them realize it was a mistake for them not to have participated in the January elections and they want to participate in the drafting of a constitution and in the follow on elections   At the same time  the so called former regime element that is fueling the insurgency in an attempt to block a political settlement comes from the Sunni Arab community  and too many members of that community sympathize with and provide support for the insurgents       There are a number of issues that will need to be resolved if a draft constitution is to be agreed upon by August 15th   These include the role of Islam  the form of the government  i e  parliamentary or presidential   the relationship between the national government and the provinces and the degree to which natural resources will belong to the provinces or the national government  and the degree of autonomy that will reside in the regions   Since the oil resources of Iraq are located in the Shia south and the Kurdish north  these are issues that are extremely important to the Sunni Arabs  whose area lacks oil resources       The decision of the National Assembly to accept 15 Sunni Arabs as members of the constitutional drafting committee  despite the Sunni Arabs lack of participation in the election  hopefully augurs well for the kind of compromises that will need to be made by all three of the main political factions for a draft constitution to be reached             Although the successful drafting of a constitution  with the active participation of the Sunni Arab community  is very important and may help create an environment within which the insurgency can be dramatically reduced  it will not automatically achieve that result   The Sunni Arabs with whom we met  although from different groups  complained of the extended detention of their brethren  the perceived focus of raids by Coalition and Iraqi security forces on their community  the forced unemployment of hundreds of thousands of Sunni Arabs fired in the de Baathification process and denied the pensions to which they contributed   They expressed a preference for the U S  military to leave the cities and to locate on bases removed from populated areas  and the need for at least a rough estimate as to when Coalition forces will be withdrawn      I explored in depth the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces   It is clear that a great deal of time was wasted during the existence of the Coalition Provisional Authority or CPA   While it appears that progress is being made now  it is moving slowly and will take quite some time before Iraqis will be capable of dealing with the insurgency on their own       In his recent speech to the nation on Iraq  President Bush said  with respect to the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces  that    as Iraqis stand up  we will stand down      General Casey  the overall commander on the ground in Iraq  acknowledged to me that he is working on a plan whereby units of the Iraqi security forces would first partner with Coalition military units and gradually take the lead in military operations  then will assume control in selected provinces  and gradually assume control more broadly until they ultimately can control the entire country   Part of that plan provides for Coalition forces to be reduced as Iraqi security forces become more and more capable       I also spoke to General Casey and to Iraqi officials about the need for greater progress in the review of Iraqis detained by Coalition or Iraqi forces and the need to either release or try them   While some progress has been made in this area  it has been too slow in coming and much more must be done and done quickly       In Jordan  I was pleased to be able to meet with King Abdullah   King Abdullah had just finished presiding over the closing session of a three day International Islamic Conference that he had organized    This visionary and critically important Conference was attended by top Muslim authorities from around the globe   It was aimed at finding common principles among various Muslim schools of thought and isolating and deligitimatizing those who preach violence in the name of Islam                   Two things need to happen within the next 40 days to improve chances of a successful outcome in Iraq       A draft of the Iraqi constitution needs to be agreed and sent to the National Assembly by the constitutional committee no later than August 15   the timetable the Iraqis have set for themselves   All of the people with whom I spoke   whether Sunni  Shia  or Kurd   agree that that date should and can be met       There also needs to be a more detailed road map for drawing down U S  forces   General Casey  commander of the multi national forces in Iraq  has said that it should be possible for a fairly significant reduction in U S  force levels in the first few months of next year   But what is so far missing are the decision criteria for determining when that reduction can begin so that presidential rhetoric and statements of intent are turned into a credible and reassuring roadmap for Iraqis taking ownership of the risks and responsibility for their own security and survival         After much prodding by Congress  the Administration has finally created and implemented a capability assessment system for determining the readiness of Iraqi military and police units to conduct counter insurgency operations   whether alongside of Coalition units  or in the lead but with Coalition support  or independently   Now there must be a detailed plan  mutually agreed to by the Coalition and Iraqis  with measurable benchmarks to determine progress  and with a reasonable estimate of the time required to reach those benchmarks   Only in this way can we know the approximate number of Iraqi units that need to be capable of counter insurgency operations so that coalition units can first withdraw from cities and other visible locations and begin a withdrawal from the country as a whole       It is essential that such a plan be promptly agreed to and implemented  and its outline publicly announced  so as to provide reassurance to the American public which is expressing growing concern about simply being told we need to    stay the course    in Iraq  and to the Iraqi public which needs to see that U S  forces will not be in their country indefinitely   Both publics must see that the President s statement that    as the Iraqis stand up  we will stand down    is not just a bumper sticker slogan       Secretary Rice has said that we will be in Iraq as long as we are needed   Without adopting and implementing a measured and credible plan  coalition forces could be    needed for    an indeterminate time   Without such a plan  Iraqis may never assume the responsibility for taking back their country from the insurgents and taking the risks and making the compromises necessary to chart their own destiny       Finally  while I was surprised by the high level of optimism about the August 15 date being met for agreement on a draft Iraqi constitution  I was given a sobering assessment about the current and future strength of the insurgency       Even if the timetable for adopting a constitution is met  and even if a plan is agreed upon for phasing in capable Iraqi military forces to take over responsibility for security so U S  forces in Iraq can simultaneously be reduced  there is still great uncertainty that the insurgency will be eliminated or lessened in the near term       But  while taking those steps doesn t guarantee success  they could help change the dynamic in Iraq and provide the only way a poorly thought through and mistake ridden U S  policy in Iraq can still reach a successful conclusion
