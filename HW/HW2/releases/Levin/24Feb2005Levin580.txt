Services by Accounting Firms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   today released a letter supporting proposed rules to strengthen auditor independence and limit the ability of auditors to sell tax shelters to the publicly traded companies they audit   Levin also released a   GAO  with data on the tax shelter services actually provided in recent years by accounting firms to public companies and the companies    officers and directors        For more than a year  the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  on which Levin serves as the Ranking Minority Member  has been examining actions taken by professional firms  including accounting firms  to promote abusive tax shelters           The Subcommittee   s investigation showed abusive tax shelters were being mass marketed by major accounting firms     said Levin      In response  the accounting oversight board has proposed new rules to keep accounting firms out of the aggressive tax shelter business   Today   s GAO report provides further evidence of accounting firm involvement in tax shelters and why the new rules are needed   Hopefully  those rules will be finalized in the next few months   If we are going to restore public confidence in the financial statements of our public companies  auditors of those companies can   t be selling them abusive tax shelters that distort and misrepresent the companies    tax liabilities and income           The 13 page letter released today strongly supports the rules proposed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  PCAOB  to increase auditor independence and reduce conflicts of interest related to tax shelter services provided by auditors to the public companies they audit   The proposed rules would require registered public accounting firms to maintain independence from the public companies they audit  and bar them from obtaining contingent fees from their audit clients  providing tax services to audit client executives who oversee the company   s financial statements  and promoting aggressive tax positions to the public companies they audit        The Levin letter cites the Subcommittee   s work on abusive tax shelter promoters as evidence of the need for the rules   It also recommends that the proposed rules be further strengthened in several ways   It recommends  for example  amending the proposed auditor independence rule to require auditors to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest as well as actual conflicts   The letter also recommends allowing accounting firms to promote to public companies only those tax products which would be very likely to be upheld in court  rather than tax products with a lesser probability of being upheld in court        The GAO report released today  which was prepared at Levin   s request  provides an analysis of data on how many Fortune 500 companies obtained tax shelter services from their auditor or another accounting firm   Using data compiled by Standard   Poor   s on public corporations and Internal Revenue Service data on tax shelters  GAO determined that for the five year period  1998 to 2003  207 of the Fortune 500 companies  or 40   purchased tax shelter services from a third party  of which 114 obtained them from an accounting firm  and 61 from their own auditor        The GAO report also found that 57 of the Fortune 500 companies saw one or more of their officers or directors obtain tax shelter services from a third party  of which 33 had obtained these services from an accounting firm  and 17 from their company   s own auditor        GAO estimated that  altogether  114 of the Fortune 500 companies and 4400 individuals in the IRS database had obtained tax shelter services from an accounting firm  resulting in estimated total tax revenue loss to the U S  Treasury of about  32 billion   When GAO considered all tax shelters for all years in the IRS database  not just tax shelters promoted by accounting firms  it found that 207 Fortune 500 companies and over 10 300 individuals in the IRS database had engaged in tax shelter transactions with an estimated total tax revenue loss of nearly  129 billion               GAO report
