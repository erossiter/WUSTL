Booked Expenses      WASHINGTON     Tomorrow  Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate   s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  will hold a hearing entitled     Executive Stock Options   Should the IRS and Stockholders Be Given Different Information      The hearing will examine corporate accounting and tax rules that require corporations to report one set of stock option compensation figures to investors on their financial statements and completely different figures to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  on their tax returns          Stock options are a major factor in the growing gap     now chasm     between executive pay and average worker pay     said Levin      Companies pay their executives with stock options in part because  right now  those stock options often generate huge tax deductions that are 2  3  even 10 times larger than the stock option expense shown on the company books   For example  nine companies we examined claimed stock option tax deductions over five years that exceeded their stock option expenses by more than  1 billion  or 575   even after using tougher new accounting rules to calculate the book expense   New IRS data  examining tax returns for periods ending between December 2004 to June 2005  has identified a massive stock option book tax gap of  43 billion  which means U S  companies legally reduced their taxes by billions of dollars for that period by claiming  43 billion more in stock option tax deductions than the stock option compensation amount shown on their books   Those companies did not break the law  they are benefitting from an outdated and overly generous stock option tax rule that produces tax deductions that often far exceed the companies    reported expenses             Stock options are valuable and legitimate incentive tools used to reward and retain high performing executives     said Coleman      However  anything can be problematic in excess  and I fear we have reached that point   It is clear that favorable tax and accounting rules have caused companies to issue far too many stock options on far too generous terms  greatly contributing to the meteoric rise in executive pay   While I would agree that exceptional performance demands exceptional pay  it is troubling to investors when mediocrity is rewarded with a king   s ransom   It is imperative that companies take steps to ensure that top executives    pay is fair and deserved   This requires that companies open their compensation decisions to shareholder scrutiny by providing clear and complete disclosures of executive pay to investors          Stock options give employees the right to buy company stock at a set price for a specified period of time  usually 10 years   According to Forbes  for the chief executive officers  CEOs  at 500 of the largest U S  companies  average CEO pay in 2006 was  15 2 million  including an average gain of  7 3 million from exercised stock options  which provided about 48  of the total   CEO pay is now estimated at nearly 400 times average worker pay  compared to a pay gap of 300 times in 2004  and 100 times in 1990       Publicly traded corporations are required by law to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  GAAP  issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB   which is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC    Until recently  GAAP allowed corporations to show a zero expense on their financial statements for most stock options   In 2005  FASB issued a new accounting rule  Financial Accounting Standard  FAS  123R  requiring companies to show an expense on their books equal to the stock options    fair value on the date they are granted       Under Section 83 of the tax code  first enacted in 1969  the stock option tax deduction does not reflect the expense shown on a company   s books   Instead  the stock option deduction is calculated on the date that a stock option is exercised  which is often years after it is granted   The deduction is equal to the difference between what the employee paid to exercise the option and the market value of the shares on the exercise date       Because the accounting rule values stock options on their grant date  and the tax deduction values stock options on their exercise date  the two numbers do not match   The data indicates that  in most cases  the tax deduction exceeds the book expense   Stock options are the only type of compensation expense where companies are allowed to take a tax deduction that exceeds the expense shown on their books       At the hearing  the IRS will present newly available information on the size of the stock option book tax difference   Data from a new M 3 Schedule required to be filed by large corporations shows that corporate tax returns for periods ending between December 31  2004  and June 30  2005  reported stock option tax deductions that were collectively  43 billion  larger than the amounts shown on company books for options granted during the tax year covered by the returns   The  43 billion was about 30  of the entire book tax difference reported by companies on the M 3   The IRS also found that 82  of the  43 billion book tax difference was attributable to just 250 companies       The M 3 data does not reflect the new stock option accounting rule that requires stock option expensing beginning in 2006   To understand how the new accounting rule would affect the book tax difference  the Subcommittee asked nine corporations to calculate what their book expense would have been under FAS 123R for options exercised between 2002 and 2006  and compare that expense to their tax deductions   That analysis showed the tax deductions for the nine companies combined were over  1 billion  or 575   larger than their book expense  even under the new rule       The hearing will hear from three Fortune 500 companies that were among the nine who helped the Subcommittee with its calculations  the Acting Commissioner of the IRS  the SEC Director of Corporation Finance  and three stock option experts          It is time to take a serious look at whether it makes sense to have two completely different sets of stock option rules for financial accounting and tax purposes     said Levin     especially when the result is a revenue loss of billions of dollars
