announced that the Defense appropriations bill for the 2008 fiscal year  which the Senate approved last night  includes a total of  50 million in funding to support manufacturing technology initiatives by the Department of Defense  DoD    These funds support the DoD provisions that were included in the American Manufacturing Initiative  AMI  proposed by Michigan Democrats earlier this year          The devastation our manufacturing sector has experienced in Michigan and across the country has been exacerbated by the Bush Administration   s failure to support policies in support of U S  manufacturers     said Levin      We put together the AMI proposal to establish a plan to get our manufacturing sector back on track   We   ll continue to fight for all of the pieces of the AMI proposal  but these defense manufacturing initiatives are important steps in the process   Advanced manufacturing technologies and a healthy industrial base will help ensure that we can produce the defense systems that we need  as well as contributing to our nation   s economic competitiveness          AMI is a comprehensive agenda to revitalize our domestic manufacturing industry and respond to the loss of millions of U S  manufacturing jobs  AMI aims to bring together government  private industry  and academia in a robust partnership aimed at turning around the manufacturing sector of the U S  economy   Additional details about AMI can be found at http   levin senate gov newsroom release cfm id 274509       Senator Levin led a bipartisan group of 15 Senators in securing funding for the following three competitive DoD initiatives related to manufacturing research and development            30 million to establish an Industrial Base Innovation Fund to support the DoD   s ability to address specific shortfalls in the defense industrial base to meet short term surge manufacturing requirements  The surge production requirements of current operations have stressed the industrial base and lead to intolerable wait times for the delivery of some much needed materiel to the battlefield   This Industrial Base Innovation Fund would focus on the development of advanced manufacturing technologies that can reduce the time required to produce high demand items such as body and vehicle armor  Improvised Explosive Device  IED  jammers  and Mine Resistant  Ambush Protected  MRAP  vehicles during surges in military operations            10 million for a High Performance Manufacturing Technology Initiative to advance manufacturing technologies that support the defense industrial base  improve the performance of defense systems  and reduce life cycle costs  These funds would further efforts in the development of test beds and prototypes of advanced manufacturing technologies  promote the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes throughout the industrial base  and support the development of technology roadmaps to ensure that the DoD can access required manufacturing and technology capabilities in critical defense technologies             10 million for a Disruptive Manufacturing Technology Initiative to support long term research into new manufacturing techniques  These types of innovations  possibly in areas such as nanomanufacturing  would allow the DoD to gain easier access to affordable low volume  state of the art production capabilities  as is often needed in the acquisition of defense unique technologies of low density  high demand systems       Advanced weapons systems are increasingly costly to develop  field and sustain   A February 2006 report by the Defense Science Board  DSB  regarding the DoD   s Manufacturing Technology Program points out that manufacturing technology plays a critical role in addressing development  acquisition  and sustainment problems associated with these programs         In its report  the DSB recommended increased funding for the Manufacturing Technology Program over a 5 year period to a level of    one percent of the research and development budget     to align the Department with the level of manufacturing technology investments in the early 1980s   For fiscal year 2008  one percent of the President   s requested research and development budget for DoD would equal approximately  750 million   However  the DoD Manufacturing Technology Program received only  193 3 million in the President   s budget request   The funding proposed by Levin that was included in this bill would help to address this shortfall       A conference committee will now work to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill
