                                                                                                                                                      Coleman     Levin report cites evidence that former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua and recently reelected British MP George Galloway were granted lucrative  oil allocations  from Hussein regime      WASHINGTON    Today Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Carl Levin  D MI   Chairman and Ranking Member respectively of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  PSI   issued a joint staff report disclosing evidence that the former French Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua and recently reelected member of the British Parliament George Galloway were granted lucrative oil allocations under the United Nations Oil for Food Program  OFF        The program was designed to permit Iraq to sell its oil and use those proceeds to purchase food  medicines  and other humanitarian goods for its people  As PSI   s year long investigation has demonstrated  Saddam Hussein quickly devised multiple abuses of the OFF Program in an effort to undermine UN sanctions and obtain illicit income  PSI s report and exhibits regarding Pasqua and Galloway   s activities can be found in the attached PDF files        One of the Hussein regime   s chief methods of manipulating the OFF Program was through  oil allocations   The attached report shows that Pasqua received 11 million barrels in oil allocations  while Galloway received allocations of 20 million barrels of oil  The Iraqi government distributed its oil by selling the right to buy a set number of barrels     an  allocation      to prospective buyers  Under the OFF Program  Iraq was permitted to sell oil to whomever it wanted  The Hussein regime awarded these oil contracts to influential foreign officials  among others  in an effort to maximize Iraq   s influence around the world  These allocation holders    essentially gatekeepers to Iraqi oil     would sell their right to buy under priced Iraqi crude to traditional oil producers and in turn received a  commission   which typically ranged from 3 to 30 cents per barrel        The staff report presents numerous documents from the Hussein era Ministry of Oil that expressly identify Charles Pasqua and George Galloway as allocation recipients  In addition  the evidence shows that Pasqua sought to conceal these transactions because he  feared political scandals   The evidence also indicates that George Galloway may have used a children s cancer foundation in connection with at least one of his allocations        The Subcommittee s report presents detailed evidence    including numerous documents created by Saddam Hussein s Ministry of Oil and testimony of senior Hussein regime officials    that former French Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua and recently reelected Member of the British Parliament George Galloway received lucrative oil allocations under the Oil for Food Program   said Coleman   This report exposes how Saddam Hussein turned the Oil for Food Program on its head and used the Program to reward his political allies like Pasqua and Galloway  The report includes evidence that Saddam Hussein personally approved allocations to Charles Pasqua  and that Pasqua    fear ed  political scandals    because of these secret allocations  The report also shows that Galloway was granted allocations for a whopping 20 million barrels of oil  All told  this report paint a disturbing picture of the dark under side of the Oil for Food Program          While  according to former Secretary of State Colin Powell  U N  sanctions on Iraq successfully prevented Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction  the sanctions program had some weaknesses as well   said Levin   The Pasqua and Galloway oil allocations show how Saddam Hussein misused the Oil for Food program to reward people he hoped would work against U N  sanctions  The United States and other U N  Security Council members made a fundamental mistake in allowing Saddam Hussein to award Oil for Food contracts and issue oil allocations         New evidence regarding oil allocations and other matters surrounding the misuse of the Oil for Food scandal will be presented at a hearing Tuesday  May 17  entitled Oil For Influence  How Saddam Used Oil to Reward Politicians and Terrorist Entities Under the United Nations Oil for Food Program  The hearing is scheduled for 9 30 a m  in Room 562 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building        The May 17th hearing will be the third hearing the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has held on the UN   s OFF Program  It will detail how Saddam Hussein manipulated the OFF Program to win influence and reward friends in order to undermine sanctions  In particular  this hearing will present evidence detailing how Saddam rewarded foreign officials with lucrative oil allocations that could be converted to money  The hearing will also examine the illegal surcharges paid on Iraqi oil sales  using examples involving the recently indicted U S  company  Bayoil
