                                                                                                                                                          Senators hold Senate symposium to review data  on the first three years of availability of buprenorphine      WASHINGTON     At a Senate symposium on Thursday  Sens  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Orrin Hatch  R Utah  will hail the success of buprenorphine  a medication that helps to block the craving for heroin   They will stress that increasing the number of physicians who are certified to dispense and prescribe the medication could help substantially in reaching more heroin addicts   A 2000 law sponsored by Hatch and Levin  the Drug Addiction Treatment Act  made it legal for physicians to distribute the medication in their offices  and the FDA approved its use in 2002  a revolutionary breakthrough   But since its legalization  less than two percent of primary care physicians have applied for certification to treat patients in their private offices with buprenorphine        Hatch and Levin are hosting the symposium and have invited officials from the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  who will highlight the findings of a three year study that has tracked the availability and use of buprenorphine   At the symposium  physicians  patients  and health policy experts will provide first hand accounts of office based buprenorphine treatment             In the past three years  we have seen the dramatic life saving impact that buprenorphine can make in the lives of heroin addicts   We have seen hopefulness in situations where hope had seemed lost     Levin said      Buprenorphine can only be effective  however  if patients have access to it and an adequate number of physicians are prescribing it    This study by HHS confirms our hopes about the effectiveness of buprenorphine and also helps to illuminate things that need to be done to help more patients reach this powerful medicine              We need to break the pernicious cycle between heroin addiction and crime     said Hatch     If we can encourage thousands of addicts into rehabilitation today  they and their families will be able to live more productive lives tomorrow  We can make major gains in our nation   s crime problem and improve the social structure and stability of many families who today live under the scourge of drug abuse           Under the law  physicians must obtain a certification to disperse buprenorphine  but only    7 518 total physicians have done so   Among general practitioners  including internal medicine and family medicine practices  only 2 910 physicians have been certified out of 242 924 potential doctors in these practice areas  or less than two percent        In addition to establishing a process through which trained physicians can dispense or prescribe buprenorphine  the Drug Addiction Treatment Act required the Secretary of HHS to evaluate the impact of office based buprenorphine treatment   In compliance with this requirement  the Secretary directed the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to conduct a survey to determine 1  the availability of the office based treatment  2  the effectiveness of the office based treatment  and 3  the potential adverse public health consequences        The HHS survey found that buprenorphine treatment is clinically effective and well accepted by patients  the program has increased the availability of medication assisted treatment  adverse effects have been minimal  the 30 patient limit established in DATA and cost reimbursement issues may decrease potential access to treatment  and longer term studies are necessary to determine the relative cost effectiveness of buprenorphine treatment under this program       Participants in the symposium  in addition to Hatch and Levin  include Nora Volkow  MD  Director  National Institute on Drug Abuse  National Institutes of Health  U S  Department of Health and Human Service  H  Westley Clark  MD  JD  MPH  Director  Center for Substance Abuse Treatment  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Herbert Kleber  MD  Professor of Psychiatry and Director  Division on Substance Abuse  College of Physicians and Surgeons  Columbia University  and the New York State Psychiatric Institute  Charles R  Schuster  PhD  Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience  Wayne State University School of Medicine  David Fiellin  MD  ASAM  Associate Professor of Medicine  Yale University School of Medicine  Jim Finch  MD  a Family Practice physician from Durham  NC  and two patients successfully treated with buprenorphine  Korean War veteran Odis Rivers  who is now drug free and no longer taking buprenorphine  and Tess Walker  a college student who has been in treatment for several years and remains free of her addiction to heroine        The Hatch Levin Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000  DATA 2000  established that certified physicians may prescribe certain medications to treat heroin addiction in an office based setting and with take home maintenance prescriptions   This groundbreaking law created an entirely new treatment modality for millions of Americans who suffer from dependence on opioids  which include heroin  morphine  and some prescription painkillers   Prior to passage of this law  medical treatment for opioid addiction and dependence was restricted to designated drug abuse treatment centers
