 and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   today announced funding for many Michigan projects in the Senate version of the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  which the Senate Appropriations Committee passed unanimously last week            Michigan continues to lead the way in performing top notch defense research and providing high quality equipment for our nation   s military services     said Levin  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee      This bill funds vital investments in advanced military technology as well as energy development  robotics  and next generation automotive research   These investments are helping our troops on the ground in Iraq  Afghanistan  and around the world  and they are ensuring that the U S  military remains the best equipped and best trained today and in the future             Michigan is a leader in defense technology  research and manufacturing and provides critical support for our troops in their missions all over the world     said Stabenow     Michigan   s industries and workers have always been an important part of our national defense  and this funding will expand those capabilities to create new jobs in Michigan         The Senate Majority Leader has not yet announced when the Senate will take up the defense appropriations bill   The House of Representatives passed its version of the defense appropriations bill in June   Following Senate passage of the bill  members of the House and Senate will meet in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills   The House and Senate will then vote on the final legislation and send it to the President for his signature      Specific projects for Central and West Michigan follow   Robotics   10 million for an Unmanned
