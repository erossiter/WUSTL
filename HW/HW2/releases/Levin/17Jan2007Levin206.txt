from Detroit to Shanghai      WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Carl Levin  D MI   along with 14 members of Michigan   s Congressional delegation  today sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters urging her to reconsider the decision declining Northwest Airlines    application for additional passenger service frequencies between the United States and China   In September  the delegation sent a letter in support of Northwest   s application to provide nonstop service from Detroit to Shanghai   The most recent letter outlined the economic benefits of such a route and urged the Secretary to consider establishing nonstop service from Michigan in the future              Northwest   s proposed Detroit Shanghai route is critical to manufacturing and commercial interests in the State of Michigan that need improved access to the global marketplace     the Delegation said in the letter      We urge you to reconsider this decision or secure new authority for Northwest to bring new nonstop service to Detroit and the State of Michigan          The full text of the letter follows       January 17  2007   The Honorable Mary Peters  Secretary  U S  Department of Transportation  400 Seventh Street S W   Washington  DC  20590   Dear Madame Secretary    We are writing to express our disappointment with the Department   s tentative decision to award the only available China service to United  which already operates four daily flights to China from two major U S  hubs   Northwest   s proposed Detroit Shanghai is critical to manufacturing and commercial interests in the State of Michigan that need improved access to the global marketplace        Manufacturing business links between Michigan  and the Midwest  and Shanghai are more significant than the other areas under consideration   The Detroit  Midwest  Shanghai market has immense business travel activity   For instance  500 companies in Michigan and northern Ohio alone already have a strong presence in Shanghai   Of the 24 fortune 500 companies in Michigan and northern Ohio  17 have operations in China  and many have made significant investment in the Shanghai region   General Motors alone has investments in China totaling over  2 billion  and Dow Chemical  Visteon and Whirlpool have all established their Asian headquarter offices in Shanghai        In addition  over 20 Chinese companies currently have operations in southeast Michigan     Mainland China currently ranks as Michigan   s second largest export market in Asia behind Japan  and the state   s fifth largest export market overall   Michigan   s manufactured and agricultural exports to mainland China totaled nearly  700 million in 2005 have grown by 252 percent since 1999       The positive economic benefits of this flight will not only touch metro Detroit but will reach beyond to businesses and consumers across Michigan  generating an estimated  160 million annual economic impact       New nonstop service at Detroit is important not only to Michigan    but creates the greatest benefits for the entire eastern region of the United States   The record showed that Northwest   s proposal would have benefited the most passengers  served the most U S  cities  and provided the quickest and most efficient routings to China    And very significantly  manufacturing industries so struggling in the United States would be especially helped by new Detroit Shanghai service  particularly in their efforts to break through Chinese trade barriers and sell their U S  made products in China        We urge you to reconsider this decision or secure new authority for Northwest to bring new nonstop service to Detroit and the State of Michigan      Sincerely    Sen  Debbie Stabenow
