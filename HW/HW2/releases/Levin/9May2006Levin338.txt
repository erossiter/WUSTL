ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee  announced funding for many Michigan projects authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  which the Senate Armed Services Committee passed unanimously last week            As the men and women of our military are engaged in combat action abroad  the Senate Armed Services Committee is working to better equip our forces to address the threats to America   s security now and in the future     said Levin     I am pleased that the committee recognized the high quality of the advanced military technology development performed by the people  companies and universities in Michigan  who continue to provide leading defense products to our nation   s military services   This bill also provides funding for the manufacturing centers and research institutions that play a crucial role in supporting our troops           The Senate Armed Services Committee will offer the bill in the Senate later this week and the Senate is expected to consider it in the coming weeks   The House is expected to take up its version of the defense authorization bill this week   After the House and Senate each pass their version of the legislation  members will meet in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills   The House and Senate will then vote on the final legislation and send it to the President for his signature      Specific projects for northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula follow    2 0 million to continue the development of an advanced thermal management system to increase engine efficiency for Army vehicles  Engineered Machined Products in Escanaba has partnered with TARDEC in the development of these systems       2 0 million for Tactical Vehicle Design Tools   This research would continue the development of a computer based tool that would assist in the design of future Army Tactical Vehicles   This program will further develop computer aided engineering design tools   These tools are now being used on several major military programs including the Army   s Future Combat Systems and the Navy   s DD X    Thermoanalytics of Calumet has worked with TARDEC on comparable research efforts for several years       2 0 million for Dendrimer Enhanced Water Remediation research   This funding will provide for selective removal of contaminants and other hazardous materials in water filtration   Research has shown that dendrimers have remarkable capacity to capture a variety of metal and organic molecules making them ideal materials for water remediation   However  it is difficult to find cost effective nanotechnology based methods that increase the capacity and performance of water filtration units by selective removal of toxic metals and contaminants at the nanoscale and molecular levels  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of dendrimers for reusable cartridges for point of use filtration units   Central Michigan University has extensive experience in this field          1 0 million for Integrated Systems in Sensing  Imaging and Communications Research   Wireless optical communication will be an important technology for highly secure  point to point communication systems   Michigan Technological University has extensive experience in this field through collaborative efforts with the National Science Foundation and the University of Michigan and Michigan State University      Work on these projects will be done in several regions of Michigan    10 million for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Development Initiative   The Unmanned Ground Vehicle Initiative  UGVI  will be implemented by the ground vehicle experts at the Tank Automotive and Armament Research Development and Engineering Center  TARDEC    This funding will be used for integrating and demonstrating sensor technologies  perception hardware and software  and robotic control technologies that are required to enable unmanned ground vehicle  UGV  systems to maneuver with minimal human intervention  for on  and off road missions while at militarily significant speeds   Mature technologies are incorporated in UGV technology demonstrators  so that performance can be evaluated for multiple tactical and sustainment applications         Technical challenges addressed should include obstacle avoidance  perception limitations  intelligent situational behaviors  command and control  frequency of human intervention  and operations in adverse weather  Funding for this project will be executed by TARDEC        8 0 million for the Solid Hydrogen Storage Initiative   This funding will initiate a new merit based research initiative in FY07 to look at solid hydrogen storage systems that would weigh less and take up less volume  allowing vehicles to safely carry more hydrogen onboard  increasing driving range and reducing refueling frequency and cost   Issues to be addressed include development of materials to maximize storage potential  improving the ability to charge and recharge the solid storage systems with hydrogen quickly after use  devising hydrogen release systems that can extract hydrogen from a solid storage system into fuel cells in a controlled  repeatable manner  and making the entire storage systems cost effective relative to other storage systems or more traditional engine technologies       2 0 million for the Hydrogen Logistics Fuel Initiative   This funding will continue the hydrogen logistics initiative established in FY06 at the Defense Logistics Agency   The purpose of this program is to establish an oversight structure and focal point within DoD to monitor technology and policy developments in the area of hydrogen and to develop a comprehensive and integrated strategy  plan for the appropriate use of hydrogen and acquisition of hydrogen to meet those DoD requirements for the future  and make appropriate technology development investments to those requirements   A significant focus will be development of a DoD hydrogen strategy and roadmap and a pilot demonstration of hydrogen refueling infrastructure      Over  1 47 billion for merit based fundamental research to support the military at our nation   s universities and government laboratories  Many Michigan universities  including the University of Michigan  Michigan State  Wayne State  Oakland University  Eastern Michigan University  Kettering University  and Michigan Technological University  perform high quality fundamental research for the Department of Defense in all fields of science and technology
