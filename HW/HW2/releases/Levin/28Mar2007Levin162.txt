                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   will speak at Thursday   s ceremony in the Rotunda of the U S  Capitol honoring the Tuskegee Airmen with the Congressional Gold Medal  the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress   Levin authored the 2006 Senate bill that designated the Tuskegee Airmen as recipients of the medal  Rep  Charlie Rangel  D N Y   sponsored the companion bill in the House of Representatives   Approximately 350 Tuskegee Airmen will be attending the ceremony  about 50 of whom are from Michigan          What is it that these young men saw in our nation which drove them to defend it in the face of the offenses against them and the pain inflicted upon them by laws promoting segregation and practices reflecting bigotry   They must have sensed that  despite the racism and bigotry  that this was a nation worth fighting for     Levin said      They must have seen a spark of hope that this was a country worth dying for and that they  in their courage and patriotism  could help that spark become a flame of justice            Levin   s bill  which included 77 bipartisan cosponsors  highlighted the courageous accomplishments of the airmen as pilots as well as the revolutionary reforms they inspired in the armed forces         The Tuskegee Airmen were not only unique in their military record but also in the revolutionary role they played in paving the way for integration of the U S   military  The largely college educated Tuskegee Airmen overcame the enormous challenges of prejudice and discrimination  succeeding despite obstacles that threatened failure   What made these men exceptional was their willingness to leave their families and put their lives on the line to defend rights that were denied them here at home       The story of the Tuskegee Airmen began in 1941 when President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the creation of an all black flight training program at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama   President Roosevelt did so one day after the NAACP filed suit in federal court on behalf of a Howard University student and others to force the Department of Defense to accept black pilot trainees         The first aviation class of cadets began training at Tuskegee Army Air Field in the summer of 1941   In September 1941  Captain Benjamin O  Davis  Jr   a West Point graduate  became the first African American to fly solo as a U S  Army Air Corps officer   In March 1942  five young black pilots  including Davis  successfully completed training and received Army Air Corps silver pilot wings   Davis later became the first African American to rise to the rank of general in the U S  Air Force       Four hundred fifty African American fighter pilots fought in aerial battles over North Africa  Sicily and Europe during World War II   Sixty six of the pilots died in combat  while another 33 were shot down and captured as prisoners of war   The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 261 aircraft destroyed  148 aircraft damaged  15 553 combat sorties and 1 578 missions   In addition  as an escort fighter wing they never lost a bomber to enemy fighters  German pilots feared and respected them   White American bomber crews referred to them as  Redtailed Angels  because of the bright red paint on the tail assemblies and because of their reputation for not losing bombers to enemy fighters   Altogether  almost 1 000 African American pilots graduated from Tuskegee Institute  with the last class finishing in June 1946       Michigan shares a rich history with the Tuskegee Airmen   In addition to their training at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama  in subsequent years some of the airmen trained at Selfridge Field and Oscoda Field   The late Coleman Young  former mayor of the City of Detroit  trained as a navigator bombardier for the 477th bombardment group of the Tuskegee Airmen   This group was still in training when WWII ended so they never saw combat   However  the important fact is that all of those receiving flight related training     nearly 1 000     were instrumental in breaking the segregation barrier   They all had a willingness to see combat and committed themselves to the segregated training with a purpose to defend their country       Congress recognizes outstanding achievements through the commissioning of Congressional Gold Medals   Since 1776  approximately 300 people and the American Red Cross have received this honor   Awardees include individuals from diverse backgrounds including the military  arts  athletics  aviation  exploration  politics  religion  medicine  science and entertainment
