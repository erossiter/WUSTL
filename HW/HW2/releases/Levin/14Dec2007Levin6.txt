the Asparagus Market Loss Program  and protection for both specialty crop growers and traditional farmers against catastrophic crop losses  this bill is a win for Michigan          Levin continued

good  Michigan has received about  260 million in disaster relief from 1995 to 2006  This fund will ensure it is faster and easier for Michigan farmers to receive these payments
