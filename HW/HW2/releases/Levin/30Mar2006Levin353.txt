Pose Security Risk to U S                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If we can   t ensure the cargo is safe  the trucks need to stop     says Levin      Customs and Border Patrol  CBP  should halt the import of Canadian trash into the United States until CBP can ensure that the containers do not pose a security threat  recommends a bipartisan Senate  released today by Sens  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Norm Coleman  R Minn    the ranking member and chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   The subcommittee report assesses U S  efforts to secure the global supply chain and makes recommendations for bolstering the security of our country   The report was released in conjunction with a subcommittee hearing     Neutralizing the Nuclear and Radiological Threat  Securing the Global Supply Chain     held this morning           We know that Canadian trash trucks pose a security risk  yet hundreds of them cross our borders and enter our communities every day     Levin said      When our country has gone to such great lengths to bolster our security  it is nonsensical that we continue to allow this known security risk   If we can   t ensure the cargo is safe  then the trucks need to stop   It   s that simple           The subcommittee found that Canadian trash trucks entering the U S  pose a unique security risk and are inherently difficult to screen  given the unknown origin of the trash and the dense nature of the cargo   Even with an x ray  the report reveals  it is impossible to see the contents of a container of trash  The volume of the cargo further amplifies these concerns    according to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Inspector General   s office  Canada shipped approximately 100 000 containers of trash across U S  borders into Michigan in 2004 alone        The report lays out three recommendations that would improve the security of Canadian trash imports    Ban Trash Imports  Until U S  Customs can ensure that the supply chain of a trash importer is secure and develops protocols ensuring adequate inspection of trash containers  Customs should not allow trash containers to enter the United States        Adopt Moratorium  Banning trash imports is the right answer to protect U S  security  If a ban is not imposed  at a minimum  DHS should immediately adopt the DHS Inspector General   s recommendation to conduct a risk analysis and develop minimum requirements for selecting and inspecting Canadian trash containers  Until those steps are taken  Customs should place a moratorium on allowing trash containers into the United States       Impose inspection Fees  If a trash import ban is not imposed  Congress should enact into law the provisions recently adopted by the U S  Senate to impose a fee on international shipments of trash to pay for a more rigorous inspection regime to protect U S  citizens from security risks currently associated with trash containers    The provision was proposed by Sen  Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   and cosponsored by Levin        More than 170 000 Michigan citizens have signed my online petition to stop the trash from Canada     Stabenow said      The subcommittee   s report confirms for the rest of the country what the people of Michigan already know     Canadian trash is unsafe  it is a threat to our security and it must stop   I am very pleased that the report calls on Congress to fully implement the inspection fee we included in this year   s budget resolution   I won   t stop fighting until we stop the trash           A January 2006 report by the DHS Inspector General that identified flaws and vulnerabilities associated with the current methods of screening trash containers  but most of its findings were released in an    official use only    version   The January report  which was conducted in response to a request by Levin  Stabenow and Rep  John Dingell  D Dearborn   found that improvements are needed in the inspection process and that ports vary in how they select and inspect cargo   The DHS report recommended that the Commissioner of the CBP conduct a risk analysis and develop minimum requirements for selecting and inspecting trucks carrying Canadian trash   The Congress members have written to DHS Secretary Chertoff asking him to release the report publicly
