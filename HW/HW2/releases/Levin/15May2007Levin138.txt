                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  Claire McCaskill  D Mo   today introduced   PDF  to stop some of the most egregious credit card practices that unfairly deepen or prolong credit card debt held by consumers   The Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act follows an investigation and hearing by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  which Levin chairs and on which McCaskill serves           Credit card issuers too often sock consumers with sky high interest rates and excessive fees  making it harder and harder for families to climb out of debt     Levin said      The goal of this legislation is to put an end to unfair and abusive credit card practices that outrage so many American families   I   m afraid these practices have become too entrenched and too profitable to the credit card companies for the companies to change them on their own   Congress needs to enact pro consumer legislation to put an end to these unfair practices             Credit card companies must be stopped from preying on the most vulnerable Americans with unfair and confusing practices  We have to fight for those who have not hired dozens of lobbyists to make sure that American consumers are not getting ripped off and are fully informed of how these companies are manipulating their financial security     McCaskill said       In October 2006  Levin released a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report analyzing credit card fees  interest rates  and disclosure practices by major credit card issuers   Following the release of the GAO report  Levin directed the Subcommittee to investigate unfair credit card practices that mire so many Americans in debt   In March  Levin chaired a Subcommittee hearing and called as witnesses the chief executive officers of the three largest credit card issuers in the country     Bank of America  JP Morgan Chase Bank and Citigroup     and an Ohio consumer whose personal credit card experiences exemplified many of the outrageous practices       Levin added      Credit card companies are so profitable that they can afford to give up unfair practices like charging interest on debt that is paid on time  charging consumers a fee to pay their bills  doubling or tripling interest rates to penalize late payments or over the limit charges  imposing repeated over the limit fees for a single over the limit purchase  and applying consumers    payments to the parts of their accounts with the lowest interest rates first   It   s past time for Congress to protect consumers from such unfair and abusive credit card practices          The Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act has been endorsed by Consumer Action  Consumer Federation of America  Consumers Union  National Consumer Law Center  U S  PIRG  and the Center for Responsible Lending       A summary of key provisions in the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act follows       Read Senator Levin s floor statement        Read a copy of the bill    PDF      Interest Rates   No Interest on Debt Paid on Time   Prohibit interest charges on any portion of a credit card debt which the card holder paid on time during a grace period      No Trailing Interest   Prohibit added interest charges on

future credit card debt  and not to debt incurred prior to the increase     Credit Card Fees   No Interest on Fees   Prohibit the charging of interest on credit card transaction fees  such as late fees and over the limit fees       Restrictions on Over Limit Fees   Prohibit the charging of repeated over limit fees for a single instance of exceeding a credit card limit  and allow such fees to be

consumers the option of having a fixed credit limit that cannot be exceeded
