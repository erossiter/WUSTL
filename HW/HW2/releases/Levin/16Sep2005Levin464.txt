                                                                                                                                                                  Thank you  Dean Becky Blank  for that kind introduction and your leadership here at the University of Michigan   s Gerald R  Ford School of Public Policy       Marilynn Rosenthal  it is an honor to speak at this lecture endowed in the name of your son  Josh   Your response to heart rending tragedy and grief was to provide a forum for all of us to study and to learn  a fitting memorial to a very bright man who cared about others and about the world around him   I hope my remarks today are worthy of your goals in creating this lecture series       Four years after the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  our nation is struggling to recover from a new tragedy     the horrific effects of Hurricane Katrina   Hundreds have lost their lives   Hundreds of thousands have lost everything   A million people are displaced   Our grief is compounded because of the bungled government response to a predicted natural disaster   Thankfully  there are rays of hope shining through everywhere  and this campus taking in displaced students so that they can continue their education is one of the brightest        The sad fact is  however  that we keep having major failures in government actions or responses   We have had several such major failures in the past four years  including the intelligence failure before September 11th  the intelligence failure relative to Iraq   s weapons of mass destruction  the failure to plan for the post combat period in Iraq  the failure to treat detainees properly at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere  and the failure to plan for  and respond to  a major hurricane in the Gulf Coast          This afternoon  I   d like to share some thoughts with you about what I believe is one of the most significant changes we must make to prevent future failures     that is  insisting on accountability for those who have failed to do their job adequately or professionally or honestly          Specifically  I   d like to talk today about why accountability matters  to look at the absence of accountability for some recent major failures  and then to give my best attempt at explaining why there has been a breakdown in accountability and my best hope for a way forward       If my remarks today seem highly critical  that is because they are   Many Americans  including this one  are deeply angry about these failures because of the personal tragedies that have resulted and because they have left us less secure as a nation   Yet  I hope my remarks will be taken as constructive  not simply critical   That is the spirit in which they are offered      Accountability   At its birth  the United States government was an experiment in accountability   As the Father of the Constitution  James Madison  wrote in the Federalist Papers   The genius of republican liberty seems to demand not only that all power should be derived from the people  but that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people         That is our bedrock   Those entrusted with power are kept in dependence on the people   Elections based on an informed public provide the ultimate in accountability         But while voters can provide accountability on Election Day  the President is responsible every day for holding members of his administration accountable   President Harry Truman understood this  which he made clear with the simple    the buck stops here    sign on his desk in the Oval Office   By the way  Josh was named a Truman Scholar in his junior year at the University of Michigan  the first year this national scholarship was awarded  a real tribute at an early age       Accountability can provide a measure of justice for the victims of a tragedy and some amount of closure for the families involved   That is surely important   But it is also important for the country because holding people and institutions accountable for their actions or inaction is a vital way of improving future performance         That   s why after every military action     large or small     our military conducts an after action review to assess what went right and to learn from mistakes   It is not just about being punitive  it is about improving performance       A Republican President from Michigan  and this School of Public Policy   s namesake  understood this indispensable role of accountability   In 1976  President Gerald Ford spoke about his proposed Intelligence reform legislation   He said     Accountability is the real crux of how you can prevent abuses          Today  however  Harry Truman would be very disappointed   The buck gets passed and passed and never seems to stop anywhere      Intelligence Failures Before 9 11    Let   s begin with the failure to heed the warnings prior to 9 11   The then National Security Advisor would later state     I don t think anybody could have predicted that these people   would try to use an airplane as a missile  a hijacked airplane as a missile      She was wrong   To take just one example  the Federal Aviation Administration   s intelligence unit had warned in 1998 and 1999 about the hijacking threat posed by Al Qaeda     including the possibility that the terrorist group might try to hijack a commercial jet and slam it into a U S  landmark      At best  the National Security Advisor was uninformed        The accountability problem was embedded at all levels  relative to the 9 11 failures   Two of the 9 11 suicide bombers were known to the CIA as Al Qaeda associates  were known to the CIA to have been linked to the suspected attackers of the USS Cole  and at least one was known by the CIA to have entered the U S   But the CIA failed to notify the FBI or immigration of these crucial facts        An FBI agent in Phoenix noticed that    an inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest    were going to flight school to learn how to fly   He went to one of their homes and noticed pictures of Osama Bin Laden on the wall  and the person freely acknowledged that he considered the United States a legitimate target   The agent sent a report to the Bin Laden Unit at the FBI headquarters where it was ignored        Meanwhile  efforts to seek a subpoena to access the computer of another suspected terrorist were short circuited by FBI lawyers and agents who misread the law        These are examples of incompetence  and they point to a deeply troubling conclusion  prior to September 11th  U S  intelligence and law enforcement officials possessed information that may have permitted them to disrupt  limit  or possibly prevent the terrorist attacks         More than a year after the attacks  I asked the CIA Director and the FBI Director if they had held anyone accountable for these obvious failures       The FBI Director replied     Well  it all depends on your definition of accountability  but I would say that I have not held somebody accountable in the sense of either disciplining or firing somebody          The CIA Director replied      I haven   t held anyone accountable yet  sir           Last month  Congress received a report from the CIA   s Inspector General that examined the issue of accountability   It has been reported in the press that the Inspector General found that many people at all levels of the CIA failed in carrying out their jobs  and that he called for an Accountability Board at the CIA        The new Director of the CIA has not indicated whether he will accept that recommendation        Pre War Iraq Intelligence    With no accountability for their failure before 9 11  George Tenet and the CIA had less incentive to get the intelligence right on Iraq   They lived up to those low expectations       The intelligence failures before the Iraq War were massive  The CIA   s errors were all in one direction  making the Iraqi threat appear clearer  sharper  and more imminent than it was  thereby promoting the Administration   s decision to attack Iraq   Nuances  qualifications and caveats were dropped  the CIA Director told the President it was a    slam dunk    case that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction   The CIA shaped and shaded its assessments and told the Administration and the American people what it thought the Administration wanted to hear and wanted us to hear       In July 2004  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a blistering 500 page unanimous report   The first overall conclusion on WMD was this   Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community s  pre war  National Intelligence Estimate either overstated or were not supported by  the underlying intelligence reporting    In other words  the intelligence community failed to objectively and independently assess the facts  which is one of its core responsibilities       The response from the Administration has been a collective shrug of the shoulders         The failures inside the CIA were multiplied by exaggerations and distortions in the highest reaches of the Executive Branch       The Secretary of State made a presentation to the United Nations in which he claimed Iraq had mobile biological weapons labs  despite dubious evidence   The Vice President repeatedly asserted that the lead 9 11 hijacker  Mohamed Atta  may have met in Prague with an Iraqi agent before the 9 11 attacks  though our intelligence community did not believe this happened       The CIA told the White House to remove the suggestion that Iraq purchased uranium from Africa from the President   s major speech in Cincinnati in October 2002 because the CIA doubted the claim was true  and it was in fact removed   Yet in the State of the Union Address in January 2003  the President put the same assertion back in by saying    the British government has learned    that Iraq was trying to acquire uranium from Africa  with the clear intent of creating the impression that we believed it too  although we didn   t       These exaggerations were not mistakes or slips   They were not inadvertent or accidental   These were calculated decisions to stretch the evidence past the breaking point  to turn gossip and gossamer into grounds for war       For these failures and these distortions there has been no accountability   Instead  the President gave the CIA Director the country   s highest civilian award     the Presidential Medal of Freedom     for the meritorious service he had rendered      Post War Planning    Another recent failure was the lack of adequate planning for postwar Iraq   When called to duty  our military fought bravely and brilliantly   Their performance in Iraq  however  was not matched by a similar performance in Washington   The Administration tragically misjudged the post war situation and failed to plan for the possibility of a violent aftermath       This was in part because they failed to adequately involve our uniformed military leaders in that planning   General Tommy Franks  the Commander of our wartime forces in Iraq  told Senator John Warner and me that the senior civilian officials in the Pentagon had made clear that uniformed military leaders should focus on planning for the combat phase and leave the planning for the aftermath to the civilians        Uniformed military leaders would have planned for a possible worst case scenario  not just the rosy scenario       When then Army Chief of Staff General Shinseki warned that it would take several hundred thousand U S  troops to occupy and stabilize Iraq after the war  he should have been listened to  instead of being scorned and isolated       Civilian leaders at the Pentagon similarly ignored the detailed studies on Iraq done by the State Department that accurately predicted the problems we have encountered   Had they paid attention  they would not have disbanded the Iraqi Army    That was among the worst of our post war decisions  and it was done casually and thoughtlessly based on the arrogant belief that we would be welcomed with flowers by the people of Iraq       Again  no accountability   The Defense Secretary stayed on for a second term   And one of the main architects of post war Iraq was appointed to head the World Bank      Detainee Abuse    Another large failure has been the horrific treatment of some of the detainees under American control   Photographs of some of those deplorable acts at Abu Ghraib flashed around the world  undermining our security and jeopardizing our troops if they are captured in future combat   Similar reports of abuse at Guantanamo Bay have taken a similar toll   The wellspring of good feelings toward the United States of people around the world has been poisoned  our values have been tarnished  and a club was handed to the religious fanatics who want to destroy us       This is one of the most serious scandals in recent military history  but there has been almost no accountability   Yes  there have been several reviews inside the Department of Defense relating to prisoner abuse  but these snapshot inspections and narrowly tailored investigations have left huge gaps   The Department of Defense has shown that it is not capable of investigating itself  investigators cannot be independent when they are in the chain of command of those they are investigating       The only review done outside of that chain of command was the Schlesinger panel investigation   It concluded that the abuses are    not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards  and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline   There is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels            Yet as of today  a few low ranking  enlisted personnel have been court martialed  but no high ranking civilian or military person has been held accountable even in the most modest of ways   In fact  when investigators inside the military have made recommendations of reprimand or stronger penalties against senior officers  those recommendations have been reversed by higher level commanders       Instead  the shameful parade of unaccountability continues with little challenge from the Republican controlled Congress   This not only undermines our moral authority as a nation of laws but also puts our troops at increased risk if they are captured      Hurricane Katrina   Finally  the failure in New Orleans   For three or four critical days  FEMA failed to provide food and water to 20 000 stranded people in the New Orleans convention center   No helicopters with rations and bottled water   Just ship wrecked  dehydrated people left in unimaginably squalid conditions   Millions of Americans     and countless millions around the world     watched in horror on their televisions at FEMA   s incompetence and in many cases  deadly failures         And then we watched in dismay as the President congratulated the head of FEMA by saying     Brownie  you re doing a heck of a job            The attempt to avoid accountability was swift   The President claimed that  I don t think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees      That statement was the 2005 version of the national security advisor saying that no one had anticipated suicide pilots before 9 11  and it was just as inaccurate       The President and his press secretary dismissed fair questions from the media by calling them a    blame game      Instead  they insisted there would be plenty of time later on to assess accountability       It was only because of persistent public outrage over his performance and lack of experience that    Brownie    was finally removed from the recovery operation   When the head of FEMA later resigned  the President indicated he was unaware that the resignation had happened       In his address last night  the President finally began to use the language of accountability   Surrounded by the destruction and devastation of New Orleans     and after weeks of public anger and outcry     the President said     When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation  I  as President  am responsible for the problem  and for the solution      It is a critical and encouraging first step       The words  however  are the easy part   The proof that he is serious and has truly changed his Administration   s attitude toward accountability will be if he and the Republican Congress agree to the creation of an independent  bipartisan commission to investigate all aspects of what went wrong with the response to Hurricane Katrina and to find ways to correct the problems      Root of the Problem   What is the root of the no accountability posture   One possibility is that it stems from a general unwillingness to acknowledge that mistakes have been made   The Administration  after all  has never acknowledged that the failure to find WMD in Iraq was indeed a failure  instead  it shifted the rationale for going to war       Another possibility     and the one I believe is likely     is that it is a variation on the old    You scratch my back and I   ll scratch yours      Namely     If you don   t point a finger at me for my failings  I will protect you when you fail            According to this theory  the Administration fears that if anyone is demoted or fired they will strike back at their bosses   There is some history to support this   Former Treasury Secretary Paul O   Neill is one of the few people dismissed from the Bush Administration   He later wrote that Bush Cabinet meetings made the President look  like a blind man in a room full of deaf people    The President may not wish to risk a repeat of that public relations debacle       Circling the wagons around the president has become the operative policy  and the President is loyal to those who do the circling   As Republican Congressman Christopher Shays said recently about the Administration     Loyalty and never admitting a mistake matter more than the truth          As a result  the message those in the Executive Branch constantly receive is     Don   t worry about mistakes   Don   t speak truth to power   Be a    yes    man   That   s the road to positive recognition and personal advancement      Tragically  that is also the road to future national failures and disasters      Conclusion   What is the antidote to the no accountability disease   The best answer  like so many answers  is in our great Constitution   Tomorrow is Constitution Day     a day for the country to learn about and celebrate the Constitution   We look to our Constitution to help us fix mistakes  to correct course  and to hold people accountable for failure         The Constitution created three co equal branches of government  and gave each checks and balances on the others   When the President does not hold members of his Administration accountable  congressional oversight can and should be a great check on executive power         For example  in 1941  the Truman Committee investigated wartime profiteering under a Democratic Administration that Harry Truman would later join   In 1972  the bipartisan Watergate inquiry exposed wrongdoing at the highest levels of executive power  and it was a Republican senator who repeatedly asked the famous question     What did the President know and when did he know it      In 1987  the Congressional Iran Contra hearings put an end to illegal arms sales to Iran to finance the Contras in Nicaragua         Today  however  the Congress is not fulfilling its oversight responsibility   Congressional investigations of executive branch activities are next to nil   There is no examination of post war Iraq planning and no examination of detainee abuse   The Senate Intelligence Committee has not conducted the promised examination into how policymakers used or misused the intelligence they received         Given the inability or refusal of the Republican Congress to be critical of a Republican President or his Administration  the next best alternative is an independent bipartisan  commission with staff and subpoena power  such as the 9 11 Commission   Created only through the persistence of the victims    families  the 9 11 Commission did excellent work and unearthed many of the facts I mentioned earlier       That commission should be the blueprint for the investigation into the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina   Unfortunately  just this week the Senate rejected on a party line vote an amendment to create such an independent commission       If the Congress refuses to engage in thorough oversight  the final guardians of accountability are a free press     guaranteed by the Constitution     and an informed American public exercising its freedom of speech and right to vote        But whether it is through citizens speaking out  the Congress finally fulfilling its oversight responsibilities  or the President having a true change of heart  it is time to end the era of no accountability   For the sake of our nation   s security  the buck passing must stop
