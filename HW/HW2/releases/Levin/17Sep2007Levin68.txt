the National Press Club International Correspondents Lawmakers Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this evening about our country   s future course in Iraq   This is a particularly timely discussion since the Senate is going to be debating this issue for the next several weeks        The Senate debate over an Iraq resolution is likely to be contentious  reflecting the division in the country over Iraq for the last four years    But I want to begin tonight by pointing out areas where I think there is general agreement        The first is that a stable  independent Iraq is in our national interest   I and many of my Democratic colleagues disagreed with the way we went to war with Iraq four and a half years ago  and have disagreed with almost every aspect of the Bush Administration   s policy in Iraq since then     ignoring the advice of senior military leaders such as General Shinseki in planning the invasion  failing to properly plan for the occupation and its aftermath  disbanding of the Iraqi army  banning low level Ba   ath Party members from post Saddam government employment  failing to pressure the Iraqi leaders to meet the benchmarks on the timetable they set for themselves  and most recently  increasing the U S  military presence in Iraq in the so called surge when we should be reducing our military presence        But the challenge facing the Congress now is     given where we are today     what is the best way to promote a stable and independent Iraq        There has also been a consensus for some time that there is no military solution to the sectarian violence in Iraq  and that the key to ending the violence lies in bringing about a political settlement among the various factions in Iraq today   Even Prime Minister Maliki recognized that fact last November     The crisis is political     he said     and the ones who can stop the cycle of   bloodletting of innocents are the  Iraqi  politicians           President Bush himself acknowledged this reality when he said last January that the purpose of the surge was to give Iraqi politicians    breathing space    to work out a political settlement        It is also pretty much undisputed that the stated purpose of the surge     to give Iraqi politicians breathing space to work out a political settlement     has not been achieved   President Bush said as much in his speech last Thursday when he  abandoned his original justification for the surge   Now  the President said     the goal of the surge is to provide that security and to help Iraqi forces to maintain it      That is a far cry from the original    breathing space    goal     and a lot more open ended       General Petraeus himself admitted in testimony last week that the purpose of the surge    to provide    breathing space    to work out a political settlement    had not been achieved       There has been a lot of debate as to the current situation on the ground in Iraq and whether the surge has even produced significant progress in terms of security   I was struck by the fact that recent public opinion polls in Iraq indicate that Iraqi citizens feel even less secure than before  According to an ABC News analysis     the surge broadly is seen to have done more harm than good  with 65 to 70 percent  of Iraqis  saying it s worsened rather than improved security in surge areas  security in other areas  conditions for political dialogue  the ability of the Iraqi government to do its work  the pace of reconstruction and the pace of economic development          The result of the surge     or more accurately  the lack of political results    underscores the reality that there will be no end to the violence until Iraqi national leaders work out their political differences  As the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq under the leadership of retired Marine General Jim Jones reported last week     Political reconciliation is the key to ending sectarian violence in Iraq           The Iraqi politicians haven   t done that  They haven   t kept the commitments they made to achieve political reconciliation by adopting legislation setting the dates for provincial elections  approving a hydrocarbon law and a de Ba   athification law  and submitting constitutional amendments to a referendum        I want to emphasize that the Iraqis    commitments to work out their key differences and the timetable to do so were their commitments and their timetable   So when Prime Minister Maliki complains that outsiders aren   t going to dictate to the Iraq government  he is trying to obscure the fact that his own government set the benchmarks and timetable for themselves       Back in January when he proposed the surge  President Bush said that    America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced      Last Thursday  we heard the same old song   The President said that    the  Iraqi  government has not met its own legislative benchmarks     and in my meeting with Iraq leaders  I have made clear that they must           Eight months after saying that we will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced  the President   s words ring hollow   We aren   t doing anything to pressure the Iraqi leaders to keep their commitments   And there have been absolutely no consequences for the Iraqi political leaders    failure to do so   James Baker  Lee Hamilton  and the rest of the Iraq Study Group recommended that    if the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation  security  and governance  the United States should reduce its political  military  or economic support for the Iraqi government      Those are what are needed   consequences     clear  direct and understandable consequences   But the only response to the Iraqi politicians    continued dawdling has been the repeated and endless calls by the President for patience          Success in Iraq     creating a stable  independent Iraq     depends on Iraqi leaders finally seeing the end of the open ended U S  commitment   The Iraq Study Group correctly pointed out almost a year ago that    an open ended commitment of American forces would not provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take the political actions that give Iraq the best chance of quelling sectarian violence   In the absence of such an incentive  the Iraqi government might continue to delay taking those actions             The President   s current strategy is stagnant  because it is open ended  It lacks the key ingredient of an action forcing mechanism aimed at getting the Iraqi leaders to resolve their political differences  What is that mechanism   Action on our part  not just rhetoric that clearly demonstrates to the Iraqi government that our open ended commitment of American troops in the middle of their civil war is over  and that while we will provide support to their Army  that we have decided     as did the British     to transfer principal responsibility for security to Iraqi forces        The Jones Commission reported this month that    The Iraqi armed forces   are increasingly effective and are capable of assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of Iraq      The Commission went on to say that a number of Iraqi Army battalions that are capable of taking the lead are not in the lead  a fact acknowledged by General Petraeus in our hearings last week  and the Commission recommended that    the size of our national footprint in Iraq be reconsidered    and that    significant reductions    appear to be possible and prudent             The Jones Commission also emphasized that    there is a fine line between assistance and dependence      When I was in Iraq last month  a young U S  soldier  who is on his third deployment to Iraq  told us that    the Iraqi soldiers will let U S  soldiers do the job that they   re supposed to be doing forever  and we need to let them do it on their own           In addition to getting our troops out of the middle of their civil war  success also depends on a transition of missions   According to the Iraq Study Group     by the first quarter of 2008  subject to unexpected developments in the security situation on the ground  all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq       They proposed a far smaller U S  military presence would remain only for limited missions to include force protection  counterterrorism and training the Iraqi security forces   I believe it is essential that transition to the limited missions should be announced now  along with a timetable for its completion        Presenting Iraq   s political leaders with a timetable to begin withdrawing our forces and transitioning those that remain from mainly combat to mainly support roles is the only hope that Iraqi leaders will realize that their future is in their hands     not in the hands of our brave men and women who proudly wear the uniform of our country          Taking this step will also recognize another fact of life     that the stress on our forces  especially the wear and tear on the Army and the Marine Corps  must be reduced   Moreover  we cannot continue to deploy our forces in Iraq at the current level without seriously weakening our ability to respond to other challenges that might confront us        How can Congress bring about a change of course in Iraq while President Bush delays and delays making any change        A clear majority of the Senate voted in favor of the approach I   ve just outlined in July when we voted 53 46 to cut off the filibuster of the Republican leadership against the Levin Reed amendment        The Levin Reed amendment would have required the Secretary of Defense to begin a reduction in the number of United States forces in Iraq not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment   It would also have required a transition to a limited presence only to carry out the missions of protecting United States and Coalition personnel and infrastructure  training  equipping  and providing logistic support to the Iraqi Security Forces  and engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda  al Qaeda affiliated groups  and other international terrorist organizations   The transition to the limited presence and missions would have had to be completed by April 30  2008   This reduction would be implemented along with a comprehensive diplomatic  political  and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq   s neighbors and the international community        The continued inability of the Iraqi government to make any progress toward a political settlement  and the refusal of the Bush Administration to change course  reinforces the need for the Levin Reed amendment   Senator Reed and I will be offering our amendment again later this week        The challenge of course is to get 60 votes to overcome the filibuster     that is why I have entitled my remarks this evening    Getting to 60      As I stand here this evening I can   t tell you whether there are 60 votes for Levin Reed  What I can tell you is that there is growing disenchantment among the American people and my colleagues over the Iraqi government   s inability to act and the President   s stagnant strategy which fails to include any realistic mechanism to get them to act        We are working to get the votes for the Levin Reed amendment because it represents the best strategy and best hope to begin moving toward a stable  secure Iraq         If we don   t have 60 votes to break the filibuster  I believe we should work to find 60 votes for a formulation which might change the binding completion date for the required transition to the new missions as provided for by Levin Reed  but which still gets us off of dead center in Iraq and changes course in a way that puts real pressure on the Iraqi government to act        I know what some of you are thinking   You are thinking that the goal should be 67 votes  not 60  because the President will veto anything that the Congress passes that changes his policy        We may at some point need 67 votes  but getting a clear Congressional requirement now for a change of course in Iraq and a rejection of President Bush   s stand pat policy     and demonstrating the determination of Congress and the American people to change course in Iraq     will bring pressure where it is needed most   on the President to change course  on the Iraqis to make them understand that their future is in their hands  not ours  and on countries in the region whose failure to act to resolve the Iraqi war represents a reckless avoidance of responsibility        Whether the Iraqis continue their civil war is up to them  but we are going to do all we can to get American troops out of the middle of it
