this accommodation go into effect   How long will it last    Since January 23  2007  all citizens of the United States  Canada  Mexico  and Bermuda have been required to present a valid passport when entering the United States at any air port of entry       Due to longer than expected processing times for passport applications in the face of record breaking demand  the federal government is making an accommodation for air travel   U S  citizens traveling to Canada  Mexico  the Caribbean and Bermuda who have applied for but not yet received passports can temporarily enter and depart from the United States by air with a government issued photo identification and Department of State official proof of application for a passport through September 30  2007        Do I need a passport to go on a cruise or to travel by vehicle across the land border to Canada or Mexico    No  but it is recommended that U S  citizens carry and present government issued identification when requested   Although not currently required to present a document  U S  citizens arriving by land and sea must still establish to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer that they are U S  citizens       As early as January 2008  the Departments of Homeland Security and State will begin to implement WHTI at land and sea ports of entry   A Notice of Proposed Rule Making outlining a phased implementation is expected to be published in the Federal Register within the next two weeks      Do I need a passport if I m flying within the United States  for example from Puerto Rico to New York     Domestic travel within the United States does not require the presentation of a passport       The passport requirement does NOT apply to U S  citizens traveling to or returning directly from a U S  territory   U S  citizens returning directly from a U S  territory are not considered to have left the United States and do not need to present a passport   U S  territories include the following  Guam  Puerto Rico  the U S  Virgin Islands  American Samoa  Swains Island  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands      What is your advice to travelers     Travelers who have applied for passports should monitor the status of the application online at    Customers may track the progress of their applications within one week of applying   The online status check will verify that the application is in process  and will update to confirm that the completed passport has been mailed       If a customer is within two weeks of travel and the website does not show that the passport is completed  travelers should call the National Passport Information Center  NPIC  at 1 877 487 2778 for information and assistance in arranging to have their passports ready for their trips        We ask that other travelers leave these phone lines open for those with immediate travel needs   Our goal is for all travelers to get their passports in time for their trips       If you benefit from the flexibility permitted for travel to Mexico  Canada  the Caribbean  and Bermuda  you do not need to contact the NPIC about your application   We will continue to process your application and mail your passports       What advice do you have for travelers who have not yet applied for passports      Travelers who have not applied for passports should plan 10 to 12 weeks for standard passport processing and two to three weeks for expedited processing         This is an increase over our earlier ten week turnaround time         Applying as far in advance as possible is always the best advice  and not needing to expedite saves money       Complete information on how to apply for a passport is available at the Consular Affairs website         I haven   t applied yet and I need my passport soon   How do I get expedited service for my passport application       Applicants traveling in two to three weeks may apply using expedited service at their nearest passport acceptance facility   Your nearest passport acceptance facility may be found at           Those traveling in less than two weeks who have not yet applied for a passport should contact us by email using the form at  or by calling 1 877 487 2778 for information and to schedule an appointment       Applicants should be sure to indicate on their application their travel plans and intended departure date         A tip   applicants requesting and paying for expedited service must write    EXPEDITE    on the outside of the envelope containing their application    Should people go to a Passport Agency if they can   t get an appointment      Passport agencies are striving to assist customers with urgent travel needs   Agencies are open by appointment only  and require applicants to demonstrate that they are traveling or need to apply for a foreign visa within two weeks      Why do the Passport Offices and the Post Office provide conflicting information  e g   you say it will take 10 12 weeks  but the post office says it will take 14 weeks or longer     The most reliable source of information on applying for a passport is our Internet site     We encourage all travelers to check this site for information  not just on getting a passport but also for tips on safe travel and other useful information    Why should people have to pay the expedited fee when they sent their passport applications in within the suggested time period but now are faced with missing their flights     Our specialists will review your file and determine the best way to get your passport to you   Depending on the situation  we may arrange to deliver your passport by mail or overnight courier  or schedule an appointment for you at a regional passport office     How will U S  lawful permanent residents  LPRs  be affected by this travel flexibility    LPRs will continue to be able to use their Alien Registration Card  Form I 551   issued by DHS  or other valid evidence of permanent residence status to apply for entry to the United States      Why these changes    We are aware that some travelers have not been able to obtain passports because of longer processing times caused by record setting demand   Accordingly  we   re allowing flexibility because we are hearing about more cases of Americans missing flights   As a service organization dedicated to helping Americans  we cannot let this happen         Some of the advantages of this accommodation are that current travelers will be relieved and this will allow us to better prioritize our work so that no American traveler will miss a trip      How long will Americans have to wait to get a passport regularly processed while the rules are relaxed    Regular processing takes between 10 to 12 weeks   Expedited passport processing takes between two and three weeks      What has the Department of State been doing to improve the processing of applications    The Department is working hard to meet the challenge of this increased demand     our goal is that Americans have the documents they need for their travels abroad   We expanded the hours of operation at all of our passport agencies  including evenings and weekends  to maximize the use of production equipment  counters are open on Saturdays for emergency appointments  which we are scheduling through our call center        The National Passport Center  NPC  in Portsmouth  NH and the Charleston Passport Center  CPC   which together issue over 50 percent of all passports nationwide  are operating 24 hours in three shifts per day   Several agencies now operate two shifts        We recently opened the Arkansas Passport Center  APC  in Hot Springs  a mega processing center that will be our largest passport production center        The Department assembled    surge    teams of passport specialists  who deploy to exceptionally high volume passport agencies to assist with walk in applicants and to process applications   These teams also provide customer support  including locating and expediting applications of customers with urgent travel needs in order to avoid future instances of customers not making their scheduled trips         Our aggressive recruiting efforts brought 259 new full time and contract employees on board in the last three months  and scores more have received offers of employment   Recruitment continues across the country         The National Passport Information Center  1 877 487 2778  is open on weekdays  from 6 a m  to midnight Monday through Friday  Eastern Time  and on weekends  from 9 a m  to 5 p m   to provide customers with information and assistance        The Department has installed high capacity telephone lines        Additionally  on top of their regular duties  State Department employees are volunteering on task forces  answering questions  and helping Americans get their passports         Qualified State Department employees are also volunteering to help process passport applications         These volunteers supplement the Department   s corps of passport specialists  which has increased by approximately 280 new hires since 2005       Why is the demand so high     On January 23  2007  new passport regulations mandated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative took effect  requiring Americans to have passports when they travel to and from the United States by air       Some citizens are also applying in anticipation of the implementation of WHTI to land and sea travel        Americans continue to travel abroad for tourism  business  and other purposes        The U S  passport is still the best proof of citizenship and identity  and many Americans want this document for non travel purposes     How many passports is the State Department issuing       Passport demand is now at an all time high      In Fiscal Year 2006  we issued 12 1 million passports  we   re on pace to issue 17 5 million passports this year         For the first eight months of Fiscal Year 2007  October 2006 to May 2007  the Department issued 10 3 million passports  a 37 percent increase over the same period last year        Today  approximately 78 million Americans     a little over one quarter of the population     have valid passports       DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  What is the requirement for children under 16 who are United States citizens    Children traveling with a parent or legal guardian will be required to present the receipt from the Department of State  DOS  Passport Services indicating confirmation of an application upon arrival to and departure from the United States   Acceptable confirmation for a passport application can be found at the Department of State   s website at        Children traveling alone should carry a copy of their birth certificate  baptismal record or a hospital record of birth in the United States      What is the requirement for United States citizens over the age of 16    Adults who have applied for but not yet received a passport should present government issued photo identification and an official proof of application from the U S  Department of State   Travelers who have not applied for a passport should not expect to be accommodated   U S  Citizens with pending passport applications can obtain proof of application at        Will a citizen of Canada be permitted to travel within the Western Hemisphere with only a government issued photo identification and a passport application receipt    Since implementation  U S  Customs and Border Protection has and will continue to exercise its current authorities in unique circumstances to allow individuals subject to the WHTI requirements into the U S  based on other evidence of identity and citizenship       I am traveling to Europe and I have not yet received my passport   May I travel on government issued photo identification and a receipt for confirmation for a passport application    No  this accommodation does not affect entry requirements to other countries   U S  Citizens traveling to a country that requires passports must still present those documents    When will U S  Citizens be required to carry a passport or other acceptable document for WHTI    Since January 23  2007  all citizens of the United States  Canada  Mexico  and Bermuda have been required to present a valid passport when entering the United States at any airport         Due to longer than expected processing times for passport applications in the face of record breaking demand  the federal government is making an accommodation for air travel   U S  Citizens traveling to Canada  Mexico  the Caribbean and Bermuda who have applied for but not yet received passports can nevertheless temporarily enter and depart from the United States by air with a government issued photo identification and Department of State official proof of application for a passport through Sept  30  2007        Will the air carriers be advised of this flexibility and allow me to board the aircraft    The carriers have been notified of this temporary travel flexibility for U S  Citizens      I will be traveling via private aircraft  what documents do I need to present    Since January 23  2007  all citizens of the United States  Canada  Mexico  and Bermuda have been required to present a valid passport when entering the United States at any airport         Due to longer than

identification  such as a driver   s license  and Department of State official proof of application for a passport upon arrival to and departure from the United States      Why is DHS only accepting

capability to verify confirmation with manual receipts
