Freeland  Michigan  will testify to a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday about how her credit card interest rate jumped from 18  to 24 24  despite the fact that she was paying more than the minimum monthly payment and making her payments on time   Such interest rate increases are the focus of the U S  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing  led by Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   examining the credit card industry   s practice of imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who pay their bills on time in compliance with their credit card agreements           Credit card companies go too far when they hike the interest rates of consumers who are faithfully paying their credit card bills  just to squeeze more finance charges from them     said Levin      Some credit card companies are foisting interest rates as high as 25  or 30  on responsible consumers  claiming they have become greater credit risks even when those same consumers haven   t missed paying a bill in years   And credit card companies reach back and apply the higher interest rate retroactively to a consumer   s existing credit card debt  forcing the consumer to pay more even though they paid their past credit card bills on time   Right now  credit card companies are the only lenders allowed to retroactively change the interest rate on a consumer loan where the consumer has met their borrowing obligations   This unfair credit card practice needs to stop          The Michigan witness  Janet Hard  saw the interest rate on her Discover credit card increase from 18  to 24  in 2006 due to a drop in her FICO credit score  even though she had always made her payments to Discover on time and paid at least the minimum amount due   Discover applied the 24  rate to her existing credit card debt which was then about  8 300  increasing her finance charges   A year later  Discover lowered the rate to 21    Over the last twelve months  despite making steady payments totaling  2 400 and keeping new purchases on her card to less than  100  the higher interest rates meant that Ms  Hard was able to reduce her principal debt by only  350        The hearing is the second in a series of Subcommittee hearings into unfair credit card practices   The Subcommittee   s first hearing in March examined industry practices that collect interest on credit card debt that is paid on time  impose steep and sometimes duplicative late  over the limit  or other fees on consumers  apply consumer payments first to the debt with the least expensive interest charges instead of those with the most expensive charges  and impose substantial penalty interest rates that can exceed 30          Tomorrow   s hearing will examine practices related to imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who have complied with their credit card obligations  in particular the industry wide practice of applying higher interest rates to existing credit card debt        The hearing is the result of a Subcommittee investigation into interest rate practices at the five major credit card issuers who handle 80  of U S  credit cards   This investigation found that two of the issuers  Bank of America and Discover  increase the interest rates of cardholders whose    credit scores    have dropped  on the ground that these consumers pose a greater credit risk  even if they have a history of timely payments to the company   The investigation learned that another major credit card issuer  Capital One  on two occasions in 2007  increased the interest rates of consumers who paid their bills on time  not because of lower credit scores  but because the company had decided to pass on borrowing costs to its cardholders         The two remaining major issuers  Citi Cards and Chase  have recently discontinued the practice of imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who meet their credit card obligations   Citi announced its policy change at the Subcommittee   s March hearing  Chase announced on November 19  2007  while their interest rate policies and practices were being examined by the Subcommittee  that it will discontinue by March 2008 the practice of increasing cardholders    interest rates due to credit score drops           Some contend credit card companies are repricing cardholders based on objective criteria     said Levin     but the truth is there is a lot of arbitrariness in how interest rates are set   We   ve seen a consumer whose credit card was assigned four different interest rates over the same year  going from 15  to 19   27   and then 6   for no discernable reason   Another consumer with four cards from the same credit card company had four different interest rates  8   14   19   and 27   even though she presumably posed the same credit risk on each   Those interest rates are all over the map   Consumers who play by the rules and pay their credit card bills on time shouldn   t get hit with interest rates of 20  25  or 30   credit card companies who impose those high rates are taking unfair advantage of responsible consumers           In May  Levin and Senator Claire McCaskill  D Mo   introduced S  1395  the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act  which would stop credit card interest rate increases except in four circumstances    1  after the lapse of an introductory interest rate   2  pursuant to a variable interest rate   3  pursuant to the application of a previously disclosed penalty interest rate after a cardholder violates the credit card agreement  and  4  where the cardholder agrees to the increase at the time it is proposed   The bill would also prohibit the application of higher interest rates to existing credit card debt   Instead  a higher interest rate could be applied only to credit card debt incurred after the increase took effect   S  1395 is also cosponsored by Senators Leahy  Durbin  Bingaman  Cantwell  Whitehouse  and Kohl        At the hearing  the Subcommittee will examine eight case histories   Three consumers will testify along with three major credit card issuers  Bank of America  Capital One  and Discover
