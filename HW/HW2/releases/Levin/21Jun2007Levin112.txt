                                                                                                                                                    Senator Levin wrote the following op ed on Iraq  which was published in the Washington Post on Thursday  June 21  2007       In his only term in Congress  Abraham Lincoln was an ardent opponent of the Mexican War  He introduced a series of resolutions that challenged President James Polk to show the  spot  of American soil on which Mexicans had spilled American blood  and he voted for an amendment stating that the war was  unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President        But when the question of funding for the troops fighting that war came  Lincoln voted their supplies without hesitation       Sound familiar  President Bush recently vetoed a bill I helped draft because it would have required him to begin reducing U S  force levels in Iraq within four months  In the wake of that veto  calls from those who want Congress to try to stop funding the war have grown louder       Today  some of us are facing the same dilemma that Lincoln faced  Do you fund the troops fighting a war that you oppose       I voted against going to war in Iraq  I have consistently challenged the administration s conduct of the war  and I have long fought to change our policy there  But I cannot vote to stop funding the troops while they are in harm s way  conducting dangerous missions such as those recently begun north of Baghdad  I agree with Lincoln  who decided  that the Administration had done wrong in getting us into the war  but that the Officers and soldiers who went to the field must be supplied and sustained at all events   As long as our nation s policies put them there  our troops should hear an unequivocal message from Congress that we support them       That shouldn t be a cause for frustration among those of us who want to bring the war to a prompt and responsible end       There are a number of ways for Congress to try to change course in Iraq  I emphasize  try  because Democrats can t succeed without Republican support  given the realities of Senate procedure  One way to try to change course is to stop funding for the war  which sends the wrong message to the troops and won t pass in Congress  The better way to change course  an option that is also more likely to succeed  is to place in law a requirement that the president do so       We can end the war without stopping funding for the troops  For more than a year  I  along with Sen  Jack Reed  have introduced legislation requiring the president to begin reducing the number of American troops in Iraq within four months while transitioning our military mission there to limited force protection  training of Iraqi security forces and counterterrorism missions       Setting a date to begin reducing and transitioning our forces would make clear to Iraqi leaders that we will not be their security blanket indefinitely  It would force them to take responsibility for their future and to make the political compromises that only they can make  It would also give them sufficient time to make those compromises  After all  they promised to make nearly all of them by the end of last year and the rest by the beginning of this year but have yet to do so  The timeline would also allow us to plan for redeploying our forces       By setting a policy that begins with putting into law a timetable for starting a troop reduction  rather than trying to stop funding  we offer the best chance for stabilizing a country that we invaded while also sending the message to our troops that  even though we oppose the president s policy  we are united behind them       Support for our approach has grown steadily  In June 2006  our measure received 39 votes  In March  it received 48 votes  In April  it received 51 votes  including those of two Republican senators  By contrast  only 29 senators so far    none of them Republican    have voted for a funding cutoff  That s a long way from the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster or the 67 needed to override a veto       Sen  Reed and I will introduce this plan again as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Bill  As previous efforts did  this amendment will require a reduction to begin within 120 days  but this amendment will also provide that all troops be out of Iraq by April 1  2008  except for the forces needed for specified  limited missions to which they would transition       Democrats  and I hope a growing number of Republicans  will keep fighting for this approach until either the president signs it or we override his veto  Until that day  we will continue to fund the troops  following the example so wisely set by Abraham Lincoln 160 years ago      Carl Levin is Michigan s senior U S  senator    Read this article on the Washington Post
