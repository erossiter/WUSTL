Rights Issues and the Dangers of Counterfeited Goods Imported Into the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senator Levin s remarks as prepared for delivery at Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce event   The Cost of Counterfeiting and Piracy       I   d like to thank the U S  Chamber of Commerce  the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce and the U S  Patent and Trademark Office for organizing today   s event on the cost of counterfeiting and piracy   The small and medium sized businesses here today are the ones that bear the cost of when your products and ideas are stolen   I hope today   s forum will provide some new ideas to better protect our U S  products from piracy       Today  I   d like to discuss the scope of the auto parts counterfeiting problem  why it matters  and how we can attack it effectively      Scope of the Problem   Product counterfeiting and piracy has long been associated with knock off watches and handbags   But counterfeiting has exploded in recent years across many industries to become a serious threat to the competitiveness of the U S  economy   One of the greatest assets of American businesses is their intellectual property  but when American innovations can quickly be stolen by competitors around the world  the vitality of those businesses is at risk   The FBI estimates that counterfeiting costs U S  businesses  200 billion to  250 billion annually  and growing         China is the worst piracy offender  accounting for 81 percent of all imported counterfeit products seized by U S  Customs and Border Protection in 2006   According to CRS   China   s own government estimates that counterfeits constitute an alarming 15 percent to 20 percent of all products made in China and account for about 8 percent of China   s total GDP         The U S  auto parts industry conservatively estimates it loses  12 billion in lost sales annually to counterfeit auto parts   9 billion outside the United States and  3 billion inside the U S   China is responsible for about 75 percent of those counterfeit auto parts  according to estimates by American automotive suppliers   The auto parts industry estimates millions of counterfeit auto parts enter the U S  every year and only a fraction of them are ever detected at the border by U S  enforcement officials   A recent U S  Chamber of Commerce study found that counterfeiting and piracy cost the Ford Motor company alone about  1 billion annually       Virtually every automotive part has turned up in the counterfeit trade  including windshield glass  brake fluid  headlights  taillights  emissions components  structural parts  sheet metal parts  suspension parts  tires  belts  hoses  and alternators   The industry has found enough different fake parts being sold in U S  stores to construct an entire car         And the problem is now spreading beyond just auto parts   The theft of intellectual property in China has become so widespread and bold that they copied an entire car  manufactured it and sold it under a different name     sold not as a    Chevy    but a    Chery QQ      The counterfeiter even had plans to export the knock off to the United States        Why it Matters   Counterfeiting hurts U S  manufacturers and the unsuspecting public that buys fake parts in many ways   Here are a few of the biggest problems    Counterfeit and pirated automotive parts mean lost revenue and jobs in the United States   The FTC estimates that the auto industry could hire 250 000 additional American workers if the sale of counterfeit parts were eliminated   This is in an industry that has already suffered a large number of layoffs and bankruptcies in recent years   American manufacturers have a difficult enough time trying to get a foothold in the Chinese market   If that market is permeated by counterfeit products American manufacturers should rightly be making  it is that much more difficult    Counterfeit parts hurt the legitimate producer   s brand name and reputation here and abroad because these products are substandard     The U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   has noticed connections between counterfeiting and organized crime  gang activity and terrorism   Because it is easier  more lucrative  and carries fewer penalties than drug smuggling  counterfeiting is becoming an activity of choice of criminal groups and even terrorists   Fake parts also undermine U S  safety standards and put customers at risk   For example  components such as brakes have been found that were made of compressed grass and wood    I brought some examples of counterfeit parts  all made in China  to show you how sophisticated counterfeiters have become in making fake products that look and feel like the originals          Here are genuine and fake Champion spark plugs and genuine and fake ACDelco oil filters   You can see how far the counterfeiters go to deceive         While the products may look identical  including the packaging and the product name placement on the fake product  the quality and strength and precision engineering of the genuine product is much greater   For instance  the machining of the grooves  or    teeth    on the oil filters is more precise and provides for a tighter fit   Some of the oil filters have been cut in half to expose the substandard materials the knockoffs are made of   These fake products do not work to specification  if they work at all  and they present a hazard to an unsuspecting driver       I also have a genuine and counterfeit Chrysler Group aftermarket wheel for the Dodge Neon   Though these wheels may look alike  if you look closer the fake has no machining on the inside surface to ensure a true fit to the rotors surface and the aluminum is substandard   The counterfeit wheel is marked    USA    and    UAW     neither of which Chrysler Group casts into this parts and neither of which is true as the fake wheel was made in China        As you can see  with counterfeit auto parts  the concern goes way beyond the monetary losses like those suffered by a company when a handbag is copied or a high end watch counterfeited   When the wheel on your car is fake or your brakes are made of compressed grass and wood  your life and the lives of your loved ones are at risk      What to do about it   For a problem so severe and so serious  our government is doing woefully little to stop it       Internationally  we have been slow to enforce trade agreements and insist our trading partners play by WTO rules   The WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS  China signed requires her to have an effective intellectual property rights  IPR  enforcement mechanism   China may have IPR laws that appear reasonable on the books  but it is not enforcing them   After years and years of empty threats  in April  the U S  Trade Representative finally and belatedly brought two cases against China for failing to enforce its IPR laws and protect intellectual property in China         Here at home  we are not doing nearly enough to keep fakes from crossing our borders    And when we do seize pirated goods or when counterfeiting happens within our own borders  the government doesn   t prosecute the cases   The auto parts industry is not aware of any federal prosecutions for auto parts counterfeiting  and the Department of Justice could not identify any pending cases           To date there has been a lack of willingness to initiate criminal cases against auto parts counterfeiters because it was not viewed as a serious enough problem by the Department of Justice   Seizing counterfeit automobile brakes may not be as glamorous as a drug bust  but the increasing risk to the health of our economy  loss of jobs  and the safety risks to unsuspecting consumers make changing that perception a vital national priority   The bottom line is that counterfeiting is a serious and growing crime  and the Justice Department should be doing more to fight it         We rightfully treat counterfeiting money as a serious crime   Counterfeiting auto parts should be treated the same way         U S  parts companies know they are on the front line in this fight   Because of the lack of government leadership  the auto industry has had to do too much of the policing itself and at great expense   The automotive industry is working through its trade associations to educate its suppliers and distributors and to train employees purchasing parts on how to detect counterfeit products   It even has to identify counterfeit parts that show up at trade shows and arrange to have them removed   But  again  the perpetrators never seem to be prosecuted         I believe our government should be doing much more to help  and there are very simple steps that can be taken   The government should    increase staffing levels for personnel dedicated to IPR enforcement   improve training for customs agents at ports of entry   improve coordination on IPR issues between the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement   improve communication between Customs and private sector rights holders in the investigation of cases of counterfeit auto parts   increase resources to the FBI and DOJ to more aggressively pursue criminal cases against auto parts counterfeiting and other intellectual property crimes   direct the Commerce Department to develop standards for IP protection used at overseas trade shows to keep out participants trafficking in counterfeit goods    Michigan Democrats have laid out a comprehensive agenda to revitalize our domestic manufacturing industry and respond to the loss of millions of U S  manufacturing jobs we call the American Manufacturing Initiative  AMI    Our goal is to bring together government  private industry  and academia in a robust partnership aimed at turning around the manufacturing sector of the U S  economy   The American Manufacturing Initiative takes a strong stand against auto parts counterfeiting and fights for your intellectual property rights       We would increase resources for deterring  detecting  seizing  and prosecuting counterfeit imports  and we call for pursuing trade actions for failure to meet commitments to reduce intellectual property infringement levels   We direct USTR to file additional cases at the WTO to challenge China   s non compliance and call for a Special Trade Prosecutor at USTR to aggressively enforce trade laws and to crack down on counterfeiting         Counterfeiting presents a significant threat to our automakers  auto parts makers  to our economy and also to the safety and security of all Americans   China is a particularly grave offender  and its violations must be addressed firmly and fast by an administration which has so far taken a relatively lackadaisical attitude to counterfeiting with almost no prosecutions       Again  thank you all for being here today and to the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce for hosting this forum   This is an issue that should unite all Americans  regardless of their political views  because it is costing us jobs and makes us less safe   One of the most important steps we can take is to raise awareness of this issue and to build momentum for change and that is what we are doing here today   Thank you
