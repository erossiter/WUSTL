ranking Democratic Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  today released a U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO   analyzing credit card fees  interest rates and related disclosure provided to consumers   The report  requested by Levin  is the first federal study to compile in a single place a description of the recent fees  interest rates and disclosure practices of 28 popular credit cards from the six largest credit card issuers            Millions of Americans depend on credit cards to pay their bills and buy essentials like groceries or gas     said Levin      Unfair or confusing credit card practices take advantage of working families   This report shines a needed spotlight on excessive credit card fees  unfair interest rates  and inadequate disclosure practices that ought to be stopped          Levin continued     For instance  charging interest on debt that has already been paid  as some banks do  is just plain wrong   Late fees are nearing  40 per month and take a real bite out of a middle class paycheck   Some banks are charging families a  15 fee to pay their credit card bill over the phone before the late fee kicks in     actually charging families money to pay their bill   That   s outrageous            Findings of the GAO report  the result of a yearlong study  include the following       Increased Credit Card Use   U S  consumers now have about 690 million credit cards and the amount charged on them between 1980 and 2005 has grown from approximately  69 billion to more than  1 8 trillion   According to the Federal Reserve  the average American household credit card debt in 2004 was  5 100        Higher Late Fees   GAO reported that the average penalty in 2005 for making a late payment was  34   That   s a 115 percent increase from the average late fee of  13 in 1995   The highest late fee was  39 per occurrence   In 2005  about 35 percent     over one third     of active U S  accounts were assessed a late fee at least once        Unfair Interest Charges on Timely Payments   One third of the credit card issuers studied by GAO use a billing method that charges interest on credit card debt already repaid by the consumer    The example outlined by GAO assumes that a consumer starts a billing cycle with a zero balance and charges  1 000 on the credit card   The cardholder makes a timely payment of  990  reasonably expecting to pay interest on the remaining  10   Instead  some credit card issuers charge interest on the full  1 000  even though the cardholder had already paid 99 percent of the balance on time  While the consumer only owed the credit card company  10 for 30 days or less in GAO   s example  the interest charge was  11 02      Hidden Fees   Some fees are not disclosed at all in the materials provided to cardholders   For example  some issuers charge cardholders a  5 to  15 fee to make a single bill payment by telephone  others charge a  2 to  13 fee for obtaining a single copy of a billing statement or other record      Penalty Interest Rates Exceed 30 Percent   Some of the credit cards analyzed by GAO impose penalty interest rates of over 30 percent on cardholders who paid late or exceeded a credit limit   In one instance reported to GAO  consumers complained to a federal banking regulator about being charged an over the limit fee when their account balances exceeded their credit limits due solely to a late fee charged by their card issuer       Inadequate Fee Disclosure   GAO found that current fee disclosures are difficult to understand  bury important information  and often fail to convey to cardholders when late fees would be charged and what actions could result in penalty interest rates      Higher Penalty and Fee Revenues   Penalty interest rates and fees have increased as a portion of credit card issuer revenues   From 1986 to 2004  the average profitability of large credit card issuing banks was more than double that of all commercial banks             There are so many credit card fees and penalties these days that consumers need a scorecard to keep track     Levin said      Inadequate disclosure compounds the problem   This report will help consumers and policymakers evaluate the fairness of current credit card fees  interest rates  and disclosure practices  and help build the case for legislation to stop the abuses   I hope it will also serve notice to credit card issuers that they need to clean up their act and eliminate unfair  excessive  and hidden charges            In its report  GAO examined cards issued by the six largest credit card issuers of 2004   Citibank  South Dakota   N A   Chase Bank USA  N A   Bank of America  MBNA America Bank  N A   Capital One Bank  and Discover Financial Services   The accounts of these six credit card issuers make up 80 percent of credit card lending in the United States       The Government Accountability Office is the investigative arm of Congress   The report
