                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   made the following Senate floor statement calling for the declassification of specific information not involving intelligence sources and methods in the Phase II report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee last Friday    This past Friday  the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that  among other issues  looks at what we have learned after the attack on Iraq about the accuracy of prewar intelligence regarding links between Saddam Hussein and al Qa   ida   The report is a devastating indictment of the Bush Cheney administration   s unrelenting and misleading effort to convince the American people that Saddam Hussein was linked with al Qa   ida  the perpetrators of the 9 11 attack         Before the war  President Bush said    Y ou can   t distinguish between al Qa   ida and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror     and     This is a man  Saddam  that we know has had connection with al Qa ida   This is a man who  in my judgment  would like to use al Qa ida as a forward army          But the report released by the Intelligence Committee on Friday tells a different story   The report quotes the CIA   s June 2002 assessment that  our assessment of al Qa ida s ties to Iraq rests on a body of fragmented  conflicting reporting from sources of varying reliability    That same CIA report said that    the ties between Saddam and bin Ladin appear much like those between rival intelligence services            The Intelligence Committee   s report quotes a January 2003 prewar CIA assessment that    Saddam Husayn and Usama bin Ladin are far from being natural partners     that Saddam has    viewed Islamic extremists operating inside Iraq as a threat     and that    the relationship between Saddam and bin Ladin appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other           Those accurate prewar assessments didn   t stop the Administration from making many false and misleading statements trying to link Saddam Hussein and al Qa   ida before the war   What is doubly shocking is that the false statements continue to this day       Just last weekend  the Vice President said on Meet the Press that  The evidence we also had at the time was that he  Saddam  had a relationship with al Qaeda        And the Secretary of State told Fox News earlier this week that    There were ties between Iraq and Al Qaida        Just read the Senate Intelligence Committee   s bipartisan report   Those statements are simply not supported by the intelligence  prewar or postwar        Three weeks ago  the President said in a press conference that Saddam Hussein    had relations with Zarqawi    the recently killed terrorist       The Intelligence Committee   s report demonstrates that statement to be flat out false   The Committee report discloses  for the first time  the CIA   s previously classified October 2005 assessment that Saddam   s regime    did not have a relationship  harbor  or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi and his associates             But neither the CIA   s assessment nor the Committee   s report has stopped the false statements   Just last Sunday  the Vice President said on Meet the Press that  We know that Zarqawi     fled and went to Baghdad and set up operations in Baghdad in the spring of  02 and was there from then  basically  until basically the time we launched into Iraq          Just last weekend  the Secretary of State told CNN  We know that Zarqawi ran a poisons network in Iraq    So was Iraq involved with terror   Absolutely  Iraq was involved with terror        And just this week  Tony Snow  the White House spokesman said    there was a relationship    between Saddam and Zarqawi       Don   t they read the CIA   s assessments   If they do and disagree  they should say so   Again  the CIA   s October 2005 assessment said  flat out  Saddam   s regime    did not have a relationship  harbor  or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi and his associates             There are many more misleading statements   In the fall of 2001  the Czech intelligence service provided the CIA with reporting based on a single source who stated that the lead 9 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April 2001       On December 9  2001  Vice President Cheney was asked about the report on Meet the Press   The Vice President said  said that       it s been pretty well confirmed that he  9 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta  did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April  several months before the attack          On March 24  2002  the Vice President told Meet the Press that    We discovered  and it s since been public  the allegation that one of the lead hijackers  Mohammed Atta  had  in fact  met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague            But the Intelligence Committee   s report declassifies  for the first time  a July 2002  a Defense Intelligence Agency paper that said    Muhammad Atta reportedly was identified by an asset  not an officer  of the Czech    service only after Atta s picture was widely circulated in the media after the attacks  approximately five months after the alleged meeting occurred    and that    there is no photographic  immigration or other documentary evidence indicating Atta was in the Czech Republic during the time frame of the meeting          Two months later  in September 2002  CIA published it   s assessment that    evidence casts doubt    on the possibility that the meeting had occurred and that  The CIA and FBI have reviewed the reporting available so far and are unable to confirm that Atta met al Ani in Prague         None of those assessments stopped the Vice President from continuing to suggest that the report of the meeting was evidence that Saddam   s regime was linked to the 9 11 attackers   On September 8  2002 in a Meet the Press interview the Vice President said that the CIA considered the report of the meeting    credible     although  again  that same month the CIA said that there was evidence that    cast doubt    on it having occurred       In January 2003  still before the war  the CIA published an assessment stating that     A CIA and FBI review of intelligence and open source reporting leads us to question the information provided by the Czech service source who claimed that Atta met al Ani      The January 2003 paper stated that CIA was  increasingly skeptical that Atta traveled to Prague in 2001 or met with IIS officer al Ani    and that  the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility          But the Vice President continued to be undeterred by the CIA   s skepticism   In September of 2003  eight months after the CIA said that the most reliable reporting cast doubt on the possibility of a meeting between Atta and the Iraqi intelligence officer  Vice President Cheney was still citing it as having possibly occurred       On January 19  2004  a full year after the CIA expressed serious doubts about the meeting and the fact that not a shred of evidence had been found to support the claim of a meeting  the Vice President told the Rocky Mountain News that the Atta meeting was    the one that possibly tied the two  Saddam and the 9 11 attackers  together to 9 11           Six months later  on June 17  2004  the Vice President was asked whether Iraq was involved in 9 11   The Vice President said    We don   t know    We had one report  this was the famous report on the Czech intelligence service  and we   ve never been able to confirm it or to knock it down   We just don   t know      The Vice President may not have    known    but the intelligence community sure as heck didn   t believe     for a long time before the Vice President   s statement     that the meeting took place       Now the Senate Intelligence Committee   s report says that    Postwar findings     confirm that no such meeting occurred          But just last Sunday  before a nationally televised audience  the Vice President was asked whether the meeting occurred   The Vice President replied    We don   t know          The Intelligence Community does know   The Senate Intelligence Committee knows   The bipartisan report we released last week says    Postwar findings    confirm that no such meeting occurred          The intelligence assessments contained in the Intelligence Committee   s unclassified report are an indictment of the Administration   s continuing misleading attempts to link Saddam Hussein to al Qa   ida    Portions of the report which have been kept from public view provide some of the clearest evidence of this Administration   s false statements and distortions       Among what remains classified  and therefore covered up  includes deeply disturbing information   Much of the information redacted from pages 96  97 and 98 of the public report does not jeopardize any intelligence sources or methods   The continued classification of that entire portion of the report reeks of a cover up by the Administration   The Senate should not go along   The public is entitled to the full picture   Unless this report is further declassified  they won   t
