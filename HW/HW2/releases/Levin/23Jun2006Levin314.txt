                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Joe Biden  and Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Carl Levin today hailed the passage of their legislation to fix the failing Bush Administration policy towards North Korea  Though President Bush named North Korea as part of the    Axis of Evil    in 2002  his Administration has allowed that country to grow ever more dangerous in the four years since        The legislation  passed as part of the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill  is a Congressional vote of    no confidence    in current Administration policy  It will require the President to appoint a new Senior North Korea Policy Coordinator to conduct a review of our nation   s approach to North Korea  including matters related to security and human rights  and make recommendations about how the US might improve its policy        The legislation would also require the President to report to Congress every 180 days on the number of nuclear weapons likely possessed by North Korea  and the amount of new nuclear material North Korea may have produced  as well as on any new developments in North Korea   s missile programs  The full text of the bill is attached below           President Bush declared he would not tolerate a growing North Korean nuclear threat  but that is exactly what has happened on this Administration   s watch     said Senator Reid     North Korea has grown more dangerous  President Bush and his Congressional allies have allowed this to happen  and it is time to hold them accountable for allowing America to become less secure             The Bush Administration s policy of malign neglect of North Korea was based on the false assumption that the DPRK would solve our problem by collapsing     said Senator Biden     Once again  the Administration has made a colossal misjudgment on a matter vital to our national security  Hopefully a new policy coordinator will allow the Administration to finally speak to North Korea with one voice and to pursue a pragmatic solution to this crisis without delay  The legislation also requires the Administration to fully inform the American people about the nature of the threat we are now facing  Up until now  the Administration has been as skillful downplaying the full scope of North Korea s growing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities as they were at hyping non existent links between Iraq and Al Q aeda and 9 11  It s time the American people learned the hard truth  including the fact that North Korea s stash of plutonium has grown at least 400  on this Administration s watch          Said Senator Levin     When President Bush came into office the intelligence community estimated that North Korea may have had one or two nuclear devices or weapons   Six years later  most experts estimate that North Korea has increased its arsenal over four fold to more than eight nuclear weapons   And North Korea declared last year that it is a nuclear weapons state  The Bush Administration   s ineffective policy has allowed the situation to escalate   Our legislation aims to force the administration to resolve its internal debate about how to deal with North Korea   s nuclear threat  to develop a coordinated strategy and to implement it with the full force of the President   s authority   It also requires regular updated unclassified and classified intelligence assessments to Congress  so that members of Congress and the American people can have a fair  open dialogue with the Administration about U S  policy towards North Korea                     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  as passed the Senate  22 June  2006 on a 96 0 vote         SEC  1209  NORTH KOREA             a  Coordinator of Policy on North Korea
