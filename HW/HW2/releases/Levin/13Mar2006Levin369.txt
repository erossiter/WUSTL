What Should Be Done About It         Washington  DC   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  PSI  has scheduled a hearing entitled     GSA Contractors Who Cheat On Their Taxes And What Should Be Done About It      The hearing is set for Tuesday  March 14  2006  at 9 30 a m  in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building   This hearing is the third hearing by the Subcommittee on federal contractors who abuse the tax system        These contractors are essentially stealing from the American taxpayer     while at the same time making their money from taxpayer dollars   These contractors depend on the federal government for their livelihood     yet refuse to pay their taxes and have instead used the money to purchase million dollar mansions  lakeside getaways and or go high rolling at the casino   This widespread tax cheating by federal contractors must end            During fiscal year 2004 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2005  General Services Administration  GSA  contractors abused the federal tax system with little consequence   Our ongoing PSI investigation   in conjunction with the Government Accountability Office     has discovered that as of June 30  2005  more than 3 800 GSA contractors had tax debts totaling approximately  1 4 billion         In the most recent findings  GAO has identified 25 egregious GSA contractor cases of outright tax fraud   some additional examples of this widespread abuse include            One contractor that provides security services for the federal government was paid more than  1 million from the American taxpayers over the past two years  even though he owes more than  12 million in payroll taxes   Over the last few years  as his company failed to turn over payroll taxes it withheld from its employees paychecks  the owner made large cash withdrawals from the company for his personal use   Over  100 000 of that money was spent on gambling          Another contractor who provides public communications services to the federal government was paid  100 000 and owes more than  2 million in payroll taxes   While he kept his employees    payroll taxes  the owner purchased a residential property valued at  1 million  and made numerous cash withdrawals totaling  500 000 at casinos          A third contractor who sells emergency supplies was paid  100 000 by the federal government  while simultaneously owing more than  700 000 in back taxes   The Internal Revenue Service assessed a penalty against the owner for failing to remit payroll taxes and imposed a federal tax lien that was in effect when the contractor received a federal contract   While refusing to pay his employees    payroll taxes  the owner made several real estate purchases  including a million dollar home        Other owners or officers in a number of other contracting companies own significant personal assets  including commercial properties  and personal residences   many valued over  1 million   Despite these personal assets  the owners or officers failed to remit taxes owed by their businesses  and in some cases  did not pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal income taxes          While the hearing will largely focus on GSA contractors who cheat on their taxes  the IRS will also provide the Subcommittee with an update concerning the 97 federal cases of egregious tax cheats that were identified in the Subcommittee s previous two hearings   Of those 97 egregious cases  only one contractor has been convicted of tax violations   That contractor  named Jack Easterday  was convicted on 47 counts of failing to turn over roughly  18 million in payroll taxes that he had withheld for his employees   Rather than fulfilling his legal obligations and forwarding his employees    taxes to the federal government  he paid himself and his wife an average annual salary of over  338 000   Moreover  he purchased a 10 000 square foot home for  750 000 in 1997   He purchased a dining room table and chairs that seated 22 people along with a 24 place setting of Limoges china   He purchased a Rolex watch for  16 340   He owned a sailboat and jet skis   Essentially  Mr  Easterday was living like Louis XIV  compliments of the American taxpayer          The bottom line is that it   s simply unacceptable that tax cheats who owe the government millions in back taxes get millions of contract dollars from the government with no offset for their tax debt   This Subcommittee will continue to aggressively pursue this matter until the federal government tightens its procedures to ensure that these tax deadbeats are prohibited from receiving lucrative government contracts
