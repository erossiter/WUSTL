On Offshore Tax Haven Abuses  That Cost U S  Taxpayers Over  40 Billion Each Year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Report    PDF    WASHINGTON     At a Tuesday hearing entitled  Tax Haven Abuses  The Enablers  The Tools   Secrecy  the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will expose how offshore and U S  professionals are helping U S  citizens move assets offshore and dodge U S  taxes  adding to tax haven abuses that cost U S  taxpayers an estimated  40 to  70 billion dollars each year       A year long bipartisan Subcommittee investigation examined six case studies illustrating the operation of the offshore tax industry  its service providers and clients  and how tax haven abuses are undermining  circumventing  or violating U S  tax  securities  and anti money laundering laws   Subcommittee Chairman Norm Coleman  R Minn   and Ranking Minority Member Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   will release on Tuesday a   PDF  detailing the findings of the investigation           Offshore tax havens hold trillions of dollars in assets supplied by high net worth individuals around the world     Levin said      Our investigation blows the lid off tax haven abuses that use sham trusts  shell corporations  and fake economic transactions to hide the fact that U S  citizens are controlling offshore assets  circumventing U S  legal requirements  and dodging taxes   These outrageous tax haven abuses are eating away at the fabric of our tax system  and it is long  long past time to shut them down   Tax havens have  in effect  declared war on honest U S  taxpayers  and we   ve got to fight back utilizing the full legislative  executive  and administrative powers of the United States government               Using offshore jurisdictions to shelter income is unfair and I intend to fix this problem     said Coleman      Offshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions are used to hold trillions of dollars in assets that are out of reach from taxation   I m particularly troubled by an industry of tax professionals  lawyers  trust specialists  bankers  and brokers  that permit  facilitate  promote  and exploit loopholes in the tax code   We need our professional community to be pillars of commerce rather than pillars of circumvention   We need to close these loopholes            The Levin Coleman report describes a range of sophisticated schemes being used today to enable U S  citizens to shift assets offshore and dodge U S  taxes   The six case studies raise a wide range of U S  tax avoidance  securities  and anti money laundering issues          EDG   This case history examines an offshore promoter located in the United States who recruited clients through the internet and helped them create offshore structures         Turpen Holliday   This case history examines an offshore promoter who developed a how to manual for going offshore and one of his U S  clients who used that manual to move his assets to several tax havens        Greaves Neal   This case history examines a U S  businessman who  with the guidance of a prominent offshore promoter  moved between  400 000 and  500 000 in untaxed business income offshore         Anderson   This case history examines a wealthy American facing criminal charges for allegedly hiding  450 million in stock and cash offshore and disguising his ownership of the offshore corporations that held the assets         POINT   This case history examines an abusive tax shelter sold to five clients  including Haim Saban and Robert Wood Johnson IV  to erase  2 billion in capital gains and about  300 million in taxes   It used an offshore stock portfolio held by shell corporations with fake securities losses  operating under offshore secrecy practices that hid the scheme        Wylys   This case history examines two U S  citizens  Sam and Charles Wyly  who moved about  190 million in stock options offshore to a complex array of 58 offshore trusts and corporations  and utilized a wide range of offshore mechanisms to exercise direction over these assets and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment gains  which were then used to provide loans  finance business ventures  acquire real estate  and buy art  furnishings and jewelry for the personal use of Wyly family members          In reviewing these case histories  the investigation found   1  that offshore    service providers    use trustees  directors  and officers who comply with client directions when managing offshore entities and do not operate them independently   2  tax haven secrecy laws and practices make it easy to conceal and obscure the economic realities underlying financial transactions with unfair results unintended under U S  tax and securities laws   3  tax haven secrecy laws and practices intentionally make it difficult for U S  law enforcement  creditors  and others to learn the identity of the beneficial owners of offshore entities   4  U S  citizens  with the assistance of lawyers  brokers  bankers  and offshore service providers  use offshore entities to circumvent U S  tax  securities  and anti money laundering requirements   5  U S  financial institutions have failed to identify the beneficial owners of offshore trusts and corporations that opened securities accounts  even when the financial institutions knew that the offshore entities were closely associated with U S  taxpayers   6  U S  corporate insiders have used offshore entities to trade their company   s stock  circumventing U S  securities disclosure and trading requirements   7  stock options  which are taxed when exercised rather than when granted  are the subject of potentially abusive tax shelters to avoid the U S  tax due on this compensation  and  8  U S  citizens who have transferred assets to allegedly independent offshore entities in tax havens have directed those offshore entities to transfer the assets to a hedge fund controlled by the same U S  persons  thereby regaining control of the assets       Reforms recommended by the Levin Coleman report to reign in tax haven abuses include the following         Presumption of Control   U S  tax  securities  and anti money laundering laws should include a presumption that offshore trusts and shell corporations are under the control of the U S  persons supplying or directing the use of the offshore assets  where those trusts or shell corporations are located in a jurisdiction designated as a tax haven by the Treasury Secretary       Disclosure of U S  Stock Holdings   U S  publicly traded corporations should be required to disclose in their SEC filings company stock held by an offshore trust or shell corporation related to a company director  officer  or large shareholder  even if the offshore entity is allegedly independent   Corporate insiders should be required to make the same disclosure in their SEC filings       Offshore Entities as Affiliates   An offshore trust or shell corporation related to a director  officer  or large shareholder of a U S  publicly traded corporation should be required to be treated as an affiliate of that corporation  even if the offshore entity is allegedly independent       1099 Reporting   Congress and the IRS should make it clear that a U S  financial institution that opens an account for a foreign trust or shell corporation and determines  as part of its anti money laundering duties  that the beneficial owner of the account is a U S  taxpayer  must file a 1099 form with respect to that beneficial owner       Real Estate and Personal Property   Loans that are treated as trust distributions under U S  tax law should be expanded to include  not just cash and securities as under present law  but also loans of real estate and personal property of any kind including artwork  furnishings and jewelry   Receipt of cash or other property from a foreign trust  other than in an exchange for fair market value  should also result in treatment of the U S  person as a U S  beneficiary       Hedge Fund AML Duties   The Treasury Secretary should finalize a proposed regulation requiring hedge funds to establish anti money laundering programs and report suspicious transactions to U S  law enforcement   This regulation should apply to foreign based hedge funds that are affiliated with U S  hedge funds and invest in the United States        Stock Option Annuity Swaps   Congress and the IRS should make it clear that taxes on stock option compensation cannot be avoided or deferred by exchanging stock options for other assets of equivalent value such as private annuities       Sanctions on Uncooperative Tax Havens   Congress should authorize the Treasury Secretary to identify tax havens that do not cooperate with U S  tax enforcement efforts and eliminate U S  tax benefits for income attributed to those jurisdictions         This hearing and report follow numerous investigations into offshore abuses by the Subcommittee   Hearings held by the Subcommittee in 2001 examined the historic and ongoing lack of cooperation by some offshore tax havens with international tax enforcement efforts and their resistance to divulging information needed to detect  stop and prosecute U S  tax evasion  A hearing held in December 2002 and report issued in January 2003 provided an in depth examination of an abusive tax shelter used by Enron  Two days of hearings in November 2003  and a bipartisan report issued in 2005  provided an inside look at how some respected accounting firms  banks  investment advisors  and lawyers had become engines pushing the design  sale  and implementation of abusive tax shelters to corporations and individuals across the country
