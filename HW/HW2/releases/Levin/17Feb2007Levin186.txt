Jurisdictions     101   Establishes rebuttable evidentiary presumptions in tax and securities legal proceedings for non publicly traded entities located in Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions   The presumptions are as follows     Control     In a tax proceeding  if a U S  person  other than a publicly traded corporation  directly or indirectly formed  transferred assets to  or was a beneficiary of  or received distributions from an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction entity  it will be presumed that the person exercised control over the entity      Transfers of income     In a tax proceeding  any amount or thing of value  transferred to a U S  person  other than a publicly traded corporation  directly or indirectly from an account or entity in an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction  or  transferred from such a U S  person directly or indirectly to an account or entity in an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction   will be presumed to represent previously unreported income to the U S  person in the year of transfer      Beneficial ownership     In a proceeding to enforce securities law  if a U S  person  other than a publicly traded corporation  formed  transferred assets to  or benefited from an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction entity  other than a publicly traded corporation   it will be presumed that the person beneficially owned and exercised control over such entity  regardless of the nominal ownership      Foreign financial accounts     Current law requires that U S  taxpayers report to the IRS any foreign financial accounts containing at least  10 000  known as an FBAR filing    Bill establishes presumption that any account in an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction contains funds sufficient to trigger this reporting requirement    These presumptions are needed in civil judicial and administrative proceedings because the tax  corporate  or bank secrecy laws and practices of these jurisdictions make it nearly impossible for U S  authorities to gain access to needed information   Presumptions may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence   No evidence may be accepted from a non U S  person unless the person appears to testify in the proceedings      Treasury and SEC are authorized to issue regulations or guidance to implement this section  and exempt classes of transactions  such as corporate reorganizations  that do not present the potential for abuse   Determine

authority to issue credit cards for use in the United States      Allow more time for investigations involving Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions     103    Extends from three years to six years the

directly or indirectly opening a financial account or creating an entity in an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction for a U S  client to report the transaction to the IRS       These filing requirements

S  beneficiaries    Limit legal opinion protection from penalties with respect to transactions involving Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions     106    Denies the penalty protections afforded by a legal opinion if the transaction involves an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction   Treasury is also authorized to exempt opinions that express a high confidence level regarding the tax treatment of the transaction and opinions on certain classes of transactions that are determined not to present the potential for abuse addressed by the bill      TITLE II     Other Measures to Combat Tax Haven and Tax Shelter Abuses  Increase penalty for failing to disclose offshore holdings     201    Imposes penalty of up to  1 million per violation of U S  securities law on public companies or their officers

for U S  correspondent account records of financial institutions located in an Offshore Secrecy Jurisdiction   authorizing courts to presume for any summons relating to transactions in Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions that there is a reasonable basis for believing the case involves non compliance with tax laws  and  permitting a court to authorize John Doe summonses on an open ended basis for three year periods for project investigations  provided that the court exercises ongoing oversight of the IRS summonses   The bill requires GAO evaluation of this provision after five years   Improve enforcement of foreign financial account reporting     205    Clarifies the authority of IRS agents investigating Foreign Bank Account Report  FBAR  violations to use tax information in the
