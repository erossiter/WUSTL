                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   today hailed final approval of legislation to collectively honor the Tuskegee Airmen with the Congressional Gold Medal   The bill highlights the courageous accomplishments of the airmen as pilots as well as the revolutionary reforms they inspired in the Armed Forces  The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier     which was sponsored by Rep  Charlie Rangel  D N Y      and it now will go to the President for his signature          The Tuskegee Airmen were a heroic and trailblazing force in the struggle for civil rights and are richly deserving of the highest honor that Congress can bestow upon them     said Levin  who wrote and sponsored the bipartisan bill  which included 77 cosponsors      I am proud to play a part in ensuring that their legacy is enshrined in American history             This heroic group of African American flyers fought in two types of battles   the battle of World War II and the battle against racism at home     said Stabenow      These soldiers are a vital part of both America   s and Michigan   s history  and I am thrilled they will finally receive the recognition they deserve          The Tuskegee Airmen were not only unique in their military record  but they inspired revolutionary reform in the armed forces  paving the way for integration of the armed services in the U S   The largely college educated Tuskegee Airmen overcame the enormous challenges of prejudice and discrimination  succeeding despite obstacles that threatened failure   What made these men exceptional was their willingness to leave their families and put their lives on the line to defend rights that were denied them here at home       The story of the Tuskegee Airmen began in 1941 when President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the creation of an all black flight training program at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama   President Roosevelt did so one day after the NAACP filed suit in federal court on behalf of a Howard University student and others to force the Department of Defense to accept black pilot trainees         The first aviation cadet class of 13 young black pilot candidates began training at Tuskegee Army Air Field in the summer of 1941   In September 1941  Captain Benjamin O  Davis  Jr   a West Point graduate  became the first African American to fly solo as a U S  Army Air Corps officer   In March 1942  five young black pilots  including Davis  successfully completed training and received Army Air Corps silver pilot wings   Davis later became the first African American to rise to the rank of general in the U S  Air Force       Four hundred fifty African American fighter pilots fought in aerial battles over North Africa  Sicily and Europe during World War II   Sixty six of the pilots died in combat  while another 33 were shot down and captured as prisoners of war   The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 261 aircraft destroyed  148 aircraft damaged  15 553 combat sorties and 1 578 missions   In addition  as an escort fighter wing they never lost a bomber to enemy fighters  German pilots feared and respected them   White American bomber crews referred to them as  Redtailed Angels  because of the bright red paint on the tail assemblies and because of their reputation for not losing bombers to enemy fighters   Altogether  almost 1 000 African American pilots graduated from Tuskegee Institute  with the last class finishing in June 1946       Michigan shares a rich history with the Tuskegee Airmen   In addition to their training at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama  in subsequent years some of the airmen trained at Selfridge Field and Oscoda Field   The late Coleman Young  former mayor of the City of Detroit  trained as a navigator bombardier for the 477th bombardment group of the Tuskegee Airmen   This group was still in training when WWII ended so they never saw combat   However  the important fact is that all of those receiving flight related training     nearly 1 000     were instrumental in breaking the segregation barrier   They all had a willingness to see combat and committed themselves to the segregated training with a purpose to defend their country       Congress recognizes outstanding achievements through the commissioning of Congressional Gold Medals   Since 1776  approximately 300 people and the American Red Cross have received this honor   Awardees include individuals from diverse backgrounds including the military  arts  athletics  aviation  exploration  politics  religion  medicine  science and entertainment
