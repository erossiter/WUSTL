                                                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON     U S  Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   joined five of their Senate colleagues last week in sponsoring bipartisan legislation to increase funding for Great Lakes ecosystem restoration   The Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act  S  508  would authorize  6 billion over 10 years for new Great Lakes grants   The legislation would also codify into law the Great Lakes Federal Interagency Task Force  created by Executive Order in May 2004  to strengthen coordination of federal Great Lakes activities          While the Great Lakes made strides after environmental protections were put in place 30 years ago  progress in the last 15 years has been very slow     said Levin      This legislation would provide the federal commitment of funding and resources to keep pace with the restoration needs of the Great Lakes   The Great Lakes are a unique and valuable resource and Congress must act to enhance their restoration and protection             As a Michigan senator  I feel a special responsibility to protect the Great Lakes  They are not only a source of clean drinking water for more than 30 million people but are also an integral part of Michigan   s heritage and its economy     Stabenow said            Ultimately  we need to make restoration of the Great Lakes a national priority  similar to what was done for the Florida Everglades  and this legislation moves us in that direction     she said     By setting priorities for restoration projects  and providing essential funding  this important legislation will help restore and protect our great national treasures   the Great Lakes          The Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act would do the following      Grants  The bill would restore the Great Lakes ecosystem by authorizing up to  600 million annually for 10 years in competitive grants administered by Environmental Protection Agency   s  EPA  Great Lakes National Program Office   These grants would be in addition to the existing federal efforts in the Great Lakes   The Program Office  in consultation with the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board  would award grants to states  municipalities  and other applicants   At least one project in each Great Lake state would be funded each year   Every Great Lakes state would receive a minimum of 6 percent of the total available funding each year  and no state could receive more than 30 percent of the total funding each year   Additionally  grants would have to address one or more of the designated Great Lakes restoration priorities designated by the Advisory Board      Advisory Board  The governor led Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board would be comprised of Great Lakes governors  mayors and local officials  and federal agencies  along with Native American tribes  environmentalists  industry representatives  and Canadian observers  This Advisory Board would determine the priority issues for grants issued under the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Grant Program and advise the Program Office on the grant proposals that should be funded        Interagency Task Force   The bill would codify the Great Lakes Federal Agency Task Force  created by Executive Order  to strengthen coordination of federal Great Lakes activities   The EPA would lead the Council and participants would include the key federal agencies involved in Great Lakes work such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Army Corps of Engineers  and Fish and Wildlife Service   The bill would also codify the existing Great Lakes Regional Collaboration process to ensure the preparation and oversight of the development and implementation of the comprehensive restoration action plan      Monitoring   The Great Lakes National Program Office  in coordination with other federal agencies and Canada  would develop indicators of water quality and related environmental factors in the Great Lakes  as well as a network to monitor those indicators regularly throughout the Great Lakes basin   The Program Office would report to Congress on the changes in water quality after initial benchmark data is collected within four years  and again every two years thereafter         Senator Mike DeWine  R Ohio  introduced the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act   DeWine and Levin are co chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force   Other original cosponsors include Senators Evan Bayh  D Ind   Richard Lugar  R Ind   Herb Kohl  D Wisc   and Mark Dayton  D Minn
