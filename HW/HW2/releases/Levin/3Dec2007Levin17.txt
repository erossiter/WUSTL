Interest Rate Increases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON     Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the U S  Senate   s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  will hold a hearing on Tuesday  December 4  2007  to examine the credit card industry   s practice of imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who pay their bills on time in compliance with their credit card agreements           Credit card companies go too far when they hike the interest rates of consumers who are faithfully paying their credit card bills  just to squeeze more finance charges from them     said Levin      Some credit card companies are foisting interest rates as high as 25  or 30  on responsible consumers  claiming they have become greater credit risks even when those same consumers haven   t missed paying a bill in years   And credit card companies reach back and apply the higher interest rate retroactively to a consumer   s existing credit card debt  forcing the consumer to pay more even though they paid their past credit card bills on time   Right now  credit card companies are the only lenders allowed to retroactively change the interest rate on a consumer loan where the consumer has met their borrowing obligations   This unfair credit card practice needs to stop              Without a doubt  many Americans are frustrated by certain credit card practices  often finding themselves saddled with interest rates that skyrocket seemingly out of the blue     said Coleman      At our March hearing  I challenged the credit card industry to address these concerns so that the federal government wouldn   t have to   To that end  some credit card companies have taken the initiative to correct the inadequacies of their disclosures and proposed new  clearer formats to better provide truly effective notices   I applaud their efforts  but more needs to be done to make policies transparent and predictable for consumers  These reforms will require the industry to focus on clear  user friendly disclosures and common sense  straight forward alerts when an issuer wants to change a card   s terms   At this hearing  I will urge industry experts to develop new solutions to create a more consumer friendly lending environment in the future           The hearing is the second in a series of Subcommittee hearings into unfair credit card practices   The Subcommittee   s first hearing in March examined industry practices that collect interest on credit card debt that is paid on time  impose steep and sometimes duplicative late  over the limit  or other fees on consumers  apply consumer payments first to the debt with the least expensive interest charges instead of those with the most expensive charges  and impose substantial penalty interest rates that can exceed 30         The upcoming December hearing will examine practices related to imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who have complied with their credit card obligations  in particular the industry wide practice of applying higher interest rates to existing credit card debt        The hearing is the result of a Subcommittee investigation into interest rate practices at the five major credit card issuers who handle 80  of U S  credit cards   This investigation found that two of the issuers  Bank of America and Discover  increase the interest rates of cardholders whose    credit scores    have dropped  on the ground that these consumers pose a greater credit risk  even if they have a history of timely payments to the company   The investigation learned that another major credit card issuer  Capital One  on two occasions in 2007  increased the interest rates of consumers who paid their bills on time  not because of lower credit scores  but because the company had decided to pass on borrowing costs to its cardholders         The two remaining major issuers  Citi Cards and Chase  have recently discontinued the practice of imposing interest rate increases on cardholders who meet their credit card obligations   Citi announced its policy change at the Subcommittee   s March hearing  Chase announced on November 19  2007  while their interest rate policies and practices were being examined by the Subcommittee  that it will discontinue by March 2008 the practice of increasing cardholders    interest rates due to credit score drops           Some contend credit card companies are repricing cardholders based on objective criteria     said Levin     but the truth is there is a lot of arbitrariness in how interest rates are set   We   ve seen a consumer whose credit card was assigned four different interest rates over the same year  going from 15  to 19   27   and then 6   for no discernable reason   Another consumer with four cards from the same credit card company had four different interest rates  8   14   19   and 27   even though she presumably posed the same credit risk on each   Those interest rates are all over the map   Consumers who play by the rules and pay their credit card bills on time shouldn   t get hit with interest rates of 20  25  or 30   credit card companies who impose those high rates are taking unfair advantage of responsible consumers           In May  Levin and Senator Claire McCaskill  D Mo   introduced S  1395  the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act  which would stop credit card interest rate increases except in four circumstances    1  after the lapse of an introductory interest rate   2  pursuant to a variable interest rate   3  pursuant to the application of a previously disclosed penalty interest rate after a cardholder violates the credit card agreement  and  4  where the cardholder agrees to the increase at the time it is proposed   The bill would also prohibit the application of higher interest rates to existing credit card debt   Instead  a higher interest rate could be applied only to credit card debt incurred after the increase took effect   S  1395 is also cosponsored by Senators Leahy  Durbin  Bingaman  Cantwell  Whitehouse  and Kohl      Case Histories   The Subcommittee will examine eight case histories at the hearing   The consumers in the first three case histories will testify  along with three major credit card issuers  Bank of America  Capital One  and Discover        1  Janet Hard of Freeland  Michigan  has had a Discover credit card for many years   In 2006  Discover increased her interest rate from 18  to 24    Discover increased the rate  because Ms  Hard   s FICO credit score had dropped  even though she had always made her payments to Discover on time and paid at least the minimum amount due   Discover applied the 24  rate to her existing credit card debt which was then about  8 300  increasing her finance charges   A year later  Discover lowered the rate to 21    Over the last twelve months  despite making steady payments totaling  2 400 and keeping new purchases on her card to less than  100  the higher interest rates meant that Ms  Hard was able to reduce her principal debt by only  350        2  Millard Glasshof of Milwaukee  Wisconsin  is a senior citizen living on a fixed income   For years he made a  119 monthly payment to Chase to pay off a credit card debt that is now about  4 800   In December 2006  Chase increased his interest rate from 15  to 19  and then in February 2007  to 27    Application of the 27  rate to Mr  Glasshof   s existing debt meant that  out of his  119 payment  about  114 went to pay finance charges and only  5 went to reducing his principal debt   He was also assessed multiple over limit fees   Over the last twelve months  Mr  Glasshof made payments to Chase totaling  1 300  but his  4 800 debt did not decline at all   After the Subcommittee inquired about his account  Chase reduced his interest rate to 6    By then  however  Mr  Glasshof had taken out a personal loan to pay off his Chase card and close the account          3  Bonnie Rushing of Naples  Florida  has two Bank of America cards  one of which is affiliated with the American Automobile Association     AAA       Both cards had interest rates of about 8    In April 2007  despite her history of timely payments  Bank of America nearly tripled the interest rate on her AAA card from 8  to 23    It increased the rate  because Ms  Rushing   s FICO score had dropped   She speculates that her score dropped after she opened Macy   s and J  Jill credit cards to obtain discounts on initial purchases   Ms  Rushing told Bank of America that she had not received notice of the rate increase and wanted to opt out  but bank personnel told her she had missed the opt out deadline and pressed her to accept a higher interest rate   She complained to the Florida Attorney General  the Subcommittee  and AAA  and closed her account   After two months  Bank of America restored the 8  rate on her closed account        4  Gayle Corbett of Seattle  Washington  over a period of less than twelve months in 2007  was subjected to three separate interest rate increases on her Bank of America  Citi Card  and Capital One credit cards   Bank of America and Citi increased her rate  because her FICO score had dropped    Citi later discontinued this policy    Capital One increased her rate  not due to her credit score  but as part of a larger effort to pass on increased borrowing costs to its cardholders   Ms  Corbett was able to convince each issuer to partially or fully retract its rate increase   Her interest rates on the three cards are now 10   19   and 15    She told the Subcommittee that contesting these three rate increases  none of which were her fault and all of which threatened her ability to repay her debts  had left her exhausted and worried about future rate increases         5  Agnes Holmes of Montgomery  Alabama  is a loyal Chase customer with two Chase credit cards   In 2007  despite her history of on time payments  Chase increased the interest rate on one of her cards from 19  to 30    Chase attributed the increase to a drop in her credit score  but Ms  Holmes employs a service that tracks her credit reports to prevent identity theft and provides her credit score on a quarterly basis  she provided materials showing that  during the period in question  her credit score had remained at or above 700   After the Subcommittee inquired about her account  Chase reduced her rate to 13  and refunded the excess finance charges          6  Linda Fox of Circleville  Ohio  has had a Capital One credit card for more than ten years   In April 2007  Capital One increased her interest rate from 8  to 13   after a decision to pass on increased borrowing costs to its cardholders   Capital One   s automated system had selected accounts which had not had an interest rate increase in three years and had what the system deemed a    below market    interest rate   Ms  Fox   s account was one of many selected for an increase  which was then applied to her existing credit card debt   In November  after a Subcommittee inquiry  Capital One allowed Ms  Fox to close her account and repay her debt at her former rate of 8         7  Marjorie Hancock of Arlington  Massachusetts  has four Bank of America cards  all of which carry debt balances   In August 2007  because her credit score had dropped  Bank of America increased the interest rate on one of her cards from 19  to 27   even though she regularly paid all of her credit card bills on time   The 27  rate was applied to her existing debt on the card   Her four Bank of America cards now carry interest rates of 8   14   19   and 27   even though she carries similar amounts of debt on each and presumably presents each with the same credit risk   In addition  although Bank of America increased her rate on one card because she was allegedly a higher credit risk  it has continued to mail her credit card checks allowing her to incur still more debt        8  Donna Bernard of Dallas  Texas  has multiple credit cards with substantial debt but pays her credit card bills on time and pays at least the minimum amount due   She has not used her Chase credit card since 2001 to make a purchase  instead making regular payments to reduce a  7 900 debt   Despite her on time payments  Chase nearly doubled her interest rate  from 15  to 29    Ms  Bernard attempted to opt out of the increase  but was told she had missed the opt out deadline and closed accounts are not protected from interest rate increases   Before the increase  when Ms  Bernard made a  170 payment  about  100 went to pay for finance charges and  70 to pay down the principal debt   After the increase  out of a  200 payment   199 75 went to pay for finance charges and only 25 cents went to pay down the principal debt   After a Subcommittee inquiry about the account  Chase restored her 15  interest rate
