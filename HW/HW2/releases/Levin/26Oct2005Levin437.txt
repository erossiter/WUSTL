                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON     Late Tuesday  the Senate approved a resolution authored by Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   that honored the life and accomplishments of Rosa Parks and expressed condolences on her death this week   Levin delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor       Last evening  we lost Rosa Parks  She died at the age of 92  Her personal bravery and self sacrifice have shaped this Nation s history and she is remembered with reverence and respect by us all            A half century ago  Rosa Parks    the black seamstress who refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery  Alabama  bus to a white man    sparked a revolution in American race relations  Rosa Parks decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus  In her own words  Rosa Parks said   People always say that I didn t give up my seat because I was tired  but that isn t true  I was not tired physically  or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day  I was not old  although some people have an image of me as being old then  I was forty two  No  the only tired I was  was tired of giving in             The strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American people but the entire world  Rosa Parks s arrest for violating the city s segregation laws was the catalyst for the Montgomery bus  boycott  Her stand on that December day in 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle for equality and justice  Twelve years earlier  in 1943  Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city s bus related segregation laws requiring blacks to pay their fares at the front of the bus  then get off of the bus and reboard from the rear of the bus  The driver of that bus  was the same driver with whom she would have her confrontation years later            The rest is history  the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American revolution that elevated that status of African Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor  the Reverend Martin Luther King  Jr            For her personal bravery and self sacrifice  in 1999  we honored Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal            My home State of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our own  Rosa Parks and her husband Raymond made the journey to Detroit in 1957 where Rosa Parks s brother resided  In the years since  she continued to dedicate her life to advancing equal opportunity and to educating our youth about the past struggles for freedom  from slavery up to the civil rights movement of the 1960s            In 1987  the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development was established  Its primary focus has been working with young people from across the country and the world as part of the  Pathways to Freedom  program  The pathways program traces history from the days of the underground railroad to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and beyond  Through this institute  young people  ages 11 to 17  meet with national leaders and participate in a variety of educational and research projects  During the summer months  they have the opportunity to travel across the country visiting historical sites            The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development has expanded to include an intergenerational mentoring and computer skills partnership program  which teams young people with elderly Americans  Generational and age barriers break down as young people help the elderly develop computer skills  while the elderly provide their unique and personalized recollections of their lives in American history  To date  over 10 000 youth from around the world have participated in this program            With the work of her institute  we can truly say that in addition to having played a major role in shaping America s past and present  Rosa Parks is continuing to help shape America s future            Mr  President  I close with the profound  instructive words of Rosa Parks  which she spoke in 1988  She said   I am leaving this legacy to all of you       to bring peace  justice  equality  love and a fulfillment of what our lives should be  Without vision  the people will perish  and without courage and inspiration  dreams will die  the dream of freedom and peace                Following is the text of the Levin resolution  S  Res  287  approved by the Senate       Whereas Rosa Parks was born on February 4  1913  as Rosa Louise McCauley  to James and Leona McCauley in Tuskegee  Alabama            Whereas her moral clarity and quiet dignity shaped and inspired the Civil Rights Movement in the United States over the last half century        Whereas Rosa Parks was educated in Pine Level  Alabama  until the age of 11  when she enrolled in the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls and then went on to attend the Alabama State Teachers College High School        Whereas on December 18  1932  Rosa McCauley married Raymond Parks and settled in Montgomery  Alabama        Whereas  together  Raymond and Rosa Parks worked in the Montgomery  Alabama branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP   where Raymond Parks served as an active member and Rosa Parks served as a secretary and youth leader        Whereas on December 1  1955  Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat in the  colored  section of the bus to a white man on the orders of the bus driver because the  white  section was full        Whereas the arrest of Rosa Parks led African Americans and others to boycott the Montgomery city bus line until the buses in Montgomery were desegregated        Whereas the 381 day Montgomery bus boycott encouraged other courageous people across the United States to organize in protest and demand equal rights for all        Whereas most historians date the beginning of the modern day Civil Rights Movement in the United States to December 1  1955        Whereas the fearless acts of civil disobedience displayed by Rosa Parks and others resulted in a legal action challenging Montgomery s segregated public transportation system  which subsequently led to the United States Supreme Court  on November 13  1956  affirming a district court decision that held that Montgomery segregation codes deny and deprive African Americans of the equal protection of the laws  352 U S  903         Whereas in 1957  Rosa Parks moved to Detroit  Michigan        Whereas in 1965  Representative John Conyers hired Rosa Parks as a member of his staff  where she worked in various administrative jobs for 23 years and retired in 1988 at age 75        Whereas Rosa Parks continued her civil rights work by starting the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in 1987  a nonprofit organization that motivates young people to reach their highest potential        Whereas the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development offers educational programs for young people  including two signature programs  first  Pathways to Freedom  a 21 day program that introduces students to the Underground Railroad and the civil rights movement with a freedom ride across the United States and Canada  tracing the underground railroad into civil rights  and second  Learning Centers and Senior Citizens  a program that partners young people with senior citizens where the young help the senior citizens develop their computer skills and senior citizens mentor the young        Whereas Rosa Parks has been commended for her work in the realm of civil rights with such recognitions as the NAACP s Spingarn Medal  the Martin Luther King  Jr   Nonviolent Peace Prize  the Presidential medal of Freedom  and the Congressional Gold Medal        Whereas Time magazine named Rosa Parks one of the  100 most influential people of the 20th century   The Henry Ford Museum in Michigan bought and exhibited the bus on which she was arrested  and The Rosa Parks Library and Museum opened in Montgomery in 2000        Whereas in 2005  the year marking the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks  refusal to give up her seat on the bus  we recognize the courage  dignity  and determination displayed by Rosa Parks as she confronted injustice and inequality  and       Whereas in 1988 Rosa Parks said   I am leaving this legacy to all of you       to bring peace  justice  equality  love and a fulfillment of what our lives should be  Without vision  the people will perish  and without courage and inspiration  dreams will die  the dream of freedom and peace   Now  therefore  be it       Resolved  That the Senate honors the life and accomplishments of Rosa Parks and expresses its condolences on her passing
