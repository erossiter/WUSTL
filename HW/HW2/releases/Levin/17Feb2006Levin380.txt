Oversight Hearing on Trade Policy   and the U S  Automobile Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Three weeks ago  President Bush took a    blame Detroit    approach to the auto industry by saying that U S  automakers don   t make    relevant products      That   s like saying the consumer electronics industry doesn   t make relevant products   That industry and so many other manufacturers have been driven overseas even though their products are in great demand in the U S   The President is simply dodging responsibility by not acknowledging that there are serious imbalances on the playing field of trade          U S  automakers are making    relevant products     but they are also struggling with immense costs not faced by their foreign counterparts  including ballooning pension and health care costs   They are competing with currency manipulation by other countries  including China  Japan and Korea  which gives their vehicles and other products an unfair price advantage in our market    Our manufacturers also face trading partners that have markets that are closed to U S  products  and a number of other unfair trade practices         Automotive manufacturing in the U S  has been a lynchpin of our economy  accounting for nearly 4 percent of the U S  GNP and providing generations of workers a good standard of living and quality of life   That is now at risk   Since January  2001  we   ve lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs  with no improvement in sight   The U S  auto industry alone has lost nearly 200 000 jobs since November 2000   Our overall trade deficit hit a record  726 billion in 2005  and much of this deficit is in the automotive sector   Delphi   s bankruptcy and the layoffs at General Motors and Ford Motor Company should be a wake up call that it is time to take action and change the policies that are hurting this important manufacturing industry         Instead of aggressively fighting for U S  interests by challenging illegal trade practices before the WTO  however  President Bush continues to tolerate unfair trade practices and pursue the same failed trade policies that have led to record trade deficits that displace thousands of American workers each year      Most harmful to U S  auto makers is currency manipulation   For instance  since 2000  Japan has followed an aggressive policy of massive currency interventions in global markets in order to keep the value of its yen artificially weak against the dollar   Japan has spent over  420 billion on currency interventions in less than 5 years  The clear purpose of this policy has been to provide Japan   s export industries with a subsidy that creates a significant competitive disadvantage for U S  manufacturers and other key U S  industries        Despite strong economic growth  over the past five years Japan s currency has been undervalued by as much as 36 percent against the dollar  This means a  20 000 car imported from Japan has had an unfair subsidized cost advantage of  2 400 to more than  7 000 over U S  cars  and U S  exports to Japan face the equivalent of  2 400 to more than  7 000 in    tax      Although Japan hasn   t intervened directly in foreign currency markets in the last 18 months  senior Japanese government officials have continued to    jawbone    global financial markets by threatening to intervene              The Bush Administration has also failed to take action on China   s currency manipulation   By rigging its currency at a level that independent experts estimate at between 15 and 40 percent below its appropriate value  China is giving a subsidy to its exports to the United States and imposing a direct cost on U S  exports to China        Korea has also engaged in long term currency manipulation   Despite a May 2005 announcement by the Bank of Korea that it would no longer intervene in foreign exchange markets  Korea   s foreign exchange reserves rose by  4 3 billion in the first half of January 2006  a clear indication that Korean financial authorities had stepped up their intervention to slow the won   s appreciation against the dollar                    On top of all of these problems  the Administration is now proposing two new free trade agreements  one with Korea and one with Thailand  that could tip the scale even further against the U S  auto industry         Despite two separate automotive trade agreements between the U S  and Korea  intended to open Korea   s auto market  which were negotiated in 1995 and 1998  sales of imported vehicles in Korea from every country in the world totaled only 31 000 autos in 2005  or 2 72 percent of Korea   s total domestic auto market   Only about 4 000 of these autos were from the U S   about the same number sold by U S  manufacturers into Korea in1996    Although Korea remains closed to U S  automakers  it exports 70 percent of its automobile production   Korean auto sales into the U S  increased from approximately 132 000 sold in 1996 to approximately 731 000 sold in 2005    Korean passenger cars now make up almost 6 percent of the U S  market for passenger cars   In the meantime  U S  automakers continue to face significant barriers to entry in their attempts to sell into Korea   s auto market   Even Japan  with its notoriously protected automotive market  imports a greater percentage of vehicles  with 5 percent of its total vehicle market comprised of foreign made vehicles          Daimler Chrysler Corporation  Ford Motor Company  and General Motors Corporation have made extensive efforts to increase sales in Korea   Based on the companies    sales performance in every other major market in the world  the shockingly low Korean sales levels are inexplicable and cannot be attributed to marketing  design  or lack of interest        Korea   s barriers to imported automobiles range from an 8 percent passenger vehicle tariff compared to the 2 5 percent U S  tariff  to consumer bias against imports that is promoted by government sponsored anti import policies such as subjecting owners of foreign cars to tax audits   Korea   s tax system disproportionately taxes larger engines  which tend to be imports  significantly inflating the price of imported cars   Korea also maintains a burdensome standards and certification process that can exclude vehicles built outside the country due to high testing costs coupled with the low rate of sales for those vehicles         When the 1998 agreement was reached both USTR and industry said they were pleased with the agreement   The chief USTR negotiator pointed to the language of the agreement as being tighter than anyone thought Korea would agree to   Even with this supposedly air tight language  Korea failed to keep its commitment to    substantially increase market access for foreign passenger vehicles in the ROK      U S  negotiators expected the agreement to result in an increase in the number of U S  cars sold in Korea   It did not   We learned that any progress made in removing one area of standards and certification was negated by new issues that arise in other areas   I am therefore highly skeptical that we can have an agreement with Korea that will result in increased sales of U S  vehicles              Because of these concerns  Senator Voinovich and I  as co chairs of the Senate Auto Caucus  recently sent a letter to the Bush Administration expressing serious concern about a U S  Korea Free Trade Agreement  KFTA           The Thailand FTA that is currently under negotiation poses additional risks to domestic manufacturers   In fact  more than 25 000 U S  pickup truck assembly jobs are directly at stake   If Thailand is granted privileged access to the U S  pickup truck market  that access will be used by third country automobile producers in Thailand  who restrict U S  access to their home markets  as a backdoor into the U S  market   Thailand will be used as an export platform by third countries such as Japan  South Korea  and India  but they would not be required to reduce their own tariff and non tariff barriers to U S  automotive products   Thailand is already the world   s second largest producer of pickup trucks because many producers from outside of Thailand have moved their pickup truck production there   Negotiations on access to such critical segments of the U S  automobile market should not be done bilaterally   These negotiations should be multilateral and should focus on both tariff and non tariff barriers specific to the automobile industry         The U S  auto industry is facing dire circumstances that put the jobs of millions of hard working Americans at risk   It is imperative that we not aggravate the already difficult position of an important U S  industry through a Korea FTA or a U S  Thailand FTA    U S  auto manufacturers can compete effectively anywhere in the world if they are given a fair chance   Right now they don   t have that chance and they are being forced to compete with the odds stacked firmly against them
