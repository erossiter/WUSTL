                 Senator Carl Levin  News Release              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEApril 15  2005 Contact  Press OfficePhone  202 228 3685      Levin Releases Newly Declassified Intelligence Documents  on Iraq al Qaeda Relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Documents show Administration claims were exaggerated      WASHINGTON    Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   today released documents recently declassified at his request that illustrate that some claims of a cooperative relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda made by top administration officials in support of the Iraq war were contrary to what U S  intelligence officials believed to be true          These documents are additional compelling evidence that the Intelligence Community did not believe there was a cooperative relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda  despite public comments by the highest ranking officials in our government to the contrary     Levin said      At a time when the Senate is considering nominees for the newly restructured leadership of the Intelligence Community  these documents remind us of the need to strengthen the independence and objectivity of intelligence assessments  and to guard against the misuse or exaggeration of intelligence by policymakers          The documents that Levin released undermine Administration claims regarding 1  Iraq   s involvement in training al Qaeda operatives  and 2  the likelihood that a meeting occurred between 9 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April 2001      Iraqi training of al Qaeda members    On October 7  2002  President Bush asserted that    Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases             However  according to the newly declassified excerpts of classified documents         Iraq and al Qa   ida  Interpreting a Murky Relationship     states that  relative to a report that Iraq provided chemical and biological weapons assistance to al Qaeda     the level and extent of this is assistance is not clear      The document notes the    many critical gaps    in the knowledge of Iraqi links to al Qaeda because of    limited reporting    and the    questionable reliability of many of our sources           As with much of the information on the overall  Iraq al Qaeda  relationship  details on training and support are second hand or from sources of varying reliability      It also notes that that the Intelligence Community    cannot determine   how many of the reported plans for CBW  Chemical and Biological Warfare  were actually realized           Iraqi Support for Terrorism     discusses the lack of    evidence of completed training     and says most of the reports of training    do not make clear whether training    was    actually implemented       It indicates that some number of the reports appeared to be based on    hearsay     and that others were    simple declarative accusations of Iraqi al Qa   ida complicity with no substantiating detail or other information that might help us corroborate them      Likelihood of Atta meeting with Iraqi officials    On December 9  2001  Vice President Cheney said that the Prague meeting had been    pretty well confirmed     and on September 8  2002  he said     Mohamed Atta  who was the lead hijacker  did apparently travel to Prague on a number of occasions  And on at least one occasion  we have reporting that places him in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official a few months before the attack on the World Trade Center      When asked if the CIA thought the report of the meeting was credible  he said     it   s credible      On January 9  2004  Cheney further said     We did have reporting that was public  that came out shortly after the 9 11 attack  provided by the Czech government  suggesting there had been a meeting in Prague between Mohamed Atta  the lead hijacker  and a man named al Ani  who was an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague  at the embassy there  in April of  01  prior to the 9 11 attacks    That was the one that possibly tied the two together to 9 11          However  according to the newly declassified documents         Iraq and al Qa   ida  Interpreting a Murky Relationship     states     Reporting is contradictory on hijacker Mohammed Atta   s alleged trip to Prague and meeting with an Iraqi intelligence officer  and we have not verified his travels           Iraqi Support for Terrorism     states     some information asserts that Atta met with     al Ani  but the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility       Levin requested declassification of the document excerpts in April 2004 as part of his Armed Services Committee minority inquiry into Iraq intelligence failures   The declassified portions of the documents relate to the Intelligence Community   s analysis of Iraq   s connections to al Qaeda  and demonstrate that the Intelligence Community 1  did not conclude that Iraq had provided training to al Qaeda in Weapons of Mass Destruction technologies  and 2  that it was skeptical of an alleged meeting between the lead 9 11 hijacker  Mohammed Atta  and an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague five months before the 9 11 attacks       As a key part of its case for going to war  the Bush Administration repeatedly suggested that Iraq had a significant cooperative relationship with the people who attacked us on 9 11   The documents provide new  previously classified details demonstrating that Administration statements about the Iraq al Qaeda relationship were not supported by the underlying intelligence
