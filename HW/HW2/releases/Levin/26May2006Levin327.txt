of a New Iraqi Government                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Last evening  during his press conference with Prime Minister Blair on Iraq  President Bush stated that    The formation of a new government represents a new beginning for Iraq and a new beginning for the relationship between Iraq and our coalition           I hope that is not overly optimistic but frankly I   m afraid it is because of the incompleteness of the Iraqi government   The two most important positions   the minister of defense and the minister of the interior   have not been filled   These are critical positions because numerous police and Army units have been dominated by militia members who are loyal to sectarian or political leaders and not to the central government and many militia members outside of the police and Army are engaged in a rampage against innocent civilians               Mr  President  while there have been disagreements on a number of issues related to Iraq  almost everyone has agreed that the new Iraqi government would have to be a government of national unity  with specific emphasis on independent  nonsectarian choices for the positions of minister of defense and minister of the interior  if there was to be a chance of quelling the sectarian violence and defeating the insurgency        Our senior military leaders have been telling us for years that there is no military solution to the violence in Iraq and no way to defeat the insurgency without a political solution among the Iraqis themselves           The government that was announced last weekend and approved by the Iraqi Council of Representatives doesn   t  represent a political solution because it didn   t include the two most important ministries   the ministry of defense and the ministry of the interior   The plain truth is that the various Iraqi political actors were not willing to make the compromises necessary to bring about a government of national unity within the time frame allotted by the Iraqi Constitution          Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  appearing on Fox News Sunday  minimized the lack of selections for those two positions  saying    People are dramatizing the fact that they didn   t get certain posts that they hoped to get      She went on to say        let   s give them three days or four days  or five or six days  to come up with the best possible interior ministry   You know  the five days that they will take to vet people more thoroughly  to make sure that they have the right person  will be well worth it            On Meet The Press that afternoon  Secretary Rice even spoke of this failure as a plus  saying        I think it actually shows some maturity that they were able to go ahead with the formation of the government so that they can start working  but that they can take a little bit longer           How is that a sign of maturity   In my view  both the mature and necessary thing was for the Iraqi political leaders to make the compromises necessary to have formed the entire government  including in particular the minister of defense and the minister of the interior        Mr  President  it was also disappointing that neither the President nor the Secretary of State mentioned anything about the need to amend the Iraqi Constitution        General Casey noted in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee    We ve looked for the constitution to be a national compact  and the perception now is that it s not  particularly among the Sunni     The Iraqi Constitution provides for the appointment of a committee to propose amendments to the Constitution   That Committee has four months to complete its work and to recommend amendments to the Constitution to the full parliament          For a long time  I have been calling for President Bush and officials of his Administration to put pressure on the Iraqis to meet the timetable they set in their own Constitution to form a unity government and to make the changes to their Constitution that would make it a unifying document   I have called for that pressure to be in the form of conditioning the future presence of U S  forces in Iraq on the Iraqis meeting their self imposed deadlines   The President told me in the presence of several other Members of Congress and his national security team that my position has been helpful   He declined to make it his own publicly  however   He needs to do so        Mr  President  these are critically important matters   There needs to be a Government of national unity   There needs to be amendments to the Iraqi Constitution to make it a unifying rather than a divisive document   But that won   t happen if we don   t insist upon the Iraqis meeting the deadlines they themselves established   I hope the President and the Secretary of  State and the U S  Ambassador are saying privately what they haven   t said publicly
