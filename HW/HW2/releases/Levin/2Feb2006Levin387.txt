                                                                                                                                                                WASHINGTON     In response to the concerns of seniors across Michigan  Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow  both D MI  are introducing legislation today  the Medicare Part D Reform Act of 2006  to address some of the major problems in the Medicare prescription drug plan that took effect on January 1            It is just a month into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  and it is a disaster for millions of seniors     Levin said      There are more than a few bugs that need to be worked out   Beneficiaries are confused  and many seniors have less coverage today than they had before the bill   The insurance and pharmaceutical industries have been the principal beneficiaries  not seniors   My legislation would help make Medicare Part D more equitable and efficient              The confusion and incompetence we have seen in the implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug program has put the health of millions of Americans at risk     said Stabenow      These aren   t just issues of bureaucracy and inconvenience     when it comes to seniors getting the medicine they need it can be a matter of life and death   I have heard from seniors all across Michigan about the problems with this new benefit  and this legislation will help fix the problems          The Medicare Part D Reform Act of 2006 contains the following provisions    Restore seniors to discount programs who have been arbitrarily and precipitously cut off    Prior to the enactment of Medicare Part D  some pharmaceutical companies offered lower income individuals prescription drug assistance through Patient Assistance Programs or PAPs   PAPs assist seniors who have income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level   19 600 for a single person or  26 400 for a couple    However  the new Part D benefit provides assistance to individuals only up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level   14 700 for a single person or  19 800 for a couple          Therefore  large numbers of seniors with incomes between  14 700 and  26 400 will have major new expenditures for prescription drugs  Under Medicare Part D  some pharmaceutical companies are now offering both PAPs and Prescription Drug Plans   The Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  recently advised pharmaceutical companies that they could not use PAPs as inducements for low income beneficiaries to sign up for those companies    Prescription Drug Plans  with the result being that many companies have terminated the discount drug card   This provision would clarify that pharmaceutical Patient Assistance Programs are allowed to continue as before          The provision would also clarify that the PAP discount does not count as a contribution towards out of pocket costs  which otherwise would get seniors more quickly to the point where prescription drug coverage stops  the so called    doughnut hole     before starting up again       Prescription Drug Plans  PDPs  will not be permitted to remove drugs from the plan   s list of covered drugs until January 1 of the following year    Currently  Prescription Drug Plans  PDPs  can drop coverage of any medication from their formulary at any time during the calendar year  even seniors may have relied upon the medication being available and covered when choosing that particular plan   This provision would require PDPs to continue to offer all drugs in their formulary for the entire year   If a PDP chooses to discontinue a medication  it must give notice between September 1 and October 15 that it will no longer cover that medication beginning the following January   This change will ensure that seniors will know in a timely manner if their provider plans to drop a medication that they rely on  so they can choose another plan during open enrollment season from November 15     December 31   Plans will continue to be allowed to add prescription drugs to their formulary at any time      Waive co payments for    dual eligibles    who cannot afford them    Former Medicaid recipients have been involuntarily moved into the Medicare prescription drug program   The result has been an increase in co pays and  unlike the Medicaid program  no possible waiver of those co pays        Strike the    Non Interference Clause    from Part D    Current law bars the Department of Health and Human Services from using its bargaining power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies   This legislation would remove that prohibition  which would allow the federal government to save money by negotiating bulk discount pricing
