                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON      Senator Carl Levin  D MI  said today that newly declassified information indicates the Bush Administration   s use of pre war intelligence was misleading          Specifically  newly declassified information from the Defense Intelligence Agency  DIA  from February 2002 shows that  at the same time the Administration was making its case for attacking Iraq  the DIA did not trust or believe the source of the Administration   s repeated assertions that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training   Additional newly declassified information from the DIA also undermines the Administration   s broader claim that there were strong links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda       No Chemical and Biological Weapons Training    The Administration made repeated assertions that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training   For example  President Bush said in a speech in Cincinnati on October 7  2002     We   ve learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases      In February 2003  the President said     Iraq has provided al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training           Those assertions were based on the claims of a detainee  Ibn al Shaykh al Libi  a long time jihadist and senior military trainer for al Qaeda in Afghanistan   However  as revealed by this newly declassified information  the DIA did not believe al Libi   s claims at the time the Administration was making its assertions   Specifically  the DIA concluded the following in February 2002  which has never previously been publicly disclosed           This is the first report from Ibn al Shaykh in which he claims Iraq assisted al Qaida   s CBRN  Chemical  Biological  Radiological or Nuclear  efforts   However  he lacks specific details on the Iraqis involved  the CBRN materials associated with the assistance  and the location where training occurred   It is possible he does not know any further details  it is more likely this individual is intentionally misleading the debriefers  emphasis added    Ibn al Shaykh has been undergoing debriefs for several weeks and may be describing scenarios to the debriefers that he knows will retain their interest            This newly declassified information provides additional  dramatic evidence that the Administration   s pre war statements were deceptive     Levin said      The underlying DIA intelligence simply did not support the Administration   s repeated assertions that Iraq had provided chemical and biological weapons training to al Qaeda   More than a year before Secretary Powell included that charge in his presentation to the United Nations  the DIA had said it believed the detainee   s claims were bogus   The Administration   s use of this intelligence was disingenuous and misleading           The CIA also had reservations about the source   The CIA   s unclassified statement at the time was that the reporting was    credible     a statement the Administration used repeatedly   However  what was selectively omitted was the CIA   s view at the time that the source was not in a position to know whether any training had taken place        According to press reporting  al Libi recanted his claims in January 2004        The recent DIA declassification demonstrates a critical fact  at the very time the Administration was making these unqualified assertions  the DIA believed it was    more likely this individual is intentionally misleading the debriefers    and the CIA believed he was not in a position to know       No Close Relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda    The Administration   s claim that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with chemical and biological weapons training was part of its larger effort to assert a relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda    For example  President Bush said on September 25  2002     You can t distinguish between al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror             The DIA  however  had concluded otherwise   The Administration omitted in its public statements the DIA   s pre war conclusion about the likelihood of links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda   In February 2002  the DIA stated the following  which has remained classified until now            Saddam   s regime is intensely secular and is wary of Islamic revolutionary movements   Moreover  Baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control            That DIA finding is stunningly different from repeated Administration claims of a close relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda     Levin said      Just imagine the impact if that DIA conclusion had been disclosed at the time   It surely could have made a difference in the congressional vote authorizing the war
