General Hayden   s nomination for CIA director                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The most important feature to me  the core issue  is whether or not General Hayden is going to be independent and objective when he delivers his intelligence assessments to the President   George Tenet shaped the intelligence  distorted the intelligence  and exaggerated the intelligence as Director of the CIA   He was doing that in order to please the White House  to give support to the White House for what the White House had obviously decided to do  which was to attack Iraq         That was a highly dangerous thing to do   It got us into all kinds of problems as a result of that flawed intelligence  that distorted intelligence  and the characteristic that I most look for in General Hayden is whether he would stand up to the President or anybody else who   s trying to get him to reach a certain conclusion on the intelligence and speak truth to power   basically say no  and that should be the answer  rather than yes  which too often was the answer given by Director Tenet when he was the director       We saw significant evidence of independence and objectivity in General Hayden   For instance  he stood up to Secretary Rumsfeld when Secretary Rumsfeld wanted certain intelligence components to stay with the Department of Defense   General Hayden  a four star general  in uniform  stood up to Secretary Rumsfeld and said no  he did not think that those elements of the intelligence community should stay with the Defense Department       He also has been very open in his criticism of another part of the Defense Department  which was operated by Mr  Feith   That part of the Defense Department had a pipeline into the White House and was telling the White House that there was a close relationship  for instance  between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein   General Hayden disagreed with that   He gave an indication in his own assessments at NSA that he was not in agreement with that  and in open session the other day  said he was not comfortable with what Mr  Feith had done at the Defense Department       In other ways he has shown some independence and some backbone and a willingness to say no to power   You   ve got to have someone in this position who speaks truth to power   That   s the most important feature  I believe  of this position that we look for       Also  in the way he   s described the NSA  he   s been much more careful in his description of the power that they have and what the program is about than the White House has been   The President has said that the program involves only international phone calls   That is a very partial description and according to press reports  and indeed  according to reports of people who have been briefed on this subject  there is much more to the program  the eavesdropping program  than listening in on some international phone calls         According to those reports  what   s involved also is access to phone records of individuals against whom there   s no suspicion  phone records to determine who they called and who called them   These are totally innocent American citizens whose phone records are involved       When the White House described the program  they didn   t talk about that   They acted as though the entire program there at NSA was listening in on some international phone calls  which were being made by Bin Laden or supporters of Bin Laden or two people in this country who are with al Qaeda   And when General Hayden was asked the question about whether or not the description of the program the President has given and others in the White House  he indicated  he signaled quite clearly that that was not the full program   He didn   t say that because he said he couldn   t because he had to comment in classified session   But what he did say  when I asked him     Was the President   s description of this program the total program     he said     I have to talk about that in classified session      Clearly  if it were the whole program  which the President was describing  he would have been able simply to say     Yes            There are a lot of questions about this program which still need to be explored at NSA   The legal opinions about this program were not written by General Hayden   They were written by the Attorney General   Right in the middle of our inquiry about this program  a lot of unanswered questions still need to be answered   I haven   t reached a conclusion yet about the program itself except to say that there are some troubling questions which remain       But in terms of General Hayden  I think he is qualified  He has shown real evidence of independence and he   s been much more careful  I believe  in his description of this program  which has been approved by this Administration  than has the Administration itself       That   s why I voted for him   That   s why I will support his nomination on the floor
