                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich  and Norm Coleman  R Minn   chairman and Ranking Republican of the Senate   s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  held a hearing of the subcommittee today to examine fees  interest rates  and grace period practices used by credit card companies that saddle consumers with billions of dollars of debt            The credit card industry thrives on the confusion and powerlessness of consumers to both nickel and dime the average card holder and to commit highway robbery of anyone who slips up even in the slightest     said Levin         The committee heard testimony from the CEOs of the top three credit card issuers in the U S   as well an Ohio consumer  Wesley Wannemacher  who used a Chase Bank credit card in 2001 and 2002 to pay for approximately  3 200 in expenses for his wedding   These expenses exceeded the credit card limit of  3 000 by about  200   Over the next six years  he made payments toward the debt averaging about  1 000 per year  and as of February 2007  he had paid about  6 300 on his  3 200 debt   However  his statement showed that he still owed  4 400     a total of  10 700 in charges for  3 200 in purchases          This case may seem extreme or unfair  but what our investigation has shown is that those types of charges and fees are actually common in the credit card industry     said Levin  who added that Wannemacher was contacted by a Chase representative after he agreed to testify before the subcommittee and was told that they had reviewed his account and decided to forgive his balance       In October 2006  Levin released a U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  report analyzing credit card fees  interest rates and related disclosure provided to consumers  The report  which was requested by Levin  was the first federal study to compile in a single place a description of the recent fees  interest rates and disclosure practices of 28 popular credit cards from the six largest credit card issuers   Following the release of the report  Levin began an investigation into some of the practices  focusing on three fundamental issues that will be discussed at the hearing today   grace periods  interest rates  and fees      Grace Periods   The subcommittee   s investigation found that  although many consumers think that all credit cards provide them with a grace period before interest is charged  in fact most credit card issuers do not provide a grace period to cardholders unless they pay their credit card balances in full each month   If a consumer has any balance owing on a card from the prior month  there is no grace period on new purchases    every purchase racks up interest charges from day one      Interest Rates   The subcommittee reviewed the GAO   s findings that credit card issuers typically apply multiple interest rates to the same card  depending on the circumstances   For example  the credit card industry typically uses one interest rate for cash advances  another for regular purchases  a third for balance transfers and account checks  and if a cardholder pays late or exceeds a credit limit  the company may substitute a so called penalty interest rate that can exceed 30    When a consumer pays off a portion     or even the majority     of a monthly balance  the credit card industry charges interest on the entire amount previously owed  including the portion that was paid before the due date           It is indefensible that these banks charge interest on money that a consumer has paid on time     Levin said       Fees   At the hearing  Levin discussed a host of fees imposed by the credit card industry  including late fees  over limit fees  and fees charged for paying a bill over the telephone   Mr  Wannemacher exceeded the limit on his card 3 times for a total of  200  but was then charged 47 over limit fees totaling  1 500  an amount seven times greater than the amount for which he was being penalized            Excessive fees are then made worse by the industry practice of including all fees in a consumer   s outstanding balance so that they incur added interest     Levin said      In other words  the higher the fees  the higher the balances owed  and the higher the interest charges           At the hearing  the bank that handled Mr  Wannemacher   s account announced that it would no longer charge consumers repeated over limit fees  but would limit them to three consecutive charges         The committee heard from the CEOs of the three largest credit card issuers in the country     Bank of America  Chase Bank  and Citigroup     who described the credit card practices use by their banks   The subcommittee also heard testimony from Alys Cohen of the National Consumer Law Center regarding its findings on credit card practices
