with Unpaid Taxes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bill sets deadline for CMS to join federal tax levy program  investigation reveals more than 21 000 Medicare doctors owing  1 3 billion in back taxes      Washington  D C    Senator Norm Coleman  R MN   Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  and Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin  D MI  today introduced legislation to require the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS  to participate in the Federal Payment Levy Program  FPLP   which levies payments from the federal government to recoup outstanding tax debts   At a March hearing  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  testified that more than 21 000 doctors and related health care providers that received Medicare Part B payments in the first nine months of 2005 owed more than  1 3 billion in federal taxes   The hearing also revealed that CMS does not participate in the FPLP for Medicare Parts A and B  GAO concluded that  had CMS sent just a portion of its Part B payments through FPLP  between  50 and  140 million in unpaid federal taxes could have been collected in the first nine months of 2005 alone  Senator Claire McCaskill  D MO  is a cosponsor of this legislation            Due to the fact that CMS has failed to participate in the Federal Payment Levy Program  we have missed countless opportunities to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid federal taxes   This is particularly disturbing because these tax cheats are Medicare providers who make their living from the federal government and  to make matters worse  the average American taxpayer has to pay more taxes to make up the shortfall   Simply put  we need a solution  This is common sense legislation that will put the federal government on the path to recouping these tax debts  and I am pleased to be working with Senator Levin as we move this legislation forward     said Coleman           While the vast majority of Medicare health care providers are honest  tax paying citizens  others have been stuffing taxpayer dollars in their pockets at the same time they have been stiffing Uncle Sam by not paying their taxes     said Levin      The bill we are introducing today will put a stop to this abuse by Medicare health care providers by beefing up the tax levy program and screening all  450 billion in annual Medicare payments to spot the recipients with unpaid taxes   Collecting these unpaid taxes would strengthen tax fairness  help reduce the tax gap  and take part of the load off the shoulders of honest taxpayers           In general  the FPLP levies payments to delinquent taxpayers from the federal government at 15  or more until the outstanding tax debt is recovered   CMS has been participating in FPLP for payments to Medicare Part C and D providers  but has failed to include payments to Medicare Parts A and B providers  which together represent more than  300 billion in payments each year   The Coleman Levin bill mandates that CMS participate in the FPLP by screening 50  of their Part A and B payments within one year  and all payments by the following year        Another provision in the Coleman Levin bill would include CMS in the Treasury Offset Program  TOP  to recover non tax debt  such as unpaid child support and student loans   At the March hearing  GAO revealed that Medicare physicians and related providers owe more than  200 million in such debts   Medicare payments are currently not included in TOP because the Medicare program is not named in the enabling statute  according to officials at CMS and the Financial Management Service  the agency that administers TOP   The Coleman Levin bill would add Medicare payments to the TOP statute to permit the recovery of non tax debts  as well as unpaid state taxes           Our investigation revealed that unpaid federal taxes were just the tip of the iceberg  These Medicare doctors did not just cheat on their federal taxes     they also owed  33 million in child support   27 million in unpaid student loans  and  22 million in unpaid state taxes  By integrating CMS into the Treasury Offset Program  we can help safeguard the America taxpayers against tax deadbeats who are cheating the system     Coleman continued          The final provision of the Coleman Levin bill would implement a recommendation of the Federal Contractor Tax Compliance Task Force designed to expedite IRS   s notice procedures   Today  the IRS must undergo a lengthy notice process with delinquent taxpayers before being able to activate a tax debt for collection through the FPLP   The current system requires that four tax bills and a special notice of intent to levy be sent by the IRS before any property can be levied   To streamline the process for federal payments  the Coleman Levin bill would authorize the IRS to begin to levy the federal payments after notice and demand have been sent  and allow the levy notice and any appeal proceedings to take place after the levy has been initiated  This approach was endorsed by IRS Commissioner Everson during last month   s hearing             The process of collecting these outstanding tax debts is often stymied by redundant paperwork  and by those who are taking advantage of the system  pushing collection through the FPLP back by months or even years  By shortening the timeframe  this provision would enable the federal government to substantially increase the amount of tax debt to be collected     Coleman added           The bill is expected to be referred to the Senate Committee on Finance
