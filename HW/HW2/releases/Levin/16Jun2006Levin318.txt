round of negotiations on a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea  22 senators today  in urging the U S  Trade Representative to ensure that any trade agreement with Korea addresses all existing and future tariff and non tariff barriers to the Korean auto and auto parts market   The effort was organized by Senate Auto Caucus co chairs Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  George Voinovich  R Ohio  along with Sen  Mike DeWine  R Ohio  and Sen  Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   who voiced concern that  despite numerous commitments from Korea to open its market to imported autos and auto parts  the U S  faced a staggering  2 1 billion trade deficit with Korea in 2005           There is a long standing and pervasive auto and auto parts trade imbalance between the United States and Korea     the senators wrote to Ambassador Susan C  Schwab  the U S  Trade Representative     While Korea relies on exports to support its domestic auto and auto parts industry  Korea remains the most closed auto market in the developed world          The senators cited statistics that Korea exported 70 percent of the vehicles it produced in 2005  while sales of vehicles imported into Korea remain less than three percent of Korea   s total domestic auto market         The text of the letter follows         June 16  2006      Ambassador Susan C  Schwab  United States Trade Representative  600 17th Street  N W   Washington  D C   20508   Dear Ambassador Schwab       We are writing to you to raise issues relating to the recent announcement that the United States is starting negotiations with the Republic of Korea  Korea  regarding a Free Trade Agreement  KFTA    As you know  there is a long standing and pervasive auto and auto parts trade imbalance between the United States and Korea   Korea has taken full advantage of open access to the U S  auto and auto parts market  which has led it to become one of the world   s major auto exporting countries   In fact  Korea exported a full 70 percent of the vehicles it produced in 2005   Nevertheless  while Korea relies on exports to support its domestic auto and auto parts industry  Korea remains the most closed auto market in the developed world         The United States and Korea have had a troubled trade relationship in autos for a long time   Until 1987  Korea did not allow imported autos into its market   Once Korea    opened    its auto market  U S  auto makers attempted to gain access  however  U S  auto producers were met with a host of trade barriers   For example  we understand that Korea used tax audits and similar governmental actions to penalize individuals who purchased imported automobiles         Beginning in the early 1990s  the United States notified Korea that its automotive market trade barriers were unacceptable and attempted to address these issues   Despite two separate agreements intended to open Korea   s closed auto market  sales of imported vehicles into Korea remain less than three percent of Korea   s total domestic auto market   Since this time  Korea also began to run a significant trade surplus in auto parts         Korean auto sales into the United States increased from approximately 132 000 vehicles sold in 1996 to approximately 731 000 vehicles sold in 2005   In stark contrast  in 2005  U S  auto makers sold roughly 4 000 vehicles from the United States into Korea  roughly the same number as 1996     In 2005  the United States shipped only  562 million worth of auto parts to Korea  slightly less than we shipped in 1999   This compares to Korea   s auto parts exports to the United States of  2 7 billion in 2005  up from  919 million in 1999    That is  during this period  the U S  auto parts trade deficit with Korea climbed from  322 million in 1999 to  2 1 billion  Korean passenger cars now make up almost six percent of the U S  market for cars   In the meantime  U S  automakers continue to face significant barriers to entry in their attempts to sell into Korea   s auto market and have a fraction of a percent of the Korean market for cars         The United States must ensure that a KFTA addresses all existing and future tariff and non tariff barriers to the Korean auto and auto parts market   A KFTA that fails to address current and potential non tariff barriers will constitute a significantly flawed agreement   Based on Korea   s track record  we are concerned that there is a great risk that a KFTA will significantly benefit Korean auto and auto parts makers without giving U S  auto and auto parts manufacturers any meaningful access to Korea   s historically closed market   U S  trade history supports this concern         The U S  auto industry is facing dire circumstances that put the jobs of millions of hard working Americans at risk   It is imperative that a KFTA not aggravate the already tenuous position of an important U S  industry   We are confident that U S  auto and auto parts manufacturers can compete effectively in an open and fair Korean auto market  and we look forward to working with you to ensure they gain meaningful and sustained auto market access during this negotiating process              Sincerely
