                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON     An investigation led by Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Norm Coleman  R Minn   senior Democrat and Chairman  respectively  of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs  has uncovered a secret web of at least 125 U S  bank and securities accounts at Riggs and other financial institutions operating in the United States  that were used by former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet and his associates to move millions of dollars          New information shows that the web of Pinochet accounts in the U S  was far more extensive  went on far longer  and involved more banks than was previously disclosed     said Levin      Some banks actively helped him hide his funds  others failed to comply with U S  regulations requiring banks to know their customers   Through lax due diligence or worse  too many banks allowed a notorious public figure  Augusto Pinochet  to build a secret web of U S  accounts using offshore corporations  deceptive account names  and third party conduits to hide his role in moving millions of dollars across international lines           This is a sad  sordid tale of money laundering involving Pinochet accounts at multiple financial institutions using alias names  offshore accounts  and close associates     said Coleman      As a former General and President of Chile  Pinochet was a well known human rights violator and violent dictator   Even the most rudimentary compliance with federal  know your customer  rules would suggest that these accounts should have scrutinized and closed long ago  Congress spoke with the enactment of the Patriot Act  we need to make sure that the banks listened because banks are our first line of defense   Now more than ever  proper bank compliance is crucial to root out proceeds of illicit conduct and financing of activities that makes our world unsafe            Senators Levin and Coleman are releasing a bipartisan staff report today that augments a year long Subcommittee investigation that  in 2004  unearthed the relationship between Riggs Bank and Pinochet   Following that hearing  Riggs identified additional documents and accounts that should have been  but were not  provided in response to Subcommittee subpoenas   The Subcommittee also used Riggs bank records to identify other financial institutions that helped Pinochet gain access to the U S  financial system  including Citigroup  Banco de Chile United States  Espirito Santo Bank in Miami  and others       The staff report lays out four key findings       More Extensive Pinochet Relationship  The relationship between Riggs Bank and Augusto Pinochet was more extensive than previously disclosed  encompassing 28 accounts instead of nine  spanning 25 years instead of eight  including secret accounts opened under misleading names  and involving more personal  high level contact between Riggs officials and Pinochet than previously described     Military Officer Accounts  From 1981 to 2004  eight Riggs accounts  opened in the names of Chilean military officers  served as conduits for Pinochet funds and transmitted more than  1 7 million to Pinochet related accounts     Web of 125 U S  Accounts  Over the past 25 years  multiple financial institutions operating in the United States  including Riggs Bank  Citigroup  Banco de Chile United States  Espirito Santo Bank in Miami  and others enabled Pinochet to construct a web of at least 125 U S  bank and securities accounts     often using aliases  offshore corporations  or names of third parties     which he used to move millions of dollars in funds and conduct business    Transferring Suspect Funds  After U S  bank regulators raised money laundering concerns about the Pinochet funds at Riggs Bank  the bank closed the accounts and transferred the funds to another financial institution operating in the United States  without notice that the funds were suspect  The U S  regulators failed to follow the suspect funds when they left Riggs to determine whether they went to another U S  financial institution    To address these findings  the Subcommittee staff recommends that    Financial institutions that close an account due to money laundering concerns should  before transferring the suspect funds to another financial institution  warn that financial institution under Section 314 b  of the Patriot Act that the transfer is the result of an account closure due to suspect funds    U S  regulators should take steps to prevent suspect funds from being transferred to another U S  financial institution and should identify and dismantle any network of related U S  accounts     U S  regulators should clarify Section 314 b  to make clear that its legal protections permit financial institutions to respond to requests for information  including by offering information that may help to expose or prevent money laundering or terrorist activities  and   The United States should work with the European Union to enable financial institutions with U S  and E U  affiliates to exchange information about clients and accounts across international lines to guard against money laundering and terrorist financing      Since 1999  the Subcommittee  under Levin   s leadership  has conducted a series of investigations  held hearings  and issued reports related to money laundering activities in the U S  financial services sector   This investigative work provided the foundation of many of the anti money laundering provisions included in the USA Patriot Act enacted in October 2001
