                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON     Senators Carl Levin  D Mich   and Norm Coleman  R Minn    Ranking Minority Member and Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  today released a Subcommittee  finding that market speculation has contributed to rising oil and gasoline prices  and that too many energy trades are occurring without regulatory oversight   The report recommends that Congress enact legislation to close a major loophole in federal oversight of oil and gas traders  slipped into law in 2000 at the behest of Enron and other large energy traders            It   s time to put the cop back on the beat in our major energy markets     Levin said      Millions of Americans are suffering as the prices of oil  gasoline  diesel fuel  natural gas  and other vital energy commodities go through the roof    These record high energy prices threaten our economic security   At the same time  our government is less and less able to monitor U S  energy markets to figure out what   s going on and ensure that energy prices reflect supply and demand rather than market manipulation or excessive speculation   More and more trading is being conducted by large oil and gas traders on electronic markets where there is no oversight   It   s time to put the cop back on the beat in these markets to make sure that ordinary Americans aren   t being ripped off             I am concerned at the prices that hardworking Americans are paying for energy and troubled by the implication that excessive market speculation or manipulation may be a contributing factor     said Coleman     The question is whether we have allowed this sector to play by the beat of their own drum     going virtually unchecked and unregulated  We need to take a hard look at whether we have enough regulatory tools to prevent fraud and ensure there isn   t profiteering by traders at the expense of you and me           In late April of this year  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX  hit a record of  75 17 per barrel   In mid May  the average retail price for gasoline reached  2 99 per gallon  just a few cents short of the record set after Hurricane Katrina shut down oil and gasoline production along the Gulf Coast in September 2005         Although these high prices are often attributed to the forces of supply and demand  the report demonstrates that supplies have been more than adequate to meet demand   Since late 2004  the amount of stored oil in the United States has been increasing   Oil inventories recently reached 347 million barrels     an eight year high and the largest U S  inventory since 1998  when oil was  15 per barrel   Similarly  oil inventories in Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  countries recently reached a 20 year high   As the report explains  the traditional factors of    supply and demand    do not tell the whole story on oil and gas prices            What is new  according to the Levin Coleman report  is that over the past few years market speculators have poured tens of billions of dollars into the energy commodity markets   For example  the International Monetary Fund reports that over the past three years approximately  100  120 billion has been invested in energy markets worldwide   Over this same period about  60 billion has been invested in oil futures on the NYMEX         Many analysts believe these speculative investments have significantly raised the price of oil futures   While it is not possible to determine the precise dollar increase in the price of oil attributable to market speculation  some analysts have estimated that speculation has added as much as  20  25 to the price of each barrel of oil  thereby pushing up oil from about  50 to around  70 per barrel    As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently stated     with the demand from the investment community  oil prices have moved up sooner than they would have otherwise           At the same time that oil and gas traders have been spending billions of dollars on energy commodities  those traders are increasingly able to trade without any oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC    The CFTC is the federal agency charged with preventing fraud  manipulation  and excessive speculation in U S  commodity markets    Under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000  large oil and gas traders may trade energy commodities in    over the counter     OTC  electronic markets without any ongoing oversight by the CFTC   Additionally  oil and gas traders in these markets do not have to file any large trader reports with the CFTC   Large trader reports are the cornerstone of CFTC oversight of commodity markets to detect  prevent  and prosecute manipulation and to analyze the effects of speculation   Traders in these electronic markets are also currently exempt from the limits imposed by the CFTC on speculative trading that are designed to prevent excessive speculation          In addition  due to past regulatory actions by the CFTC  oil and gasoline traders in the United States may now electronically trade U S  energy commodities on a London futures exchange  called    ICE Futures      ICE  Inter Continental Exchange  Futures is regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority  but not the CFTC   As a result  persons within the United States seeking to trade key U S  energy commodities     U S  crude oil  gasoline  and heating oil futures     now can avoid all CFTC oversight and reporting requirements simply by routing their trades through the ICE Futures exchange in London instead of the NYMEX in New York       The report recommends that the CFTC   s large trader reporting system be extended to require all U S  traders of energy futures to report large trades to the CFTC  regardless of where the trade takes place     on the NYMEX  on an over the counter electronic exchange  or on a foreign exchange            Right now  there is no U S  cop on the beat overseeing U S  energy trades on over the counter electronic exchanges or foreign exchanges     said Levin      Oil and gas traders on those exchanges are trading without any cop looking over their shoulder   Enron has already taught us how energy traders can manipulate prices and walk over consumers if they think no one is looking and they can get away with it      Levin added     Our report highlights the need for a legislative fix such as S  2642 which would put the cop back on the beat in the oil and gas markets                We need to explore legislative ideas to ensure that energy prices reflect the true market forces of supply and demand and guard against speculators driving up prices     Coleman said     It is becoming increasingly clear that our efforts must be proactive  as the energy futures market is really about whether families will be able to afford to heat their homes and fill up at the pump  As more and more trading occurs on electronic markets without oversight  it   s time to determine whether the scale needs to be tipped from the speculator to the regulator          Read the report      The findings and recommendations of the report are below    FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  A   Findings     Rise in Speculation   Over the past few years speculators have expended tens of billions of dollars in U S  energy commodity markets   Speculation Has Increased Prices   Speculation has contributed to rising U S  energy prices  but gaps in available market data currently impede analysis of the specific amount of speculation  the commodity trades involved  the markets affected  and the extent of price impacts   Price Inventory Relationship Altered   With respect to crude oil  the influx of speculative dollars appears to have altered the historical relationship between price and inventory  leading the current oil market to be characterized by both large inventories and high prices    Large Trader Reports Essential   CFTC access to daily reports of large trades of energy commodities is essential to its ability to detect and deter price manipulation   The CFTC   s ability to detect and deter energy price manipulation is suffering from critical information gaps  because traders on OTC electronic exchanges and the London ICE Futures are currently exempt from CFTC reporting requirements   Large trader reporting is also essential to analyze the effect of speculation on energy prices     ICE Impact on Energy Prices   ICE   s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other evidence indicate that its over the counter electronic exchange performs a price discovery function     and thereby affects U S  energy prices     in the cash market for the energy commodities traded on that exchange      B   Recommendations   Eliminate Enron Loophole   Congress should eliminate the Enron loophole that currently limits CFTC oversight of key U S  energy commodity markets  and put the CFTC back on the beat policing these markets    Require Large Trader Reports   Congress should enact legislation to provide that persons trading energy futures    look alike    contracts on over the counter electronic exchanges are subject to the CFTC   s large trader reporting requirements      Monitor U S  Energy Trades on Foreign Exchanges   Congress should enact legislation to ensure that U S  persons trading U S  energy commodities on foreign exchanges are subject to the CFTC   s large trader reporting requirements    Increase U S  U K  Cooperation   The CFTC should work with the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority to ensure it has information about all large trades in U S  energy commodities on the ICE Futures exchange in London      Make ICE Determination   The CFTC should immediately conduct the hearing required by its regulations to examine the price discovery function of the ICE OTC electronic exchange and the need for ICE to publish daily trading data as required by the Commodity Exchange Act
