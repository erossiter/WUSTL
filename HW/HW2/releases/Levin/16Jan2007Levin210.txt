chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  spoke today at the Pentagon at the ceremony naming the CVN 78 aircraft carrier the U S S  GERALD R  FORD   In June  Levin co sponsored the amendment with Sen  John Warner  R Va   then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 to name the aircraft carrier after President Ford   Levin   s remarks follow   Remarks of Senator Carl Levin  Naming Ceremony for the USS GERALD R  FORD  CVN78   January 16  2007    Vice President Cheney  Secretary Winter  Admiral Mullen  members of the family of Jerry Ford  men and women of our Armed Forces  ladies and gentlemen        I want to thank Senator Warner for his leadership on last year   s Defense Authorization Act in including the provision that made this day possible  and I want to commend the Navy and Secretary Winter for following through on the suggestion in that bill that we name CVN 78 in honor of President Gerald Ford   I was pleased to co sponsor Senator Warner   s amendment because of the special pride this honor would bring to President Ford   s heart  and because it rings so true as a memorial to him         In 1941  not long after Gerald Ford opened a law practice in Grand Rapids  the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor   Gerald Ford enlisted in the Navy within the week          At first  Ford served in the physical education branch  and this gifted athlete coached all nine sports that were offered   He soon grew restless  though  and needed to join the fight   Ford asked to be transferred to service at sea  and was assigned to a light aircraft carrier  the USS Monterey   He would later write that there he saw    as much action as I   d ever hoped to see      With Ford serving as assistant navigator  athletic officer and anti aircraft battery officer  the Monterey fought in many of the major operations of the South Pacific  earning 10 battle stars during his service        Perhaps Lieutenant Ford   s finest hour at sea  however  was a battle not with the enemy  but with the elements   In December 1944  a massive typhoon slammed the Monterey  with waves topping 70 feet   Chaos reigned as the planes on board caught fire  and several broke free from their cables   Many of the sailors were incapacitated  Admiral Halsey ordered the Monterey abandoned  and flames threatened to consume the carrier   But then     thirty years before President Ford would right our ship of state     Lieutenant Ford helped save the Monterey and its men        At great personal risk  Jerry Ford led a team down to the hangar deck to battle the fire   With gas tanks exploding around them and thick smoke choking the air  they evacuated the stricken men and then extinguished the fire   The fight lasted for hours  but the Monterey and almost all of her sailors survived   The teamwork that Jerry Ford learned playing football at the University of Michigan was surely put to the test that day   And the    we   re all in this together    feeling of community  instilled in him by his Grand Rapids upbringing  just as surely contributed to his leadership on the Monterey        After the war  Gerald Ford returned to practice law in Grand Rapids but soon felt a new call to service   When he ran for Congress  his naval record was clearly an asset  but more important than how that service helped him was how it had changed him   Ford   s naval service had inspired in him a transformation similar to that of Michigan   s great Senator Arthur Vandenberg  another son of Grand Rapids who had evolved from an isolationist to an internationalist        With Vandenberg   s support  Ford ran an underdog primary campaign against the isolationist incumbent   Ford   s upset victory was a reflection of how highly voters thought of him personally and also how much had changed in American politics          The people of Michigan   s Fifth District recognized that Gerald Ford was the right man for the times  and years later the rest of America would reach that same judgment   The Watergate scandal slammed our nation like a political typhoon  and thank goodness Gerald Ford was there to lead us with the same steady courage he had displayed on the Monterey          As Commander in Chief  President Ford resolved  in his words     to make our Navy as it has been  as it will be  and as it must be     the best Navy in the whole world      Today  we help keep that pledge with this new aircraft carrier named in his honor  and we renew that pledge in his name to maintain the best navy in the whole world and to help defend beyond his and our lives the nation that Jerry Ford loved so much
