                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Carl Levin  News Release              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJune 20  2005 Contact                                                                                                                                                              Statement of Senator Carl Levin to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission Hearing in St  Louis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Mr  Chairman  thank you  and BRAC Commissioners  thank you all for your willingness to serve in a very  very difficult job   And thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak with you today   Jennifer Granholm and Senator Stabenow cannot be with us today  but they asked me to extend their appreciation and to offer their support for my remarks   I will also be submitting Senator Stabenow   s statement for the record      My focus today is on the Pentagon   s recommendations for the Detroit Arsenal   I will also touch upon Selfridge Air National Guard Base and then  after I take about half of our time  you will hear from Congressman Joe Schwarz and other representatives from Battle Creek  and that conversation will be regarding the Kellogg Air National Guard Base in Battle Creek    I believe there is overwhelming logic to the Pentagon   s recommendations to consolidate certain additional functions at the Detroit Arsenal   This is the Department of Defense   s    center of excellence    for ground vehicle development and acquisition   So I   m here to support those recommendations of the Department of Defense relative to that Detroit Arsenal   And one line from the Department of Defense   s Base Closure Report really says it all   Which are that    the synergies from having a critical mass located in southeast Michigan and being able to leverage the world   s capital for automotive ground vehicle research and development and acquisition will ensure the Department of Defense is prepared to meet its future demands         So the department has recognized that the world   s capital is right where the Detroit Arsenal is in southeast Michigan for automotive and ground vehicle research development and acquisition      Let me just share with you briefly some thoughts about why those recommendations make so much sense   The Detroit Arsenal  first of all  includes the headquarters for the Tank and Automotive and Armaments Command  known as TACOM  the Tank Automotive Research and Development Center  known as TARDEC  and the National Automotive Center  known as the NAC   They combine the Army   s ground vehicle acquisition  development  and maintenance functions in one central location       Because of their strategic location in the world   s automotive hub  TACOM  TARDEC  and the NAC are able to take advantage of the investments in the area that have been made by General Motors  Ford  Chrysler  Toyota  Nissan  and Hyundai  and many other companies  as well as by academia in advanced vehicle research   And because the individuals who work at the Detroit arsenal have deep relationships  professional relationships with their commercial counterparts  they are able to secure the most advanced and effective technologies for the Army   In short  the Detroit arsenal allows the Army to develop the highest performance vehicles at the lowest cost      Let me just give you a few examples   TACOM  TARDEC  and the Society For Automotive Engineers recently developed a common on vehicle computer that allows the Army to more easily incorporate advanced commercial automotive technologies from the commercial automotive industry into the Army   s ground vehicle fleet   Today  those computers are being installed in the entire family of medium tactical vehicles  enabling the Army to modernize its current fleet of naval vehicles      One example of the improvement that on vehicle computer has enabled is the installation of a common commercial device called anti lock brakes  and to integrate that safety device on the Army   s existing ground vehicle fleet   Many of those vehicles were manufactured long before computers were even placed on the vehicles   Today  they   re commonplace on both commercial and military vehicles   The Detroit Arsenal took the Army Stryker combat vehicle from concept to production in record time   It developed new slat armor     and this is with the commercial world for the striker     in a matter of weeks to meet the needs of Operation Iraqi Freedom   It deployed new crew protection armor kits for the M 939 vehicle months after the concept originated   It responds to calls from the field both in Iraq and Afghanistan on a daily basis   And the harsh operational conditions in both locations have demanded that Arsenal engineers find ways to push the Army   s ground vehicle fleet to the next level      Southeast Michigan is helping to develop the Army of the future   The engineers at TARDEC and the National Automotive Center are improving the Army   s ground vehicle fleet by leveraging the research already completed in the auto industry  and that research is critical to reducing fuel consumption in the Army   s ground vehicles   Together the commercial sector and the military are exploring ways to create a mobile electrical grid   They are developing the use of artificial intelligence together and nanotechnology for the next generation of vehicles   They are moving forward with the advanced development of deployment of a generation of vehicles powered by hybrid and by fuel cells       Now  with the BRAC recommendations  the Department of Defense has recognized that greater efficiency and innovation will be possible through a greater concentration or clustering of related functions at the Detroit arsenal   That    center of excellence    at the Detroit Arsenal will take on additional tasks that are closely related to the Arsenal   s core mission  which is ground vehicle development and acquisition   The Department of Defense   s recommendations before you  which we support relative to the Detroit Arsenal  propose to cluster related functions      And specifically I   m going to talk about three of those functions  to support them  because you  I think  will be hearing some opposition to the moving of these functions to the Detroit Arsenal from other states   So I want to spend the few minutes that I have to say why it makes so much common sense that these functions be clustered where the Department of Defense proposes to cluster them  at the Detroit arsenal      First  they recommend relocating the Marine Corps Program Manager Advanced Amphibious assault facility from Woodbridge  Virginia to the Detroit Arsenal   Many of the issues facing amphibious assault vehicles are similar to those facing ground vehicles   They needed improved maintenance and reliability   They need more efficient propulsion systems   They need better ballistic protection and blast protection   The Marines will directly benefit from the similar research and development being conducted by the Army and the commercial automotive sector      Likewise  transferring the ground vehicle armament acquisition positions from the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois to the Detroit Arsenal will increase efficiency   These positions that we   ll be moving  or are proposed to be moved  are mostly logistics acquisition and technology experts who are responsible for armament parts and equipment that the Army has retained active design control over   From weapon systems to on vehicle weapon control systems  these specialists work closely with the engineers at TARDEC right now   They have to regularly meet with  talk to  work with those engineers that are at the Detroit Arsenal to insure that those systems continue to operate successfully   At the same time  TARDEC engineers find ways to improve the Army   s ground vehicle fleet   They need to work together   Again  this move is driven by the Defense Department   s sensible efforts to consolidate related development and acquisition functions in one place      Now  the expert on this subject is not me  it   s General Laniers  who is commander of TACOM   And this is what he said recently      The positions at Rock Island are TACOM positions   It   s a piece of TACOM at Rock Island      And this is what General Lanier says   He   s the overall commander of TACOM  whether it   s Rock Island  whether it   s the Detroit Arsenal or the other parts   General Lanier      It   s all about speed and agility now  rapidly changing your systems to meet the current needs in the field   There   s a lot more communications with the acquisition guys and the logistic guys and the engineers can all sit face to face and discuss things and get back out and work on it   I think there will be a lot of improvements     he said   He has the firsthand day to day  hands on experience   His judgment  I believe  should have great weight with this Commission      Finally  the Pentagon has recommended moving the unmanned ground vehicle system   s Joint Project Office from the Army Aviation and Missile Command in Huntsville  Alabama to Michigan   There are compelling reasons to do so   There are advanced technology efforts already going on in Michigan   Both commercial and university are working with TARDEC to integrate the new technology such as artificial intelligence  sensors  based on nanotechnology  advanced computer vision systems  into robotic vehicles   All of the Department   s science and technology development objectives in ground vehicles and robotic technologies are already led by TARDEC  and most of the agencies that the Joint Project Office at Huntsville reports to and collaborates with are located in southeastern Michigan   Moving that ground vehicle robotics mission to the Detroit arsenal just makes common sense      Now  Mr  Chairman and members of the Commission  the Detroit Arsenal is losing some functions under the proposal of the Department of Defense   It   s not just gaining the functions I   ve outlined   It   s also losing some functions   They recommend that the sea vehicle development and acquisition be consolidated into one    center of excellence    for sea vehicles in the Washington  D C  area   Those gains in the Washington areas are slated to come from the Army   s sea vehicle development acquisition program in Detroit and go to Virginia   We are not protesting the move   We don   t object to it   It   s so inherently logical under the very same logic which I just outlined   The Detroit Arsenal is slated to lose about 100 positions to the Defense Logistics Agency in Columbus   While we   re obviously concerned about any job loss in Michigan  shifting those jobs is consistent with the Department   s attempt to leverage the advantages of collocation   That   s what this is all about       So the same logic which we believe compels the move of the Marine Corps program manager  the ground vehicle armament acquisition positions  and the unmanned ground vehicle project office to the Detroit Arsenal  moves us to accept the move from the Detroit Arsenal of sea vehicle development and accusation and of certain acquisition experts for commercially available items that can be brought through the DLA      Now  as to the Army Garrison at Selfridge  the Department of Defense has recommended closing that facility   I wanted to submit for the record several letters that I   ve received from the community expressing deep concerns about that proposed closure      The garrison   s proposed closure could mean many of the support services that the military personnel in the greater Detroit area have relied on since World War II would be closed   The letters which I   m going to submit for the record make different arguments  but where they agree is on one critical point  Should the Army garrison at Selfridge be closed  it is essential that the Army land and support functions be transferred to the Air Force   For two reasons  One is the land is essential to the Air Force   And  two  some of the critical services will continue to need to be performed  including the commissary  the base exchange  and the pharmacy      So that is what I would urge the Commission look at as a common position of the community at Selfridge   While they don   t see precisely eye to eye on every aspect of this  and the letters will speak relative to that  when it comes to if you close that garrison  what should be done with the land  and the necessity that the Air Force take over the services  particularly relative to the commissary base exchange and the pharmacy  are something upon which there is agreement and consensus        Again  thank you very much for your service as well as for the opportunity to be with you today
