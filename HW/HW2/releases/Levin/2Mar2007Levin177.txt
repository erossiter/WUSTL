President Bush                                 March 1  2007       The President                       The White House    Washington  D C   20500       Dear Mr  President     We are writing in advance of the eighth round of U S  Korea Free Trade Agreement negotiations  to present the enclosed Congressional Proposal to Open Korea s Automotive Market   This proposal reflects a pragmatic  trade expanding  WTO consistent approach that provides concrete  achievable positive incentives for Korea to open its automotive market and ensure the elimination of current and future non tariff barriers in all industries   This proposal represents what we believe the United States needs to negotiate to achieve a satisfactory resolution to Korea s closed automotive market   In addition  it is a proposal that should be welcomed by Korean consumers and by the Bush Administration because it will lead to a more competitive market in Korea with greater choice of products and more competitive prices         We have developed this proposal out of our growing concern that these negotiations will fail to effectively tear down Korea s non tariff barriers  prevent Korea from using future non tariff barriers to maintain its closed market indefinitely  and ensure access for imports to Korea s automotive market   For decades  Korea has enjoyed open access to the U S  auto market   At the same time  it has kept its own market virtually shut to foreign competition through the use of an import ban  followed by high tariffs  coupled with a complex and discriminatory tax regime  coupled with systemic  comprehensive and long standing regulatory barriers  coupled with periodic anti import campaigns by the Government of Korea         The issue of our inability to break down long standing and discriminatory barriers in a bicameral negotiation would seriously undermine our ability to address non tariff barriers in the more comprehensive multilateral negotiations underway at the World Trade Organization   Given the importance of this issue  we have made consistent and repeated calls for the United States to undertake a new approach with Korea that addresses in a complete  comprehensive  and systemic way the long standing policies by which Korea created and maintains a fundamentally closed automotive market   The U S  automotive industry and union leadership also have called upon the Administration to take a new approach   To date  however  no new approach has been put forth that would lead to genuine market opening in Korea   Instead  we understand that the proposals which have been exchanged have been similar to the same ones that were tried repeatedly in the past and that have failed to achieve any meaningful access for U S  products        Our proposal moves beyond previous negotiating strategies and embarks on such a new approach that addresses the United States  legitimate concerns that Korea will not obtain additional access to the U S  market unless there is reciprocal opening of the Korean auto market   There are two key components to the Congressional proposal   The first part addresses the phase out of the 2 5  U S  passenger vehicle tariff and creates a positive incentive for Korea to open its market to U S  autos   The second part addresses Korea s current non tariff barriers and creates a mechanism   available to all industries   for the United States to take action against future non tariff barriers   A copy of the proposal is enclosed  as well as a briefing paper that summarizes its key elements         The Korean automotive market presents a significant potential market for U S  exports of cars and automotive products and would greatly benefit the U S  automotive industry and the hundreds of thousands of workers it employs and supports   U S  automotive manufacturers can compete effectively in an open and fair Korean auto market   We look forward to discussing how our proposal achieves a truly open market and more balanced automotive trade with Korea                                                         Sincerely       The Honorable Charles B  Rangel  Chairman  House Committee on Ways and Means               The Honorable Carl Levin  Co Chair  Senate Auto Caucus     The Honorable George V  Voinovich  Co Chair  Senate Auto Caucus     The Honorable Sander M  Levin  Chairman  Subcommittee
