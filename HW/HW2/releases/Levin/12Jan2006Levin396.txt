                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON     Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   issued the following statement regarding the Justice Department   s Motion to Dismiss the Hamdan case on the basis of the Graham Levin Amendment     Earlier today  the Justice Department filed a brief asking the Supreme Court to dismiss the Hamdan case on the ground that this year   s Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts    plainly divest   the courts of jurisdiction    over the case          The Justice Department is in error   Far from deciding that the relevant statutory language applies to pending cases  Congress specifically considered and rejected language that would have stripped the courts of jurisdiction in cases that they had before them          Throughout the consideration of the bill  the White House repeatedly urged the inclusion of language that would have stripped the courts of jurisdiction over pending cases   In each case  I objected to this language   As a result  no such language was included in the final version of the legislation    Specifically  the original Graham amendment considered by the Senate  and adopted on a 49 42 vote  contained language stating that the provision    shall apply to any application that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act      I opposed the amendment  arguing that the Hamdan case  now pending in the Supreme Court    would be wiped out under the language    and that as a result  the Court    would be stymied in hearing a case they have agreed to hear             I then worked with Senator Graham to modify the previously adopted language   The Graham Levin amendment eliminated the language stating that the provision would apply to pending cases   As I stated when the modified amendment was placed before the Senate  the compromise language was specifically designed to ensure that the courts would not lose jurisdiction over pending cases   I said to the Senate         The other problem which I focused on last Thursday with the first Graham amendment was that it would have stripped all the courts  including the Supreme Court  of jurisdiction over pending cases   What we have done in this amendment  we have said that the standards in the amendment will be applied in pending cases  but the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over those cases   For instance  the Supreme court jurisdiction in Hamdan is not affected                The modified amendment was then adopted by a vote of 84 14       Before the bill passed the Senate  the White House made an effort to reinsert language applying the amendment to pending cases   Their proposed language stated that the provision    shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act  except that the Supreme Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of the removal  pursuant to such amendment  of its jurisdiction to hear any case in which certiorari has been granted as of such date      I objected to this language and it was not included in the Senate passed bill   During the conference between the Senate and the House of Representatives  the House conferees proposed language sought by the White House  which would have applied the amendment to pending cases   The language proposed by the House conferees stated that the provision    shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act      I objected to this language and it was not included in the final version of the legislation     As stated before passage of the final conference report               The conference report retains the same effective date as the Senate bill  thereby adopting the Senate position that this provision will not strip the courts of jurisdiction in pending cases         T he conference report states that the provision    shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act      These words have their ordinary meaning     that the provision is prospective in its application  and does not apply to pending cases       emphasis added         The Administration is wrong when it argues otherwise
