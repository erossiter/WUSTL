                                                                                                                                                      Elaborate tax avoidance schemes cost Treasury and honest taxpayers billions each year  Senators say       WASHINGTON     Today  citing billions of dollars in revenue diverted from the U S  Treasury each year at the expense of honest  hardworking American families who pay their fair share  Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn   introduced comprehensive legislation to combat abusive tax shelters and uncooperative offshore tax havens used by businesses and individuals to dodge payment of their U S  taxes   Sen  Barack Obama  D  Ill   is an original cosponsor       For more than two years  Levin and Coleman  the senior Democrat and Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations respectively  have led an in depth subcommittee investigation into abusive tax shelters developed  marketed  and carried out by accounting firms  banks  investment advisors  and lawyers   Subcommittee hearings and reports have presented evidence that tax advisors cooked up one complex scheme after another  packaged them as generic    tax products    and then peddled the products to thousands of taxpayers across the country   This investigative work provides the foundation for the bill   s provisions           These tax advisors are getting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees  while robbing the U S  Treasury of billions of dollars in revenues each year     said Levin      We need to strengthen the laws and enforcement mechanisms to stop promoters of abusive tax shelters   We also need to take stronger measures to stop use of offshore tax havens for tax dodges             Abusive tax shelters and uncooperative tax havens undermine our tax system  forcing honest taxpayers to pay more than their fair share     Coleman said      We need to give honest  hardworking Americans a better deal     by cracking down on those who choose not to pay their fair share in taxes             This is a basic issue of fairness and integrity     said Obama      We need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our tax laws so that those who work hard and play by the rules aren   t disadvantaged              Tax chiseling hurts average Americans  not only by leaving them with the burden of making up lost revenues  but also by constricting resources for essential government programs     Levin continued      Lack of resources burdens our schools with unfunded mandates  limits money for health care  and deepens the deficit ditch that threatens the economic well being of our children and grandchildren           Levin and Coleman introduced a similar bill last year   Several provisions were adopted into law  including   stronger penalties for failing to report interests in foreign financial accounts  authorizing civil fines for tax practitioners such as accountants and attorneys who violate specified standards of practice  stronger penalties for failing to register or provide to the IRS required information regarding a potentially abusive tax shelter  and stronger penalties for failing to maintain a list of participants in potentially abusive tax shelters        The 2004 bill also sought to stiffen the penalties imposed on abusive tax shelter promoters from  1 000 per offense to a penalty equal to 150  of the promoter   s profits from selling the abusive shelter   The penalty has since been raised to 50 percent  but did not go as far as provided in the Levin Coleman bill   The Senators said      The penalty increase enacted by Congress in 2004 was a significant improvement over prior law  but letting promoters of abusive tax shelters keep 50  of their ill gotten gains doesn   t make sense   Congress needs to take stronger action by denying persons who promote tax cheating not only all of their illegal profits  but also requiring their payment of a stiff fine on top of that           The Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005 proposes the following measures  among others  to clamp down on tax abusers       INCREASE PENALTIES to 150 percent on persons who promote abusive tax shelters or knowingly aid or abet taxpayers to understate their tax liability   Currently  promoters face only a 50 percent penalty  and aiders and abettors face a maximum penalty of  10 000      PREVENT ABUSIVE TAX SHELTERS by prohibiting tax advisors from charging fees linked to alleged tax savings  mandating examination procedures to identify banks contributing to abusive tax shelters  encouraging whistleblowers who report tax schemes  and authorizing the IRS to work with federal agencies like the SEC and bank regulators to strengthen abusive tax shelter enforcement      REQUIRE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE FOR TRANSACTIONS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX BENEFITS by clarifying and codifying the economic substance doctrine and by strengthening the penalties for tax transactions lacking economic substance      DETER UNCOOPERATIVE TAX HAVENS by authorizing Treasury to publish an annual list of uncooperative tax havens  and by ending U S  tax benefits and requiring greater disclosure for taxpayers transferring funds to such uncooperative tax havens     View the text of
