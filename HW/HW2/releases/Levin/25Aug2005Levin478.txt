be made available to replace Zylon vests      WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Carl Levin  D MI  announced today that the U S  Department of Justice has awarded  572 043 in funding to 133 Michigan communities to help purchase bulletproof vests for local law enforcement officers          Crime fighting is dangerous work  and we must make every effort to protect the officers who serve on the front lines every day     Stabenow said     With this funding  local police departments across Michigan will now be better equipped to make sure our men and women in uniform have the vital protection they need while they protect their communities             This funding is part of a real partnership with local communities to ensure that our law enforcement professionals have the life saving equipment they need     Levin said      Law enforcement officials risk so much to keep us all safe   When we can reduce that risk  we owe it to them to do so          The senators also announced that the DOJ is making an additional  10 million available today nationwide to allow police departments to replace vests based on Zylon  which the department has determined may not provide an intended level of ballistic resistance            I urge those departments whose officers currently use Zylon based vests to take advantage of this special funding     said Stabenow   I am pleased that the Department of Justice has recognized the problem and moved to help local departments replace Zylon based vests with more effective equipment            The DOJ report on Zylon based vests and information on how to apply for the special funding for replacement vests is available at http   vests ojp gov      The Bulletproof Vest Partnership funds up to 50 percent of the cost of each vest purchased or replaced by law enforcement agencies  Funding was allocated to Michigan communities as follows       Grant Recipient Amount      ADRIAN CHARTER TOWNSHIP  342 50       ADRIAN
