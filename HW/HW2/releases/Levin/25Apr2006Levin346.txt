                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON      Today Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   and Sen  Norm Coleman  R Minn   ranking Democrat and Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  released a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report finding that states routinely incorporate new non publicly traded companies without learning the identity of the owners  and that the absence of this company ownership information impedes law enforcement            We ought to know who is behind U S  companies doing business in our country  but right now we don   t     Levin said      The result is that anonymous non publicly traded companies are able to engage in illegal activities such as money laundering or other crimes  knowing that U S  law enforcement has no ready way to identify the company owners   Today people have to supply more information to get a driver   s license than to form a company              Companies form the basis of this country   s economic system  providing valuable goods and services     Coleman said      However  some individuals abuse the system and hide their identity behind shell companies that conduct no business except to facilitate criminal activity under the radar of law enforcement agencies   We need to take a closer look to identify the magnitude of this problem           In response to a Levin Coleman request  GAO reviewed the legal requirements in all 50 states to set up non publicly traded corporations and limited liability companies  LLCs   The GAO report found    None of the 50 states routinely requires applicants who want to form a new corporation to disclose who will own the corporation  most states do not require ownership information for LLCs   Third party agents who submit company formation papers and annual reports are not required to and do not collect or verify company ownership information   The absence of company ownership information enables individuals to conceal their identities while operating as U S  companies   Law enforcement is hindered by the absence of company ownership information     The failure of states to collect company ownership information creates a risk that criminals will set up and use U S  companies for money laundering  tax evasion  terrorist financing  or other crimes   Law enforcement officials told GAO that they are seeing an increase in the use of anonymous U S  shell companies for illicit activities   The GAO report provided the following examples of law enforcement investigations that involved U S  shell companies    The U S  Treasury   s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network found that  between April 1996 and January 2004  financial institutions filed 397 suspicious activity reports  concerning a total of almost  4 billion  that involved U S  shell companies  East European countries  and U S  bank accounts     The FBI told GAO that U S  shell companies are being used to launder as much as  36 billion from the former Soviet Union   The FBI also reported that they have 103 open cases investigating market manipulation  most of which involve U S  shell companies     Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  officials reported that a U S  citizen used multiple Oregon shell companies to move  1 million from Libya to a U S  bank account despite U S  sanctions on Libya   In another ICE case  a Nevada based corporation received more than 3 700 suspicious wire transfers totaling  81 million over 2 years  but the case was not prosecuted  because ICE was unable to identify the corporation   s owners    The Internal Revenue Service uncovered a scheme involving three individuals who set up U S  shell companies to conceal nearly  9 million in taxable income in secret accounts in the Turks and Caicos Islands and other foreign countries     A Department of Justice report revealed that Russian officials used shell companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware to unlawfully divert  15 million in international aid intended to upgrade the safety of former Soviet nuclear power plants       The GAO report observes that some offshore jurisdictions  such as the Isle of Man and Jersey  currently require company formation agents to obtain and verify company ownership information           Some offshore jurisdictions get company ownership information  but use corporate secrecy laws to make it tough for U S  law enforcement to get the information     said Levin      Here at home  states make it easy for law enforcement to get company documents  but those documents don   t identify company owners   Anonymous U S  shell companies engaging in criminal activity present a major problem for law enforcement  so we cannot continue to ignore this problem   The security risk and criminal threat posed by anonymous shell companies mean we need to work with law enforcement  the states  and others to address this problem in a reasonable and cost effective way               The ease in which shell companies can be set up for illicit purposes is troubling  yet we need to consider the legitimate business interests and privacy concerns with protecting ownership information     said Coleman     We need to find the right balance among individual rights  state rights  and legitimate law enforcement objectives              You
