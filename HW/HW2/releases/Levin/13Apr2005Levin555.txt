Coleman  R Minn   and Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  released a bipartisan Subcommittee report that examines the credit counseling industry and exposes abusive practices committed by certain credit counseling agencies           Over the past several years the credit counseling industry has seen the emergence of new and aggressive credit counseling agencies     Coleman said     The practices of these new agencies resulted in consumer complaints of excessive fees  pressure tactics  non existent counseling and education  promised results that never come about  ruined credit ratings  poor service  and in many cases being left in worse debt than before they initiated their debt management plan  I am pleased to note that our investigation    in conjunction with the enforcement efforts of the IRS and the FTC    has resulted in a reversal of the situation and has greatly increased public awareness of the problems facing the credit counseling industry  The recommendations in this report are designed to effect real reform in the industry and will result in greater protection for indebted consumers from unscrupulous credit counseling agencies              Too many abusive credit counseling agencies continue to take advantage of average Americans trying to dig their way out of debt    charging excessive fees  taking for themselves payments intended for creditors  and acting under the guise of a non profit charity when they are really for profit operations     said Levin     Increased IRS and FTC enforcement is targeting some of the worst offenders  but more systematic reforms are needed to clean up this industry  This report not only lays out the abuses  but also recommends a range of reforms to stop the misconduct           The Subcommittee held hearings in March 2004 and released a bipartisan staff report that related the history of credit counseling and detailed the questionable practices of three credit counseling    conglomerates    who have been the subject of consumer complaints        The bipartisan Subcommittee report released today incorporates the information learned at the Subcommittee   s hearing and outlines the changes that have occurred in the credit counseling industry since the time of the hearing  The subjects of the investigation    Cambridge Credit Counseling  The Ballenger Group  and Amerix    have each adopted more consumer friendly practices as a result of the Subcommittee   s investigation  In addition  the Subcommittee   s investigation and the enforcement actions of the IRS and FTC have resulted in the closing of AmeriDebt  Inc   one of the most notorious credit counseling agencies investigated by the Subcommittee        The Subcommittee   s report makes the following bipartisan recommendations designed to protect indebted and vulnerable consumers and improve the credit counseling industry      Complete Industry Cleanup  The IRS and FTC should complete their ongoing reviews of the credit counseling industry to eliminate abusive conduct by credit counseling agencies that have been operating in violation of restrictions on non profit charities or using unfair or deceptive trade practices        Establish Five Year Review  In light of past industry abuses  the IRS should require each credit counseling agency to submit every five years  for IRS review  return information establishing its charitable activities and a certification that the agency is not providing a private benefit to any individual or entity  Congress should consider enacting legislation conditioning a credit counseling agency   s tax exemption on the submission of this documentation and the IRS   s renewal of its tax exempt status for five year periods       Provide Consumer Education  To address rising consumer debt and bankruptcy rates  each credit counseling agency should provide affirmative financial counseling and educational programs designed to reduce excessive indebtedness within the populations they serve  and should evaluate  improve  and document the effectiveness of these programs       Continue Creditor Support and Standards  Major creditor banks should continue to provide financial support to non profit credit counseling agencies  conditioned upon the agencies    achieving specified standards that contribute to the public good  including standards requiring agencies to maintain accreditation within the industry  assess reasonable fees based upon actual costs  provide individualized debt counseling  and avoid conduct or transactions that generate a private benefit for any individual or entity  Creditors should carefully screen credit counseling agencies to ensure they provide funds only to reputable agencies that comply with their standards       Clarify Federal Standards  The IRS and FTC should work together to clarify the standards that credit counseling agencies must meet to maintain tax exempt status under Section 501 c  3  and avoid deceptive or unfair trade practices  including by making it clear that a non profit credit counseling agency must meet certain standards        a  Accreditation    maintain good standing and accreditation status within the credit counseling industry  such as by meeting the accreditation standards of the Council on Accreditation for Children and Family Services         b  Independent Board    maintain an independent Board of Directors that includes representatives of the community served by the agency and that includes no more than a minority of directors who are employed by the agency  a related entity  or any other person who stands to gain direct or indirect financial benefit from the agency   s activities         c  Public  Not Private Benefit    avoid conduct or transactions that generate or create the appearance of generating a private benefit for any individual or entity         d  Full Disclosure    disclose to each client the existence and nature of any financial relationship that the agency has with a creditor of the consumer or with a for profit entity that provides data processing  marketing  or financial services to the agency or the client         e  Reasonable Fees    if fees are to be charged  they should be reasonable fees that are based upon the agency   s actual costs and charged as services are provided  rather than substantially in advance of such services  and        f  No Improper Incentives    refrain from accepting compensation for referring clients to any service or organization  and refrain from paying compensation to any employee based upon the number of clients enrolled in debt management plans or the amount of debt managed by the agency
