champion throughout  his  career in promoting ethics in government     and citing his    dedicated efforts to combat public corruption  streamline government processes  protect the rights of whistleblowers  and reduce waste  fraud  and abuse     the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois has named Senator Carl Levin  D Mich   as the 2006 recipient of the Paul H  Douglas Ethics in Government Award     Senator Levin s remarks at the awards ceremony follow      Bill  thank you for your very kind words   We   re sorry to lose you to Illinois   It   s the last thing we   ve lost to Illinois since  by the way   But  you were a loss   A number of people  not just the students but the faculty  really  really admired you when you were there   To this day they still talk about the time you were there   Thank you       Dick Durbin  your words  your tribute  is extraordinarily meaningful to me   The fact that you   re here  obviously  is important  but the amount of sentiment that you put into those words truly is significant to me and I shall always remember them         This award  the Douglas award  I think there   s only one thing missing     It says scholar  patriot  statesman   I   m not sure of any of those  but the missing word here is    rumpled      That should be added to the award from here on in         I don   t want to disappoint my wife or my brother by not telling this story about one of my campaigns   This rumpled look of mine has been     I   ve survived  let   s put it that way   Before I tell this story  let me introduce my wife  Barbara  who   s heard this story a few times and she still laughs at it   This is my wife  Barbara       My second race was against an astronaut   His name was Jack Lousma   He was a very  very nice guy  very good looking guy   Six foot two  something like that   No political experience   And he printed up some literature which started off with his physical characteristics  unlike any political literature I   ve ever seen   It started off with his physical appearance  6   2     185 pounds  blond hair and blue eyes   And my staff got nervous with the    blond hair and blue eyes     because they thought there was a subtle message in there because I   m Jewish  and I said to my staff  no there isn   t   He   s ex military and it was probably the way they started off some of their resumes     let   s have a little fun with this one       So I started campaign speeches this way        Well  now my opponent has put out this literature with his physical appearances   We   ve done some polling on this issue   And we   re throwing out all of my literature tomorrow   We   ve reprinted it and we   re starting out with my physical characteristics     5   9 1 2     190 pounds  balding and disheveled  and plump      I don   t want to leave that out      Plump  balding and disheveled      And then the punch line was     Folks  our pollsters tell us there   s more of us than there is of them          I hope I have some other characteristics in common with Paul Douglas  but I   m glad to hear that that one also applied       I   ve introduced my wife  Barbara   My wife and my brother  Sandy   My brother Sandy and I learned ethics at the same dinner table   My parents talked a lot about ethics and values and morality   He taught me a lot about it  my brother   He   s older than I am  although he tries to pretend at times he   s not  particularly when we play squash together   But I   m glad that he was able to come by       My two colleagues who are here  I see Jack Reed was here and still is   Jack is someone I rely on so incredibly heavily on the Armed Services Committee   Thank you for coming  Jack   I thought I saw Mark Dayton   I don   t know if I really did or not   Mark Dayton from Minnesota   Mark is leaving us after one term in the Senate  and I   m going to have some things to say about him tomorrow   But he is a man of great  great passion and we will miss you   Thank you both for coming       Jean  thank you for your very kind remarks   We have the same alma mater  as you mentioned   It had a major effect on our lives when we were there  with some years in common  and I won   t say who graduated first   We fought some of the same causes together  including the fight against Joe McCarthy back in 1954   That was a fight  which Swarthmore students weighed in against Joe McCarthy and we were some of the few people actually in the country who came to Washington to lobby our senator at that time to support the censure of Joe McCarthy   It was a very important experience in my life  and I   ll just kind of leave it at that   But we did a lot of things together at Swarthmore as students  some of which were probably legal as a matter of fact       My staff is here   I   m not going to mention them all   My chief of staff  representing them  I   ll just name David Lyles   Paul Douglas knew the importance of staff to a member   I don   t have to tell my colleagues here or anyone else here about the importance of staff   But they are so critical to any successes we have that we should never overlook the importance of our staff   I just hope that when my time comes to leave that my staff will think half as well of me as Paul Douglas    staff thought of him   It   s a real tribute to Paul Douglas that you remember him and so many others here remember him so fondly       I heard the word    idiosyncrasies    used to refer to Paul Douglas  staff understanding and surviving his idiosyncrasies   My staff  it   s not the idiosyncrasies that they have to survive  I   ve overheard the word    weirdness      It   s the more likely word         Paul Douglas    voice resonates still in Dick Durbin  who is literally our voice in the Senate Democratic Caucus   We use the word these days frequently     message     which I personally am kind of tired of  perhaps   It sounds a little cold   But nonetheless  what Dick Durbin does for our caucus is try to help us put into words that will resonate with the American people   He spends a good deal of his life trying to help those of us who aren   t nearly as good with words as he is to gain that capability so that we can communicate   He   s our go to guy for message to try to state in words what our party openly stands for everyday   And he   s now been joined by Barack Obama   Thank you  Illinois  for sending us Barack Obama   He   s a really great addition to the U S  Senate       The opening words of Paul Douglas    book  Ethics in Government  have already been quoted      The American public has become increasingly uneasy in recent months about the moral practices of many government officials      And how those words ring true today as Washington reels from lobbying and bribery scandals that will send several lobbyists and at least two members of Congress to prison         In his book  Paul Douglas summarized the scandals plaguing that era  and then he made this observation   He said           After such revelations as I have cited  people are apt to believe that ours is a degenerate age and that we have lost ground morally   Men who are disgusted with the present picture the past as a Golden Age in which citizens were virtuous and public officials impeccable    The practical effect of this attitude is often to discourage people and give them a deep inferiority complex about their own times          Well  today  it is easy to be discouraged   The headlines have been dominated by golf trips to Scotland and the selling of legislative favors   Behind the scenes  there has been a blurring of the lines between lobbyists and members  as lobbyists write bills and members seek direction from lobbyists before they act on legislation   The revolving door spins rapidly as members leave office to take lucrative jobs with those who lobbied them       But as Paul Douglas knew  the abuses we see that we see today need to be a call to action  not a cause for discouragement         When Bill Cohen and I and others     Bill Cohen was one of the awardees of the Paul Douglas award     when he and I and a number of others went into action to enact a lobbying reform bill in the early 1990s  we were cautioned by those who were somewhat older and undoubtedly wiser that this was a thankless and perhaps impossible undertaking         Decade after decade  Congress had tried to close the loopholes in the 1946 act  and decade after decade  those efforts had failed        President Truman called for reform in 1948   It was not heeded   Senator McClellan s reform efforts in the 1950 s reached a dead end   The lobbying reform bill that passed the Senate in the 1960 s was never taken up in the House  even though it had been endorsed by President Johnson   The lobbying reform bills that were approved by both Houses of Congress in 1976 could not be reconciled in conference   And they went nowhere   The lobbying reform bill approved by the House in 1978 never left committee in the Senate        As a result  the loopholes had grown larger and larger   No one was plugging the new gaps  while many were working in the opposite direction to make those gaps bigger       By the early 1990s  the country was adequately fed up and we were able to push through Congress the bipartisan Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995       That act required paid professional lobbyists to register and disclose whom they represent  how much they are paid  and the issues on which they are lobbying         Although we were proud of that effort  and it was a real step forward  we knew that it too would eventually need updating  because there is an armada of lawyers working day and night to find loopholes and create new schemes that dance around this law   s specifics  like any other law   s specifics       Some of what we are seeing today is already illegal under the 1995 law  but recent events have made clear that loopholes have been found   We need to close those loopholes before public outrage over the Abramoff scandals fades       Even if we succeed in doing so today  and this is my message  we won   t solve the problem forever   We   ll never pass a    perfect    lobbying law or a law which can   t be evaded because those who seek to find a system   s weaknesses won   t rest   We can   t rest either    standing for honesty and openness in government will forever be an unfinished task   Constant vigilance is required       The same is true for so many ethical issues we face  we have to keep fighting them day in and day out  year in and year out       In the wake of corporate scandals at Enron  Worldcom  and others  we passed the Sarbanes Oxley accounting reform act to try to crack down on abuses and restore public trust in our system       Over the past three years  the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has uncovered outrageous abuses involving offshore tax havens and homegrown tax shelters that cost taxpayers  100 billion or more each year in unpaid taxes   I hope the Senate will soon pass our Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act  which Senator Coleman and I have sponsored on a bipartisan basis   It increases penalties on those who aid and abet tax evasion and begins to close that totally unfair tax gap       We have to tackle abuses tirelessly and head on     as Paul Douglas did in his day     if we are to stay ahead of those  as Paul Douglas put it so eloquently  those who have let    the weeds of the flesh choke the flowers of the spirit          Thank you again for this honor   It   s a wonderful award   Its timeless relevance is a reminder that constant vigilance is a price we should willingly pay to ensure that the clean  ethical  open government that our people deserve is provided to them       Again  thank you all   This is an award that I will treasure   I thank the family  the university  my colleagues and all of you who keep this spirit of Paul Douglas alive
