technologies    permanently bans Great Lakes drilling      WASHINGTON     The Senate today approved an energy bill that is aimed at diversifying our energy supply and reducing our dependence on foreign oil  U S  Senators Carl Levin  D MI  and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  announced   The bill increases the federal investment in advanced technologies to increase fuel economy  permanently bans drilling in the Great Lakes  and offers short term relief from threatened federal action against west Michigan counties whose air quality has been harmed by upwind pollution from Chicago           This bill is a step forward in establishing a sounder energy policy for our nation   We need a long term  comprehensive energy plan that will conserve energy and increase our domestic energy supplies in a responsible manner  while providing consumers with reliable energy     Levin said      We need to do much more to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to create revolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technology   Overall  this bill can provide some modest advances toward this goal              I am extremely pleased that the ban against drilling for oil and gas in the Great Lakes     which I was able to put in place in 2001     is made permanent by this bill  This important protection for the Great Lakes will benefit not only Michigan residents but all who live around the lakes     Stabenow said     This bill also includes my request for a Federal Trade Commission investigation of possible gas price manipulation  In addition  this energy bill includes important tax credits to help make new technologies like hybrid  fuel cell and alternative fuel cars more affordable for the American public  These auto tax credits will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help the Big Three create jobs with these new emerging technologies          The bill includes the following provisions that are interest to Michigan communities        Strong provisions for the research  development  and demonstration of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles    Tax credits     available for five years     for hybrid  clean diesel  and fuel cell vehicles  There is a per manufacturer cap of 60 000 on the aggregate number of hybrid and clean diesel vehicles that can qualify for the tax credit  which ensures that the domestic manufacturers can benefit from the tax credit to the same extent that foreign manufacturers can     A  200 million authorization each year for five years to fund federal and state grant and loan programs to replace older diesel technology with clean diesel   A permanent ban on drilling in the Great Lakes   In the three previous years  Congress has passed temporary bans on Great Lakes drilling  which were sponsored by Sen  Stabenow and cosponsored by Sen  Levin   Requirements for the Department of Energy to develop and use cost effective procedures for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  which minimize taxpayer costs and maximize total oil inventories   This Senate had previously approved this language in a bipartisan amendment by Sen  Levin and Sen  Susan Collins  R Maine   An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission of potential price gouging by oil companies   a provision authored by Stabenow   was included in the final bill   Only 50 percent of the price of gasoline at the pump is determined by the cost of crude oil   The investigation will ensure that Michigan residents are not being unfairly gouged by domestic gasoline producers and refineries   Critical steps to improve the reliability of our electrical grid and promote electricity transmission infrastructure development   Given our dependency on electric power     which was underscored by the massive August 2003 blackout     the bill includes steps to ensure mandatory and enforceable reliability standards   A short term solution for addressing air quality issues in west Michigan  which is plagued with pollution that comes from Chicago and other urban centers upwind   Reauthorization of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  until 2007 at  5 1 billion per year  and reauthorizes state weatherization programs through 2008 at  2 1 billion per year   A requirement for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and submit a budget roadmap to Congress on what efforts and actions would be required to transition to fuel cell vehicles and a hydrogen economy by 2020   An extension of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  credit to manufacturers for dual fueled vehicles  which is intended to encourage production of these vehicles    Strong R and demonstration programs to promote replacement or retrofit of diesel school buses and city transit buses with fuel cell and other advanced technology buses   Includes provisions to promote the use of renewable fuels  including a mandate for refiners to use 7 5 billion gallons of ethanol or biofuels by 2012
