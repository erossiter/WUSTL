the bill on Thursday      WASHINGTON     Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin  D Mich    along with a bipartisan group of 29 senators  today introduced the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  S 1606  and announced that the committee will hold a markup of the bill on Thursday   The act  which lays out a comprehensive path for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to address shortfalls in the care of our wounded warriors  is sponsored by Levin  Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii   Armed Services Committee Ranking Member John McCain  R Ariz    Former Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner  R Va    Veterans Affairs Committee Member Patty Murray  D Wash    and 25 other senators       Problems with the care of America   s wounded warriors were dramatized in a series of articles in The Washington Post in February and in a subsequent joint hearing by the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Veterans Affairs   The bill introduced today would address many of the problems highlighted in the articles and hearings   Some of the bill   s provisions would         End the inconsistent ratings for the same disabilities by the Department of Defense  DOD  and the Veterans Administration  VA        Provide for a seamless transition from DOD to VA care by requiring the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a comprehensive policy on the care and management of service members    transition       Authorize  50 million for improved diagnosis  treatment  and rehabilitation of members with Traumatic Brian Injury  TBI  or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD        Authorize medically retired service members with disability ratings of 50  or higher to receive the active duty medical benefit for three years after the member leaves active duty        Authorize military and VA health care providers to provide urgent and emergency medical care and counseling to family members on invitational travel orders       Establish a DOD and VA Interagency Program Office to develop and implement a joint electronic health record   Require the Secretary of Defense to establish standards for housing for military out patients and for military hospitals and clinics and specialty medical care facilities      Increase the minimum severance pay to one year   s basic pay for those separated for disabilities incurred in a combat zone  and six months    basic pay for all others       Eliminate the requirement that severance pay be deducted from disability compensation for disabilities incurred in a combat zone     Senator Levin     The Nation   s shock and dismay at the deplorable conditions unveiled at Walter Reed reflected our people   s support  respect and gratitude for the men and women who put on our Nation   s uniform   They deserve the best care and support we can muster  not shoddy medical care and bureaucratic snafus         Sen  Akaka     This measure will go a long way toward addressing the problems that first gained public attention with the stories about Walter Reed Army Medical Center and will help achieve the goal of providing optimal care and a truly seamless transition for the nation   s wounded warriors         Sen  McCain     Never before has our medical technology been better equipped to help our injured Service members  Quality patient care must be a priority for those who have served and sacrificed for our country   This legislation calls for much needed changes in the onerous process by which our men and women in uniform receive medical care  If passed  the bill would provide more comprehensive treatment for our wounded soldiers and their families throughout their recovery  allowing for a smoother transition into life after service         Sen  Warner     Providing for our men and women in uniform  and their families  is our highest priority on the Armed Services Committee  and this bill will provide a comprehensive approach to caring for those  who through their courage  have sacrificed greatly for our country   Our nation owes these brave men and women nothing less than the finest possible care         Sen  Murray      From day one  our service members have answered the call of duty and fulfilled their promises to our country   We need to meet their needs every step of the way from the day they re recruited through their transition back home  Whether it s health care for mental or physical wounds  ensuring clean facilities  or processing claims in a timely manner  our veterans and their families deserve a seamless transition and the best services available   I am so proud to have worked with members of the Senate VA and Senate Armed Services Committees to create this bill and fulfill our promise to our service members and veterans  At the end of the day  our security comes down to people     people doing a job our country asks them to do     and we need to keep our promise to them
