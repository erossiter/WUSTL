Debbie Stabenow  both D Mich   announced today that National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  National Sea Grant has awarded Michigan Sea Grant nearly  2 6 million over two years to support Great Lakes research  education and outreach programs           The research performed by Michigan Sea Grant provides us invaluable information about challenges facing the Great Lakes  including findings that are crucial to water quality  species habitat  and public health     Levin said      This funding will permit Michigan Sea Grant to continue important research projects on the lakes  including a review of E  coli bacteria in our coastal sand  and a study of human activities near on shoreline fish communities             Our future is directly tied to the Great Lakes   As stewards of the lakes  we must make every effort to protect these great Michigan and national resources     Stabenow said     Michigan Sea Grant and its education and outreach projects play an important role in that effort          Coupled with almost  1 6 million in non federal matching funds  primarily from the State of Michigan  the federal grant will support Great Lakes related programs during 2005 2007  One new research project is related to the public health implications of E  coli bacteria and beach closures   Other projects will focus on fish habitat  policy related to yellow perch harvest  and three dimensional imaging using remote sensing technology  A complete list of new and continuing research projects is online at           Michigan Sea Grant Director Don Scavia added   Addressing coastal environmental  social and economic issues in Michigan and throughout the region is our top priority   This grant will support the work of education and outreach specialists who provide statewide assistance with environmental education and coastal issues           Education and outreach projects during 2005 07 include continued sponsorship of the Great Lakes Education Program  award winning curriculum for fourth grade students and teachers  see   the Clean Marina Program  designed to minimize the environmental impact of boating  see   and support for Fisheries Learning on the Web  a standards based series of lessons for teachers  see        Michigan Sea Grant has worked with businesses  teachers  coastal property owners  and natural resource managers to conduct Great Lakes research  education and outreach for the past 36 years  Michigan Sea Grant  a collaborative program of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University  is supported by the NOAA National Sea Grant College Program       The NOAA National Sea Grant is a network of 30 university based programs administered through the NOAA and dedicated to enhancing the practical use and conservation of coastal  ocean  and Great Lakes resources to create a sustainable economy and environment          2005 2007 Michigan Sea Grant Great Lakes Research Projects      Genetic Pollution  Coastal Beaches as Environmental Reservoirs of Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance Genes  One relatively unexplored aspect of beach quality is shoreline sand  Several recent studies of public recreational beaches in the Great Lakes have shown that high densities of E  coli bacteria persist in the sand throughout the beach season  In this study  researchers will examine two types of genes that may be transferred among bacteria that inhabit the sand  The study will determine whether this transfer is occurring and the implications for public health  Contact  Elizabeth Wheeler Alm

population is beginning to show signs of recovery  Sound management will be critical in the coming years to provide optimal fishery benefits in the face of long term fluctuations  Using decision analysis techniques  researchers will develop a forecasting model to provide managers with the information they need to develop a well founded harvest policy  Several workshops will be conducted in close cooperation with the Lake Michigan Yellow Perch Task Group  Contact  James Bence and Michael Jones  Michigan State University  bence msu edu  jonesm30 msu edu   517  432 3812   517  432 0465      Guiding Shoreline Restoration  Fish Habitat Choices Based on Flow Signatures  Great Lakes bays and channels are ecologically valuable and provide nursery areas for many species of fish  Yet shoreline development  marsh fragmentation and increasing human activity threaten these sensitive habitats  Waves driven onshore by boats are thought to pose a significant hazard  especially in areas where seawalls are used  This project will determine the effects of water flow on shoreline habitat and near shore fish communities  Researchers will conduct a comparison of wave and water flow dynamics and the response of fish in five contrasting sites within the Les Cheneaux island bays and channels in Michigan s eastern upper peninsula  Contact  Paul Webb  University of Michigan  pwebb umich edu   734  763 2332       Ecosystem Mosaics and the Lake Michigan  Doughnut     Modeling Pattern and Process Using Remotely Sensed Imagery  Using recent advances in remote sensing technology  researchers will examine the interaction between coastal and offshore waters in relation to winter food web productivity and impacts on Great Lakes biodiversity  They will document the occurrence and magnitude of episodic events  which temporarily circulate sediment and nutrients  Collected data will allow researchers to create three dimensional images of an unusual phenomenon  resembling a doughnut pattern  previously discovered in southern Lake Michigan  Investigators will explore the potential food web implications of this late winter episodic event  which may be instrumental in supporting numerous species  Contact  W  Charles Kerfoot  Michigan Technological University  wkerfoot mtu edu   906  487 2769
