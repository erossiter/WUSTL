and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   hailed inclusion of millions of dollars for Michigan and the Great Lakes in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill  which the Senate Appropriations Committee approved last week  The bill includes over  53 million for operation and maintenance     including dredging     for navigation projects in Michigan   and authorization to upgrade and construct Asian carp barriers on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal  which was requested by the senators  The bill needs to be approved by the full Senate and a House Senate conference committee before being signed into law by the president      Every year  hundreds of millions of tons of goods are transported through the Great Lakes waterways  and communities throughout the Great Lakes are economically tied to waterborne commerce     said Levin     This bill contains much needed funding for the dredging of these important waterways  as well as the fight against invasive species such as the Asian carp  Michigan and our country will also benefit from the funding in this bill for renewable energy projects and advanced vehicle technologies         The economic vitality of our harbor communities depends on both regular dredging and protection from invasive species     said Stabenow     I am pleased that this bill will help improve our harbor communities  create jobs  and will provide alternative energy funding to help decrease our dependency on foreign oil      The bill contains a provision requested by Levin and Stabenow that would direct the Secretary of the Army to operate and make permanent the Asian carp barrier at the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and to construct a second barrier  At total of  3 75 million in funding would be provided for this work   The bill also includes funding for the following projects   Army Corps of Engineers     Operation and Maintenance    Note  funding for specific Michigan harbors is left to the discretion of the Army Corps  so funding
