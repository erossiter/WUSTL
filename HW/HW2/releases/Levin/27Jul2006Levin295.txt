and Debbie Stabenow  D Mich   today announced funding for many Michigan projects in the Senate version of the defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  which the Senate Appropriations Committee passed unanimously last week            Michigan continues to lead the way in performing top notch defense research and providing high quality equipment for our nation   s military services     said Levin  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee      This bill funds vital investments in advanced military technology as well as energy development  robotics  and next generation automotive research   These investments are helping our troops on the ground in Iraq  Afghanistan  and around the world  and they are ensuring that the U S  military remains the best equipped and best trained today and in the future             Michigan is a leader in defense technology  research and manufacturing and provides critical support for our troops in their missions all over the world     said Stabenow     Michigan   s industries and workers have always been an important part of our national defense  and this funding will expand those capabilities to create new jobs in Michigan         The Senate Majority Leader has not yet announced when the Senate will take up the defense appropriations bill   The House of Representatives passed its version of the defense appropriations bill in June   Following Senate passage of the bill  members of the House and Senate will meet in a conference committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills   The House and Senate will then vote on the final legislation and send it to the President for his signature      Specific projects for northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula follow   Robotics   10 million for an Unmanned Ground Vehicle Development Initiative   The Unmanned Ground Vehicle Initiative  UGVI  will be implemented by the ground vehicle experts at the Tank Automotive and Armament Research Development and Engineering Center  TARDEC    This funding will be used for integrating and demonstrating sensor technologies  perception hardware and software  and robotic control technologies that are required to enable unmanned ground vehicle  UGV  systems to maneuver with minimal human intervention  for on  and off road missions while at militarily significant speeds   Mature technologies are incorporated in UGV technology demonstrators  so that performance can be evaluated for multiple tactical and sustainment applications   Technical challenges addressed should include obstacle avoidance  perception limitations  intelligent situational behaviors  command and control  frequency of human intervention  and operations in adverse weather  Funding for this project will be executed by TARDEC      Advanced Automotive   7 0 million for the vehicle fuel cell program  This program was initiated by Sen  Levin in 2002 to coordinate fuel cell activities throughout the military and to focus specifically on vehicle fuel cell technologies  This program develops and demonstrates vehicle propulsion technologies and fuel cell auxiliary power units in military settings   The program continually evaluates new technologies in fuel cells  fuel reforming  hydrogen storage and generation  and battlefield electric power in an effort to solve military problems with fuel cells and allied technologies   The U S  Army   s Detroit Arsenal participates in this merit based Defense Logistics Agency  DLA  program        2 0 million to continue the development of an advanced thermal management system to increase engine efficiency for Army vehicles  Engineered Machined Products in Escanaba has partnered with TARDEC in the development of these systems       2 0 million for tactical vehicle design tools   This research would continue the development of a computer based tool that would assist in the design of future Army tactical vehicles   This program will further develop computer aided engineering design tools   These tools are now being used on several major military programs including the Army   s Future Combat Systems and the Navy   s DD X    Thermoanalytics of Calumet has worked with TARDEC on comparable research efforts for several years       1 0 million for the development of lightweight wheels for military combat vehicles   This project will increase the lifespan and reduce the infrared signature of wheels on combat vehicles and will be led by GS Engineering of Houghton        Michigan Based Procurement   796 million for 100 of the Army   s Stryker armored vehicle  General Dynamics Land Systems  GDLS  of Sterling Heights is the prime contractor for the Stryker armored vehicle   GDLS uses a network of Michigan subcontractors to assist them in their development  engineering  support and manufacturing of the Stryker armored vehicle       365 million for the M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management process   The Army initiated a M1A1 Abrams tank rebuild program in 1999 known as Abrams Integrated Management  AIM    Under this refurbishment program of more than 1 000 M1A1 Abrams tanks will be rebuilt to a like new condition by completely disassembling each component of the tank and cleaning  inspecting  and evaluating for rebuilding  refurbishment  or complete replacement  General Dynamics Land Systems of Sterling Heights is the prime contractor for the U S  Army   s Abrams tank   GDLS uses a network of Michigan subcontractors to assist them in their development  engineering  support and manufacturing of the M1A1 Abrams tank       171 million for M1A2 Abrams tank upgrade program    In this program  588 early model M1 tanks are being upgraded to the latest M1A2 System Enhancement Package  SEP  configuration   The M1A2 SEP program upgrades Abrams tanks with the Army s newest command and control system  second generation thermal sights  color displays  and improved armor   General Dynamics Land Systems of Sterling Heights is the prime contractor for the U S  Army   s Abrams tank   GDLS uses a network of Michigan subcontractors to assist them in their development  engineering  support  and manufacturing of the M1A2 Abrams tank upgrade program      University Research   2 0 million for dendrimer enhanced water remediation research   This funding will provide for selective removal of contaminants and other hazardous materials in water filtration   Research has shown that dendrimers have a remarkable capacity to capture a variety of metal and organic molecules making them ideal materials for water remediation   However  it is difficult to find cost effective nanotechnology based methods that increase the capacity and performance of water filtration units by selective removal of toxic metals and contaminants at the nanoscale and molecular levels  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of dendrimers for reusable cartridges for point of use filtration units   Central Michigan University has extensive experience in this field          1 0 million for integrated systems in sensing  imaging and communications research   Wireless optical communication will be an important technology for highly secure  point to point communication systems   Michigan Technological University has extensive experience in this field through collaborative efforts with the National Science Foundation  the University of Michigan and Michigan State University       1 479 billion for merit based fundamental research to support the military at our nation   s universities and government laboratories  Many Michigan universities  including the University of Michigan  Michigan State  Wayne State  Oakland University  Eastern Michigan University  Kettering University  and Michigan Technological University  perform high quality fundamental research for the Department of Defense in all fields of science and technology
