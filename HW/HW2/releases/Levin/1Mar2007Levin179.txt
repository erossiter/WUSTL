amended by the        Section 1  Short title  Table of Contents  Section 2  Findings  Section 3  Definitions      TITLE I     PREVENTION OF INTRODUCTION OF AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES IN WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES BY VESSELS      Section 101  Prevention of Introduction of Aquatic Invasive Species in Waters of the United States by Vessels   Building on the current mandatory National Ballast Water Management Program  the bill sets requirements applicable to all ships  coastal and transoceanic  operating in waters of the United States and a timeframe for compliance   In particular  it would require all vessels that ply U S  waters  with limited exceptions  to undertake ballast management treatment practices to minimize the risk of new introductions of aquatic invasive species in U S  waters by any aspect of ship operations        Requirements on Vessels Operating in Waters of the United States   Every ship operating in waters of the United States must have an Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan  carry out Best Management Practices  including practices to reduce hull fouling   document ballast operations and management activities  and comply with applicable ballast water treatment requirements       Ballast Water Requirements   Until the end of 2011  all existing ships entering a U S  port must conduct ballast water exchange and any other management practices included in regulations unless the safety of the vessel is at stake  Exceptions include vessels operating entirely within the exclusive economic zone and existing vessels that operate entirely within an enclosed aquatic ecosystem       Beginning in 2012  all vessels entering a US port shall conduct ballast water treatment so that ballast water discharged contains less than 1 living organism that is larger than 50  micrometers in dimension per 10 cubic meters of water and less than 1 living organism that is smaller than 50 micrometers per 10 milliliters of water  The Coast Guard in concurrence with the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  may set an alternative standard that is as protective  If the Coast Guard and EPA determine that technology to meet this standard does not exist  the Coast Guard and EPA shall require the use of treatment systems that meet or exceed the best performance available at that time  provided that the technology meets the standard adopted by the International Maritime Organization        Approved ballast treatment technologies shall be environmentally sound   Permits to use technology are valid for the lesser of 10 years or the life of the treatment system and may be renewed if the treatment system remains in compliance with applicable standards  The Coast Guard will monitor treatment system operation and effectiveness   Permits are revocable if the performance is seriously deficient relative to expectations      Certification Procedures   The Coast Guard and EPA shall develop protocols measuring ballast treatment performance  and approving  ballast water and other treatment systems to certify effectiveness  occupational safety  environmental soundness  and its minimum lifespan   Approval of a system shall be qualified  as needed  based on voyage pattern  vessel class  and other properties that may limit system performance   Certification must include ship based testing      Experimental Treatment Approval   The Coast Guard shall issue and implement procedures for approving experimental ballast water treatment methods on a ship by ship basis  largely mirroring the Coast Guard   s existing Shipboard Treatment Evaluation Program  STEP    Experimental treatment approvals are valid for the lesser of 10 years or the life of the treatment system and also may be renewed   Ship owners must agree to gather information regarding the operational and biological effectiveness of the treatment system      Great Lakes Program   Current regulations would stay in place  but within 18 months of enactment  the U S  Coast Guard must review and revise the Great Lakes ballast water management   Ships reporting no ballast on board or    NOBOBs    will be required to conduct saltwater flushing   Before 2011  ships may use treatment systems meeting the prevailing IMO standard in lieu of ballast water exchange      Section 102  Armed Services Whole Vessel Management Program   The Armed Services Whole Vessel Management Program is amended to minimize the risk of introductions of aquatic invasive species by towed vessels   This program shall not affect the current ballast program in place for Department of Defense vessels       TITLE II     PREVENTION OF INTRODUCTION OF AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES IN WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES BY OTHER PATHWAYS      Section 201  Priority Pathway Management Program   The Aquatic Nuisance Species  ANS  Task Force will conduct pathway analysis in order to identify the highest risk pathways for introduction of aquatic invasive species into US waters and to implement management strategies to reduce these introductions      Section 202  Screening Process for Planned Importations of Live Aquatic Organisms   The USGS  APHIS  and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center shall develop a catalog of aquatic species that have a documented history of being in trade  Beginning 3 years after enactment  anyone trying to import a live aquatic species not in trade  as documented by the catalog  must obtain a permit to import the species  The National Invasive Species Council will develop screening guidelines for federal agencies to use to determine if the U S  should permit the importation of a live organism  and if so  whether the U S  should condition the importation of the species  Federal agencies that currently have authority over the importation of an aquatic species will be in charge of screening that species though any agency may opt to give its screening authority to the Fish and Wildlife Service  The bill authorizes grant funding to help states perform their own screening processes in addition to the federal process        TITLE III    EARLY DETECTION  RAPID RESPONSE  CONTROL AND OUTREACH      Section 301  Early Detection   The National Invasive Species Council will develop a set of sampling protocols  a geographic plan  and a budget to support a national system of ecological surveys for rapid detection of aquatic invasive species   This national system will establish clear lines of communication and help identify pathways causing distribution of newly detected aquatic invasive species       Section 302  Rapid Response   The bill establishes a Rapid Response Fund to provide grants to states and regions to implement approved rapid response contingency strategies   The ANS Task Force will develop model state and regional rapid response contingency strategies to aid states and regions in the development of contingency strategies   The National Invasive Species Council  within 12 months of enactment  would establish a Federal Rapid Response Team to    1  implement eradication and control responses on federal land   2  assist  if requested  in implementing rapid response measures on non federal land  and   3  provide training to state  tribal  and regional rapid responders      Section 303  Dispersal Barriers   This bill expands the existing dispersal barrier program   The Army Corps of Engineers would complete construction and upgrades of the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal Dispersal Barriers  operate the barriers  and conduct a feasibility study on the full range of options to prevent spread of invasive species through the canal   The Fish and Wildlife Service would establish a monitoring program to track invasive species moving through interbasin and intrabasin waterways  asses the efficacy of dispersal barriers and other measures in preventing this spread  identify waterways suitable for dispersal barrier projects  and analyze the range of options available to prevent spread in the Lake Champlain Canal and the Upper Mississippi River       Section 304  Environmental Soundness   The EPA will promulgate regulations to evaluate treatment methods to ensure no adverse effects on human health  public safety  or the environment result from their use        Section 305  Information  Education and Outreach   The legislation expands on education initiatives under existing law by including new public and industry outreach programs  The Task Force  Sea Grant and the National Park Service would develop programs to address the spread of aquatic invasive species by recreational boats   The Task Force will maintain a website to inform the public on screening  monitoring and control efforts   In addition  the Task Force would carry out activities to inform and promote voluntary cooperation and regulatory compliance       TITLE IV     AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES RESEARCH      Sections 401     404  Research   Research priorities form an integral component of this bill  Key research programs include  The development and implementation of ecological surveys at various sites and invasion surveys to assess the rates and patterns of introductions of nonindigenous aquatic species in U S aquatic ecosystems and to track the establishment of these species    The execution of standardized  field based pathway surveys to monitor high risk pathways by which nonindigenous aquatic species may be introduced into aquatic ecosystems  including ballast discharge  and to determine practices that contribute to the introduction of these species    The development and maintenance of a central  national pathways and ecological survey database of information collected under the Act  and the coordination of this database with other relevant previously established databases   The utilization of US Geological Survey field stations to perform collaborative experimental research to identify the relationship between the introduction and establishment of nonindigenous aquatic species  including organism concentration and any ambient conditions necessary for those species to survive and strive    Establishment of a research  development  and demonstration program to develop a wide set of environmentally sound methods and treatment tools for detecting  preventing  controlling and eradicating aquatic invasive species  including interbasin dispersal barriers and ballast water treatment technologies   Research to support the implementation of pathway standards   Encouragement of Graduate studies in taxonomy and systematics      TITLE V   COORDINATION      Section 501  Program Coordination   The ANS Task Force membership will add the Directors of USGS  Secretary of the Department of State  and the Smithsonian   The content of State Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plans would expand to include rapid response  aquatic plant control  screening and early detection strategies  and Federal funds are made available for the development of State Management Plans        Section 502  International Coordination   The Secretary of State would initiate negotiations with Canada to task the International Joint Commission with a review of policies to protect the Great Lakes  and with Mexico for the US Mexican border region         TITLE VI     AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS      Section 601  Authorization of Appropriations
