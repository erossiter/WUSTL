spoke on the Senate floor regarding the  nuclear option   a radical parliamentary procedure that the majority party has threatened to use to end filibusters in the Senate  circumventing the Senate   s written rules  precedents  and practices               Following are excerpts of Levin   s remarks      We proudly serve in the world   s greatest deliberative body   We say that so often that those words can lose their impact  but we must never lose sight of our profound responsibility to this institution as keepers of its legacy        The enduring strength and beauty of the U S  Senate is that we not only operate by rules  but that those rules provide protections for the minority   More than 200 years of Senate rulings have affirmed that this body stands against the    tyranny of the majority    that our Founding Fathers cautioned us about       Today  for temporary political advantage  some would destroy part of what makes the Senate unique   The so called    nuclear option     if implemented  will deface this Senate monument by allowing a majority  for the first time in our history  to operate by fiat instead of by rule         Arthur Vandenberg  one of my predecessors from Michigan is one of the giants of Senate history  His portrait was recently added to the Senate Reception Room outside of this chamber where he joined six other greats of the Senate   Senator Vandenberg  a Republican leader in the Senate  addressed the Senate in 1949 prior to the Senate   s rejection of Vice President Barkley   s effort to change the cloture rule by fiat   His comments speak directly to the situation we find ourselves in and I want to share some of his remarks today       Senator Vandenberg said        I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate are as important to equity and order in the Senate as is the Constitution to the life of the Republic  and that those rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself  in the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves        Senator Vandenberg continued         One of the immutable truths in Washington   s Farewell Address  which cannot be altered even by changing events in a changing world  is the following sentence   The Constitution which at any time exists  until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people  is sacredly obligatory upon all    I respectfully submit   Senator Vandenberg said   as a basic explanation of my attitude  that I accept this admonition without reservation  and I think it is equally applicable to the situation which Senators here confront  though obviously the comparison cannot be literal      T he Father of his Country said to us  by analogy   The rules of the Senate which at any time exist  until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole Senate  are sacredly obligatory upon all         Senator Vandenberg continued          I have heard it erroneously argued in the cloakrooms that since the Senate rules themselves authorize a change in the rules through due legislative process by a majority vote  it is within the spirit of the rules when we reach the same net result by a majority vote of the Senate upholding a parliamentary ruling of the Vice President which  in effect  changes the rules   This would appear to be some sort of doctrine of amendment by proxy   It is argued that the Senate itself makes the change in both instances by majority vote  and it is asked     What is the difference      Of course  this is really an argument that the end justifies the means          Senator Vandenberg continued          I think there is a great and fundamental difference  Mr  President   When a substantive change is made in the rules by sustaining a ruling of the Presiding Officer of the Senate    and that is what I contend is being undertaken here    it does not mean that the rules are permanently changed   It simply means that regardless of precedent or traditional practice  the rules  hereafter  mean whatever the Presiding Officer of the Senate  plus a simple majority of Senators voting at the time  want the rules to mean   We fit the rules to the occasion  instead of fitting the occasion to the rules   Therefore  in the final analysis  under such circumstances  there are no rules except the transient  unregulated wishes of a majority of whatever quorum is temporarily in control of the Senate   That  Mr  President  is not my idea of the greatest deliberative body in the world     No matter how important  the pending issue   s  immediate incidence may seem to many today  the integrity of the Senate   s rules is our paramount concern  today  tomorrow  and so long as this great institution lives          Senator Vandenberg continued              I  want to be sure that none of my colleagues shall feel under the slightest compunction to vote on a friendship or loyalty basis so far as I am concerned   This is a solemn decision    reaching far beyond the immediate consequence    and it involves just one consideration   What do the present Senate rules mean  and for the sake of law and order  shall they be protected in that meaning until changed by the Senate itself in the fashion required by the rules            Senator Vandenberg eloquently summarized what is the root of the    nuclear option                 T he rules of the Senate as they exist at any given time and as they are clinched by precedents should not be changed substantively by the interpretive action of the Senate   s Presiding Officer  even with the transient sanction of an equally transient Senate majority   The rules can be safely changed only by the direct and conscious action of the Senate itself  acting in the fashion prescribed by the rules   Otherwise  no rule in the Senate is worth the paper it is written on  and this so called    greatest deliberative body in the world    is at the mercy of every change in parliamentary authority          How I wish every Senator would read Senator Vandenberg   s speech before voting to support the    nuclear option            This Senate is an enduring monument of political history   Its uniqueness is perhaps most embodied in Rule XXII  which is at the heart of our being a deliberative body and the source of protection of the minority   I plead with our colleagues    do not deface this Senate monument by eliminating by fiat that right of the minority   Do not trample on rights so essential to the institution   s deliberative nature   Do not deface this Senate monument by amending rules by fiat   Instead  seek to change our rules  if you deem it wise  according to the procedures set out in our rules   But do not take this fateful  unprecedented  and misguided step being proposed by the Majority Leader         Few are privileged to serve in this special place   Let those who follow us here look back at what we will do in the fateful days which lie ahead and say that the institution they aspired to was preserved and protected by its present custodians
