Review U S  Detainee Policies and Allegations of Detainee Abuse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON    Sen  Carl Levin  D Mich   today announced plans to introduce an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act  along with Sens  Ted Kennedy  D Mass   John Rockefeller  D W V   and Jack Reed  D R I   that would establish an independent commission to examine U S  policies and practices for the treatment of detainees since September 11  2001  including their detention and interrogation  and allegations of detainee abuse  The commission  which would be modeled after the 9 11 Commission  would report on its findings regarding the causes of detainee abuse  determine who should be held responsible for such abuses  and make recommendations for changes in U S  policy and law relating to the treatment of detainees      We are calling for an Independent Commission on the Treatment of Detainees because the Defense Department has shown that it is not capable of investigating itself     said Levin     The most serious scandal in recent military history needs an objective investigation      The purposes of the Commission would be to    examine U S  policies and practices relating to the treatment of detainees since September 11  2001  including their detention  interrogation  and rendition   examine the causes of and factors that may have contributed to alleged mistreatment of detainees  including U S  laws and policies  and activities of contractors or intelligence personnel   assess the responsibility of military and civilian leaders  within and outside the Department of Defense  for policies  actions  or omissions that may have contributed to detainee mistreatment   evaluate the effectiveness and propriety of interrogation techniques  policies  and practices for producing useful and reliable intelligence   evaluate plans for the long term detention and procedures for the prosecution  including by military commissions  of detainees  and  report to the President and Congress on their findings and recommendations  including any recommended changes to U S  laws  policies  or regulations  as appropriate    The composition and powers of the commission would be modeled on the 9 11 Commission    The results of the various Defense Department reviews to date are highly inadequate  the Senators allege  These reviews  snapshot inspections  and carefully circumscribed investigations have resulted in significant gaps  have had limited or no cooperation from the CIA  have left critical documents missing  including key legal memos from the Justice Department  and have reached conflicting conclusions   The Senators seek answers to critical questions  such as   Why  despite serious concerns raised by military service lawyers in Washington and FBI agents in Guantanamo  did Secretary Rumsfeld approve in December 2002 an interrogation policy for Guantanamo that included aggressive techniques like stress positions  isolation  20 hour interrogations  nudity  and the use of military working dogs  Did memos from the Justice Department s Office of Legal Counsel give the green light to the cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees in U S  custody  including abusive and degrading interrogation techniques   How was it that aggressive interrogation techniques migrated from Guantanamo to Iraq   where these same techniques contributed to the abuses at Abu Ghraib   Why did the Secretary fail to promulgate interrogation policies for Afghanistan   and Iraq   as he did for Guantanamo in April 2003   Did senior leaders create a command climate in Iraq and elsewhere that increased the likelihood of abuses  by pressuring interrogators to produce actionable intelligence    In calling for an independent commission  the Senators voiced concern that there has been no accountability at senior levels for policies  actions  and failures to act that may have contributed to widespread abuse of detainees  The responsibility of civilian leaders  in particular  remains essentially unexamined  Meanwhile  eight junior soldiers have been criminally convicted at courts martial for the Abu Ghraib abuses  with one other reservist still being tried   A full  objective  and independent inquiry into the treatment of detainees would serve to restore the United States   credibility and leadership in the world  the Senators argued      A thorough investigation would protect our troops     Levin said     We must demonstrate our commitment to the humane treatment of detainees  to strengthen our standing to object to  and take action against  anyone who mistreats an American prisoner of war      The full text of the proposed amendment can be
