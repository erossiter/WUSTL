SEN. REID: RECORD-SETTING GAS PRICES UNDERSCORE NEED FOR BETTER NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to reports that gas prices have reached record highs: 
   "The news that our nation's gas prices have hit an all-time high - especially as we approach the beginning of the summer travel season - underscores the urgent need for a better national energy policy that quickly brings clean and affordable renewable fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles to market. We have to make it a national priority to reduce our reliance on oil, especially foreign oil. 
   "That is why I introduced legislation to invest in a secure, energy-independent future for America. Our reforms will protect consumers by punishing price-gouging, increase our energy independence, strengthen the economy and reduce global warming emissions. This Administration may be content to sit by as oil companies continue to profit at the cost of our national security, economy and environment, but Democrats are not."
