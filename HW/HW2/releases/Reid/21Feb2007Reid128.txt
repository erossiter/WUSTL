SEN. REID HONORS PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT CLARENCE NORING
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada honored World War II Veteran Clarence Leroy "Roy" Noring at a Purple Heart presentation at the Air National Guard Auditorium.  
   "Our nation is forever indebted to Mr. Noring's service," said Reid. "I was honored to take part in his Purple Heart presentation and to be in the presence of one of our state's great heroes." 
   Noring, a resident of Reno since 2003 and a former Marine, is the last survivor of the 1st Marine Edsons Raiders, a small unit of about 100 Marines who got their name when they raided Guadalcanal on September 8, 1942. During the raid, Noring was shot in the head by a Japanese soldier. Noring was also wounded two other times in a bayonet fight at the last battle in Guadalcanal. 
   Numerous members of Noring's family were present at the ceremony, including: Dora, his wife of 17 years; sister Pat Bumby; son and daughter-in-law Lee and Liz Noring; daughters Lisa Chansler and Karen Noring Arnold; grandchildren Gavin and Ashley; and his former home school teacher, Bill Horn. 
   The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy, and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action.
