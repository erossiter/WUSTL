SEN. REID'S LEADERSHIP DELIVERS ADDITIONAL MILLIONS FOR NEVADA
  Sen. Harry Reid included more than $300 million for Nevada projects in his Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Reid is seven months into his new position as the Senate's Democratic Leader, a powerful position that gives him added clout to deliver for Nevada. As the top Democrat on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Reid has long secured millions for the state to fund energy, homeland security, water and infrastructure projects. Last year, Nevada received over $220 million in the bill. This year, there is $338 million for Nevada.  
   "This is a long list of projects, and every one of them will benefit Nevada," Senator Reid said. "There is funding for flood control in large and small communities, money for homeland security to make Nevada safer, and tens of millions of dollars for renewable energy projects that will be part of the economic future of our state." 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee passed the bill today. It includes money for flood control and environmental improvements throughout the state, as well as increased funding for homeland security training and studies at the Nevada Test Site, UNR, UNLV and DRI, and millions for rural Nevada programs. 
   Additionally, Reid included language in the Energy and Water bill that would release $85 million of previously approved funding for agriculture and water projects in the Walker River Basin. Sen. Reid, Sen. John Ensign and Congressman Jim Gibbons have been working to release the funding. It passed as part of the 2002 Farm Bill when Sen. Reid included $200 million for conservation projects at places like Walker Lake. 
   The bill still must pass the full Senate and then go to a conference committee, where it will be reconciled with a House version of the legislation.
