SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE HUNT'S DECISION ON YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement following the ruling by U.S. District Judge Roger Hunt regarding the Yucca water bore hole drilling issue: 
   "Judge Hunt's ruling confirms what many of us have known for a long time: the federal government will do anything it can to try to turn Nevada into the nation's nuclear dumping ground, even if that means ignoring the law and the will of the people who would be most affected by the dump. Stealing water, misleading Congress, and ignoring court orders are par for the course for the Energy Department. I am pleased that Judge Hunt upheld Nevada's right to enforce its water laws. The Energy Department needs to come to grips with the fact that the dump will never be built and begin working on a way to store nuclear waste at the sites where it is produced, instead of an outdated plan to ship 77,000 tons of it across the country to Nevada."
