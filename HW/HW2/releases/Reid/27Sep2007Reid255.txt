SEN. REID ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR NEW BUSES TO SERVICE LAKE TAHOE
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada announced that Nevada will be receiving $500,000 for the purchase of two 35-foot transit vehicles and one shuttle van to service the Eldorado and Douglas County portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin.  
   "Lake Tahoe is one of the most beautiful, pristine areas in the world," said Reid. "We need to do everything we can to make sure that it stays that way. These new buses run cleaner, safer, and will help protect our air. It will help to preserve one of Nevada's greatest treasures while providing a much needed public transit system servicing those in the Lake Tahoe area."
   The new vehicles run on clean fuel and will be delivered by the end of 2007, replacing the older BlueGO vehicles. The money is an installment of $4 million that Reid secured in the Transportation Authorization bill (SATETEA-LU) for the Lake Tahoe Metropolitan Organization.
