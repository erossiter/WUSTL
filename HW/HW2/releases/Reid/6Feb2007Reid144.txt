SEN. REID MEETS WITH NASCAR NEXTEL CHAMPION JIMMIE JOHNSON
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with NASCAR NEXTEL Champion Jimmie Johnson, #48 TEAM Members, and NASCAR Executives.  
   Over the past decade, NASCAR has thrived in the state of Nevada, especially since the construction of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 1995. Races attract as many as 275,000 visitors to Las Vegas and have brought in a record $197 million, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's annual study. 
   "NASCAR has become an integral part of Nevada's culture and economy," said Reid. "I was pleased to meet with one of its greatest drivers, Jimmie Johnson." 
   Last year, Johnson became the only NASCAR driver to ever win the Daytona 500, Allstate 400 and the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Championship races all in the same year.
