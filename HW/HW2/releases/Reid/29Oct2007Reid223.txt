SEN. REID ANNOUNCES MOBILE RESOURCE CENTERS TO HELP NEVADANS FACING FORECLOSURES
  Working to address the foreclosure crisis in Nevada, today U.S. Senator Harry Reid announced five mobile resource centers throughout Nevada.
   "Nevada is facing a foreclosure crisis," said Reid. "Clark, Washoe, Douglas, Elko and Nye counties have been hit hardest by foreclosures. In these counties foreclosure rates have increased 100-300 percent in the last two years. That's why it's important that local, state, federal, and agencies come together to identify ways to help Nevadans. The goal of these mobile resource centers is to provide a place where people in danger of losing their homes can get help. I will continue to do all I can to help address this foreclosure crisis."
  Credit counselors, lenders, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and representatives from Reid's office will come together to help Nevadans at these centers.
