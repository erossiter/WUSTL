SEN. REID: BUSH REPUBLICANS PUT POLITICS BEFORE PROTECTING AMERICA
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement after Bush Republicans in the Senate voted to block comprehensive national security legislation:  
   "Today is another example of Republicans talking tough about national security, but then failing to do what it takes to keep America safe. Our country is not as safe as it can and should be five years after 9/11, and votes like this in the Republican Congress are a reason why. The Bush White House and its Do Nothing Congress have left our ports, borders, chemical plants and mass transit systems vulnerable. It is time this Congress finally learn the lessons of 9/11. Politics won't protect the American people. Only a serious commitment and tough and smart strategies, like the Democrats Real Security Act, will. It's time for a new direction."
