SEN. REID PROTECTS NEVADA AGAINST MORMON CRICKETS
  Working to protect Nevada's lands from the far reaching invasive species of Mormon Crickets, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada secured the state's full request, $150,000, in the fiscal year 2007 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill today. In addition, Senator Reid co-sponsored an agriculture disaster amendment that passed, ensuring that Nevadans are eligible for disaster assistance for crop losses that they experienced last year.  
   "Mormon crickets eat nearly anything and everything in their path. These crickets are ravaging Nevada, especially rural communities in Humboldt, Lander, and Pershing counties. Nevada has experienced past infestations of epidemic proportion. These crickets are a public hazard, putting economic strains on rural business, and making farming and ranching much more difficult," said Reid. "I'm pleased to know that this funding will help continue efforts to control these destructive insects." 
   Mormon Crickets can grow to 3 inches long and travel a mile a day as they eat sagebrush, lawns and crops. 
   Over the course of the last several years, Mormon cricket infestations have doubled each year. The last two years saw the worst infestations Nevada has experienced in 40 years. It was a larger infestation than the 1990-91 infestation that briefly shut down I-80 as the crickets made the road greasy and caused car accidents. 
   This year the crickets are expected to hatch in numbers well above last year's record setting infestation. The Mormon Cricket infestation that has hit approximately 11 million acres in Nevada this summer. The combination of a mild winter and the ongoing drought have led to one of the worst infestations on record, with a devastating impact on many ranchers and farmers. 
   Reid has fought for and won over $20 million in 2003 to control Mormon crickets in Nevada, Utah, Idaho. Out of that funding Reid secured nearly $7 million for Nevada.
