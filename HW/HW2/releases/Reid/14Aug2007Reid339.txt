SEN. REID: SIX MONTHS INTO SURGE, IRAQIS NO CLOSER TO POLITICAL SOLUTION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today on the six-month anniversary of President Bush's escalation in Iraq:  
   "While our brave men and women continue to fight Iraq's civil war, Iraqis remain far from a political solution and have not demonstrated any readiness to stand up and take responsibility for their own country. And as President Bush continues to cling stubbornly to his flawed strategy, Al Qaeda only grows stronger.
   "This week's political summit is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done as it is clearer than ever that we urgently need a new strategy. Over the past six months, despite President Bush's unfounded claims of success, 565 Americans have been killed in Iraq while taxpayers have spent $60 billion. After the Administration's September 15 report, we hope the President and Congressional Republicans will finally work with us to provide a real, overdue change of course in Iraq."
