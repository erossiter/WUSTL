SEN. REID CONDOLES LAS VEGAS MARINE'S DEATH, CONDEMNS IRAQI SUICIDE BOMBERS
  Statement of Sen. Harry Reid:
   "Nevada has lost another of its extraordinary citizens. Corporal William I. Salazar, a 26-year-old Marine from Las Vegas, was killed in Iraq by suicide bombers. The bombers' cowardice is a sharp contrast to Salazar's bravery and selflessness. 
   Salazar sacrificed his life trying to bring peace to the most troubled part of the world. All Nevadans should be proud of the work he did in Iraq, and grateful for his heroism. My thoughts and prayers are with William Salazar's family and friends."
