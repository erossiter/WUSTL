SEN. REID APPLAUDS SIGNING OF WATER AGREEMENT
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement after the signing of the agreement between the seven Colorado River Basin States by U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne.  
   "I want to applaud the negotiators from the seven Colorado River Basin Sates and the Secretary of the Interior for successfully completing this important agreement which will govern how the states share water shortages. Unfortunately, it appears that this 9 year drought may be the new "norm" and this agreement will ensure future cooperation among the States that rely upon the River to meet all our water needs."
