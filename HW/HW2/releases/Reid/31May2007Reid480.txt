SEN. REID SPEAKS AT OPENING PREVIEW OF LAS VEGAS SPRINGS PRESERVE
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada spoke to an audience of 400 at the opening preview event for the Las Vegas Springs Preserve and then toured the facility.  
   "This wonderful project creates a new cultural hub for locals and tourists that allows them to learn more about Las Vegas' early days while delighting in nature," said Reid. "I am pleased to have played a part in ensuring that the Las Vegas Springs Preserve became a reality and I encourage all Nevadans to visit this new facility." 
   The Preserve features a series of historic museums, galleries, outdoor concerts/events, the Nevada State Museum & Historical Society, an interpretive trail system, a botanical garden and more. The $250 million project received $48 million in Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) funds. Reid helped protect SNPLMA legislation that allows money generated from land sales to be used for high priority conservation, park, and trail projects. 
   The Preserve will open to the public on June 8th.
