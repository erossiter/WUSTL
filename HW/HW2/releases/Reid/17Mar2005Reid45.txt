SEN. REID WELCOMES SEN. FRIST'S WILLINGNESS TO SEEK CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  The following is a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid: 
   "I welcome Sen. Frist's pledge to me that he will not pursue the nuclear option if there are 'reasonable alternatives.' I am encouraged that the Majority Leader seeks a more constructive approach and I look forward to working with him to address this issue consistent with constitutional checks and balances. "In the meantime, I hope the Majority Leader will allow us to vote on non-controversial nominees. I hope we can continue the bipartisan cooperation that has characterized this Congress and tackle the pressing issues facing this country."
