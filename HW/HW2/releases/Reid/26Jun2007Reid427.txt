SEN. REID DISCUSSES CHALLENGES FACING NEVADA WILDFIRES
  As the devastating Lake Tahoe fire burns for a third day, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada continues working to prevent future catastrophic fires. 
   Last week U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign introduced the Wildfire Presuppression Fuels Management Act of 2007 that establishes a conservation program that helps ranchers prevent the occurrence, spread of, and damages caused by wildfire to rangeland. 
   "Nevada has had many devastating wildfire seasons and the Tahoe fire is another example of the tragedy they cause," said Reid. "In order to address this situation, Senator Ensign and I passed legislation at the end of last year which provides more than $200 million for hazardous fuels reduction in the Tahoe Basin, and additional funds for the Spring Mountains and the Carson Front. We also worked together to introduce the Wildfire Presuppression Fuels Management Act that mitigates damages from fires that occur. Fighting and preventing wildfires is a priority for Nevada and for us. Sadly, fire is an issue that this Administration has not taken seriously." 
   In recent months when Congress, under Reid's leadership, has requested additional funds to fight and prevent fires, the White House has opposed the funding. The Administration has taken this position despite the fact that firefighting and fire prevention have become one of the primary costs for land management agencies. The Forest Service, for example, spent 21 percent of its budget in 2000 on fire, but in 2008 is expected to devote at least 45 percent of total funds to fire efforts. 
   Money from legislation passed last year by Reid and Ensign will go to thin forest areas that have become too dense. This thinning helps create a more natural density of vegetation that can help prevent and slow the spread of fire. Special priority is being given to the removal of hazardous fuels in the areas surrounding the many communities in the Lake Tahoe Basin.
