SEN. REID: BUDGET AGREEMENT CUTS TAXES, BALANCED BUDGET, PUTS WORKING FAMILIES FIRST
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after Senate and House negotiators reached an agreement on a budget plan for fiscal year 2008: 
   "Democrats will pass a budget that cuts taxes for middle-class families and reflects the common values of the American people. It increases funding for critical national priorities and restores fiscal discipline by balancing our budget and creating a surplus, all without raising taxes.
   "Furthermore this budget will help ensure that Nevadans can continue to deduct state sales taxes on their federal tax returns. It also supports allowing teachers to deduct classroom expenses including qualified professional development expenses. This is important for Nevada's 22,000 teachers.
   "Our budget rejects the President's plan to cut domestic priorities and invests in working Americans, education and health care for our children, and our troops - active and retired. After running up trillions in additional debt, last year's Republican led Congress left town without even trying to pass a budget. Democrats said we could do better, and this budget proves it."
