SEN. REID: THE ESTATE TAX SHOULD NOT BE A PRIORITY IN SENATE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement after Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced he would not bring repeal of the estate tax to the U.S. Senate for a vote before the Fourth of July Recess. 
   "The Senate has repeatedly rejected repeal of the estate tax because it recognized that giving away hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest among us was the wrong priority for America. Today the Majority Leader recognized that the phony House 'compromise' would suffer the same fate for the same reason. It's time for Bush Republicans to return to the priorities of the American people."
