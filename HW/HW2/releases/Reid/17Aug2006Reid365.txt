SEN. REID: WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION TO PROTECT AMERICANS
  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on today's ruling that President Bush's domestic spying program is unconstitutional: 
   "Today's ruling is the latest example of how the Bush Administration has jeopardized our efforts in the war on terror. The Administration's decision to ignore the Constitution and the Congress has come at the expense of the security of the American people. Instead of being five years into an effective strategy we are back at square one. We now have the opportunity to take a new direction. It is time for the Administration to work with the Congress to develop effective tools to defeat terrorists. Senate Democrats stand ready to work with the Administration and Congressional Republicans toward that goal."
