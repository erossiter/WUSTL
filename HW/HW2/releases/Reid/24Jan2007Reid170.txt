SEN. REID WORKS ON BIPARTISAN LEVEL TO STRENGTHEN COURTHOUSE SECURITY IN NEVADA
  Determined to pass legislation to protect judges, Sen. Harry Reid today joined with key Senators and House Members to support a bipartisan, bicameral bill that would strengthen and expand protections for judges and their families.  
   During the last Congress, Reid took the lead on initiating the legislation and moving the process forward in the wake of a sniper style Courthouse shooting in Reno which injured Nevada District Court Judge Chuck Weller. 
   "I'm proud that, on a bipartisan basis, work is progressing to make our courthouses safer," said Senator Reid. "The urgent need for this legislation is especially important to the people of Nevada where someone attempted to take the life of Judge Weller of Reno just this past summer. I am committed to fast tracking this legislation - quickly passing this bill in the Senate and working with the House in order to get it to the President to become law." 
   Key provisions of the bill include: 
   * New criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to seriously harm judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties; 
   * Enhancing penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses
   * New resources for state courts to improve security for state and local courts; 
   * Provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges. 
   Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the panel's ranking member, teamed up with Reid, Senate Majority Whip, Dick Durbin, D-Ill. as well as Senators Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to introduce the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. Rep. John Conyers, D- Mich., the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee introduced a companion bill in the House today. The House bill is also a bipartisan measure, sponsored by Chairman Conyers, Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, D-Va., and Louie Gohmert, R-Texas.
