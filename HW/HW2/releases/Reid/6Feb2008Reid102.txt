SEN. REID UNVEILS NEW PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING NEVADA'S FORECLOSURE CRISIS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid today unveiled his latest public service announcement (PSA) to help Nevadans facing foreclosure. In the PSA Reid announces the date for his next "Mobile Resource Center," set for Monday, February 18th, at Cashman Center in Las Vegas.  
   "The Silver State is facing a foreclosure crisis that is hurting Nevadans and weakening our economy," said Reid. "In Las Vegas alone the foreclosure rate has jumped an astonishing 200 percent. But these aren't just statistics. There are people behind these numbers. These people need to know that there are reliable and credible resources out there to help them. I hope those in Southern Nevada will take advantage of the February 18 Mobile Resource Center."
  Reid's Mobile Resource Centers bring together state and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, mortgage lenders and credit counselors to provide a "one stop shopping" location where Nevadans in need can get useful advice.
  The text of the PSA follows:
