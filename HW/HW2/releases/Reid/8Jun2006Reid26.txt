SEN. REID HAILS PASSAGE OF MINE SAFETY BILL
Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today hailed yesterday's vote in the House of Representatives to pass the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, and urged President Bush to quickly sign the bill into law.  
 This bill, which Reid helped pass through the Senate on May 24, will help keep miners in Nevada and around the country safer and help prevent deadly accidents at mine sites. The legislation calls for improved safety emergency response plans for mines, sets guidelines for improved underground communications and tracking strategies, enhances mine rescue and air supply, and authorizes more federal funding for research into mine safety. 
 Reid knows the dangers of mining first hand. Growing up in the mining town of Searchlight, Nevada, he watched his father work in gold mines throughout his childhood. 
 "I know that better mine safety laws and procedures will save lives and protect families," said Reid. "We have all witnessed the terrible mine disasters of the last year, and I am very pleased that Congress is finally doing something to help. As long as I'm in Washington, I will continue the fight to improve mine safety and protect the miners of Nevada and the nation." 
 Throughout his years in Congress, Senator Reid has been a champion for miners and the Nevada mining industry. Mining is an essential industry in Nevada and employs thousands of people statewide. Reid continues to work with members from both sides of the aisle to defend responsible mining, mining families, and their communities.
