SEN. REID HOSTS ENERGY TOWN HALL
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada held a town hall meeting with Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian and Las Vegas residents to discuss the nation's energy challenges and Nevada's potential to be a leader in clean, renewable energy.  
   "It is important to invest in clean, affordable energy produced in places rich with renewable energy resources, like Nevada," said Reid. "By tapping into Nevada's wealth of solar, wind and geothermal energy resources we can create thousands of Nevada jobs, reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels and preserve our state's limited water supply."
   Reid is leading the Senate in promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy, and a clean energy economy. In June, Reid led the passage of an energy bill in the Senate that for the first time in 30 years requires cars and trucks to be more fuel efficient, to a national average of 35 MPG by 2020. At current gas prices, the energy bill will save Nevadans about $500 each year at the pump.
   During the event Reid noted his continued commitment to eliminate breaks for the big oil companies and use that revenue to pay for renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives for consumers and businesses. Reid will work hard to make sure the Senate includes renewable electricity standard and renewable energy incentives into the bill that reaches the President's desk.
