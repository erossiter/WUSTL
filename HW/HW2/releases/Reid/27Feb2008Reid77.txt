SEN. REID, NEVADA SUICIDE PREVENTION COORDINATOR DISCUSS STOP SENIOR SUICIDE ACT
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid, in conjunction with the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA (SPAN USA) and Misty Vaughan Allen, Suicide Prevention Coordinator of Nevada, spoke today about the Stop Senior Suicide Act, a bill that Reid sponsored in the Senate. 
  Nevada's rate of suicide for men and women aged 65 and older is more than twice the national average, and the highest of any state. To bring awareness to the problem and to acknowledge the memory of those that have died of suicide, SPAN USA has created Lifekeeper Memory Quilts. The Nevada quilt includes a picture of Reid's father, who died of suicide when he was 58 years old.
  "Older adults have the highest rate of suicide nationally" Reid said. "This subject not only touches Nevadans, but it touches me personally. I sponsored the Stop Senior Suicide Act as a response to this tragic problem. It will help to improve the coordination of mental health and social services, make mental healthcare more affordable for Medicare beneficiaries, and create new grants for elderly suicide prevention programs. Now is the time to take action."
  "The Nevada Office of Suicide Prevention and the Nevada Suicide Prevention Plan are dedicated to reducing the record high rates of suicide in our state," said Vaughan Allen. "We recognize Nevada's seniors as a significantly higher at-risk group. Funding from the Stop Senior Suicide Act would assist us in addressing the needs of this unique population."
