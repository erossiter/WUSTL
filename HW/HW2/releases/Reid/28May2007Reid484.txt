SEN. REID PRESENTS KOREAN WAR VETERAN WITH PURPLE HEART AT MEMORIAL DAY SERVICE
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada honored Korean War Veteran Earl Van Fleet at a Purple Heart presentation during the annual Memorial Day Service in Boulder City.  
  Reid also delivered an address to nearly 300 people. He focused on memorializing the troops who served our country and especially those who paid the ultimate price. During the speech, Reid paid a special tribute to the 38 Nevadans killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and honored the families who recently lost loved ones in the war.
   "We must not forget the price we pay for freedom, and why we pay homage to the many men and women who have given their lives so that we can be free," said Reid. "Nevada and the rest of the country have experienced many terrible losses. However, we must celebrate and honor the courageous endeavors of veterans, like Earl Van Fleet, who are with us still."
   Van Fleet was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds he received as a result of hostile actions while serving in the Army in the Republic of Korea August 31, 1951. He suffered severe gun shot wounds to the right femur, left leg, and right side of his neck, which caused his right shoulder to be paralyzed for one month. These injuries were due to battle and came from a 50 caliber machine gun.
