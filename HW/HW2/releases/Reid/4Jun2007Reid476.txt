SEN. REID: PRESIDENT MUST SHOW LEADERSHIP ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Senate Majority Leader Sen Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' letter to the President urging him to work toward international consensus on greenhouse gas emission reductions at the G-8 meeting this week in Heiligendamm, Germany: 
   "The G-8 meeting is an opportunity for the President to show real leadership and announce binding reduction targets for the United States to start implementing now - not in 2012 or some far distant future. This bipartisan letter appropriately urges the President and his Administration to work harder and more constructively at the international level to provide leadership on global warming. We cannot afford more delays in reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
