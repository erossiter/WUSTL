SEN. REID WELCOMES ROBERT POZEN'S CALL FOR TAKING PRIVATE ACOUNTS OFF THE TABLE
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement welcoming Robert Pozen's call for the president to reject private accounts in the Social Security debate:  
   "I am pleased that the inventor of the President's benefit cut proposal for Social Security has joined Democrats in calling on the President to reject private accounts. These accounts, with their deep benefit cuts and massive new debt, would weaken Social Security and leave American workers worse off. 
   "Democrats remain committed to strengthening Social Security and working to make retirement more secure for all Americans. Once we can put privatization aside, Democrats stand ready to work in a bipartisan way to save Social Security." 
   EVEN THE CREATOR OF THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN SAYS PRIVATE ACCOUNTS SHOULD GO 
   Pozen Called on the President to "Say that Carve-Out Accounts are no Longer Required." Yesterday, Robert Pozen, the inventor of the President's benefit cut plan, often referred to somewhat misleadingly as "progressive price indexing," called on the president to take private accounts off the table. "I would advise the president to say that carve-out accounts are no longer required...[Bush should indicate he is] willing to have a package that, if otherwise satisfactory, does not have carve-out accounts."
