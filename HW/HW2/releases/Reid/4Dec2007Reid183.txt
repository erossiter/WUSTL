SEN. REID, NEVADA STATE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BUCKLEY RELEASE PSA TO HELP NEVADANS FACING FORECLOSURE
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada joined with Barbara Buckley, the Speaker of the Nevada State Assembly to produce a public service announcement (PSA) to reach out to Nevadans worried about losing their homes to foreclosure. 
   "Far too many honest, hardworking Nevadans are threatened with the loss of their home," said Reid. "Speaker Buckley and I thought it necessary to reach out to them to let them know that there are places they can go and people they can talk to for reliable, credible assistance."
   "It is critical that we provide homeowners facing foreclosure a place they can turn for reliable counseling that provides them real options for refinancing, especially in light of the number of so-called counseling 'services' springing up on every street corner and in constant ads on TV," said Buckley.
   The PSA on Nevada's foreclosure crisis comes on the heels of a successful week of providing information and resources to Nevadans all across the state that are facing the threat of foreclosure. Organized by Reid and attended by mortgage lenders and credit counselors, the mobile resource center made stops in Reno, Minden, Elko, Las Vegas and Pahrump, and provided face to face counseling for those in need.
   The text of the PSA follows:
   REID:
