SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF UNLV'S FIRST PRESIDENT, DONALD MOYER
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement upon learning of the passing of Donald Moyer, the first official president of UNLV. Moyer presided over the university from 1964-1969. 
   "UNLV is the respected institution it is today because of the vision of Donald Moyer. In 1964, Don became the first official president of Nevada Southern University, now known as UNLV. He started the hotel administration program, which is recognized as one of the best in the world. He created the first on-campus housing facility, Tonopah Hall. And Don worked tirelessly to raise money for projects including the original student union, which now bears his name. I am grateful to President Moyer for all of his contributions to southern Nevada. My thoughts are with his friends and family as they mourn his loss."
