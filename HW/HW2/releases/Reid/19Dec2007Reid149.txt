SEN. REID HAILS PASSAGE OF APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada commended the passage of the omnibus appropriations bill, which included millions of dollars in funding for Nevada priorities. In addition to funding key projects, the omnibus cuts funding to the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain by more than $108 million, a 22 percent reduction.
   "This bill contains funding for important Nevada projects. Transportation, military, education, affordable housing, and health care are just some of the Nevada priorities that received funding from this legislation," said Reid. "Unlike spending bills passed during the previous Republican Congress that increase the nation's debt, this legislation is fiscally responsible and ensures the government does what every Nevada family has to: live within a budget."
