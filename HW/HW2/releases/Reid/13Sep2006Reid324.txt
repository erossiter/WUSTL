SEN. REID RECEIVES PRESTIGIOUS AGRICULTURE AWARD
  On Tuesday, September 12th, Sen. Harry Reid accepted the prestigious Golden Triangle award from the National Farmer's Union (NFU).  
   "I am honored to accept the Golden Triangle award from the National Farmer's Union," said Reid. "The concerns and interests of farmers and ranchers are of utmost importance to me. I will continue to ensure that their interests are recognized and protected." 
   The Golden Triangle is presented annually to lawmakers who exercise leadership in a variety of policy areas important to farmers and agricultural producers, including emergency farm assistance, trade assistance, mandatory price reporting, and concentration in the agricultural industry. The award is based on the NFU symbol: a triangle where "legislation" and "cooperation" form the sides and "education" forms the base. 
   Reid, a champion of the needs of rural farming and ranching community needs, has worked to pass disaster legislation, and has continued to promote fair trade and rural development. Additionally, he has consistently supported biofuel development and conservation programs. 
   NFU, comprised of 250,000 farm and ranch families with organized chapters in 26 states, is committed to protecting and enhancing the economic well-being and quality of life for family farmers, ranchers and their rural communities.
