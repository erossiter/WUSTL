SEN. REID CELEBRATES DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS' DECISION TO OPEN CLINIC IN FALLON
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, a strong supporter of the nation's veterans, announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will create a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Fallon to serve Nevada's rapid growing veteran population.  
   "Nevada is the home to more than 200,000 veterans who live across the state, including rural areas like Fallon," said Reid. "It's important that veterans, who have worked so hard to preserve our nation's freedom, receive the best medical service possible. The new clinic will be a good step towards improving veteran's healthcare across Nevada." 
   Veterans in Fallon will no longer have to travel to Reno for medical services, which will allow for a more personal relationship between the veteran and the doctor and makes it easier for follow-up for people with chronic problems. 
   The new Fallon clinic, which is slated to be operational later this year, is one of 25 new community clinics in 17 states around the country.
   Reid, a long-time champion for veterans' issues, also recently announced a $420,000 grant that will go toward providing housing and job training for veterans in Southern Nevada.
