SEN. REID PRAISES COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR NATIONAL DAY OF ACTION TO BENEFIT MIDDLE CLASS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today praised Communities United on their National Day of Action to benefit the middle class. Five years of failed economic policies have left hard-working men and women squeezed between rising prices and stagnant wages. While some have looked the other way, Reid was proud to join Communities United in fighting to make government serve the middle class.  
   "After five years of misplaced priorities and failed economic policies, America's middle class is working harder, paying more, and earning less," said Senator Reid. "Some may not be paying attention, but I am proud to join organizations like Communities United in working for change. Hard-working, middle-class Americans deserve leaders who will work for them. 
   "Whether it's raising the minimum wage, working to make health care and education more affordable, or fighting to protect the retirement security of the American people, it's time to take this country in a new direction."
