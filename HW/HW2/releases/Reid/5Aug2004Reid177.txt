SEN. REID, REP. GIBBONS WORK FOR FEDERAL AID TO REPAIR FIRE DAMAGE
  Working in a bipartisan manner for the good of Nevada, Sen.  
 Harry Reid and Rep. Jim Gibbons sent a letter to President Bush today urging him to issue a presidential disaster declaration for the recent Waterfall Fire.
   Securing this declaration would expedite Nevada's recovery from the damage incurred from the fire in and around Carson City. The text of the letter follows:
   August 5, 2004
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  President
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, D.C. 20500
   Dear President Bush:
   We write to urge you to issue a presidential disaster declaration for the Waterfall Fire that recently wreaked havoc in Nevada's capital of Carson City. Personal property losses and natural resource damages from the fire are significant and require additional financial resources to address. 
   Securing this declaration is critical to assuring Nevada's ability to comprehensively cope with the fire's aftermath. A presidential declaration would unlock the door to a wide variety of federal aid, including: aid for emergency services, direct aid to individuals, temporary housing assistance, repair of damaged homes, replacement of homes and housing construction, hazard mitigation to prevent future losses, small business loans should businesses be damaged or lost, and capital loans to help small businesses get back on their feet after a disaster.
   We urge you to work with Nevada's Governor Kenny Guinn under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. ?? 5121-5206, to expeditiously issue this declaration. This declaration will assure that the full resources of the federal government are brought to bear in Nevada's recovery from this disaster.
   Sincerely,
   HARRY REID
  United States Senator
   JIM GIBBONS
  United States Congressman
