SENS. REID, ENSIGN ISSUE STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINATION
  Statement of Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign:
   "Brian Sandoval has served Nevada well as our Attorney General, and we believe he will serve the country well as a federal judge.  
 He was an award-winning attorney in private practice. He also has a wide range of other professional experience, including his tenure in the Nevada Assembly and as Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, that will help him rule on issues that are important to Nevadans. 
   Brian Sandoval is the first Latino elected to a statewide constitutional office in Nevada. His presence on the federal bench will reflect Nevada's growing and changing population, and ensure that all our diverse voices are represented in our courts. 
   We work together to pick judicial nominees based on their character and qualifications, instead of their politics. We hope President Bush and our colleagues in the Senate will follow our lead, and work with us in a bipartisan fashion so Brian Sandoval can be nominated and confirmed."
