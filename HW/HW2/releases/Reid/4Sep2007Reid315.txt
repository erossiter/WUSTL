SEN. REID: VOTE AGAINST CONFIRMING OMB DIRECTOR SENDS SIGNAL OF OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S FLAWED FISCAL POLICY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today regarding his intent to vote "no" on confirming Congressman Jim Nussle as Director of the Office of Management and Budget: 
   "This President has presided over a period of historic fiscal irresponsibility that has seen this nation's debt grow by more than $3 trillion, much of which is owed to foreign creditors. He has turned record surpluses into record deficits by giving hundreds of billions of tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while borrowing nearly $500 billion to finance the Iraq civil war. 
   "Now, after years of rubberstamping Republican appropriations bills that exceeded his own requests by billions, the President is choosing to pick a purely political fight over less than one percent of the budget. Voting against confirming Congressman Jim Nussle as OMB Director will send a clear signal of my opposition to this reckless fiscal policy."
