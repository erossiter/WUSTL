  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued the following statement after Army Reserve officials confirmed 50 Army Reserve soldiers from Las Vegas will be sent to Kuwait as part of the Iraq war:  
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the troops from the 314th Combat Service Support Battalion and the family members they leave behind as they prepare to serve overseas. Their work will be crucial to the well-being of the 145,000 servicemen and women serving in Iraq, including nearly 300 from Nevada. I am grateful for their service and pledge to do all I can to work with the President on changing course in Iraq to ensure that our troops return home quickly and safely."
