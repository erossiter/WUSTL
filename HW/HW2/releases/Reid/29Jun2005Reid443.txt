SEN. REID WELCOMES INTELLIGENCE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "After three months of review, the White House finally announced today that it will implement most of the 74 recommendations of the Silberman-Robb commission on improving weapons of mass destruction intelligence.  
 It's about time. 
   "The Commission's analysis was a stark reminder of the badly flawed intelligence and original rationale for going to war in Iraq. The decision by the President to implement most of the Commission's recommendations, coming a day after the President's major address on Iraq, is a tacit acknowledgement of the mistakes made. 
   "But, regrettably, an important element is still missing - fixing the Administration's flawed and paralyzed policies and foot-dragging in the larger fight against WMD. 
   "On the Bush Administration's watch, North Korea has likely quadrupled its nuclear weapons arsenal, and more than a year has passed with no meeting of the 'six-party' diplomatic talks. 
   "Iran appears determined to continue its weapons program. 
   "A global effort to protect loose nuclear weapons material has faltered. 
   "And the Administration all but ensured the failure of last month's review conference of the 35-year-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by failing to exercise the leadership needed to update the treaty. 
   "While implementing the process changes called for in the Silberman-Robb report is potentially useful, ultimate success in our efforts to control weapons of mass destruction rests with the policymakers in this Administration and their policies. And unfortunately, on this score, this Administration seems unwilling to either acknowledge its failings or come forward with policies that will actually work."
