SEN. REID: SENATE MUST DEBATE CHANGING COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the upcoming debate on a Democratic Resolution to change course from President Bush's flawed Iraq policy.  
   "Democrats are united in our efforts to transition the mission in Iraq and redeploy our troops so that America can maximize the chances for success in Iraq and better fight the war on terror. Senate Republicans have thus far signaled that their only plan is to commit more men and women in uniform to policing an open-ended civil war. 
   "It is clear that a number of Senate Republicans have concerns about their Leadership's strategy of dodging a debate on Iraq. But agreeing to a debate is not enough. Republicans must heed the voices of their constituents and the overwhelming majority of Americans and vote to change the President's flawed Iraq policy."
