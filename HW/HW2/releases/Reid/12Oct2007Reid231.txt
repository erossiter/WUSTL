SEN. REID: GORE'S VISION, LONG INSPIRATION TO SENATE DEMOCRATS, NOW RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE WITH NOBEL PRIZE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the Nobel Committee awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore in recognition for his work raising awareness of global warming: 
   "I congratulate my former Senate colleague Al Gore on receiving the world's greatest honor - the Nobel Peace Prize - for his work on the planet's greatest environmental issue. We have all benefited from his vision and unique ability to focus the world's attention on the causes and consequences of global warming, and we are proud that he now has earned this well-deserved worldwide recognition. Al Gore's tireless advocacy continues to inspire me and many other Democrats to work toward curbing our reliance on foreign oil, increasing our energy independence and reduce global warming emissions."
