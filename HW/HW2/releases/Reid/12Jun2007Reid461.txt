REID CALLS FOR MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR MORE THAN 3,500 U.S. TROOPS KILLED IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following remarks today on the floor of the U.S. Senate and called for a moment of silence to honor the more than 3,500 Americans troops killed in the Iraq war: 
   "This week we have reached another tragic milestone in the Iraq war: 3,500 American troops have now been lost. Every single one of them is a hero. Every brave man and woman who continues to serve and protect us is a hero as well.
   "At a somber time like this, words betray our grief and gratitude. So I ask my colleagues to join me in a brief moment of silence to honor the memory and sacrifice of every airman, soldier, sailor and marine we have lost in Iraq and Afghanistan."
