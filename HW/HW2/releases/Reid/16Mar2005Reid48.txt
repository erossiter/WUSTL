SENATE REPUBLICANS VOTE TIME AND TIME AGAIN AGAINST INTERESTS OF AMERICAN PEOPLE
  Throughout the budget debate today, Republican Senators have thwarted the efforts of Democrats to improve the budget to better reflect the priorities of the American people. From commuter rail, to drilling in the Arctic Refuge, to paying for our priorities and supporting our veterans, the Republicans have voted no, no, no!  
   Republicans Vote No on Providing Rail Service to Millions of Americans. Senate Republicans voted no on the Byrd amendment to provide funding for Amtrak. The amendment called for an increase in funding for Amtrak by $1 billion. The amendment failed 46-52. [RC 51, S. Amdt. 158 to S. Con. Res. 18, 3/16/05] 
   Republicans Vote No on Protecting the Arctic Refuge. Senate Republicans voted against the Cantwell amendment to protect the Arctic Wildlife Refuge from drilling. The amendment failed 49-51. [RC 52, S. Amdt. 168 to S. Con. Res. 18, 3/16/05] 
   Republicans Voted Against Paying for all Tax Cuts and Spending. Senate Republicans voted against the Feingold amendment that would have reinstated the "Pay-as-you-go" rules.

   Republicans Voted Against An Amendment to Provide for the Health Care Needs of Our Veterans.

The amendment failed 47-53. [RC 55, S. Amdt. 149 to S. Con. Res. 18, 3/16/05]
