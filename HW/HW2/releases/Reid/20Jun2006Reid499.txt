SEN. REID NOMINEE APPROVED BY SENATE COMMITTEE
Sen. Harry Reid's selection for a seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Las Vegan Jon Wellinghoff, is now one step closer to confirmation.  
 The Senate Energy Committee unanimously approved Wellinghoff today, and he will now go before the full Senate for a vote. 
 Wellinghoff was recommended for the prestigious post by Reid. 
 "I was pleased to recommend Jon Wellinghoff for this job, and his nomination is an idea that has grown only better with time," said Reid in a speech to the Senate Energy Committee. "The current energy problems facing our nation and the recent verdicts in the Enron trial underscore the need for a nominee of Jon's caliber and experience. He is the right person at the right time." 
 FERC is an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, and electricity. FERC also regulates natural gas and hydropower projects. 
 Wellinghoff has an extensive background in energy issues and is known for his work to protect consumers. He has served as Chief of the District Attorney's Consumer Fraud Division in Reno, counsel to Nevada's Public Utilities Commission and a seven-year appointment as Nevada's Consumer Advocate. 
 In that work, Wellinghoff saved Nevada's utility customers more than $40 million. Jon also helped to write and enact Nevada's renewable energy requirements, one of the strongest in the nation. He is currently a shareholder in the law firm of Beckley Singleton in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he specializes in energy and consumer law. 
 "I know Jon Wellinghoff will serve Nevada and the nation with great distinction as a FERC Commissioner," said Reid. 
 Reid says he'll push for the full Senate to confirm Wellinghoff as soon as possible.
