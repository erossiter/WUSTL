SEN. REID TEAMS UP WITH CDC TO ADDRESS HEPATITIS C
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid and Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released a Public Service Announcement (PSA) on Monday to encourage people to play an active role in their own healthcare as a way to further assure their safety. The PSA is one of a number of steps officials are taking to address public concern following recent incidents where improper medical procedures resulted in thousands of Nevadans potentially being exposed to Hepatitis. 
   In the 30 second PSA, Reid and Gerberding urge Nevadans to not only continue following their doctors advice and seek treatment when they need it, but to also ask a few simple questions before receiving care. "I'm thankful that Dr. Gerberding has taken such an interest in the health and well-being of Nevadans," said Reid (link to press release). "This PSA is another step in our ongoing partnership. I'm doing everything I can to get the CDC the resources it needs to help Nevadans affected by these disgraceful medical practices and to prevent a situation like this from ever happening again. As part of this effort, Dr. Gerberding has proposed a number of questions that I would encourage patients to ask before receiving medical care."
