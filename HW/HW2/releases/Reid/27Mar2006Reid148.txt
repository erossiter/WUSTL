SEN. REID PRAISES HARD WORK OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the Judiciary Committee's passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill: 
 "We need comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, protects Americans and addresses the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living here today. I congratulate Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy and the Judiciary Committee for reporting out a bipartisan bill today that does just that. I hope Senator Frist will immediately substitute this comprehensive approach for his wrongheaded bill as the full Senate begins debate tomorrow."
