WHITE HOUSE NOMINATES REID PICK TO SERVE ON BRAC
  The White House today nominated former Rep. James Bilbray to serve on the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC).  
 Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid recommended Bilbray to the White House to serve as the Democratic Commissioner on BRAC. 
   BRAC commissioners make recommendations to the Department of Defense on how to ensure military installations are working efficiently and effectively. 
   "I am pleased the White House has moved forward on Congressman Bilbray's nomination," Reid said. "His service in Congress and his extensive expertise in national defense will make him an excellent asset on the BRAC as it conducts its important work." 
   Congressman Bilbray served Nevada and the nation during four terms in the United States Congress. That service included membership on the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. Bilbray has also served on the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, the Board of Visitors of the United States Air Force Academy, and the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He is a graduate of the Washington College of Law and is currently in counsel at Kummer Kaempfer Bonner & Renshaw, specializing in local, state and federal issues. 
   Bilbray must now be confirmed by the full Senate, which will happen in the coming months.
