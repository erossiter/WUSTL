SEN. REID JOINS TWO HOUSE MEMBERS IN PROMOTING PREVENTION FIRST ACT
  Today, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada joined with Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise M. Slaughter of New York and Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette of Colorado to introduce the Prevention First Act, legislation designed to increase access to contraception, as well as help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States.  
   "There are few more divisive issues in America today than abortion, but there is an opportunity to find common ground if we are willing to join together and seize it," said Senator Reid. "I am pleased to join my colleagues in this bicameral effort to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and the resulting abortions in America today." 
   This legislation would take a number of steps to reduce unintended pregnancies including: 
   * Increase Funding for the National Family Planning Program (Title X)
   * Expand Medicaid Family Planning Services
   * End Insurance Discrimination Against Women
   * Improve Awareness about Emergency Contraception(EC).
   * Provide Compassionate Assistance for Rape Victims
   * Reduce Teen Pregnancy
   * Ensure that Federally -Funded Programs Provide Medically Accurate Information
   Research shows, and a majority of the public believes, that providing more and better access to family planning services is the most effective way to reduce the number unintended pregnancies. Higher levels of unintended pregnancies inevitably lead to higher levels of both unplanned births and abortions.
