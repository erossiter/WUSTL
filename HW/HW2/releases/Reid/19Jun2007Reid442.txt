SEN. REID URGES PRESIDENT TO SIGN STEM CELL BILL, GIVE HOPE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today, calling on the President to sign into law S.5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act: 
   "Democrats and Republicans did the right thing when we passed legislation, based on sound science, which offers real hope to millions of Americans and thousands of Nevadans by greatly expanding scientists' access to embryonic stem cell lines. Countless Americans have been diagnosed with and have continued to suffer from debilitating diseases and conditions since President Bush vetoed this legislation a year ago, but it is not too late for the President to do the right thing today.
   "We urge President Bush to sign this bill, which expands research on stem cell lines that would otherwise be discarded, acknowledges the important ethical issues at stake and enacts stronger research guidelines than exist in the President's current policy. And because we believe that all forms of promising research should move forward, our legislation includes a provision that supports the advancement of alternative forms of stem cell research."
