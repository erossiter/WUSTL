SENS. REID, ALEXANDER PROMOTE AMERICAN HISTORY EDUCATION
  Acting on their conviction that young Americans should learn about our nation's history and government, Sens.  
 Harry Reid (D-NV) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) have passed legislation to promote civics education. 
   "Social studies and history teachers in Nevada have told me that their subjects are being affected by the No Child Left Behind Act," said Reid. "That law focuses so much attention on testing students in math and reading, there are no resources left for other important subjects like science and civics." 
   "It is time to put the teaching of American history and civics back in its rightful place in our schools so that our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American," Senator Alexander said. 
   The American History and Civics Education Act establishes Presidential Academies for Teachers of American History and Civic and Congressional Academies for Students of American History and Civics. The purpose of these academies is to strengthen teachers' and students' knowledge of American history and civics, and increase their understanding of the subject matter. 
   This legislation also authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide grants to universities, libraries, museums, or other non-profit organizations that demonstrate expertise in the core subjects of history and civics and government. 
   The Secretary is also authorized to award grants to the National History Day program. The History Day program is a year-long national program that trains educators and sponsors student competitions. The students compete on the basis of dramatic performances, imaginative exhibits, multi-media documentaries, and research papers based on an annual theme. 
   The American History and Civics Education Act unanimously passed the Senate on Tuesday. It is now on its way to the President for his signature.
