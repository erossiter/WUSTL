SEN. REID AWARDS TUSKEGEE AIRMEN CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today released the following statement upon awarding the heroic Tuskegee Airmen the Congressional Gold Medal:  
   Today Congress awards to the Tuskegee Airmen the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor it can bestow. This recognition represents a major step forward in our nation's effort to properly honor these amazing heroes of World War II. 
   As our nation was gripped in a struggle for freedom and democracy, the Tuskegee Institute, a Historically Black College in Tuskegee, Alabama, began to train African American men to fly combat aircraft. Like so many others soldiers, African American men traveled to Tuskegee from across the country to serve our nation. Unfortunately, these same soldiers were forced to fight two wars - one of against the enemy, and the other against racism and bigotry. Even while training to become pilots and serving in the Army Air Corps, airmen were forced to endure prejudice, double standards and countless other injustices. 
   Despite onerous challenges, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to excel and ultimately became the 332nd Fighter Group in the 15th Air Force. Most notably, while flying bomber escort in over 200 missions, they never lost a single bomber to enemy action. Following the war, the Tuskegee Airman continued to distinguish themselves, taking first place at the Air Force Fighter Gunnery Meet at the Las Vegas Air Force Base, Nevada; now Nellis Air Force Base, the Air Force's premier fighter training school. 
   Perseverance, sacrifice, duty and an outstanding service record are part of the lasting legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen. Because of their efforts, our nation is free and we are richer as a people. Today's ceremony is long overdue, but our nation's gratitude for the Tuskegee Airmen's service is profound.
