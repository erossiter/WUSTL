SENS. REID, ENSIGN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR NYE COUNTY HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUS
  Working to expand the opportunities of higher education to the residents of Nye County, Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign introduced legislation that would make land available for the construction of a college campus. 
   The Nye County Higher Education Campus Conveyance Act would convey 280 acres of federal land from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to the University and Community College System of Nevada for a new college campus. The Community College of Southern Nevada, Nevada State College and the Nye County School District would share the facilities. 
   "Southern Nevada is one of the fastest growing regions of the country and growth has poured over from Clark County into Nye County," said Reid. "Nye County does not have a single institution of higher learning to serve its more than 33,000 residents. A college campus will become an exceptional asset not only to the citizens of Nye County, but to all Nevadans and ultimately to the nation as a whole." 
   "The accelerated progress of Nevada's higher education system has benefited southern Nevada," said Ensign. "The college campus in Nye will give residents an accessible, unique learning opportunity that will open new doors. This is a great success for the citizens of Nye County." 
   The BLM has identified the site for disposal. Congressman Jim Gibbons (R-NV) is working on similar legislation in the House of Representatives.
