SEN. REID: WORLD NEEDS URGENT ACTION ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on a new report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that makes clear the urgent need for action to combat global warming.  
   "Today, the world's best and brightest scientists made clear that the debate on global warming is over. The world has moved beyond doubt, and now all that remains is to work urgently toward solutions. President Bush should immediately work with Congress to pass legislation that requires reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases, and he should call together the leaders of the world to obtain their binding commitment to reducing pollution around the globe. America produces by far the most greenhouse gases, and it is time for America to take the lead in combating global warming. 
   "The Congress and the American people are waiting to see how this President responds. In the past, the Bush Administration has repeatedly put special interests before sound science. The time for propaganda campaigns by Big Oil is past, and the days of the Bush/Cheney Energy Task Force are over. We cannot leave future generations with a disaster by failing to act today."
