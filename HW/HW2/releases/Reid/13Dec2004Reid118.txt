  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today on the nomination of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Mike Leavitt to serve as Health and Human Services (HHS) Director:  
   "Mike Leavitt and I have been friends for years, and I know him and his family well. I look forward to the nomination process moving forward to better understand how he would serve the country as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
   The Director of HHS has a number of responsibilities that affect the lives of Americans, from the very young to the elderly. The scope of the Department of Health and Human Services includes administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs, preventing disease, ensuring food and drug safety, providing services for low income families and older Americans, overseeing the Head Start program and programs for medical preparedness. 
   With such weighty responsibilities, serving as HHS Secretary is an important charge, and the conformation process will ensure we have the appropriate person in this role."
