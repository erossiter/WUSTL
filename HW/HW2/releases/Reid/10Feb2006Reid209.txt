SEN. REID: CONGRESS MUST COMPLETE FULL INVESTIGATION INTO ADMINISTRATION'S PREWAR INTELLIGENCE
  On the eve of the two-year anniversary of the start of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's investigation into prewar intelligence, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement:  
   "It was reported today that our government's former top intelligence officer for Middle East issues has described the troubling misuse of intelligence on Iraq by the Bush Administration to take the country to war. On the same day, we learn that Scooter Libby was directed by the Vice President and others to leak sensitive national security secrets to publicly sell the Administration's case. Evidence that the Bush White House manipulated and selectively declassified intelligence to wage a public relations campaign before, during, and after the invasion of Iraq grows every day. 
   "Now more than ever, it is critical that Congress completes a full and thorough investigation into whether this Administration did mislead the American people into a long and costly war in Iraq. This Sunday marks the two-year anniversary of the launch of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee's investigation into prewar intelligence. That investigation is still not complete. Our troops and the American people expect and deserve that this investigation be thorough and be completed so that the lessons can finally be learned and these mistakes can never happen again."
