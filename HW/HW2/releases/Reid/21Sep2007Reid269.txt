SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE $3.6 MILLION GRANT TO PREPARE NEVADA HOSPITALS FOR ANY EMERGENCY
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada announced a grant of $3,663,636 from the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare Nevada's hospitals for any public health crisis. 
   "This grant is good news for all Nevadans," said Reid. "We all know that cities like Las Vegas and Reno could be potential targets of bioterrorism, so it is extremely important that we have plans in place for any health crisis. I applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for working to make the people of Nevada safer."
   "It is vital that our healthcare facilities are equipped and prepared to treat victims in crisis situations," said Ensign. "There must be plans in place to protect residents during a large-scale emergency, and these funds will help ensure the safety of Nevadans."
   The grant will fund Nevada's Hospital Preparedness Program, a program designed to prepare for and respond to possible public health emergencies, such as bioterrorism attacks and flu outbreaks.
