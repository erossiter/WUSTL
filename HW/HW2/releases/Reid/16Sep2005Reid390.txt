SEN. REID PRAISES PASSAGE OF BILL THAT WILL MAKE NEVADA SAFER
  Sen. Harry Reid praised passage of a spending bill that will help victims of Hurricane Katrina and provide funding for the Small Business Administration, NASA, the National Weather Service and law enforcement agencies like the FBI. The Senate approved the $48.6 billion Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill last night with a vote of 91-4.  
   Reid successfully increased funding for programs designed to help victims of domestic violence and other crimes. Additionally, Reid included $1.2 million for the FBI to hire more personnel to process the backlog of pending US Citizenship and Immigration Services applications. 
   "This bill funds national programs that make a big difference in Nevada," Senator Reid said. "For example, I have heard from local law enforcement officials about the need for funding to fight methamphetamine labs, and from local social service advocates who provide legal assistance to victims of crime. The federal funding from this bill will help accomplish those goals and many others that will make our communities safer and stronger." 
   And, responding to the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Reid worked to ensure there is additional funding for the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program and the Economic Development Administration to help affected communities recover. 
   "Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to victims of Hurricane Katrina," Reid added. "The bill provides resources for those who are trying to rebuild their lives and communities with low interest disaster loans and other economic assistance." 
   Projects and agencies funding in the bill include: 
   * $800 million for low interest loans to help repair damaged homes, businesses, personal property, equipment and inventory.
