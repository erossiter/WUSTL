SENS. REID, ENSIGN APPLAUD $2.45 MILLION FOR CLARK COUNTY SCHOOLS
  High school students in the Clark County School District will receive more individual attention in smaller classes, thanks to a $2.45 million education grant announced by Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign today. 
   The Smaller Learning Communities Program promotes academic achievement through the planning and implementation of smaller classes in large public high schools. Small classes help students gain the knowledge and skills they need to make successful transitions to college and careers. 
   "Students learn better in smaller classes. They can get more individual attention from their teachers and more help toward realizing their dreams," said Reid. "I'm proud that we were able to secure federal funds for this important goal." 
   "Small Learning Communities allow students to interact more, learn more and make the grade," said Ensign, a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "This is great news for students, parents and teachers because this funding will allow schools to focus their attention on innovative programs that improve academic achievement and help achieve our goal of leaving no child behind." 
   The main objective of the project is to increase graduation rates through rigorous academic coursework and increased student achievement. Each of the five schools will utilize rigorous curriculum to prepare students for college or careers. New, innovative structures and research-based strategies will result in greater student success. 
   The U.S. Department of Education administers this grant.
