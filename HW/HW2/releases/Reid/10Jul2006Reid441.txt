SENS. ENSIGN, REID ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR RURAL AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid today announced funding to improve three rural airports in Nevada, the City of Winnemucca, City of Wells and Silver Springs airports. The grants will be disbursed through the Federal Aviation Administration to enhance safety at the three locations. 
   "These funds are necessary to improve our rural airports," Ensign said. "These funds will help secure the safety of individuals traveling to and from our rural communities, and they will also help stimulate the current and future economy of these areas."
   Silver Springs Airport will receive more than $800,000 to improve weather data collection, aircraft parking and access road improvements for airport traffic. Wells Municipal Airport will receive more than $2,000,000 to improve runway pavement and lighting to meet current airport design standards. Winnemucca Municipal Airport will receive more than $700,000 for taxiway and runway lighting needs.
   "Our rural Nevada communities are growing at tremendous rates. That means there's an increased demand for air travel," said Reid. "These grants will help our rural airports improve safety, become more accessible, and help Nevadans meet their transportation needs."
   The grants were released through the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. The program is designed to ensure that airports are able to keep up with mandatory safety requirements and other airport improvements and infrastructure.
