SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF MARINE FROM LAS VEGAS
  Sen. Reid's statement on the death of Corporal William Salazar:
   "Nevada has lost another of its extraordinary citizens. Corporal William I. Salazar, a 26-year-old Marine from Las Vegas, was killed in Iraq by suicide bombers. The bombers' cowardice is a sharp contrast to Salazar's bravery and selflessness. 
   Salazar sacrificed his life trying to bring peace to the most troubled part of the world. All Nevadans should be proud of the work he did in Iraq, and grateful for his heroism. My thoughts and prayers are with William Salazar's family and friends.
