BUSH MUST STOP ANTI-IMMIGRANT FORCES WITHIN HIS PARTY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement today: 
   "Today in Texas, President George Bush said once again that he will push Congress to come up with a rational, common-sense immigration policy. Democrats agree with the President that our immigration laws should be reformed in a way that is humane, realistic and fair and for over four years we have stood ready to work with the President to accomplish such reform. Unfortunately, the right wing of the President's party continues to put forward proposals that neither help make progress towards comprehensive immigration reform, nor help truly protect our borders. Democrats stand ready to work with the President to help advance an immigration policy reform, but we also ask him to exercise his leadership among Congressional Republicans to stop the anti-immigration forces within his party."
