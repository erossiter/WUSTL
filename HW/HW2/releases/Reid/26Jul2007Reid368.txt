SENATE SECURES $3 BILLION FOR BORDER SECURITY; SEN. REID CALLS ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO SHOW COMMITMENT TO BORDER SECURITY BY BACKING HOMELAND SECURITY BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today after the U.S. Senate voted to add $3 billion in emergency spending for border security in the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill currently on the floor: 
   "Democrats believe stronger border security is an important first step toward fixing our broken immigration system, and we will continue to work toward the enactment of comprehensive immigration reform. Tightening our borders is also one our nation's highest-priority security projects. By adding $3 billion to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for border security, the Senate is giving the President a chance to match his words with action and make America safer. 
   "The Senate demonstrated today this it overwhelmingly supports tough border security, and we hope the President shows us he shares our concern by dropping his irresponsible threat to veto the Homeland Security spending bill."
