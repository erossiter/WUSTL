SEN. REID: CONGRESS GIVES PRESIDENT SECOND CHANGE TO DO RIGHT THING, ENSURE CHILDREN GET HEALTH CARE THEY NEED
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed a new version of the CHIP reauthorization bill that Democrats and Republicans wrote together to address the concerns of those who oppose it: 
  "Democrats and Republicans have again come together in good faith to pass a responsible, fully funded bill that improves the lives of low-income, uninsured children by ensuring they get the doctor visits and medicines they need when they're sick and the checkups they need to stay well.
  "The President has manufactured phony excuse after phony excuse to mislead Americans into opposing children's health care and Republican leaders have repeatedly used procedural maneuvers to prevent enactment of this bill. Regardless, we will continue to work in good faith with the President and Republican leaders; despite their political games and misinformation campaigns, our goal remains to provide 10 million American children the health care they need."
