SEN. REID SUPPORTS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "We all believe our top priority must be to ensure that federal government never responds as poorly to a national emergency as it did with Katrina.  
 Democrats believe the best way to do this is by creating a non-partisan, blue ribbon commission of independent experts like the 9/11 commission. 
   "I do not believe that the committee proposed by Speaker Hastert and Senator Frist is in the best interest of the American people. I do not support it and, as it is currently described, I will not appoint members to it. The only way to ensure that all levels of our government are held accountable to the people is to take this process out of the hands of politicians with a vested interest in the outcome. 
   "Americans deserve answers independent of politics. I stand with Senator Hillary Clinton in supporting an independent commission modeled on the 9/11 commission. An independent investigation insulated from politics and conflicts of interest is the only way to ensure that the American people get the answers they deserve. We know America and do better. Let's get to work. Let's change the future."
