SEN. REID ANNOUNCES HIS SECURED FUNDING TO IMPROVE NEVADA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
  Working to ensure that Nevada meets its fast growing needs for a more efficient transportation system, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced today the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Engineering will receive $430,000 to conduct research on Nevada's transportation system to provide solutions to its problems.  
   This funding is possible because Reid designated UNLV as a University Transportation Center (UTC) in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) bill. The UNLV Center is the only UTC in Nevada and one of about 40 in the country. "Nevada is one of the fastest growing states in the nation, and that's great. But that growth also has an impact on our roads, especially when it comes to traffic tie-ups," said Reid. "I am pleased that UNLV is a designed UTC center. This will allow them to receive grants like this so that they continue exploring ways to keep Nevada moving quickly and safely." 
   Reid has secured millions from Transportation Appropriations bills in order to improve Nevada's transportation system. 
   The UTC program was established in 1987 to advance the Nation's transportation system through research, education and technology transfer at university-based centers. 
   The UTC program is administered by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that works to coordinate research and advance the development and deployment of technology solutions to America's transportation challenges.
