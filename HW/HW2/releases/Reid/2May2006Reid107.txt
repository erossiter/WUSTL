DEMOCRATS RELEASE DEVASTATING REPORT ON BUSH'S ENERGY POLICIES
  Oil companies are raking in record profits while consumers are struggling to pay the price of gas, and the American people are asking why. Today, House and Senate Democrats joined together to release For and By Big Oil: A Special Joint House and Senate Democratic Report. The report, a blistering critique of Bush Republican energy policies that have put Big Oil before the American people, describes Democratic plans to provide immediate relief to consumers and to put America on the path toward energy independence.
