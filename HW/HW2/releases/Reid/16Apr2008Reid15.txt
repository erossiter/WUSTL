SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON VISIT OF POPE BENEDICT XVI TO AMERICA
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement on the Senate floor today after attending a special ceremony at the White House to welcome Pope Benedict XVI to the United States: 
   "Earlier today, I was honored to help welcome Pope Benedict XVI to the United States for his first Papal visit to America. In his brief remarks on the South Lawn of the White House, His Holiness spoke of his admiration for America. His lifetime of righteousness in faith and deeds are an inspiration, not just to the more than one billion Catholics world-wide, but to those of every faith. 
   "As Pope Benedict XVI said shortly after his election three years ago - 'I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples.' Throughout my life, I have known the Catholic Church to be a deep well of comfort and aid to those in need, and a pillar of strength in times of uncertainty. On behalf of the United States Senate, Pope Benedict XVI is welcome to America with open arms and joy."
