SEN. REID: BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUST LAUNCH DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE OVER IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on news that the Bush Administration will now participate in talks with Iran and Syria about Iraq.  
   "The Bush Administration's decision to begin talks with Iran and Syria should have been made long ago. Democrats and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group have made clear for months that America must be willing to talk with all major nations in the region, including Iran and Syria, if we are ever to find the necessary political solution in Iraq. Today's announcement is a first step, but it is not enough on its own. Our national security requires a robust diplomatic effort in the Middle East, and the Bush Administration cannot again settle for mere half measures."
