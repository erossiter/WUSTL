SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX RELIEF
Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign today announced the passage of legislation that continues important tax relief for working Nevadans. As a result of legislation passed overnight, Nevadans can continue to claim state sales taxes, college tuition, and out-of-pocket expenses for teachers' classroom supplies on their federal tax returns. The bi-partisan bill also contains tax incentives for businesses conducting research and development in the U.S., and providing jobs for Americans returning to work and leaving welfare.  
 "Nevada's working families rely on this tax relief, and I'm so glad that Democrats and Republicans in Congress acted together to ensure these middle-class tax cuts remain in place," said Reid. 
 "This is great news for Nevadans and their families because this deduction can be used to help pay for their children's education, to buy a home, or to pay for a vacation," said Ensign. "This tax relief puts money back in the hands of Nevadans." 
 This is a win for tens of thousands of Nevada families. According to the IRS, in 2004, 327,500 families took sales tax deductions, 32,000 claimed tuition, and 22,800 teachers who paid for classroom supplies benefited from the deductions.
