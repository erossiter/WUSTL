SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS WILL NOT ALLOW PRESIDENT TO EVADE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HIS DISASTROUS WAR POLICY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after Republicans blocked Democrats' efforts to give our troops the resources they need while holding the Administration accountable for its failed Iraq policy: 
   "Last week, Congress gave the Department of Defense $459 billion, but President Bush says he needs billions more. So Democrats offered the President a plan to provide an additional $50 billion, provided he works with us to redeploy our troops out of a civil war, ensure our troops receive the training, equipment and rest they need. President Bush and Senate Republicans have said no. 
   "The President and his enablers in Congress are so afraid of being held accountable for this disastrous war policy, that they would rather leave our men and women in uniform empty-handed than work with us to change course in Iraq.
   "Let's be clear: The only ones threatening to cut off funding for our troops are President Bush and Congressional Republicans. In the coming weeks Democrats will continue to push the President and Senate Republicans to do the right thing: and not hold America's troops hostage due to their stubborn refusal to change course; or as shields to escape being held accountable for this failed war policy."
