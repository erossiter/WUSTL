SEN. REID STATEMENT ON NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today released the following statement in celebration of Women's History Month.  
   "Women's History Month is as an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the historic contributions and accomplishments made by women. This special month also serves as a catalyst for change - a call to action to ensure that future generations are empowered - so women and men can continue to make strides towards a more egalitarian society. 
   "For far too long, women and their valuable contributions have been overlooked, especially in politics. This last election changed that. Americans made history by electing a record number of women to the Senate and by making Nancy Pelosi the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. This is a far cry from the way things were when I entered the House in 1983, when only 22 women served in that chamber. Now there are 71 and 3 delegates. The Senate has also made great strides. When I began serving in 1987, there were only 2 women. Today, there are 16. 
   "We've made big accomplishments in my home state of Nevada as well. Nevadans not only reelected Assemblywoman Barbra Buckley, they made her the first female Speaker of the Assembly in Nevada history. When I first served in the Nevada State Assembly in 1969 there were only 4 women. Today, 13 women are serving in the Assembly and five of them hold leadership roles. 
   "While I am proud of the accomplishments we have made in Nevada and across the country, there is more work ahead to ensure equality, especially in the area of fair compensation. But because of trailblazing women like the ones I've mentioned, future generations of young women will have greater chances of becoming the strong and respected leaders they want to be."
