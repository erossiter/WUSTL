DEMOCRATS CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS ON IRAQ
  Leading Senate Democrats sent the following letter to President Bush after his Administration failed to brief the Senate today on the current situation in Iraq and recently delivered an inadequate quarterly report to Congress. The letter calls for the Bush Administration to reinvigorate its consultation with Congress and to provide better information on Iraq.  
   In the first five months of this year, cabinet officials have appeared only sporadically before the Senate to discuss Iraq, and the Administration's most recent quarterly report to the Congress on Iraq ("Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq") failed once again to present a clear and objective picture of what is happening in Iraq. Given the recent escalation of violence and increased threat to U.S. forces, regular and comprehensive briefings are more important than ever. 
   The text of the letter, signed by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Assistant Democratic Leader Richard Durbin, Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Carl Levin, and Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Joe Biden, is below.
