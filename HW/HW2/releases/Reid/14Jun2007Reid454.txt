SEN. REID: REPORT SUPPORTS DEMOCRATS' EFFORTS TO INCREASE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to the attached report released by Securing America's Future Energy that outlines global energy security as it affects the United States: 
   "This report by Securing America's Future Energy is on the mark as we work to make our nation safer by reforming its energy policy. Our energy security and national security increasingly overlap, and each day that we continue to rely on Middle East energy is one more day we remain vulnerable to that region's volatility.
   "Democrats are moving forward with legislation that will make us more energy independent and strengthen our national security and economy. It is our hope that our Republican colleagues will work with us on completing this important first step and to develop bold, innovate and sensible ideas to reduce our dependence on oil."
