SEN. REID WINS FUNDING FOR GEOTHERMAL POWER RESEARCH
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has included funding for research and development of geothermal power in next year's federal budget, in spite of the Administration's efforts to kill the program.  
   Reid is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. Today the subcommittee approved a bill that provides millions for geothermal power research. "I'm pleased we were able to resurrect the geothermal power program from the dead," said Reid. "This bill has $22.5 million for geothermal power research and development. This is very important to my state, because Nevada is the Saudi Arabia of geothermal power. It's also important to the country that we continue researching renewable energy sources, and moving toward energy independence." 
   Some new, preliminary work suggests geothermal power has great potential, and could power a significant part of the increasing demand for energy in Nevada and across the West. 
   President Bush's budget proposal for fiscal year 2007 had removed all funding for geothermal power research. Reid worked to reinstate it in the FY '07 Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. That bill will go before the full committee on Thursday.
