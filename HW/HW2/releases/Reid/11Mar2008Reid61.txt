SEN. REID: ADMIRAL FALLON'S RESIGNATION MORE EVIDENCE THAT BUSH ADMINISTRATION SILENCES OPPOSING VOICES
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to news of U.S. CENTCOM Commander Adm. William J. Fallon's resignation: 
   "I am concerned that the resignation of Admiral William J. Fallon, commander of all U.S. forces in the Middle East and a military leader with more than three decades of command experience, is yet another example that independence and the frank, open airing of experts' views are not welcomed in this Administration.
   "It is also a sign that the Administration is blind to the growing costs and consequences of the Iraq war, which has so damaged America's security interests in the Middle East and beyond. Democrats will continue to examine these matters very closely in the coming weeks and months."
