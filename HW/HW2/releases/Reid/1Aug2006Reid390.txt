SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON CUBAN DICTATOR FIDEL CASTRO
  With Cuban Dictator Fidel Castro having ceded power to his brother Raul under unusual circumstances, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement.  
   "When Fidel Castro dies, it should not simply be the end of the Fidel era, it should be the end of the Castro era. The Cuban people deserve to be free. The Cuban regime must once and for all tear down its oppressive system and make its long overdue transition to democracy. It is time for the Bush administration to offer a real plan to help the Cuban people finally get the freedom they deserve. In addition, we need to continue supporting those who have been leading the call for democracy and freedom within the island."
