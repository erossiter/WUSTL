SEN. REID ANNOUNCES GRANT TO FUND CRISIS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MASTERS DEGREE AT UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS
  Today, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada announced a grant from the Department of Homeland Security to fund a new Masters Degree program at the Greenspun College of Urban Affairs on the campus of the University of Nevada Las Vegas. $442,776 will be awarded to the UNLV Department of Public Administration to fund an advanced Masters of Science Degree in Crisis and Emergency Management. The money will come from the Department of Homeland Security's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Career Development Grant program, a program expressly designed to advance careers in the Homeland Security field.  
   "I'm really glad to see that the Homeland Security Department has awarded UNLV this grant," said Reid. "Already at UNLV we have some of the best Hotel Administration, Engineering, and Fine Arts programs in the country. Now, with this program, we can work to expand that prestige into other areas that will help protect the people who live and work in our state."
   "We are extremely grateful for the support this grant provides," said Christine G. Springer, director of UNLV's Executive Master of Science in Crisis and Emergency Management (ECEM). "Working closely with our partners the Institute for Security Studies, the ECEM program is one of only a few national programs to offer an executive graduate degree in this field. This grant will enhance our current program by attracting the next generation of future Homeland Security professionals to serve our state and the nation. UNLV is now uniquely positioned to provide these students with the state-of-the-art research skills, educational tools and methodologies necessary to address natural, intentional, and technical disasters."
