SENS REID, ENSIGN, REP. HELLER, ANNOUNCE NEARLY $500,000 IN FUNDS FOR RENO FIREFIGHTERS
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada and Representative Dean Heller today announced that a $490,768 federal grant has been awarded to the Reno Fire Department. The funding will be provided through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.  
  "Last year, there were more than 1250 wildfires in Nevada, burning over 1.3 million acres of precious rangeland and forests," said Reid. "Nevada's firefighters not only battled fires in our state but they also traveled to other states like California to help fight against the recent devastating fires. It is critically important that we support these model citizens and provide them with the funding that will enable them to continue protecting Nevada."
  "Over the last several years, we have all witnessed the devastation that fires can cause," Ensign said. "These additional resources will help firefighters keep residents of the Truckee Meadows safe from this dangerous threat."
  "Fire Departments are often the first to arrive in crisis situations. Providing them with the resources necessary for training is vital when every second counts. First responders are critical to the safety of every community and I am pleased this funding has been made available to the Reno Fire Department," said Heller.
  The purpose of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is to enhance the ability of first responders to effectively protect the health and safety of the public, as well as personnel, from fire hazards.
