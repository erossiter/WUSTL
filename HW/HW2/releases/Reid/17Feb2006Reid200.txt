SEN. REID: BUSH PREACHES TO CHOIR IN TAMPA
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the president's speech today:  
   "In his latest appearance before handpicked supporters, the president today called on the American people to just trust him with our nation's security. Trust him on Iraq. Trust him on domestic spying. And trust him on preparing and protecting America for terrorist attacks and natural disasters. Unfortunately, more than five years of incompetence have failed to protect the American people and have eroded the president's credibility. We need more than tough talk and rhetoric. We need real leadership that will make 2006 a year of significant transition in Iraq, will finally take the necessary actions to protect Americans from terrorism here at home, and will speak honestly about the challenges we face."
