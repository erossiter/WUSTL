SEN. REID: BUSH REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC POLICIES FAIL MIDDLE CLASS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on new economic numbers that show the continuing failure of Bush economic policies.  
   "While some investors may be reaping the rewards of record high stock market, today's jobs numbers show workers are still hurting in the Bush economy. It's because the President and the Republican Congress haven't done enough to help everyone get ahead. Under their economic policies, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and the middle class is getting squeezed. 
   "President Bush may be 'pleased' with what his economy has done, but hard-working families know America needs a new direction. The American workforce is second to none. We work hard. We produce. And on a level playing field, we can't be beat. It's time for Washington to quit stacking the deck against America's workers and their families. We need leaders who will fight for the middle class, which starts by creating good jobs that pay."
