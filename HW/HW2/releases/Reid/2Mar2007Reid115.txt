SEN. REID DEMANDS SENATE REPUBLICANS NOT BLOCK CRITICAL 9/11 LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement demanding Senate Republicans put the security needs of the American people ahead of the political needs of President Bush and drop their plans to block legislation to implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.  
   "The same President that initially opposed the Department of Homeland Security and initially opposed the 9/11 Commission has signaled that he may oppose to the most sweeping improvement to America's homeland security in the past several years. Unfortunately, it seems that Senate Republicans are again standing by his side. Twice already this year, Senate Republicans have chosen to give a green light to escalate the war. Now, in yet another effort to provide political cover for the President, they are threatening to block the 9/11 bill. 
   "It is shocking that, after making the world more dangerous through their inaction and indifference, the President and Senate Republicans would even consider filibustering or vetoing a bill that would make America more secure. The President and Republicans in Congress have asked the American people to wait six years for the security they deserve. It is time for Republicans to stop carrying water for the President and start working to make America more secure. The American people deserve the tough and smart homeland security policies that will keep them safe, and Democrats will implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. We hope Senate Republicans will forgo their threats to block this bill and instead join us in making America more secure."
