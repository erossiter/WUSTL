SEN. REID: WE MUST END CUTURE OF CORRUPTION IN REPUBLICAN WASHINGTON
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on Congressman Tom DeLay's decision not to seek a return to Majority Leader of the House of Representatives:  
   "Tom DeLay bears much of the responsibility for the culture of corruption Republicans have created in Washington, DC, but his removal from House leadership alone will not end the pervasive cronyism and corruption that he and Washington Republicans created. His decision is a victory for the all those who believe in honest government. Much more must be done to reform Washington and create a government as good as its people to focus on the American people's priorities and not the special interests." 
   DeLay Abandons Post Despite Bush's Full Confidence in Him. In an interview on Fox News, President Bush expressed his full confidence that Tom DeLay would beat his money laundering charges. "I hope that he will, 'cause I like him, and plus, when he's over there, we get our votes through the House." [Fox News, 12/13/05]
