SEN. REID SAYS BUSH STILL HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  While President Bush admitted in interviews today that he may raise taxes in order to privatize Social Security, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement urging the President to address questions about how much his plan for private accounts will cut benefits and drive up the debt: 
   "While I welcome President Bush's candor to the Social Security debate, too many unanswered questions remain about his privatization plan. As he continues to push for private accounts, I hope the President will come clean about how much benefits will be cut and how much debt will be accumulated under his plan."
