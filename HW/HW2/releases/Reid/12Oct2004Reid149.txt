SEN. REID'S BILL TO HELP DISABLED VETS WINS FINAL PASSAGE
  Sen. Harry Reid's proposal to end an unfair tax on 100 percent disabled veterans is on its way to the White House to be signed into law, after passing both the House and Senate this weekend.  
 The proposal is included in the FY 2005 Department of Defense Authorization Bill, which was unanimously approved by the Senate yesterday. 
   The proposal will help an estimated 40,000 veterans whose disability benefits have been deducted from their earned military retirement pay. 
   "This amendment has a widespread Congressional support," said Reid. "It got unanimous approval in the Senate earlier this year. I am very hopeful that both Houses will pass the Conference Report by the end of the year." 
   Reid has been fighting for years to end the ban on "concurrent receipt," a policy that deducts disability payments to veterans from the military retirement pay they earned. 
   Last year Reid succeeded in winning a 10-year phase-in of full retirement pay to all veterans who are 50 percent to 100 percent disabled; any veteran who sustained combat-related injuries; Purple Heart recipients regardless of their degree of disability; and to national guardsmen and reservists who were previously left out of the earlier compensation programs. 
   Reid's new amendment will provide full pay to severely disabled vets immediately, instead of phasing it in over 10 years. The cost of the amendment is estimated to be under $1 billion over 10 years. 
   "When a combat-related incident completely disables a retired member of the military, they shouldn't have to wait the 10 years to get the retirement pay they have earned," said Reid. "Our veterans have sacrificed to keep us safe, and we need to support them immediately."
