SEN. REID RENEWS COMMITMENT TO PROTECT NEVADANS' SOCIAL SECURITY
  Today, Sen. Harry Reid rallied with members of Congress, Nevada seniors, community leaders, and other concerned citizens about the importance of protecting Social Security from being privatized.  
   "I am proud to be here today, standing up - with Nevadans - to protect retirement security," said Reid. "Nevada has a large number of baby-boomers who are looking forward to retiring and we need to make sure they can do so with the confidence that Social Security will be there for them. That's why it's so crucial that we strongly oppose the privatization of Social Security to protect one of the most important and successful programs in U.S. history. I'm fighting for a new direction that brings retirement security and retirement dignity to all Nevadans." 
   Today's event kicked off a new nationwide "Golden Promise" campaign to call on members of Congress to sign a pledge to oppose efforts to privatize the critical program. Several Nevadans also attended the event, including President of the Nevada Alliance for Retired Americans, Scott Watts, of Minden and Michael Aupperle, from Las Vegas. Both are concerned about Social Security's future. 
   "We're opposed to the privatization of Social Security, and Senator Reid's opposition to the administration's privatization plan shows that he's committed to protecting the retirement future of all Nevadans. We're with him 100 percent, because he's 100 percent with us," said Watts.
   "Social Security is a critical program, because millions of people in this country depend on it. We have to do everything we can to protect it from privatization. Senator Reid has continuously worked hard for the senior citizens of Nevada, and for that, we appreciate him," said Aupperle.
