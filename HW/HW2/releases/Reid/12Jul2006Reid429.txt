DEMOCRATS WIN SWIFT ACTION ON STEM CELL LEGISLATION
  A day after the Senate Democrat Leadership called on him to make House passed stem cell legislation (HR 810) the next bill debated in the U.S. Senate, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today agreed and announced the legislation will be considered by the Senate on July 17th and 18th. With today's progress on legislation that holds the promise of cures for diseases impacting millions of Americans, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement. 
   "I am extremely pleased Senator Frist has agreed to Democrats' request to take up stem cell legislation next week. The American people have waited long enough for the United States Senate to act on this potentially life-saving legislation. Despite his frequent promises, Senator Frist waited for over a year after the House of Representatives passed the bill before even agreeing to bring it to the Senate floor. There is not another moment left to spare."
