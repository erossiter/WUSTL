SEN. REID URGES WHITE HOUSE TO COME CLEAN ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY CUTS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "When it comes to cutting Social Security benefits, this White House is wearing two faces. In public, the President says he will protect Social Security benefits. But in secret memos to right-wing supporters, his advisors are revealing a very different plan.
   "The American people deserve to know the truth about the President's intentions and should not be learning about them from shadowy memos. Social Security is America's promise to those who work hard and play by the rules that their retirement will be secure. If, as this private memo indicates, the President is intent on breaking this promise - and his own public pledge - by cutting benefits, he needs to stand up and tell the American people himself about his plan, when it will go into effect, who will be affected and how much benefits will be cut."
