SEN. REID DISCUSSES ENERGY POLICY THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS, ENVIRONMENT, NATIONAL SECURITY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada held a news conference today with his Senate Democratic colleagues to discuss their energy package that will increase energy independence, strengthen the economy, reduce global warming emissions and protect consumers.  
   "Our legislation will dramatically increase American-made and grown renewable fuels production, reducing our dependency on unsustainable and volatile petroleum supplies from around the world," Reid said. "This is good news for Nevada, a state that has tremendous renewable solar, geothermal, and wind resources. Having access to these resources would position Nevada as a leader in our country's renewable energy efforts and create 3,200 new jobs." 
   Reid reaffirmed his commitment to punish gas price-gougers, make the government a model of energy efficiency, increase our supply of biofuels, and quickly bring clean and affordable renewable fuels to market. 
   Senate Democrats also unveiled a new Web site - www.democrats.senate.gov/energy - an online information center that will provide important updates in the coming weeks as Reid and his Democratic colleagues hold energy forums across the country and legislation moves through Congress.
