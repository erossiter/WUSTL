SEN. REID RESPONSE TO DOE REPORT REGARDING YUCCA MOUNTAIN EMAILS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement in response to a report by the Department of Energy regarding the Yucca Mountain email scandal.  
   "The Energy Department said it hopes this report puts the USGS email scandal to rest. Far from it. This report only highlights the fact that senior managers of the Yucca Mountain project were out of touch and failed to do their jobs. This is unacceptable when you consider the fact that we are talking about 77,000 tons of the most dangerous substance known to man. 
   "This is only one area of the Yucca Mountain project. One only has to wonder what else may have slipped through the cracks as a result of the DOE's admitted lack of leadership. 
   "If the Energy Department thought this report would make people feel better about Yucca Mountain, it is sorely mistaken."
