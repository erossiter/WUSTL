SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON GROUNDBREAKING OF MARTIN LUTHOR KING JR. NATIONAL MEMORIAL
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement on the groundbreaking of the Martin Luthor King Jr. National Memorial.  
   "As the ground was broken for the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial today, Americans had the opportunity to witness the shaping of an important chapter our nation's history. This memorial will provide visitors to our nation's capital with the opportunity to honor the rich life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   "The groundbreaking is especially poignant for the countless Americans involved in our nation's civil rights movement because it pays homage to the non-violent struggle that forever transformed our country. While more than 40 years have passed since Dr. King shared his dreams of hope, freedom, justice, and equality with the world, his vision continues to inspire us all. It is my hope that the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial will serve as a reminder that all Americans deserve to be treated with human dignity and are entitled to the pursuit of happiness. 
   "Our great nation has made tremendous progress in its appreciation and inclusion of the diverse talents and contributions of all Americans. However, there remains a considerable amount of work to be done before Dr. King's vision is fully realized. The Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial reminds us all that together we can transform Dr. King's dreams into a reality."
