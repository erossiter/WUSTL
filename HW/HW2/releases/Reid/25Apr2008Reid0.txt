SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS LEAD SUPPORT OF AMERICA'S VETERANS, YOUNG, OLD
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed the Veterans Benefit Enhancement Act, 96-1: 
   "At a time when 150,000 men and women are serving our country bravely in Iraq, providing for our veterans is one of our most important responsibilities. This long-overdue bill provides for, supports and honors America's veterans, both young and old.
   "Democrats have led the way to expand eligibility for traumatic-injury insurance and specially adapted housing benefits to veterans with severe burns. We are also increasing benefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-job training programs, and restoring veteran status to Filipino veterans who served under U.S. command during World War II.
   "While we are pleased with the important support we are giving our veterans, this bill should have been completed long ago. After a 94-0 procedural vote and a 96-1 final vote, it is clearer than ever that Republicans' stalling for the sake of stalling does nothing but waste the American people's time."
