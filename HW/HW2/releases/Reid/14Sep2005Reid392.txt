SEN. REID CALLS FOR AIRLINE PENSION PROTECTION
  Sen. Harry Reid today expressed dismay that fuel costs pushed two of the nation's largest airlines into bankruptcy.  
 He also expressed support for immediate action on airline pension legislation to save pensions for workers across the nation: 
   "While the Bush Administration has done little to solve our energy crisis which accelerated the Delta and Northwest bankruptcy filing, Congress has an immediate opportunity to pass legislation enabling both companies to keep pension plans for workers in place. We must not sit by and do nothing while thousands of hard working Americans' retirement security is at risk. 
   "I encourage Senator Frist to join me in a bipartisan agreement to bring up this month the pension reform proposals passed by the Finance and HELP Committees that include airline pensions. Airline workers and all American workers need to have confidence in their pensions and look forward to a secure retirement."
