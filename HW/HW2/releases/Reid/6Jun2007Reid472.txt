SEN. REID: D.C. DESERVES FULL REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, met with Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty and members of the D.C. Council to discuss Senate efforts to give Washington, D.C., residents full voting representation in the House. Reid made the following statement during the meeting: 
   "It is wrong that the residents of the District of Columbia are denied the right to full voting representation on the House. They pay taxes, serve in the military, and deserve the same vote in the House as all other American citizens. If we can send young Americans to fight for democracy in Baghdad, the least we can do is ensure democracy in the shadow of the United States Capitol.
   "I commend Senator Lieberman for his leadership on D.C. voting rights, which he supports not for parochial reasons but because he is a champion of democracy. And I admire Mayor Fenty's energy and Congresswoman Norton's stalwart advocacy for the people of the District of Columbia on this important issue, which I look forward to bringing to the Senate floor."
