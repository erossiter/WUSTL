SEN. REID RECEIVES AWARD FOR SUPPORT OF DIABETES ISSUES
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada was presented with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's "Children's Congress Hero Award" for his continued support to find a cure for type 1 (juvenile) diabetes. 
  JDRF's Nevada Delegates Megan Christensen, 14, (Las Vegas), Anna Ressell, 13, (Sparks), April Welsh, 12 (Australia), and Jordan Exber, 14, (Las Vegas) told Reid what its like to live with diabetes. They also thanked Reid for his leadership on efforts to expand the President's embryonic stem cell research policy. The House and Senate recently passed S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The President is expected to veto that legislation this week.
   "Children and teens with diabetes go through life with a constant threat of devastating complications," said Reid. "The young Nevadans I met with today shared their touching stories about what it's like to have diabetes. The thought of these children having to prick their fingers day in and day out has made me that much more committed to support causes that give hope of a cure". 
   Reid is working to reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research and Native Americans. The first program supports research toward a cure for Type 1 diabetes, and the second is focused on type 2 treatment and prevention strategies targeted at Indian and Alaska Native populations. The program currently provides $150 million per year for each part of the program. 
  Congress created this program in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act and reauthorized it again in 2000 and in 2002. Reid supported these efforts.
