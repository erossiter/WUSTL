SEN. REID RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement in response to the final State of the Union Address given by President George W. Bush. 
   "President Bush said some good things about issues that are important to the people of Nevada, now I hope he will work with Congress to produce meaningful results. I believe that, by working together, we can do good work for Nevada and the nation, but it takes a willing partner.
   "Nevada families are struggling to get by. High home foreclosure rates, growing unemployment, rising gas prices, and sky-high health care costs are just a few of the things that are squeezing Nevada's middle class. To address these challenges, the president must stop playing political games and start working with Congress to forge the solutions people need.
   "I was pleased to hear the president talk about the importance of reducing America's dependence on oil - one that has only grown under this administration. President Bush can play a key role in an energy revolution that reduces our reliance on oil and other fossil fuels while creating jobs, protecting our air, and strengthening our national security. I believe that if the president works with us, Nevada can become the world leader in renewable energy.
   "I look forward to working with President Bush in the final year of his presidency on real solutions that will make a difference in the lives of all working Nevadans."
