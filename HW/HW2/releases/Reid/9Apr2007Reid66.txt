SEN. REID WELCOMES BUSH ENGAGEMENT ON IMMIGRATION, CAUTIONS ON NEED TO CLARIFY DETAILS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks on immigration reform:  
   "Senate Democrats agree with President Bush that we must pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill this year. The overwhelming majority of Americans want to reform our broken immigration system so that we can improve our border security and bring millions of undocumented workers out of the shadows of our society. 
   While preliminary discussions with the White House have revealed many areas of bipartisan agreement, Democrats do have concerns about the workability of several elements of the administration's recent draft proposals to members of Congress. To win the support of Senate Democrats, a comprehensive immigration bill must be tough, fair, and practical. 
   We look forward to working closely with the President on this issue of mutual concern when the Senate takes up legislation the last two weeks of May."
