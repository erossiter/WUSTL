SEN. REID SECURES FUNDING FOR IMPORTANT NEVADA WATER PROJECTS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada led the passage of a bill that will improve and maintain important flood control projects, and address critical water supply and quality needs, as well as restore ecosystems. 
   "These projects are important to our state, especially for residents in rural and Northern Nevada," said Reid. "This legislation will help create more effective water systems and keep our economy strong. The massive growth our state has experienced demands continued support of crucial water infrastructure programs and projects like these."
   The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) reauthorization bill has received wide support from Nevada community leaders. Under Reid's leadership, WRDA will contain the following projects for Nevada:
   * Rural Nevada Program - Increases the program funding level to $150 million for existing and future projects enabling rural communities to meet their water supply and quality needs. Population growth and a lack of water supply have created a serious need to rehabilitate old structures and reconstruct and create more efficient and affordable water systems. In Northern Nevada, an acre-foot of water, which is enough to supply a family of four for one year, costs as much as $40,000 - $50,000.
   * Truckee Meadows Water Authority - Provides $10 million for water system improvements to the Glendale Dam Diversion Structure. This project is critical to improving the flow of the Truckee River and stabilizing the river's ecosystem by replacing the 30 year old Glendale Diversion Dam structure with a more permanent structure. This will improve water flow and efficiency and create a more dependable water supply to the recipients downstream.
   * Huffaker Hills Reservoir Conservation Project - Provides $13.5 million for construction of water infrastructure improvements to the Huffaker Hills Reservoir. Currently, the bottom of the reservoir is earthen and results in a loss of 40 percent of the water that is stored. Lining the reservoir will result in immediate water savings helping the Washoe County Department of Water Resources stretch the water supply to meet the demand of a growing population.
   * Highland Canal - Mogul Bypass Pipeline Project - Provides $13 million to construct a water conservation project for the Highland Canal - Mogul Bypass in Reno. The Highland Canal, which has existed for over 120 years, delivers water to the Truckee Meadows Water Authority's Chalk Bluff Water Treatment Plant in northwest Reno. This project will help eliminate leakage losses from unlined canal sections estimated at approximately 580 acre-feet per year.
   * Clean Water Coalition - Provides $20 million for wastewater infrastructure, specifically for the Systems Conveyance and Operations Program (SCOP), which will ensure that treated waste waster is properly discharged into the Las Vegas Wash and Lake Mead. This project will ensure water quality in Lake Mead for recreation, wildlife, and consumption. The SCOP is an effort to plan for growth and increasing wastewater effluent for decades to come and to restore some of the Las Vegas Valley's most treasured natural resources.
   * Clark County Wastewater Infrastructure - Provides $50 million for the most critical wastewater infrastructure needs in Clark County.
