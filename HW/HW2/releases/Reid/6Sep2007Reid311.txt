SEN. REID LEADS SENATE PASSAGE OF MILCON BILL THAT SUPPORTS VITAL MILITARY AND VETERANS PROGRAMS
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and his colleagues in the Senate celebrated the passage of the Military Construction and Veterans Administration Appropriations Bill which will increase funding of military and veterans programs. 
    "Today, the U.S. Senate passed a critical Appropriations Bill that improves military facilities all across Nevada and improves veteran healthcare by providing new facilities and additional funding for mental health programs," said Reid. "Congress has a responsibility to provide funds for important veterans programs, especially during a time of war. I will continue to do all I can to ensure Nevada veterans and veterans throughout the nation are taken care of."
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Administration Appropriations Act provides necessary funding for Nevada's veterans, including $341 million for an all new Veterans Hospital and Medical Center in the Las Vegas valley. In the coming years, the Veteran population in Nevada is expected to grow 50 percent. Many of those veterans move to Las Vegas to retire in a place with a warm climate and relatively low taxes. In order to maintain and improve the quality of care for our veterans, this hospital is critical. 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Administration Appropriations Act also provides for the improvement of military infrastructure throughout Nevada. 
   * At Nellis AFB, $4.95 million is allocated for six advanced training simulators that are critical to the training of Air Force personnel 
   * At the Nevada National Guard complex in Reno, $5.2 million is allocated for an all new Vehicle Maintenance that will replace their smaller and outmoded facility. 
   * At the Fallon Naval Air Range, $11.6 million is allocated to build two new towers and enhance training capabilities there. 
   * At the Hawthorne Army Depot, $11.8 million is allocated for a new ground water treatment system to ensure the residents of Hawthorne have clean drinking water. Additionally, $1.4 Million is allocated for improvements to the Wabuska Rail Line that serves the Hawthorne Army Depot.
