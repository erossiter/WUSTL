SEN. REID: WE NEED BIPARTISAN COOPERATION TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on today's release of Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports. 
   "Today's report confirms that, despite White House scare tactics, Social Security remains sound for decades to come. The real threat to Social Security comes from Republicans, most of whom support and voted for privatizing Social Security. Instead of working to dismantle Social Security, we should join together to strengthen both Social Security and Medicare to build a secure retirement for all Americans."
