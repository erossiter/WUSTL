SEN. REID: SHOSHONE FUNDS FINALLY COMING TO THE COMMUNITY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced today that the Department of Interior will enact regulations so that Shoshone Indians will finally receive some compensation for what they and their ancestors lost.  
   "I am pleased that the Department has finally issued this rule," said Reid. "These rules and the eventual payment of funds come too late for many elders, but I am pleased that progress has been made to right some of the many wrongs done to the Western Shoshone people living in my state of Nevada and the Great Basin area." 
   In 1979, federal courts awarded individual Indians over $26 million as compensation for the United States taking tribal land in California and Nevada and removing minerals from that land. In related proceedings, the Court of Federal Claims awarded nearly $1 million to various Western Shoshone tribes for federal accounting inaccuracies. The funds now total nearly $160 million to be distributed under the new rule to individuals and $2 million used for educational purposes. 
   The Department will hold public meetings in Reno and Las Vegas and at various reservations in Nevada and California. Reid will continue to support efforts to implement the Claims Distribution Act and ensure that thousands of eligible Shoshone Indians are informed about the distribution process.
