SEN. REID MEETS WITH GORE TO DISCUSS ENERGY, CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met today with former Vice President Al Gore to discuss ways to make Nevada and the nation more energy independent while also protecting the environment.  
   "Nevada has an abundance of renewable resources which will help our state become a leader in clean energy and can help reduce our country's reliance on oil and other polluting fuels" said Reid. "I was pleased to meet with former Vice President Gore to discuss how we can work together to address the issue of global warming. I admire his leadership and greatly respect his dedication to raising awareness of this issue. I am hopeful that this Congress and the Bush Administration can move forward on legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. " 
   Under the proposed Senate Democratic budget, which is currently under consideration by the U.S. Senate, Reid and his Democratic colleagues have included provisions to make the country more energy independent by investing in clean alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. 
   Reid advocates adding $400 million to the President's FY08 request for energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs. Increasing the federal investment in renewable energy could create approximately 3,000 jobs in Nevada. 
   The FY08 Senate Budget Resolution includes a reserve fund for energy legislation to expand production and use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles, promote renewable energy development, improve electricity transmission, encourage responsible development of domestic oil and natural gas resources, and reward conservation and efficiency. 
   Reid remains committed to reforming energy policy and ensuring that the nation moves in the direction of energy independence. 
   Gore was on Capitol Hill today to testify before House and Senate committees on climate change.
