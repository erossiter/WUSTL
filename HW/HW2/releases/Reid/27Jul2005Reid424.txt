SEN. REID CALLS HOUSE ACTION ON CHINA A SHAM
  "House action today on China trade legislation is a sham and nothing more than political cover for House Republicans to vote in favor of the flawed CAFTA trade agreement that the American people have rejected."  
   "There is little prospect that the legislation will move anywhere in the Senate as both the Bush administration and Senate Republican leaders have resisted similar legislation and have given no indication that they are willing to move the House bill or anything like it. "We do not need more rhetoric when it comes to U.S. policy towards China. America needs a coherent and comprehensive policy to address the rise of China, something the Bush administration has failed to offer. An empty gesture by House Republicans will not fill the void of leadership and will not fool American workers, businesses, and farmers. America deserves better."
