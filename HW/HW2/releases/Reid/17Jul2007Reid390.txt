SEN. REID: NEW INTELLIGENCE REPORT UNDERSCORES NEED FOR OVERHAUL OF BUSH ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS ON TERRORISM, CHANGE IN IRAQ STRATEGY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to publication of the unclassified key judgments of a new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on "The Terrorist Threat to the US Homeland":  
   "The unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate released today leads me to two conclusions: one, the Bush Administration's national security strategy has failed in its most basic responsibility - to capture or kill Usama Bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri, the men who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks, and eliminate Al Qaeda as a threat to the homeland; and two, there is even greater urgency to the need to change course in Iraq.
   "The NIE is just the latest report assessing that Al Qaeda has rebuilt its strength to nearly pre-9/11 levels and that the greatest threat we face to the US homeland comes from Al Qaeda's senior leadership apparently based in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions, not from Iraq. Since 9/11, terrorist attacks around the world have dramatically increased in number, Al Qaeda has rebuilt safehavens, and new extremist groups have been inspired by Al Qaeda to further extremist causes and conduct deadly attacks.
   "The NIE also demonstrates that the current situation in Iraq has helped to energize Al Qaeda. Changing our strategy in Iraq and narrowing our military mission to countering Al Qaeda terrorism - as a bipartisan majority in the Senate now favors - would be the single greatest thing we could do to undermine Al Qaeda's ability to use Iraq as a recruiting and propaganda tool fueling the growth of regional terrorist groups.
   "It is a travesty that Osama bin Laden remains at large nearly six years after the 9/11 attacks, and that the Bush Administration and most Congressional Republicans remain stubbornly wedded to a flawed strategy in Iraq. We need to adapt, not stand still. I urge the Bush Administration and Congressional Republicans to work with Democrats to overhaul and improve our counterterrorism and Iraq strategies."
