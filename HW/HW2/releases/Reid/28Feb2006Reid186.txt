SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS REMAIN COMMITTED TO TOUGHER LOBBYING RULES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today after the party-line vote in the Senate Rules Committee to reject Senator Dodd's amendment, based on the comprehensive Honest Leadership Act cosponsored by 41 Democrats.  
   "Democrats have spoken at length, and for months, about the need for comprehensive reform in Washington. Today's party-line vote in the Senate Rules Committee to reject the Honest Leadership Act demonstrates that not everyone in Congress is ready to take that step. The current proposal simply does not go far enough to put tough new rules on lobbying, but I am pleased that at least some effort at reform will move to the Senate floor. Democrats would have preferred to strengthen the bill while it was still in Committee, but we are committed to working for real reform when it is considered by the full Senate."
