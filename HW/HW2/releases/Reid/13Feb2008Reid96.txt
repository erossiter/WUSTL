SEN. REID: STIMULUS WILL HELP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STRUGGLING IN UNCERTAIN ECONOMY
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today after President Bush signed the economic stimulus package into law: 
  "The bipartisan plan the President signed today will help millions of Americans who are struggling in an uncertain economy. Congress promised to act quickly and effectively to help those who need it most, and this law represents a promise kept to the American people.
  "I am proud that it was Senate Democrats who insisted that this plan to strengthen the economy include 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans. But we have much more to do in the long term because many more Americans still need our help. We will continue fighting for those who have lost their jobs in the Bush economy and small businesses suffering in a looming recession. We will fight for families struggling with rising energy prices and a national housing crisis. And we will fight to reverse President Bush's disastrous budget policies that have hurt the middle class."
