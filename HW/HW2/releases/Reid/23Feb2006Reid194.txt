SEN. REID: WHITE HOUSE REPORT IS LITTLE COMFORT FOR KATRINA'S VICTIMS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the Bush Administration's report on failures by the federal government before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina.  
   "This is far from the hard-hitting, independent analysis promised by the President and demanded by Senate Democrats. It is, regrettably, an understated and often-times self-congratulatory report written by those who were part of one of the most damaging and disturbing government failures in our history. By not holding anyone accountable for the Administration's failures, the report provides little comfort to the millions of Katrina victims and it does little to convince the American people that the White House has taken the steps necessary to ensure we are better prepared for and able to respond to the next national emergency that may befall this nation. We need an independent commission to honestly and thoroughly investigate the widespread failures during Katrina and to ensure that they never happen again."
