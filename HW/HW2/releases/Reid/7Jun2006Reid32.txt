SEN. REID: SENATE MUST UNDERSTAND NSA SPYING PROGRAM BEFORE LEGISLATING
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on reports that Senate Republicans have acceded to Vice President Cheney's request not to obtain testimony from top phone company executives about the facts of the domestic spying program. 
   "The interference by the Vice President in the Senate's efforts to conduct oversight of the White House's domestic spying program is deeply troubling. Just as disturbing is the fact that Senate Republicans have once again decided to deny the American people real oversight of the Administration's actions."
   "Before the Senate debates legislation to govern surveillance activities, the Administration should provide the Senate and the American people a full and complete understanding of the programs' legality, scope, and effectiveness."
