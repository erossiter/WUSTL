SEN. REID: WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION TO PROTECT AMERICANS
  As President Bush continues his weeklong media campaign to convince Americans that they are safer today than before September 11th, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "Today the President once again tried to convince Americans that he's taken all the steps necessary to keep them safe. Unfortunately, the facts of the last five years aren't that convincing. Five years after 9/11, the President still has not taken the necessary steps to prevent terrorists from taking explosives onto airplanes. Five years after 9/11, al Qaeda has morphed into a global franchise operation, terror attacks have increased sharply across the world and the President has shut down the program designed to catch Osama bin Laden."
   "Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, said this week that that the Iraq war has depleted our resources and distracted the Bush Administration from making homeland security a priority. These failures demonstrate that the lessons of 9/11 are being ignored by the White House and the Do Nothing Republican Congress. We must change course in Iraq, and implement the bipartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations so that we are doing all we can to protect Americans at home and abroad."
