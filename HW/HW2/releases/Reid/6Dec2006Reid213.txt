SEN. REID: IRAQ STUDY GROUP MAKES CLEAR PRESIDENT MUST CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement on the new report by the Iraq Study Group.  
 "The Iraq Study Group has done a tremendous and historic service to the American people and to the troops serving in harm's way in Iraq. Their report underscores the message the American people sent one month ago: there must be change in Iraq, and there is no time to lose. It is time for the Iraqis to build and secure their nation, and it is time for American combat troops to be redeployed. 
 "Each day the situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Nominee Robert Gates said 'we're not winning.' Today, the Iraq Study Group said Iraq is 'grave and deteriorating.' Like the Iraq Study Group, I urge the President to change course. He will find Congress ready and willing to work with him. The Senate will do its part next year and conduct strong oversight to ensure the President carries out an effective change in policy. Our troops in Iraq, including hundreds of Nevadans, have sacrificed so much. It is time for President Bush to reward their effort by bringing the country together around a new way forward."
