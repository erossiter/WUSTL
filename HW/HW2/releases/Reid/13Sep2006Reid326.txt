SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS SHOULD STOP BLOCKING TAX EXTENDERS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement after Bush Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of critical tax extenders.  
   "American families and businesses are paying the price because this Do Nothing Republican Congress refuses to extend important tax breaks. Families who just recently took their sons and daughters to college now wonder whether the tuition deduction that Republicans allowed to expire last year will get reinstated. Teachers, forced to reach into their own pockets to provide supplies for their students, now wonder why Republicans refuse to extend the modest tax break they get for doing so. Instead of holding such important tax provisions hostage to ill-fated estate tax giveaways to multi-millionaires, Republicans should join Democrats to pass these measures today. Middle-class Americans deserve a new direction, where they will not be forced to endure a tax increase because of Republican inaction and obstruction."
