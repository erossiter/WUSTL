SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ROBERTS' NOMINATION
  The following is a statement by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid: 
   "All this talk about whether Democrats will support the Roberts nomination is laughably premature. The hearings have not even begun. The White House has so far refused to produce relevant documents, and the documents we have seen raise questions about the nominee's commitment to progress on civil rights. 
   "John Roberts must still persuade the Senate and the American people that he is a worthy replacement for Justice O'Connor and the jury is still out on that."
