SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. ATTORNEY BOGDEN'S LAST DAY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement on U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden's last day of service.  
   "As Dan Bogden prepares to leave his post as the United States Attorney for the District of Nevada, I applaud his exemplary service to our state. Mr. Bogden is a former Washoe County Deputy District Attorney and also worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for ten years before being appointed as Nevada's chief federal prosecutor in 2001. Under his leadership, the U.S. Attorney's Office has prosecuted many dangerous criminals and resolved a number of important civil cases. Throughout his career, Dan Bogden has strived to make our communities safer and I appreciate all the remarkable work he has done. 
   "Mr. Bogden is one of several federal prosecutors across the country who have been unfairly forced to resign by the Department of Justice. At least one was fired to make way for a Karl Rove protégé. 
   "A little known provision slipped into the USA Patriot Act reauthorization would allow the Bush administration to replace Mr. Bogden with someone who has no Nevada ties and without Senate confirmation. In response, I am supporting a bill to close this dangerous loophole and preserve the independence of United States Attorneys. This bill has already been voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting action by the full Senate. The position of United States Attorney is too important to be politicized. We must pass S. 214 to ensure that the people of Nevada have a say in who will be our next U.S. Attorney."
