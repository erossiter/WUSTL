SEN. REID ADVOCATES FOR PRESERVATION OF COWBOY, FOLK CULTURE
  Today, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with Charlie Seemann, Executive Director of the Western Folklife Center in Elko, and James Billington, the Librarian of Congress to discuss Elko's annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering and papers that the American Folklife Center recently uncovered related to folk singer Woody Guthrie.  
   "I am committed to preserving cultural heritage and promoting access to valuable historical resources," said Reid. "Folklife is an important part of Nevada's culture and this nation's history, and the Western Folklife Center plays a key role in promoting public awareness and enhancing appreciation. I'm truly grateful for the Center's hard work to help honor the rich cowboy spirit still alive in our state." 
   Seven years ago, Reid helped pass a Senate resolution establishing Elko's annual cowboy gathering as the official "National Cowboy Poetry Gathering," which Seemann oversees in Elko each year. Reid has also cosponsored legislation to designate July 22nd as "National Day of the American Cowboy". 
   Reid is a fan of Woody Guthrie's folk music.
