SEN. REID: WE CAN DO BETTER THAN LEAVING WORKING FAMILIES OUT IN THE COLD
  Today, Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement upon the Senate's failure to pass emergency heating assistance to working families:  
   "I know that we can do better than leaving working families out in the cold this winter. Sadly, the Senate has failed again to provide these families with the emergency assistance they will need to heat their homes. With record high gas prices and heating prices expected to break new records this winter, the time to act is now. We will continue to press the Senate to do the right thing for working families." 
   Democrats Fought to Provide Additional Assistance to Help Working Families Heat Their Homes. Senate Republicans rejected an amendment to provide $3.1 billion in emergency funding to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This funding increase would have restored the program that helps working families meet their heating bills from the cut in the Bush budget. The amendment, which required 60 votes was rejected 53-46. [RC 261, S. Amdt. 2077 to H.R. 3058, 10/20/05]
