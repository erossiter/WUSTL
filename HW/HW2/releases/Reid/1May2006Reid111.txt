SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON COVER UNINSURED WEEK
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement to mark "Cover the Uninsured Week," a nonpartisan initiative to raise awareness about the millions of Americans who lack health insurance.  
   "This week is Cover the Uninsured Week, a chance for all of us to put aside our political differences and work to solve the health care crisis facing America today. The numbers are staggering. 46 million Americans lack health insurance, and more than 8 million of them are children. It is simply unacceptable for anyone who works hard, pays taxes, and plays by the rules to go without decent health care, but eight in ten uninsured are from working families. In America today, too many can't access the care they need and can't afford the care they can find. 
    "Cover the Uninsured Week is a chance for all of us, whether Democrat or Republican, to redouble our efforts to solve this terrible problem. The Senate will soon begin to debate health care reform legislation, and I pledge to do all I can to make health care more accessible and more affordable for the millions of Americans who need it."
