SEN. REID WORKS TO HELP NEVADA RECOVER FROM WILDFIRES, DROUGHT
  Thanks to Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, help is on the way for Nevadans dealing with the effects of two devastating wildfire seasons. Nevada has suffered severe agricultural losses from floods, drought, and wildfires in the past two years. 
   Reid worked to include language in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that would allow livestock producers to receive compensation for losses in the 2007 calendar year due to wildfires that occurred in 2005 and 2006. The bill passed both houses of Congress on Thursday and is headed to President Bush for his signature.
   "In Nevada, more than 3 million acres were burned by wildfires in the last two years, creating untold damage to critical rangeland," said Reid. "Nevada needs this money, and it needs it as quickly as possible. That's why I'm doing everything I can to expedite the process to get this funding into the hands of the farmers, ranchers, and first responders who need it the most."
   For livestock producers who suffered wildfire damage to their private land and those who face public allotment closures due to wildfire damage, it could be years before rangeland is suitable for livestock grazing.
   The funding in this bill will help to cover increased feed costs, repairs to fences and the expense of rehabilitating private fire-damaged rangelands.
