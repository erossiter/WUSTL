SENS. REID, ENSIGN, REP. HELLER ANNOUNCE $2.3 MILLION IN FUNDS FOR FERNLEY
  Nevada Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign and Congressman Dean Heller welcomed the approval of $2.3 million in funds to help with disaster relief efforts in Fernley, Nevada. Reid, Ensign and Heller announced $1,735,120 in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved $622,800 in federal low-interest disaster loan assistance. Together, this provides more than $2 million to help all those living in Lyon County affected by the severing flooding there earlier this month. 
   "This is very good news for the Fernley residents whose lives have been turned upside-down by this terrible flood," said Reid. "I appreciate how quickly the federal government has responded and how much people have come together to help get these residents back in their homes as quickly as possible."
  "FEMA's swift action and continued support for the residents of Fernley is appreciated because it will help families and the community recover," said Ensign. "Whether it's rebuilding a home, restoring damaged property or recuperating a lost business, Nevada's local officials and FEMA are working together to ensure a smooth, quick and successful process and this funding will go long a way toward that goal."
  "Flood victims are working through considerable difficulties to get their lives back. This much needed assistance will help place Fernley residents on the path to recovery. I will continue to work with the Nevada delegation to ensure Fernley residents have the necessary resources available to restore their community," said Heller.
