SEN. REID: RISING GAS PRICES UNDERSCORE NEED FOR STRONGER ENERGY POLICY
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to the Department of Energy's prediction that the average price of a gallon of gasoline from April to September will be $3.05:  
   "As the DOE's Energy Information Administration predicts that gasoline prices will remain more than $3 per gallon throughout the summer, this Democratic Senate is moving ahead with energy legislation that will lower energy prices, increase fuel efficiency of cars and trucks, strengthen national security and the economy, and protect the environment.
   "In six years, President Bush has done nothing to curb skyrocketing prices, instead giving tax breaks to oil and gas companies even as prices have doubled and oil company profits have soared. If President Bush and Senate Republicans truly care about lessening our dependence on oil, they will work with us to pass an energy policy that saves Americans money and makes them safer."
