SEN. REID INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO HELP NEVADA TEST SITE WORKERS
  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada offered an amendment to the DOD Authorization Bill that would grant compensation to workers who contracted cancer while performing their duties during nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. It would designate Test Site workers as members of a Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). This designation would guarantee all eligible individuals prompt compensation and medical assistance, while eliminating the many obstacles they currently face when trying to receive treatment. 
   "These Nevadans sacrificed their health to help the United States win the Cold War," said Reid. "The very least we can and must do in return is compensate them for their dedication to America's security. We can't wait any longer to acknowledge their efforts and sacrifices."
   Last year, Reid helped NTS workers who were employed between 1951 through 1962 receive SEC designation. That represents only about a third of all claimants. For that reason, Reid's amendment would extend the SEC through 1993.
   Reid is committed to helping Cold War veterans by providing them the compensation they deserve and the medical benefits they need.
