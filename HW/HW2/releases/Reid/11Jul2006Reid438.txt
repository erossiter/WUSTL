SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEFENSE DEPARTMENT GENEVA CONVENTION DIRECTIVE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the announcement by the Department of Defense that it will now apply the Geneva Conventions to all prisoners in military custody. 
   "In the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush Administration political appointees overruled the advice and judgment of professional military lawyers and established a badly flawed detainee and military commission system that was at odds with American values. Nearly five years later, the results are clear: not a single detainee has been tried and brought to justice and the U.S. reputation has been badly tarnished internationally. The system was in desperate need of repair, and the Supreme Court recognized that fact."
   "The Defense Department's decision that it renounces the Bush Administration's flawed policy is a positive step forward. While we need to see the specifics of how the Pentagon intends to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, it appears the Pentagon may finally be getting back on course. This is a welcome development, and hopefully, it will allow us to finally get on with the business of bringing to justice those responsible for acts of terrorism and violations of the laws of war and restoring our integrity around the world."
