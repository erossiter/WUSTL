SEN. REID: BUSH MUST DROP THREAT TO BLOCK HEALTH COVERAGE FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to President Bush's comments this morning repeating his threat to veto renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program: 
   "Democrats and Republicans came together to create the Children's Health Insurance Program 10 years ago, and we are coming together again to reauthorize and improve it before it expires in 10 days. But President Bush - who ran on the promise to enroll millions of more children in CHIP - is going back on his word and irresponsibly threatening to deny kids in working families the care they need.
   "Congress is working to send the President a strong, bipartisan reauthorization. I call on President Bush to drop his veto threat and listen to the 43 Governors, 68 Senators and a vast majority of the American people who know we must improve the lives of millions of American kids."
