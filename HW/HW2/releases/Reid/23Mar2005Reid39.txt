SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY TRUSTEES' REPORT
  Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement in response to the new report issued today by the Social Security Trustees:  
   "Today's report confirms that the so-called Social Security crisis exists in only one place: the minds of Republicans. In reality, the program is on solid ground for decades to come. We need to address the program's long term challenges, but it would make no sense to cut Social Security's funding by diverting payroll taxes from the Trust Fund, as Republicans have proposed. Under that proposal, Social Security would be insolvent 11 years earlier, in 2030. The Republican proposal also would require deep cuts in benefits and a massive increase in debt."
