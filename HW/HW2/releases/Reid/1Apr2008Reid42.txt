SEN. REID RECEIVES AWARD FROM AMERICAN LEGION
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid was presented with the Nevada American Legion Award to recognize his leadership and tireless efforts to ensure that veterans receive the care they need and deserve.  
   "I am honored to receive this award from the Nevada American Legion," said Reid. "For years, I have made it my mission to fight for the benefits our veterans, servicemen and women, and their families deserve. I am glad that Senate Democrats were able to provide the Veterans Administration with the largest budget in its history. I will continue to leverage my position as Majority Leader to ensure our veterans receive the retirement and health care benefits they were promised when they enlisted. It's the right thing to do and anything less is an injustice."
   Over the past year, under the leadership of Reid, Senate Democrats passed the largest budget in the history of our country for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which included $341 million for a new Veterans Administration hospital in Southern Nevada.
  The American Legion was founded in 1919, and this award was created to honor Senator Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for providing the Veterans Administration with the largest budget in its history.
