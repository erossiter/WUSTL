SEN. REID WELCOMES SPRING VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL CHOIR
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today welcomed the 19-member Spring Valley Madrigals high school choir for a performance in the U.S. Capitol. In appreciation of their performance, Sen. Reid arranged a private tour of the Capitol building for the group.  
 "It's always a pleasure to spend time with Nevadans who have taken the time to visit with me when they come to Washington, but this visit was extra special," said Reid. "These talented students are a reminder that there is no better investment for Nevada's future than creating world-class schools." 
 The choir group, who also performed for other members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation, were in Washington to sing at a White House reception.
