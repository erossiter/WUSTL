SENS. REID, ENSIGN LAND BILL WILL BENEFIT NEVADA RESEARCH
  The Desert Research Institute would expand its capacity for scientific research under legislation being sponsored by Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign.
   Reid testified at a hearing today in favor of their legislation to convey the Dandini Research Park to the University and Community College System of Nevada.
   "It is important that we help this institution grow and prosper," said Reid. "DRI conducts important environmental research that improves our lives throughout Nevada and the world."
   Commenting on the committee hearing, Senator Ensign added, "The research being performed at DRI has a particularly high value to Nevadans, which is why it is essential we make certain it can continue to move forward to meet market demands."
   This legislation will allow DRI to expand its Northern Nevada Science Center and advance its important scientific research in Nevada. As the Western United States continues to grapple with extended drought, DRI must continue to provide policy makers with the scientific information they need to manage scarce water resources in arid lands.
   The University of Nevada system will expand the DRI facility through the involvement of a private developer who will build and finance the expansion and then lease it back to DRI. This bill would convey the property from the Bureau of Land Management to the University and Community College System of Nevada.
