SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS TOUGH, SMART SOLUTIONS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement after the Republican Congress rejected tough, smart, and bipartisan legislation that would have finally brought terrorists to justice:  
   "Five years after September 11, not a single terrorist has been brought to justice under President Bush's flawed policies. The Senate Armed Services Committee produced bipartisan legislation supported by America's uniformed military lawyers that would have ensured the President has the tools he needs to fight terrorism and would have finally brought the accused masterminds of 9/11 to justice. It is regrettable that the Republican Congress has rejected this tough and smart plan to give the American people the real security they deserve."
