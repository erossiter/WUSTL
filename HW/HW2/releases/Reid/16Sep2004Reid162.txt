SENS. REID, ENSIGN SECURE $13 MILLION TO PROTECT, PRESERVE LAKE TAHOE
  Continuing their fight to protect and preserve a Nevada treasure, Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign have secured $13 million for Lake Tahoe projects. 
   The funds are included in the fiscal year 2005 Interior Appropriations bill that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, and now heads to the Senate floor. This money is in addition to the $37 million from the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act Special Account approved for Lake Tahoe projects in August.
   "Since Senator Ensign came to the Senate, he and I have been working tirelessly to protect and restore the beauty of Lake Tahoe," said Reid, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. "This bipartisan effort is delivering funds to reduce fire risk, preserve water clarity and improve the health of the entire Tahoe Basin."
   "Senator Reid and I have worked very hard to ensure that the environmental health and the unsurpassed beauty of Lake Tahoe are maintained for generations," Ensign said. "These funds will continue to protect the lake and the surrounding communities so everyone can enjoy the pristine, blue jewel in the Sierras." 
   Specific funding for Lake Tahoe is as follows: 
   * Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects $4 million 
  * Road Decommissioning/Trail Improvement $2 million 
  * Land Acquisition $2 million 
  * Vegetation and Watershed Management $5 million 
  * TOTAL $13 million.
