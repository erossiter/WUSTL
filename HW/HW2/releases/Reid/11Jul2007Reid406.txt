SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS AGAIN FAIL TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement today in response to Republican efforts to defeat two bipartisan amendments to enhance military readiness:  
   "Republicans had two opportunities today to match their words with action and support the soldiers who are risking their lives in Iraq and bearing the burden of this open-ended civil war. But they instead demonstrated that they do not care about rebuilding our badly overextended military, nor about ensuring our troops have the time to properly train, prepare for and recover from battle.
   "At the same time they claim to support the troops, a vast majority of Republicans lacked the courage of their convictions to even bring Senator Webb's and Senator Hagel's readiness amendments to a vote. Democrats remain committed to repaying in some small measure the sacrifices our brave troops are making every day; given ample chances to do the same, Republicans today proved they are more committed to protecting the President rather than protecting our troops."
