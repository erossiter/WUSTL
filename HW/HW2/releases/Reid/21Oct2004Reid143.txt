SEN. REID ANNOUNCES $556,000 FOR AMERICORPS GROUPS IN NEVADA
  Service groups in Nevada will provide more volunteers through AmeriCorps thanks to several grants announced today by Sen.  
 Harry Reid.
   Four centers in Nevada will receive separate grants totaling $555,909 that will provide monthly stipends to volunteers who are members of AmeriCorp, a nationwide service network that engages more than 50,000 Americans each year in education, public safety, health, and the environment.
   The organizations that received funding are:
   * Family Resource Center of Northeastern Nevada, Elko, NV - $84,710 
   * Parasol Community Foundation, Incline Village, NV - $124,000 
   * Boys and Girls Club of Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV - $124,000 
   * ComputerCorps, Carson City, NV - $223,199 
   "These people give their time and energy to serve our children, the hungry and families in trouble," said Reid. "This money provides for service-workers where Nevada needs them most."
