SEN. REID: AMERICANS NEED ALL THE GAS PRICE PROTECTION THEY CAN GET
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on today's release of an FTC report on gas price gouging and manipulation. 
   "If today's FTC report proves anything, it's that federal investigators don't have the tools they need to protect the American people from gas price gouging. It should not take an act of Congress to start an investigation into price gouging by oil companies. Today's report makes clear that we should pass Senator Cantwell's federal price gouging bill. With gas prices sky high and oil company profits at record levels, Americans deserve all the protection they can get. Democrats have offered the Clean EDGE Act because America can do better. The Clean EDGE Act is a comprehensive plan that will help find and stop price gouging while putting America on the path to energy independence."
