SEN. REID ASKS HOMELAND SECURITY DIRECTOR TO INTERVENE IN SARKISSIAN FAMILY CASE
 Sen. Harry Reid called on the Secretary of Homeland Security to personally intervene on behalf of Las Vegas teenagers Emma and Miriam Sarkissian.  
 The young women have found themselves in the middle of a complicated and confusing situation regarding their immigration status. Their father is a legal resident and it was only recently, while trying to comply with INS regulations, the girls discovered their residency status had been denied more than 10 years ago.
   The Sarkissian family contacted Senator Reid's office for help, and he has been following the unique case closely. Today Reid called Tom Ridge and asked the Secretary to personally help the girls who are in this position through no fault of their own.
   "I asked Secretary Ridge for his personal attention in this terrible situation," Senator Reid said. "There are extenuating circumstances in the case of these young girls, and I stressed to him that we need to make sure there is a fair outcome.
   "He was very receptive and agreed to take a look at the case. We should be working toward family unification, not ripping families apart, and that's what I told the Secretary. I am hopeful he will straighten out this mess."
   "The outpouring of sympathy from the Las Vegas community on behalf of these girls has been overwhelming," Reid added.
   Reid and his staff will continue to pay close attention to the situation, which they expect to be resolved in the coming days.
