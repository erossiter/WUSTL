SEN. REID ANNOUNCES $275 MILLION TO FIGHT WILDFIRES
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today announced $275 million in additional funding for federal agencies to fight wild land fires. The funding, for the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, will prevent the need to borrow money from programs providing other crucial services out West.  
   More than 1000 separate wildfires have damaged over 1.4 million acres in Nevada-putting Nevada in second place for the amount of land that has burned. The fires have threatened property, lives and disrupted land management, grazing and outdoor recreation. 
   "This $275 million for the forest service and the BLM will go a long way toward not only protecting our land and our people," said Reid, "but it will also prevent borrowing from other important, non-fire accounts that would slow down other vital programs like noxious weed treatments and university grants." 
   1.7 million acres were burned last year in Nevada and this year is on track to break last year's record number of acres burned. The country is also likely to break last year's record of total acres burned in wildland fires. So far this year - 7.5 million acres have burned; last year - 8.6 million -the most since national records began in 1960.
