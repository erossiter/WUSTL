SEN. REID: CONGRESS MUST HELP VETERANS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today in response to a new study that found one in four of our nation's homeless is a veteran: 
   "The war has stretched the VA dangerously thin, and veterans are paying the price. A new study out today finds that one in four of our nation's homeless is a veteran, and Nevada has the fifth-highest rate of homeless veterans in the country. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is on the rise, and with it rising social costs like substance-abuse, homelessness and divorce rates. The number of uninsured veterans is skyrocketing and veterans struggle to find jobs when they come back. Our nation owes these men and women the best health care and services available when they return from war. 
   "But Senate Republicans continue to play politics with crucial funding for veterans. First, they voted to delay the VA funding bill by stripping it from a combined bill to fund Labor-HHS-Education and Military Construction-VA programs, jeopardizing the chances of having the bill signed in time for Veterans' Day. Then, despite its $228 million for veterans' employment programs, $23.6 million for homeless veterans programs, and $3.4 billion for substance-abuse and mental-health programs vital to veterans, 19 Senate Republicans flip-flopped and voted against the conference report on the Labor-HHS-Education funding bill. Senate Republicans should put the interests of veterans ahead of partisan politics and their loyalty to President Bush, and they should work with Democrats to pass these crucial bills."
