SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CAROLYN O'CALLAGHAN
  Sen. Reid Statement on the Passing of Carolyn O'Callaghan
   "Carolyn O'Callaghan died today of a broken heart. She and Mike were lifelong companions and their separation was much for her to bear. Like Mike, she had been taking care of me since I was a young teenager and has been a meaningful part of my life for fifty years. I mourn her passing today, and my heart and prayers go out to the O'Callaghan children. But I believe there is peace and comfort to be found from the knowledge that Mike and Carolyn are once again reunited."
