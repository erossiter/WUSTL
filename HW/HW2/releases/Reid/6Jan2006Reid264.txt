SEN. REID: WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS
  With the release of December's jobs report today by the Department of Labor, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement:  
   "Today's jobs report shows that the mixed performance of the Bush economy continues for working Americans. Job creation remains anemic, millions of Americans still struggle to find a job and wages continue to fall farther and farther behind. 
   "Democrats will not rest until we address stagnant wages and rising costs for health care, gas, college tuition and home heating that are putting a squeeze on middle-class families. We need to create an economy that works for all Americans. Democrats will push to end the culture of corruption in Washington that puts the special interests before the people's interests. We can do better."
