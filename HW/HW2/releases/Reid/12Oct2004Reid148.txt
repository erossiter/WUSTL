SENS. REID, ENSIGN SECURE $20 MILLION FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM TRAINING IN NEVADA
  Working to keep Nevada and America safer, Sens. Harry Reid (D-NV) and John Ensign (R-NV) have secured $20 million in the federal budget for counter-terrorism training programs at the Nevada Test Site.  
 The funding is included in the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. A final version of the bill passed the House and Senate this weekend, and is now on its way to the White House to be signed into law. 
   "The Nevada Test Site is one of the country's leading training centers for police, firefighters, and other emergency workers who would respond to a terrorist attack," said Reid. "The Test Site is doing vital work, and this funding will allow that work to continue. Nevada has always played a key role in our national defense. Now we're leading the way in the war on terror, too." 
   This is the second year in a row that Congress has set aside $20 million for the Nevada Test Site. The unique geography and infrastructure at the Test Site allow for the operation of a wide range of counter-terrorism training programs. 
   "While preparing for a terrorist attack is a grave matter, Nevadans should feel proud that the premiere anti-terrorist training center is at the Nevada Test Site," Ensign said. "These funds will allow our military personnel and first responders to continue the work that will deter America's enemies and keep us all safer."
