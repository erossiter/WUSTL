SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN
  "My first visit to the Oval Office was when I met Ronald Reagan. It is a day I will never forget. I saw first hand President Reagan's class and his charm-trademark qualities he would carry with him throughout his life.
   "Though we were of different political parties, and didn't always see eye to eye, he was always a gentleman to work with who was pragmatic in his approach to governing the United States.
   "Ronald Reagan was a kind and gracious man, and at the same time, a man of grit, determination and true leadership. He served his country the way he lived his life."
