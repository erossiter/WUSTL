SEN. REID MEETS WITH LINCOLN COUNTY STUDENTS HONORING OUR TROOPS
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada met with 33 elementary school students from three different Lincoln County schools. The Nevada students were in Washington to honor our troops by placing wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery as members of Wreaths Across America, an organization dedicated to "remembering, honoring, and teaching the value of freedom." 
   "It was such a privilege to meet with these Nevada students," said Reid. "Their work to honor our military gives me great faith in the future of our country. I am so proud of all of these students."
  The 33 Nevada students were from Caliente, Panaca, and Pioche Elementary Schools. This was the first trip to Washington, D.C., for all 33 students.
