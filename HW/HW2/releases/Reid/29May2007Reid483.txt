SEN. REID: SUDAN SANCTIONS A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to newly announced sanctions against Sudan: 
   "I am pleased that President Bush finally ordered new U.S. economic sanctions on Sudan. The situation in Darfur, already one of the most pressing humanitarian and security issues facing the world today, is rapidly growing worse. Under the watch of the Sudanese government, militiamen continue to commit genocide against the civilian population.These sanctions are a step in the right direction to hold the Sudanese government accountable. The United States must play a leadership role in the effort to prevent the further loss of innocent civilian life in Darfur."
