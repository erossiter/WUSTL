SEN. REID: CONGRESS GIVES PRESIDENT OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY FUND TROOPS, CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement as Congress sent the Emergency Supplemental conference report to the President: 
   "As we close one of the deadliest months of the war in Iraq and the State Department reports that terrorist attacks have dramatically increased, the reality on the ground in Iraq and around the world proves what we all know - the Iraq war is not making America more secure and a change of course is needed. Today we renew our call to President Bush: There is still time to listen to the American people, fully fund our troops and change course in Iraq. This bipartisan bill does just that. A veto means denying our troops the resources and strategy they need. After more than four years of a failed policy, it's time to remove our troops from an open-ended civil war and for Iraq to take responsibility for its own future.
