SEN. REID: SENIORS CONTINUE TO PAY FOR COST OF CORRUPTION IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM
  As the Bush Administration continues to fail to adequately address the the cost of corruption that seniors across the country are paying in the prescription drug program, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement. 
   "It is astonishing that in his State of the Union Address President Bush failed even to mention the problems his prescription drug program has caused for seniors and people with disabilities. Now, just two days later, HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt has issued a one-month 'progress' report that illustrates the Administration's failure to recognize the depth of the problems America's seniors are experiencing. This report - like the implementation of the program so far - gets a failing grade for ignoring the need for a credible plan to alleviate the problems our seniors face and ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to affordable, comprehensive, and understandable drug coverage." "It is long past time for this Administration to change course and come clean with the American people. Only when the President begins to represent the people's interests, not the special interests, will we ensure that seniors and people with disabilities get the drug coverage they deserve."
