SEN. REID, SPEAKER PELOSI DISCUSS SIX MONTHS OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders today reflected on the Democratic-led Congress's accomplishments in the six months since assuming the majority and looked forward to continuing its progress in July. 
   Even with Republicans trying to block our efforts at every turn, this Democratic Congress is delivering on our promises to the American people as we continue to put working families first and make our nation more secure. Both the House and Senate have passed the bipartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations and tough ethics and lobbying reform, while also raising the minimum wage and balancing the budget. Yesterday Republicans once again objected to making our country safer and cleaning up Washington, blocking Democrats' efforts to move the 9/11 Commission recommendations and ethics reform bills to conference.
   "Democrats have made great progress in addressing America's priorities and tackling problems this Administration and past Republican Congresses have ignored," Reid said. "We have much to be proud of from the first half of the year, and we have even more to do as we enter the second. In the coming weeks, we will continue to force a change of course in Iraq until the President and Congressional Republicans finally heed the advice of military experts, respect the will of the American people, and join us in bringing the war to a successful and responsible end. Neither our troops nor the American people can afford to wait until September for a new strategy."
   Said Pelosi: "Democrats have brought a new direction to Congress. It is a new way of thinking and a new Washington - one in which we defend our country, grow our economy, care for our children and families, protect our planet and restore accountability. This is in the tradition of our founding fathers, and honors the will of the American people."
