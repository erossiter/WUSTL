SEN. REID CALLS FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO ENERGY CEO'S FALSE STATEMENTS
  Today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on receipt of a letter from Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) on the potentially false testimony of energy company CEOs before Congress:  
   "I find it deeply disturbing that energy company CEOs may have made false statements before Congress about their involvement in the secretive Cheney energy task force. Despite the Vice President's active efforts to thwart open and transparent government, Congress has the right and the responsibility to seek and obtain information from witnesses that is honest and complete. When evidence arises that some of the statements made to Congress may be false, it calls into question a witness's entire testimony and undermines Congress's constitutional role. 
   "I join Senator Lautenberg in calling on the Attorney General to launch an investigation into this testimony to ascertain whether false statements were made. While Democrats continue to work to make America energy independent we must be assured that industry leaders are held accountable for their words and actions. They should not have a different standard applied just for them. Together, America can do better."
