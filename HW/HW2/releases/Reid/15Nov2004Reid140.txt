SEN. REID TAPS SEN. SCHUMER TO LEAD DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, JOIN SENATE LEADERSHIP
  Sen. Harry Reid today expressed gratitude to Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) for agreeing to serve as Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) for the 2006 campaign cycle.  
   Reid met with Schumer last week and the two had a long discussion about the need for an aggressive fundraising and message operation on behalf of Democratic senators who are up in 2006 as well as Democratic challengers in key states. 
   "Senator Schumer is tough, focused and a formidable fundraiser," Reid said. "We need him on our leadership team. He also is a highly skilled communicator and will be an important voice for progressive change. 
   "I am grateful to Senator Schumer for taking on this challenge and am confident he will succeed. He is tenacious, tireless and committed to holding and winning seats." 
   Reid said he wants the DSCC Chairman to have a seat at the Senate leadership table. 
   "I believe the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee must be an integral part of my leadership team in order to ensure a consistent message and clear priorities," Reid said.
