SEN. REID DISCUSSES JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION ISSUES WITH JUDGE RAWLINSON OF 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Johnnie Rawlinson to discuss issues of judicial administration, including congressional support for the federal courts in Nevada. Rawlinson was recommended to the court by Reid and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2000.  
   "I am delighted to meet with Judge Rawlinson again," Reid said. "She is an outstanding appellate court judge, who has helped to shorten the time that it takes for cases to be heard. All Nevadans can be proud of Judge Rawlinson's exemplary public service on the federal bench." 
   Rawlinson, the first African American woman to sit on the 9th Circuit, holds a J.D. with distinction from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law and a B.S. in Psychology from North Carolina A & T State University. Prior to assuming the federal bench, Rawlinson was the Assistant District Attorney for Clark County. She worked for the Clark County District Attorney's office in various capacities for 18 years.
