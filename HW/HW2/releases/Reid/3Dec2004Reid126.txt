SEN. REID: SENATE SHOULD STAY IN UNTIL 9-11 INTELLIGENCE REFORM BILL PASSED
  Senate Democratic leader-elect Harry Reid (D-NV) tonight said he will stay in session as long as necessary to pass intelligence reform legislation, and he challenged his Republican colleagues in Congress to show a similar commitment.  
   "Senate Democrats are prepared to stay in session as long as it takes to pass this critical legislation that will make our country safer, and I hope Republicans will join me," Reid said about a key bill designed to address pressing post 9-11 security needs. "We have a responsibility to the victims of September 11, their families and all Americans. 
   "It is beyond irresponsible to let petty Republican power grabs from a handful of members stop passage of such an important bill. 
   "After more than a year of work and hundreds of hours of testimony, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission unamimously reported out a series of recommnedations that will make the nation more secure. From that, Congress developed legislation to meet those needs. Now, Republican leaders are upset about their jurisdictions of power and are willing to obstruct this legislation. We need to pass this legislation sooner rather than later. Waiting puts reforms on hold and our country at greater risk."
