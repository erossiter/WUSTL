SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON ENACTMENT OF BILL TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS, THEIR FAMILIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after President Bush signed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 into law: 
   "As skyrocketing tuition costs shut out more and more students from the promise and opportunity of higher education, I am proud that the Democratic bill to make college more affordable and accessible for more Americans is now law. We are making student loans work for students - not the banks - and funding the largest increase in college aid since the G.I. bill half a century ago.
   "For millions of students, we are opening the doors to success ever wider. We are giving them an opportunity to succeed, and they in turn will make America more competitive in the global economy. And by providing over $20 billion in new student aid and benefits, this bill will do so much for thousands of students and parents in Nevada and across America."
