SENATE DEMOCRATS LAUNCH NEW DEMOCRATS.GOV
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid Monday announced the launch of the Senate Democratic Caucus website, Democrats.gov.  
 The site will serve as the online home of Senate Democrats, allowing them to communicate directly with the America people about their priorities and activities. 
   Included in the new site is the opportunity for individuals to become a "Citizen Cosponsor" of efforts in the Senate. This new feature will give the American people a voice in the nation's debate and the opportunity to sign-up to show their support for the Democratic agenda. 
   The new site was formally launched this morning in concert with the rollout of the Democratic Agenda for the 109th Congress - the America Promise.
