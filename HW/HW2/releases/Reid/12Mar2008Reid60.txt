  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid held a podcast today to honor the 75th anniversary of the first of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's groundbreaking and historic fireside chats. Like President Roosevelt's initial radio address, Senator Reid discussed the banking and housing crises that threaten the nation's economy. Senator Reid asked Republicans in Congress to work with the Democrats to pass legislation that will get our economy moving again by lowering taxes for middle-class families and creating almost half a million good-paying jobs here at home.
