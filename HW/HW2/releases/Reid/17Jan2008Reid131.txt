SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFERENCE CALL WITH PRESIDENT BUSH REGARDING ECONOMIC PACKAGE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today following a discussion with President Bush and the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional leadership about the development of an economic stimulus package:  
   "It is encouraging that the President has acknowledged the economic problems challenging our nation. At the same time, I am disappointed that he is rejecting a request from leaders of both parties and both chambers to work with us directly to develop a bipartisan package rather than unilaterally detailing his own approach without Congressional input. The President's strategy threatens to unnecessarily politicize the inevitable bipartisan negotiations we will need to quickly enact legislation.
   "We hope that the President will agree in the near future to work with us to develop a comprehensive package that is targeted, timely and temporary, and that provides an urgently needed boost for the economy and the middle class."
