SEN. REID MEETS WITH GOLF CHAMPION TIGER WOODS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met today with Tiger Woods and PGA TOUR Commissioner Tim Finchemto to discuss a new PGA TOUR charity tournament that the Tiger Woods Foundation will be sponsoring with AT&T in Washington D.C. this July to develop community programs for America's youth.  
   "Tiger Woods is known around the world for his outstanding success in the field of golf, but I would like to commend him for the passion he has demonstrated in public service," said Reid. "His efforts have provided countless children with career exploration opportunities, scientific and technical training and after school programs. I also commend the PGA TOUR for their continued commitment to Nevada with the Frys.com Open in Las Vegas and the Reno-Tahoe Open in Reno. These tournaments not only have a positive impact on our state economy, but also provide much needed support to numerous local charities." 
   Founded in 1996, The Tiger Woods Foundation provides millions of children with scholarships, grants, and innovative educational opportunities and includes The Tiger Woods Learning Center in California and St. Jude Hospital in Tennessee. 
   PGA tournaments have raised over $800 million for charity. Funds raised from the upcoming tournament will be used to develop a site for a Tiger Woods Learning Center on the east coast.
