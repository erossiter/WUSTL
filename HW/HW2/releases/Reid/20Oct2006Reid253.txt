SEN. REID JOINS NEVADA'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION, VETERANS TO BREAK GROUND FOR CLINIC
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada joined Nevada's congressional delegation and veterans to break ground for the new Veterans Affairs Medical Center Complex. Secretary of Veterans Affairs R. James Nicholson and Director of Veterans Affairs clinic John Bright joined with Reid to celebrate the groundbreaking.  
   "Our soldiers, veterans, and their families deserve nothing but the best care," said Reid. "This facility will provide the best in specialty care, surgery, mental health, rehabilitation, geriatrics and extended care. Because one in six Nevadans are veterans, this center will surely prove to be vital for our growing Veteran population." 
   Reid is a strong advocate for the 250,000 veterans who reside in Nevada. He worked to provide nearly $200 million for this project in the FY2006 federal spending bill for veterans. In addition to demanding better health care for veterans, Reid has fought for concurrent receipt and increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   The Medical Center Complex will be located on approximately 154 acres in the north portion of the Las Vegas valley. The 800,000+ square foot building will accommodate 90 inpatient beds and an 88,000 square foot, 120 bed extended and skilled care nursing home care unit. The facility is expected to open early in 2011.
