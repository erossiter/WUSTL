SEN. REID HAILS PASSAGE OF TRANSPORTATION, AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada applauded the Senate's passage of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. The bill provides nearly $20 million in vital funding to improve Nevada's airports and roads, while addressing Nevada's affordable housing challenges, investing in workforce training and creating jobs.
   "After the tragedy in Minnesota, it's unimaginable that President Bush would veto this bill that provides much needed funds to our nation's infrastructure," said Reid. "The funding in this bill is important for Nevada's families because it will improve our roads, make our airports safer, increase access to affordable housing and create jobs." 
   Below is a list of projects funded through the passage of the bill.
