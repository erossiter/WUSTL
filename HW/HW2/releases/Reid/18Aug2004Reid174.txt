SEN. REID FIGHTS FOR FIREFIGHTERS
  Working to make Nevada and the nation safer, Sen. Harry Reid today met with the men and women on the front lines of the war against terror to make sure they have the resources they need.  
   With Nevada becoming increasingly important in the war on terror, Reid visited the Fire Training Facility in Henderson where he listened to ideas and suggestions from leaders who have dedicated their careers to protecting our communities. 
   "It's been almost three years since the September 11th terrorist attacks," Senator Reid said. "We're doing everything we can to prevent another attack, but we must still be prepared for the worst. We ask a lot of our fire fighters and first responders, and we have to give them the resources they need." 
   Key concerns raised at the roundtable discussion included the critical need for an interoperable communications system that would allow all emergency and law enforcement agencies to communicate on the same frequency during a crisis event. 
   The estimated cost of such a system in Las Vegas is $40 million, and Reid said funding is available in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill to meet that need. Reid is working to pass the bill as soon as Congress reconvenes. 
   The discussion also focused on other resource needs, and how local agencies are affected by the Department of Homeland Security's terror alert level. 
   "When the government raises the alert level, local emergency personnel are the ones who must bear the burden," said Reid. "This meeting allowed for a frank and honest discussion about what we can do to help them." 
   There was general consensus from the fire chiefs that one of the best ways to provide additional resources would be to increase funding under the FIRE Act. Reid promised to work on that when he returns to Washington next month.
