SEN. REID MEETS WITH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
  Thirty-three Las Vegas and Rancho High School students received a special tour of the U.S. Capital today, courtesy of Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. The students were in town visiting the nation's Capital as part of "Close Up," a program that promotes responsible and informed participation in the democratic process.  
   "One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is getting to meet with young people from our state," said Reid. "Every Nevada student should take an opportunity to visit Washington and learn about the political process. I'm certain some of these students will come back to fill the halls of Congress as politicians and leaders." 
   Reid spoke to the students about the importance of an education and the need to participate in the political process. In addition, students engaged Reid in lively discussion about his musical preferences and his iPod. 
   The Close Up Foundation is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan citizenship education organization. Since its founding in 1970, Close Up has worked to promote responsible and informed participation in the democratic process through a variety of educational programs.
