SEN. REID ENCOURAGES NEVADANS TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC HEARINGS ON YUCCA
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada sent a letter to fellow Nevadans this week, encouraging them to tell the Department of Energy how they feel about the proposal to use Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste dump during the Department's hearings in Nevada this November and December.

   Here is the text of the letter. 
   Dear *****,
   For more than two decades, I have worked to keep high-level nuclear waste away from Yucca Mountain and out of Nevada. With the support of Nevadans like you, I am confident that together we will continue our successful track record and finally stop this dangerous and wasteful project.
   The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to file an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in June 2008 to request authorization to build the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The Department has taken the first steps towards filing this application, and recently published draft National Environmental Policy Act documents in an attempt to justify its plans to build the nuclear waste dump in Nevada.
   These two documents include a draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the repository itself, and a draft SEIS for the construction of a railroad to transport nuclear waste through Nevada. You can review both statements online at www.state.nv.us/ nucwaste/news2007/pdf/doe071004comments.pdf.
   The DOE will hold six public hearings in Nevada, one in California, and one in Washington, D.C. I have enclosed the dates, times and locations of each of these hearings so you may attend. If you are unable to attend, but would like your voice to be heard, I encourage you to submit your comments to DOE at:
   EIS OFFICE, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
  1551 Hillshire Drive,
  Las Vegas, NV 89134
  Or by fax: 1-800-967-0739

   My best wishes to you.
   Sincerely,
   HARRY REID
  United States Senator
