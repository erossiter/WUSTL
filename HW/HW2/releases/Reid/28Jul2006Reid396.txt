SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT HELPING WORKING AMERICANS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on efforts by Congressional Republicans to hold relief for struggling working families hostage to unnecessary and fiscally irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Democrats are committed to giving the American people the kind of Congress they deserve, with leaders who serve ALL Americans, not just the privileged few.  
   "Republicans have made perfectly clear who they stand with and who they are willing to fight for: the privileged few. It is outrageous that Washington Republicans would make budget busting tax breaks for a wealthy few the price Americans must pay to receive tax relief and a pay raise. 
   "The Senate has rejected fiscally irresponsible estate tax giveaways before and will reject them again. Blackmailing working families will not change that outcome. If the Republicans were serious about raising the minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years and extending tax relief for working Americans, they would not hold them hostage in their effort to give the wealthiest Americans hundreds of billions more in additional tax giveaways. 
   "It is time for a change from a Republican Congress that puts the wealthiest Americans first. We need a new direction, with leaders who work for all Americans."
