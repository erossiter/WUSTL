SEN. REID CONTINUES EFFORTS TO HELP NEVADA VETERANS
  This week Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada will introduce a new bill, the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2007, which would allow veterans eligible for both disability compensation and retirement pay to collect both concurrently.  
   "I am thankful to the nation's veterans - for their great sacrifices and all that they do for our country," said Reid. "I've been working for veterans across Nevada and this great nation for seven years to ensure their commitment to the country is not forgotten. More importantly I'm working on this issue to take care of veterans - to make certain they receive the benefits they rightfully deserve and so desperately need." 
   Reid has backed numerous veteran initiatives, including the Combat-Related Special Compensation Act, an increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and improved veterans' health care across Nevada. 
   Reid is the champion in the fight for full concurrent receipt. Year after year, members of Congress revisit the issue of injustice in compensation for veterans - the ban on concurrent receipt. Disabled veterans face the obstacle of forfeiting retirement pay dollar-for-dollar if they receive disability compensation. Reid is committed to securing a fair policy to provide veterans with the entirety of their earned compensation. 
   Last session Reid introduced legislation (S.558) which would provide concurrent receipt to military retirees, with 20 or more years of service, who are rated less than 50 percent. It would also eliminate the 10-year phase-in period for veterans who draw their disability and retirement pay. 
   Approximately 250,000 veterans live in Nevada making it home to the third largest veterans' population in the nation.
