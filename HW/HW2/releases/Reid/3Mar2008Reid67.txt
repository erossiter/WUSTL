SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released a statement today in celebration of Women's History Month and International Women's Day. 
  "Women's History Month and International Women's Day are important celebrations, not just of the depth of women's contributions in all arenas, but of the progress the United States has made with regard to civil and human rights. 
  "Nevada has a rich history of female pioneers. As early as the mid 1800's, Sarah Winnemucca became the first Native American woman to secure a copyright and to publish in the English language. Her many accomplishments have earned her a spot representing the Silver State in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. Around the same time, Hanna Clap founded the first co-educational school in Nevada. She went on to become one of the first instructors at the University of Nevada.
  "The Silver State's notable women pioneers laid the foundation for our continued wealth of female leaders. Among them, Marge Sill, a noted environmentalist; Claudine Williams, the first woman in the state to head a major casino and to chair a financial institution; and the late Jean Ford, a Women's Rights activist, whom I knew well.
  "Much has been accomplished, but we are by no means finished. We should continue to work toward a future of true equality, in all senses. Knowing there are so many strong and influential women in my home state of Nevada and across the globe, I am confident that day will come."
