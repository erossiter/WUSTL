SEN. REID CELEBRATES EARTH DAY
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid today discussed the importance of Earth Day and shared his vision of Nevada becoming the world leader in renewable energy. Nevada is blessed with abundant solar, wind, and geothermal energy resources. The development of these resources will create thousands of good-paying jobs for Nevadans, while moving our nation closer toward energy independence. 
   "Earth Day began 38 years ago as a grassroots event to support the protection of our environment, and today, it's grown into a national celebration of America's natural beauty and our efforts to preserve it," said Senator Reid. He added, "I am proud to support these efforts to make sure Nevadans have clean water to drink and clear air to breathe, as well as the same picturesque outdoors we've enjoyed for generations."
