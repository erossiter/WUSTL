SEN. REID: DRUG BILL WOULD BE FIRST STEP TO IMPROVING MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM FOR BENEFICIARIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada today issued this statement on the Medicare Fair Prescription Drug Price Act:  
   "Democrats are working to allow prescription-drug price negotiations in Medicare so that it works as well as it can for seniors, people with disabilities, and taxpayers in Nevada and across America. In blocking this bill from even being debated, Senate Republicans have resorted to obstructionism in an effort to protect the drug industry at the expense of our seniors. 
   "This common-sense bill makes Medicare drug plans more accountable, improves information about which drugs are effective, and empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the bargaining power of Medicare's 43 million beneficiaries. The Bush Administration has never been shy about expanding its executive authority. Yet when Congress tries to give the Administration more flexibility in negotiating drug prices, they are fighting it at every step."
