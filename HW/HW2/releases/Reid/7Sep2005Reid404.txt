SEN. REID: AMERICANS DESERVE ANSWERS INDEPENDENT OF POLITICS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement: 
   "We must make sure that the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina never happens again. Democrats strongly prefer that the response to Hurricane Katrina be investigated by a commission of independent experts like the 9/11 commission. 
   "An investigation of the Republican Administration by a Republican-controlled Congress is like having a pitcher call his own balls and strikes. 
   "Americans deserve answers independent of politics. Our government must be accountable to the people."
