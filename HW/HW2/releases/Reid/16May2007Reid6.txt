SEN. REID MEETS WITH ACTOR KEVIN KLINE, JDRF REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS DIABETES RESEARCH
  Award winning-actor Kevin Kline and members of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) met with Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today to discuss juvenile diabetes research. 
   "Juvenile diabetes takes a tremendous personal and financial toll on Nevada and our nation." said Reid. "Over the last several years, researchers have made significant advances related to the treatment and prevention of this disease. We must continue this momentum and invest in medical research that will ultimately lead to a cure for this devastating illness." "Senator Reid has been a true champion for juvenile diabetes research funding and I appreciate his strong support and commitment for passage of legislation this year to bring us closer to a cure," said Kline.
   During the meeting, Kline discussed the importance of reauthorizing and increasing funding for the Special Type 1 Diabetes Program which provides $150 million annually in funding for Type 1 diabetes research. This program and its companion program, the Special Diabetes Programs for Indians, were created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and were reauthorized in 2000 and 2002.
   The meeting took place days before the JDRF's Nevada Chapter is scheduled to hold its Hope Gala fundraiser in Las Vegas. The event is scheduled for Saturday, May, 19.
