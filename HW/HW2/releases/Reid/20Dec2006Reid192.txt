SEN. REID: TIME HAS COME FOR CHANGE IN IRAQ
  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on comments today by President Bush on the size of the military and the war in Iraq.  
   "It is heartening to see that President Bush has reversed his position, rejected the failed Rumsfeld doctrine, and heeded Democratic calls to increase the size of the military. Unfortunately, it is troubling to see that he still does not understand the need for urgent change in Iraq. The President seems lost within his own rhetoric. He is grasping for a victory his current policies have put out of reach and leaving our troops stuck policing a civil war. Democrats and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group have both laid down a roadmap for the President to begin the withdrawal of American troops from the civil war in Iraq. It is now up to the President to follow that course."
