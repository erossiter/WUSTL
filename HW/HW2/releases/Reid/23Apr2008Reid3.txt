SENS. REID, ENSIGN, REP. HELLER ANNOUNCE $7 MILLION IN GRANT FUNDING FOR RENO-TAHOE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Nevada Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, and Congressman Dean Heller today announced the awarding of two Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration grants totaling $7 million for the Reno-Tahoe International Airport.  
   "Reducing noise levels around the Reno-Tahoe Airport is an important quality of life issue for people residing in nearby neighborhoods," Reid said. "I'm happy we're able to bring the money we need back home to Nevada for this important work."
   "Nevada is a state that prides itself on offering its residents a tremendous quality of life," said Ensign. "Reno's snowcapped mountains and warm summer climate entice visitors from all over. Unfortunately, this amount of air traffic increases the noise levels around the airport and under the flight paths. I am pleased to announce the grant awarded to Reno-Tahoe International Airport which will seek to mitigate airport noise."
   "The Reno-Tahoe International Airport is essential to the economic health and growth of Northern Nevada. Ensuring that the airport has the necessary funds to improve their facility and enhance security is critical to the safety of Washoe County residents and the thousands of visitors that come to Northern Nevada every year. I am pleased these funds have been made available," said Heller.
   The Reno-Tahoe International Airport has been awarded the following grants:
   * $5,000,000 for noise mitigation measures for Residences within 65-69 DNL* 
   * $2,000,000 to acquire land for noise compatibility within 65-69 DNL* 
   * DNL stands for Day-Night Average Sound Level, which is the average noise level over a 24 hour period. DNL was introduced as a simple method for predicting the effects on a population of the average long-term exposure to noise.
