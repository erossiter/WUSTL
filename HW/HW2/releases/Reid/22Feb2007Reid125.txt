SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DIVINE STRAKE CANCELLATION
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement after the Pentagon said they are canceling plans for the explosion at the Nevada Test Site, called Divine Strake. 
   "My highest priority has always been and will always be to provide for the health and safety of Nevadans. Tests like these are important projects that could help provide information for our defense systems to be better prepared to combat the global war on terror. However the Department of Defense failed to appropriately consult and work with our communities to demonstrate that the project is safe and sound. They didn't seek proper community input in the decision and overall didn't execute the process properly. There were still many questions left unanswered, including the possible environmental effects. Taking these factors into consideration, I support the Defense Department decision to play it safe by canceling Divine Strake. We never want to jeopardize the health and safety of Nevadans."
