SEN. REID MARKS SEPTEMBER AS 'RURAL AMERICA MONTH'
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today declared September "Rural America Month," a designation to honor the culture, values, history, and economic contributions of our nation's rural communities. 
   The official designation comes after Reid introduced Senate Resolution 561 last week, which passed with the leadership of Senator Lincoln, the Chair for Rural Outreach for the Democratic Caucus.  
   Reid, who grew up in Searchlight, Nevada, used the occasion to discuss steps the Senate should take to preserve and grow rural America. 
   "Our small towns and rural communities are rich in heritage and tradition, and we must do everything we can to protect and sustain the rural way of life," said Reid. "Enriching local economies, preserving good jobs, controlling energy costs, supporting our veterans, and spreading easy access to high-speed communications are just some ways our Congress can contribute to our small towns and communities. From Winnemucca to Ely, our rural culture is the fabric of Nevadan society, and I'm proud to honor it this and every month." 
   A fact sheet about Senator Reid's vision of strengthening rural America is below, and the text of the resolution is attached. 
   RURAL AMERICA: STRENGTHENING THE BACKBONE OF NEVADA 
   CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY 
   * As rural economies become increasingly diversified, we must help communities strive to adapt to the demands of a constantly evolving global economy. 
   * For example, Nevada is the world's third largest exporter of gold and has faced the challenges of relying upon that highly volatile industry; but the people of Elko worked together to identify local resources they could leverage to foster smart growth. 
   FARMERS, RANCHERS & COWBOYS 
   * Farming and ranching are the foundation of rural culture in America, and continue to drive the rural economy. 
   * Today, with 95 million head of cattle, beef production in the United States is an $80 billion industry. 
   ENERGY 
   * The high cost of gas and diesel affects all Americans, but it hits rural America hard. 
   * Instead of making farmers pay for our dependence on foreign oil, it's time they were paid to make America energy independent. 
   * Alternative energy technologies are finally becoming cost-competitive with conventional energy sources such as oil and gas. 
   OUTSOURCING 
   * Another hardship faced by rural Americans is the loss of good jobs. 
   * In the wake of outsourcing, rural communities have been left with the daunting task of retraining workers whose only training had been for jobs that no longer exist. 
   * For example, the manufacturing industry, which is vital to so many small towns, has been hit the hardest, with as much as 30% of the sent abroad. 
   * This has been particularly devastating for low-skilled workers, which make up more than 40% of all rural workers. 
   * This problem is made worse when young, skilled workers entering the workforce leave rural America in search of opportunities only available beyond the county line. 
   * We need to work with rural communities in attracting new industries. Prospective employers need to be assured they have a pool of talented workers. With the exodus of skilled workers and an untrained workforce, few companies are willing to roll the dice. 
   FIRST RESPONDERS 
   * Strive for good health care and good emergency response. 
   * Support programs volunteer fire departments depend upon like FIRE and Citizen Corps grants, and programs that Rural law enforcement officials rely on like BYRNE and COPS. 
   VETERANS 
   * According the Census Bureau, rural and non-metropolitan counties account for the largest concentration of veterans, and during the last decade, Nevada saw its Veterans population increase by more than 30% - the highest increase in the country. 
   * We must support legislation like Reid's (S.558), which would provide concurrent receipt to military retirees, with 20 or more years of service, who are rated less than 50%. 
   * Additionally, the CARES commission on veterans' health care recognized the need for a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Fallon and an expansion of services at the Reno VA Medical Center. 
   BROADBAND 
   * For rural America, competition and active participation in the local and global marketplaces not only means having a computer, but also access to high-speed internet services. 
   * Broadband Internet has proven itself to be a potent catalyst in job creation, economic development, and a critical component of education and public safety. In fact, the deployment of broadband service to our rural areas may be as important to economic development as rural electrification was during the Great Depression.
