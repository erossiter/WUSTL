SEN. REID CALLS ON BUSH TO TAKE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS OFF OF THE TABLE
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "Until the president and the Republican leadership agree that their misguided attempt to privatize Social Security is over and they will no longer pursue their previously announced bait and switch strategy, Democrats will continue to refuse to enter negotiations over Social Security.  
 We stand ready, willing, and able to join in a conversation to strengthen Social Security but we will not stand by and allow a vehicle for privatization to make it into Conference. 
   "The fact remains clear that privatizing Social Security with its deep benefit cuts for American workers and massive new debt is a bad deal. Democrats remain committed to standing with the American people in strengthening Social Security."
