SEN. REID: AMERICANS PAY PRICE FOR REPUBLICAN MEDICARE DONUT HOLE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on "Donut Hole Day," the day the average senior loses prescription drug coverage thanks to the Donut Hole the Republican Congress wrote into Medicare Part D.  
   "Instead of standing up for seniors and passing a prescription drug plan that would have protected them from the high cost of prescription drugs, Bush Republicans sold out to special interests. Today, the American people pay the price. Some 6.5 million Americans - over 32,000 of them from Nevada - are at risk of skyrocketing drug prices thanks to the 'Donut Hole' in Medicare Part D. For the past two years, Democrats have sought to address this problem, but in typical fashion the Republican Congress has done nothing about it. It is a travesty that the Republican Congress would ignore the donut hole, while continuing to bar Medicare from negotiating lower prices and to protect HMO giveaways while seniors struggle to pay for medicines on their own, but it's hardly a surprise. The American people deserve a change, and Democrats are fighting to take this country in a new direction."
