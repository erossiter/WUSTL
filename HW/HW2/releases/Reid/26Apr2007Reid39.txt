SEN. REID: CONGRESS SENDING PRESIDENT BILL THAT FULLY FUNDS TROOPS, BRINGS ACCOUNTABILITY TO WAR
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement following passage of the Emergency Supplemental bill:  
   "The President has put our troops in the middle of a civil war with no end in sight. That was never supposed to be their mission. The bipartisan legislation we passed today strengthens U.S. security and helps us more effectively fight terrorists by fully funding our troops and providing a plan to responsibly end this war. The conference report ensures our troops are combat-ready before being deployed to Iraq. Finally, the bill begins a phased redeployment of our troops out Iraq and holds Iraqis accountable for finding a political solution. 
   "After more than four years of a failed policy, it's time for Iraq to take responsibility for its future. We are asking the President to carefully read this bill. He will see it fully provides for our troops and gives them a strategy worthy of their sacrifices. Failing to sign this bill would deny our troops the resources and strategy they need. The President has a choice. Heed the call of the American people, a bipartisan majority of Congress and military experts to change course or keep our troops committed to an open-ended civil war."
