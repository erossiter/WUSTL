SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH USING SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AS WHITE HOUSE PR FIRM
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) released the following statement today on reports that the Bush administration is using the Social Security Administration to promote his reckless plan to cut benefits: 
   "The idea that George W. Bush would instruct the Social Security Administration to spend valuable dollars to promote his privatization plan is shocking.
   "When it comes to promoting its own political agenda, it's clear this White House knows no bounds. It has paid journalists to bias their coverage and is now turning the Social Security Administration into a White House PR firm. The United States government is not a Republican propaganda machine, and I call on President Bush to immediately investigate and put an end to these actions.
   "We will have a debate about the best way to strengthen Social Security, and the American people will decide for themselves if they support the President's plan to cut benefits in half and drive up the debt. In the meantime, for Republicans to try and use taxpayers' dollars and resources to build support for this plan is simply unconscionable."
