SENS. REID, ENSIGN INCREASE HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING FOR NEVADA
  Nevada stands to gain additional millions in Homeland Security funding under a provision from Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign. The Senate passed an amendment today that included a change to the formula for how funding is divided among the states. The provision would give extra weight to areas with large numbers of tourists. 
   "The emergency personnel who serve communities like Las Vegas have the added responsibility of protecting hundreds of thousands of tourists on any given day in addition to local residents," Senator Reid said. "When tourists are factored in, the population increases dramatically and so do the needs of first responders. We need to make sure funding goes to where it is most needed in the most effective way." 
   "Factoring in tourist population when determining funding levels for emergency responders is an essential component of our overall efforts to provide the greatest degree of safety we can," Ensign said. "States like Nevada with smaller populations must constantly fight for equal treatment when it comes to funding and in the area of homeland security or other aspects of public safety, it is crucial we wage that fight successfully." 
   Currently, a community's population, and specifically population density, is a key element in determining homeland security funding. Tourist destinations are often shortchanged under this formula because the hundreds of thousands of visitors are not taken into consideration. The Reid/Ensign provision will change that by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to include tourists as part of the overall population of a community. 
   The funding change is expected to mean an additional $6 million for the state bringing the total to $32 million for FY06.
