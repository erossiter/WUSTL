DEMOCRATS SEND PRESIDENT BILL TO FULLY IMPLEMENT 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today as he and Speaker Nancy Pelosi enrolled the Improving America's Security Act of 2007, which will finally implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations:  
   "Just as Democrats have made it a priority to fund critical homeland security needs and fought to establish both the Department of Homeland Security and the 9/11 Commission, we are again making America safer by sending the President a bill to finally and fully implement the Commission's recommendations. 
   "After years of Congressional and Administration inaction, this long-overdue legislation will fund our most vulnerable cities and states, enhance communication capabilities for first responders, strengthen transit security, and improve oversight of our intelligence and homeland security systems. With our intelligence experts saying Al Qaeda is at its strongest since 9/11, there is no time to waste. We look forward to President Bush enacting this bill as soon as it reaches his desk."
