SEN. REID: BUSH LEAVING US WITHOUT PLAN FOR SUCCESS IN IRAQ
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to President Bush's speech on Iraq: 
   "In today's speech President Bush once again failed to give the American people a clear indication that we are any closer to an overall plan for success in Iraq than we were in any of the previous five years of this war."
   "The President asserts that real progress has been made in Iraq, but if that were truly the case, then our troops would be coming home soon."
   "In fact it appears there will be as many if not more U.S. troops in Iraq at the end of the year than there were before the surge began in 2007; and in that time the President's policies have not resulted in the political reconciliation needed for a long-term solution to the conflict in Iraq."
   "Rather than criticizing Congress, President Bush should be working with us to hold the Iraqi government accountable. The President's failure on this front is keeping our troops mired in an endless civil war."
   "Our troops have done their job; it is time for the Iraqi politicians and this Administration to do theirs."
