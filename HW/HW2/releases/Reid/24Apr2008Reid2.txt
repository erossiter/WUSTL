SEN. REID MEETS WITH STUDENTS, ACTRESS TO DISCUSS AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met with actress Amber Tamblyn ("Joan of Arcadia" and "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants") and a group of college students from Nevada, Michigan, North Dakota and Pennsylvania to discuss how they are being affected by the rising costs of prescription contraceptives on college campuses nationwide. 
   "We must ensure all women have access to safe prescription contraception at prices they can afford," Reid said. "I support the Prevention Through Affordable Access Act. This legislation would restore the longstanding ability of university-based and safety-net clinics to purchase prescription contraception at deeply discounted rates and pass the savings on to students and low-income clients. 
   "There is no question that the rate of unintended pregnancy is too high in the United States," Reid said. "Half of the six million pregnancies in this country each year are unintended, and nearly half of these unplanned pregnancies end in abortion. It doesn't have to be this way. Many of these unintended pregnancies - and the resulting abortions - can be prevented if we eliminate the barriers that prevent women from having access to affordable and effective contraceptive."
   Because of a technical error in the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), drug manufacturers can no longer provide prescription contraception to certain health centers at deeply discounted rates. College students who used to pay as little as $5 are now paying as much $50 per perscription. Many clinics will no longer be able to afford to carry these prescriptions and low income women and college students cannot afford to pay the increased price.
