SEN. HARRY REID FLAYS REP. BOEHNER STATEMENT BLAMING MILITARY
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on House Majority Leader John Boehner's decision to blame the troops for Republican failures in Iraq.  
   "John Boehner ought to be ashamed. He's blaming our troops for failures in Iraq. If he wants to cast blame, he can start by looking in the mirror because he and his Congressional Republican colleagues have rubberstamped the Bush Administration's failed policy for nearly four years. Our troops in Iraq have performed bravely. It's political leaders like Congressman Boehner and Donald Rumsfeld, who have failed. I expect President Bush and Congressional Republicans, who demanded John Kerry apologize, hold their own party's majority leader to a much higher standard. There's no spinning his disparaging comments. He made them. He needs to apologize." 
   House Majority Leader John Boehner: Wolf, I understand that, but let's not blame what's happening in Iraq on Rumsfeld. 
   Wolf Blitzer: But he's in charge of the military. 
   House Majority Leader John Boehner: But the fact is the generals on the ground are in charge and he works closely with them and the president.
