SENS. REID, ENSIGN LEAD EFFORT TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN NEVADA'S SMALL COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada introduced a bipartisan bill that will benefit small communities in Nevada. Through a grant program, the legislation will provide funding for water quality projects without the current burdensome matching requirements. 
   "Many of Nevada's small communities are facing drinking water infrastructure crises," said Reid. "These communities, and others across the nation, face an increasing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable drinking water supplies. This act will give them the helping hand they need to meet that demand."
   "Rural communities have to comply with federal laws that mandate public water system improvements that are complex and often too costly for smaller communities," said Ensign. "This bill will help provide smaller towns across Nevada with the resources they need to meet these requirements."
   The Small Community Drinking Water Funding Act, S.1933, would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Small Public Water System Assistance Program that would support small water systems in complying with national primary drinking water regulations, and includes a program for Indian tribes.
   This act will authorize $750,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2014 and will accomplish three things:
   1. Establish a program to provide grants to small public water systems to meet applicable national primary drinking water regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
   2. Maintain water costs at a reasonable level for the communities served by small public water systems.
   3. Obtain technical assistance to develop the capacity to sustain operations over the long term.
