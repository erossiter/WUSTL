SENS. REID, ENSIGN CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR ELKO COUNTY VETERANS
  Continuing their two-year fight to provide better health care for veterans in Elko County, Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign have stepped up pressure on the Department of Veterans Affairs to build a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), as the Senate recommended last year. 
   Currently, veterans in Elko County and surrounding areas have to travel hundreds of miles through often hazardous driving conditions for healthcare services. Reid and Ensign secured a Senate recommendation last year to build a CBOC in Elko, but no action has been taken. 
   "We have been patient for two years now. We have had town meetings with local veterans and we have written letters to the VA and received certain assurances from the VA, but still no action has been taken," said Reid. "This has dragged on too long. Something needs to be done for these veterans now." 
   "We cannot be silent when Nevada's veterans are traveling hundreds of miles, at great inconvenience to themselves and their families, to get quality medical care," Ensign said. "Nevada's veterans have made their needs known clearly and effectively. The responsibility of meeting those needs now falls with us, and we will not let them down." 
   A measure requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to report on its plans for the Elko community was included in the 2005 Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. The report will have to be submitted with 60 days of the enactment of the bill.
