SEN. REID WINS PASSAGE OF IRAN INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT
Working to ensure that the same mistakes from Iraq are not made again as the Bush Administration increases its public and private diplomatic efforts with Iran, Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today announced the passage of his Iran Intelligence Oversight Act.  
 "We live in a dangerous world and face difficult threats," said Reid. "When the Administration makes decisions, it affects the lives and futures of Nevadans in the military, the reserves and the National Guard. That's why we must ensure that the Bush Administration is held accountable for its words and its decisions. This legislation will help ensure the kind of Congressional oversight that the people of Nevada deserve." 
 The Iran Intelligence Oversight Act will: 
 * Require an updated national intelligence estimate on Iran with an unclassified summary available to inform debate by Congress and the American people 
 * Require the President to report to Congress on his objectives regarding Iran and his strategy for achieving them 
 * Require the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on the current policies and practices for vetting and clearing statements of senior Administration officials that are drawn from intelligence; how significant misstatements of intelligence in public statements of senior public officials are identified, brought to the attention of any such officials, and corrected; and recommend any process improvements. 
 Reid's amendment passed the Senate tonight as part of the Department of Defense Authorization Act. The measure also included other amendments by Senators Reid and Ensign to help Nevada's disabled veterans get fair retirement pay and provide more funding for ROTC units in Nevada. The bill will now go to a joint House/Senate Conference Committee for approval.
