SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S BIRTHDAY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry of Nevada Reid today released the following statement in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to mark the federal holiday that bears his name: 
   "Across our country next week, Americans will celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, who would have turned 79 years old today. Nearly four decades after his death, Dr. King's voice of peace still resonates throughout the world, and his vision of equality still guides us daily.
   "As we remember Dr. King's legacy, we also recall our solemn responsibility to advance an agenda that moves our nation forward and pursues justice for all Americans. Since last Martin Luther King Day, we have called ourselves to action by working to improve access to affordable health care, increasing the minimum wage and making college education more affordable so that all students can realize their dreams. In the new year, we will continue working tirelessly toward these ends because they are the priorities of not just African Americans, but all Americans.
   "In one of his many poignant sermons at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Dr. King asked to be remembered not for his honors and awards, but rather for giving his life to help others. On this anniversary of Dr. King's birth, we honor his memory by fulfilling this request: 'I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.'"
