SEN. REID WORKS WITH HUD SECRETARY JACKSON TO ADDRESS NEVADA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS
  At the urging of Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson will meet with Clark County officials later today to work on finding a solution to Southern Nevada's affordable housing crisis. 
   A recent study that indicated that nearly 80 percent of new worker households in the Las Vegas area will not be able to afford a median priced home in the future.
   "Southern Nevada's affordable housing crisis is urgent matter that must be addressed now," said Reid. "I'm grateful that Secretary Jackson has accepted my invitation to meet with Clark County leaders. I know his visit to Las Vegas will provide a greater understanding of the tremendous growth that Southern Nevada has experienced."
   Jackson will meet with the mayors of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Boulder City, and Mesquite, as well as several Clark County commissioners. Jackson will also visit an affordable housing development under construction, to learn more about public-private efforts to address the affordable housing situation in Clark County.
