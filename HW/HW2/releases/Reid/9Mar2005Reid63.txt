SEN. REID COMMENTS ON KEEPING SNPLMA FUNDS FOR NEVADA
  In his budget released last month, President Bush proposed to divert over a billion dollars from Clark County federal land sales to offset mounting federal deficits.  
 Bush's proposal would have taken money Nevada uses for land acquisitions, environmental restoration, parks and recreation projects in Nevada. Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign were successful in stopping this effort. Reid released the following statement today: 
   "President Bush's plan was foolish and unfairly targeted Nevada. The Administration wanted to take our state's money by robbing the Southern Nevada Public Lands Act fund. I had all 45 of the Democrats ready to fight this proposal and Sen. Ensign had enough Republican support that we were able to stop them from doing this. 
   "The SNPLMA funding is very important to our state. With so much of our land under federal control we need the money. It helps conservation efforts so we can protect Nevada's natural treasures. Bush has pushed this country trillions of dollars in the hole, and taking a billion dollars from Nevada wouldn't even be a drop in the bucket towards the massive deficit."
