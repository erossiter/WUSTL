Reid released the following statement on his new position and renewed his commitment to putting Nevada's priorities at the top of the list.  
   "Nevada comes first for me, it always has and it always will. As the leader of the Senate, I will make sure that Nevada's priorities still come first by addressing important issues like immigration reform, growth, water, and the environment.. 
   "I'll also fight for energy independence so Nevada families can afford the gas they need to get to work. I'll work to make health care more affordable, and strengthen Medicare so Nevadans never have to choose between a meal and their medicine. And more than ever, I'll leverage my leadership position to keep Nevada from becoming the nation's nuclear dumping ground."
