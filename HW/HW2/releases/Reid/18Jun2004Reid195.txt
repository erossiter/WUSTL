SEN. REID CONTINUES TO FIGHT FOR AMERICA'S DISABLED VETS
  Nevada Sen. Harry Reid on Friday won Senate support to immediately end an unfair tax on veterans who are 100 percent disabled.  
   Reid has been fighting for years to end the ban on "concurrent receipt," a policy that deducts disability payments to veterans from the military retirement pay they earned. 
   Last year Reid succeeded in winning a 10-year phase-in of full retirement pay to all veterans who are 50 percent to 100 percent disabled; any veteran who sustained combat-related injuries; Purple Heart recipients regardless of their degree of disability; and to national guardsmen and reservists who were previously left out of the earlier compensation programs. 
   On Friday, the Senate unanimously accepted Reid's proposal to provide full pay to severely disabled vets immediately, instead of phasing it in over 10 years. 
   "When a combat-related incident completely disables a retired member of the military, they shouldn't have to wait the 10 years to get the retirement pay they have earned," said Reid. 
   This amendment was passed as part of the fiscal year 2005 Department of Defense Authorization bill. The cost of the amendment is estimated to be under $1 billion over 10 years.
