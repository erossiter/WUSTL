SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF KRISTINA MILLER
  Sen. Harry Reid delivered the following speech from the Senate floor this afternoon.  
   "Later tonight I believe we will pass a Resolution expressing our condolences to the people of Egypt for the deadly terrorist attacks that swept the resort city of Sharm el-Sheik this past weekend. 
   "Hundreds were injured and dozens were killed after terrorists detonated four large bombs in a crowded hotel in the sea side resort. 
   "Among the dead was an American, Kristina Miller of Las Vegas. 
   "Kristina was a daughter of Nevada and a citizen of the world. A 1996 graduate of Durango High School, Kristina was remembered by her friends as good-hearted, popular and adventurous. 
   "She was in London on July 7th when terrorists struck the mass transit system. She survived those attacks unscathed, and decided to go to Egypt on vacation, when these tragic attacks occurred. 
   "Acts of terror, like that which took her life, are a tragedy no matter where they occur, but the loss of one of our own spreads personal sadness across Nevada and the entire country. 
   "They also generate a sense of resolve and solidarity to hunt down and to bring to justice the thugs responsible for these heinous acts. 
   "I am glad the Senate will speak with one voice in condemning these barbaric acts, and I personally want to extend my deepest sympathies to the victims, especially the family and friends of Kristina Miller."
