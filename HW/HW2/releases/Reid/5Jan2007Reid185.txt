SEN. REID ANNOUNCES SEN. BOXER TO HEAD ETHICS COMMITTEE DURING SEN. JOHNSON'S RECOVERY
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today announced that Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) will chair the Senate Ethics Committee during Sen. Tim Johnson's recovery from surgery.  
   Said Reid, "Senator Johnson is recovering, and we all look forward to the day he can rejoin us in the Senate. Until he does, however, it is critical to have Senator Boxer's leadership on the Senate Ethics Committee. She will do a wonderful job, and I thank her for taking on this important responsibility." 
   Boxer said, "Today, Senator Reid asked and I agreed to temporarily lead the Senate Ethics Committee on behalf of Senator Johnson. I am pleased to be able to do my small part to help ensure that my good friend Tim Johnson and his family can focus 100 percent on his recovery without worry about his duties on the Committee."
