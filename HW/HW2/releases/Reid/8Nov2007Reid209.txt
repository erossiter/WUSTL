SEN. REID: CONGRESS OVERRIDES WATER RESOURCES VETO, REFUSES TO ALLOW PRESIDENT TO BLOCK AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate voted to override President Bush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act 
   "This veto override sends an unmistakable message that Democrats both will continue to strengthen our environment and economy, and will refuse to allow President Bush to block America's real priorities for partisan reasons. The Water Resources Development Act provides authority for essential new navigation projects and funds programs to combat flood and coastal-storm damage, restore ecosystems, and projects guided by the Army Corps of Engineers essential to protecting the people of the Gulf Coast region.
   "President Bush vetoed these critical priorities, just as he has repeatedly threatened to block other essential needs and repeatedly demonstrated how out of touch he is with the American people. Perhaps the President will finally recognize that Congress is an equal branch of government and reconsider his many other reckless veto threats."
