SEN. REID, REP. PELOSI RELEASE STATEMENT ON SEN. BYRD/REP. OBEY APPROPRIATIONS RESOLUTION
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid and incoming House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi today released the following statement on the announcement by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) and Rep. Dave Obey (D-WI) that they would seek to pass a year-long joint resolution for appropriations early in the 110th Congress.  
 "The Do Nothing 109th Congress is now complete, but too much of its work remains far from finished. Next year the Congress will begin to address the fiscal debacle six years of Republican rule has left to the American people. We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks, and we will give the American people the leadership they deserve. To give state and local governments certainty about how and what the government is funding, and to give Congress the time to legislate these issues as it should, we support Senator Byrd and Congressman Obey in their plan to pass a year-long joint resolution early in the 110th Congress. It is not a perfect solution, but it is the best available given the fiscal mess the 109th Congress has left behind."
