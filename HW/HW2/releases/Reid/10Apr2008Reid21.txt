SEN. REID INTRODUCES CANAL AND LEVEE SAFETY BILL
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid today introduced the Aging Water Infrastructure and Maintenance Act, a bill designed to protect Nevadans from future disasters like January's floods in Fernley.  
   The bill would provide $11 million over the next five years, including $5 million in FY 2009, for required inspections of aging federal water infrastructure like the Truckee Canal. It also directs the Department of the Interior to perform maintenance and urgent repairs to ensure the safety of homes and businesses in nearby communities.
  "The residents of Fernley suffered terribly when the Truckee Canal failed. We must protect Nevadans by doing everything we can to prevent this type of serious problem from happening again," Reid said. "I will work diligently to pass this bill to protect Nevadans living near canals and levees." 
  The Bureau of Reclamation faces serious challenges in maintaining aging water infrastructure. The average age of Reclamation-owned projects is around 50 years, and the Truckee Canal is one of the oldest facilities, built in 1903. 
  The legislation is being cosponsored by: Senators Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; Ken Salazar (D-CO); and Jon Tester (D-MT).
