SENS. ENSIGN, REID URGE COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT BALLOT INTEGRITY LEGISLATION
  Sens. John Ensign and Harry Reid are urging their colleagues to support legislation authored by Sen.  
 Ensign that will provide voters with the ability to inspect a printout of their ballots before the votes are actually cast. Sens. Ensign and Reid have circulated a Dear Colleague letter urging support for the Voting Integrity and Verification Act (VIVA). 
   "People will not participate in elections if they have no confidence in the voting system and this bill will restore a large measure of that confidence," Ensign said. "Voters can inspect their ballots and correct any errors before the vote is recorded, helping us avoid questionable election results." 
   "After the debacle in Florida in 2000, we knew we needed to fix our election systems," said Reid. "That's why Congress set aside billions of dollars for states to buy new, more reliable electronic voting machines. But those machines aren't perfect, and without a paper trail we can't guarantee that all votes will be counted correctly. Nevada is the only state that will have a paper-trail system in place statewide for the next election. We've gotten a great deal of media attention for being a leader in this area, but we need to help the rest of the country catch up to us. All Americans should know that their vote matters." 
   Congress has already passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) but that legislation does not include a provision mandating a paper ballot for voters' inspection. Ensign and Reid say such a provision must be included before states spend billions of dollars on new voting machines to comply with HAVA.
