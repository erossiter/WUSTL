SEN. REID ANNOUNCES $500,000 IN GRANTS TO HELP NEVADA STUDENTS PREPARE FOR COLLEGE
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada announced two grants, totaling over $500,000, to fund the Upward Bound program at Nevada State College. 
   "Working with my colleagues in the Senate, I helped pass higher education legislation in September to make a college education more affordable for Nevada students. This legislation also included additional funding to expand the Upward Bound program," said Reid. "I was pleased that Nevada State College was awarded funding for two Upward Bound programs in southern Nevada. Now, with this grant, Nevada State will be able to identify promising Nevada high school students and provide them the skills they need to succeed in college."
   The Upward Bound program awards grants to institutions of higher education, like the Nevada State College, to provide low-income and first generation college students with additional support to help them complete high school and succeed in college. A provision included in the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 expanded the Upward Bound program.
