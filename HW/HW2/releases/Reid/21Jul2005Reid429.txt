SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE TO RELEASE VITAL INFORMATION TO AMERICAN PEOPLE
  "Since the start of the war in Iraq more than two years ago, the Bush Administration has repeatedly assured the American people that it has a strategy for success in Iraq.  
   "Unfortunately, the continuing level of violence and unrest in Iraq raises questions about the credibility of the Administration's claims and demonstrates this conflict is unlikely to end anytime soon. 
   "Overly optimistic statements such as that by the Vice President that the insurgency is in its 'last throes' have not matched assessments by the Administration's own intelligence analysts and senior military officers about the challenges ahead. 
   "With all this smoke and mirrors, the American people are right to be concerned and to demand that the Administration at long last present a plan for success, benchmarks to measure our progress, and cold, hard facts about what where we stand. 
   "Since the start of the war in Iraq more than two years ago, the Bush Administration has repeatedly assured the American people that it has a strategy for success in Iraq."
