INVOKING SPIRIT OF FDR, SENATE DEMOCRATS DEMAND PRESIDENT NOT ADD TRILLIONS TO DEBT IN RISKY PRIVATIZATION SCHEME
  Sens. Reid, Schumer and Democratic Caucus will release letter to Bush urging him to send a responsible Soc. Sec. reform package to Congress - not one that unduly burdens future generations. 
   Senators will also show that the President's plan to privatize Social Security will increase per capita national debt to a whopping $25,000 per capita - up more than 100% from 2001 low of $12,000.
   Standing outside the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial on Thursday, February 3 at 11:00 am, Senators Reid, Schumer and members of the Senate Democratic Caucus will present a united front to fight against the President's plans to send the national debt skyrocketing by privatizing Social Security - increasing the burden to $25,000 per capita. The Senators will release a letter to the White House from a unified Democratic Caucus calling on President Bush to send a plan for Social Security reform that does not exacerbate national debt.
   With national debt already reaching record highs, the Senators will detail the impact of the Administration's current plan for privatization, showing that the costs of the proposal would add trillions to national debt, increasing the per capita debt to $25,000 per capita by 2015- up more than 100% from the 2001 per capita debt of $12,000. The Senators will invoke the image of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who pioneered Social Security and call on the Administration to put forth a responsible reform proposal instead of a plan that would more than double the burden of national debt for future generations.
