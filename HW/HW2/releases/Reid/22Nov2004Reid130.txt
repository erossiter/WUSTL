SENS. REID, ENSIGN DELIVER MILLIONS TO IMPROVE NEVADA HEALTH CARE
  Working to improve access and quality of healthcare, Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign directed millions of dollars to Nevada hospitals and other medical centers.  
   The money will fund state-of-the-art cancer prevention and treatment projects, expand UMC's burn center, and improve trauma services at Washoe Medical Center. 
   "This funding will do so much good for people in Nevada who need medical care," Senator Reid said. "We will be able to help patients and families struggling with long-term illnesses as well as improve immediate trauma care in the event of an accident or wide-scale medical emergency." 
   "Health care is a critical issue to every Nevada family," Ensign said. "This funding will greatly improve access to a broad range of healthcare needs-from emergency medical attention to the fight against cancer to valuable hospice care." 
   Among other health care related projects, federal funds will be going to the Nevada Cancer Institute for the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer. 
   The Lance Armstrong Foundation Cancer Survivorship Center will also receive money to provide patients and their families with support focused on treating and surviving cancer. 
   UMC's Burn Care Center will receive funding to help relocate, expand and purchase new equipment. The new center will be the primary Burn Care Center for Southern Nevada. 
   Federal funding is also going to help build the Nathan Adelson Hospice in Henderson. A hospice center is desperately needed in southern Nevada to expand end-of-life care. 
   Washoe Medical Center will receive money expand their trauma services. The trauma center is the only one of its kind between the Sacramento area and Salt Lake City. 
   Funding for these projects was requested by Reid and Ensign as part of a large government spending bill that passed the Senate today.
