SEN. REID: SENATE LEADERS AGREE ON PATH TO EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today: 
   "Democrats in Congress remain committed to changing course in Iraq and it will remain at the forefront of our agenda until the President and his Republican allies in Congress finally heed the will of the American people and work with us to bring the war to a successful and responsible end.
   "On Thursday, the Senate will vote on a resolution that expresses our continuing support for our troops and will serve as a bipartisan vehicle that will allow us to move to conference. The details of the final emergency supplemental bill will be negotiated in the House-Senate conference. It is imperative that we get to conference as quickly as possible, which this resolution allows us to do. 
   "The American people deserve to know that Democrats will remain committed in conference to the goals of fully funding our troops and changing course in Iraq. That is why we will also have two additional Iraq votes on Wednesday, separate from the supplemental. Those measures, authored by Senators Levin and Feingold, are important to our overall debate. They will provide strong guidance to our conferees and help shape the conference negotiations we have ahead of us."
