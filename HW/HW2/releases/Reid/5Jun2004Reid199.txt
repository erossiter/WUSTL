SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON EVE OF SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF 'D-DAY'
  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of "D-Day" 
   "On June 6th, Americans will commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of "D-Day", one of the most important battles in the history of modern warfare. The invasion of Normandy marked the beginning of the end of World War II by inflicting a devastating blow on the Nazi empire. Never before had the free nations of the world united in such an overwhelming and coordinated use of air, land, and sea power. American and allied troops made enormous sacrifices, suffering over 200,000 casualties.
   Americans from all the states, including Nevada, took part in General Eisenhower's bold battle plan. Those who fought and died have been called part of America's 'Greatest Generation.' That is exactly what they were. They sacrificed so much, putting the good of the United States and the future of the free world on their shoulders. We know now how much this great victory meant to the cause of freedom. We salute all those who fought and served, and are eternally grateful for their courage, their heroism, and their love of country."
