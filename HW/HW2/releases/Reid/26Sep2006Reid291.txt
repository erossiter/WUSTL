SEN. REID: NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE PROVES WE MUST CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate.  
   "The declassified findings contained in the National Intelligence Estimate confirm what the American people have long believed - the Bush Administration's failed policies in Iraq are fueling global terrorism and making America less safe. These results are the unfortunate consequences of the Administration's decision to cherry pick pre-war intelligence, ignore our senior military leaders, and completely fail to plan for the post-Saddam occupation. With such a devastating and authoritative analysis of the Bush Administration's failures in Iraq, the President and the Republican-controlled Congress now have a choice to make. Will they stubbornly follow a failed stay the course strategy that America's intelligence community has concluded makes America less safe, or will they finally admit their mistakes and change course? On behalf of our troops and the security of the American people, it is time to change course. We need a new direction in Iraq so that America can finally win the war on terror."
