SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALEZ
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, following the announcement of the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as U.S. Attorney General:
   "Alberto Gonzales was never the right man for this job. He lacked independence, he lacked judgment, and he lacked the spine to say no to Karl Rove. This resignation is not the end of the story. Congress must get to the bottom of this mess and follow the facts where they lead, into the White House."
