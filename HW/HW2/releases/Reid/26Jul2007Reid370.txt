SEN. REID: SENATE PASSES HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL TO STRENGTHEN BORDERS, MAKE AMERICA MORE SECURE
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada led the U.S. Senate to the passage of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill today. The bill includes funding secured by Senator Reid for additional Customs and Border Patrol agents at McCarran Airport. These additional agents will have an immediate impact on airport security, airport efficiency, tourism, and the economy. Following the 89-4 vote, Senator Reid released the following statement: 
   "Democrats have delivered on yet another promise to make America more secure following years of this Administration's failed policies that have led to a stronger Al Qaeda and an increase in worldwide terror attacks. This strong Homeland Security Appropriations bill invests more than $40 billion in the nation's highest-priority security projects - $5 billion more than the President proposed.
   "This important bill will strengthen our borders; ensure first responders have the tools they need to do their jobs; and enhance security at our airports, ports and mass transit facilities. We call on the President to work with us to make America more secure by dropping his misguided veto threats and signing this bill into law."
