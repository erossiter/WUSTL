SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECORD GAS PRICES IN NEVADA
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released a statement in response to Nevada's record-breaking gas prices: 
   "Today, Americans are feeling pain at the pumps more than they ever have before as oil hit a record price at $107 a barrel. Gas prices in Las Vegas have broken yet another record at $3.23 a gallon. In Reno, Nevadans are feeling the squeeze even more, with prices only a penny away from breaking the record of $3.39.
   "This is yet another reminder that the Bush Administration's misplaced budget and energy priorities have made America less secure and more unprepared. This Administration's energy policy is hitting consumers hard and weakening our national security as we rely heavily on oil from unstable parts of the world. I'm working to decrease Nevada's dependence on fossil fuels by focusing on legislation that encourages efficiency and invests in renewable energy. By investing in Nevada's abundance of solar, wind, and geothermal energy, we will decrease our need for unsustainable and unstable sources of energy. At the same time, we will create new jobs, reduce demand, and achieve greater energy independence and security. Until then, experts project gas prices will continue to rise."
