NEVADA DELEGATION WORKS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS
  Nevada's congressional delegation today sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings expressing disappointment with the U.S. Department of Education's reduction to Nevada's English Language Learner (ELL) Funds by nearly $2 million, despite the state's rapidly growing ELL student population. 
   Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, and Congressmen Jon Porter and Dean Heller have committed themselves to working through the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) reauthorization to develop proposals to more accurately count Nevada's ELL students so that our schools have the resources they need to ensure that all students become proficient in English.
