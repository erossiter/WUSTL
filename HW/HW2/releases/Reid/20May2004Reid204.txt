SENS. REID, ENSIGN WORKING TOGETHER TO RESOLVE RURAL LAND CONFLICT
  Working to resolve a land conflict affecting rural Nevadans, Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign introduced bipartisan legislation today that would settle a longstanding trespass issue in the historic mining communities of Ione and Gold Point. 
   The Nevada Mining Townsite Conveyance Act would transfer approximately 760 acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management to Nye and Esmeralda counties. The counties would then turn the parcels over to residents of Ione and Gold Point who have lived on the land for decades. During their long tenure on these lands many local residents improved their properties and paid property taxes, but have found that their ownership claims are contested by the Bureau of Land Management. This bill would provide a final solution to this problem.
   "The BLM and Nye and Esmeralda counties support the legislation that we offer as a solution to the land ownership conflicts," said Reid. "These conveyances will benefit the agencies that manage Nevada's vast federal lands as well as the proud citizens of our rural communities."
   "This is a great example of counties working together with the federal government to benefit the people living in their communities," Ensign said. "Nye and Esmeralda counties have found a workable solution because of their hard work."
   The framework for this legislation was worked out jointly by the Bureau of Land Management, Nye and Esmeralda Counties, and local residents. As a condition of the conveyance, all historic and cultural resources contained in the townsites will be preserved and protected under applicable Federal and state law.
