SEN. REID PRAISES BIPARTISAN EFFORT ON MEDICAID
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "Today's vote to restore funding for Medicaid is an important victory for states, families, seniors, and children. It could not have been possible without a truly bipartisan effort and the strong leadership of Senator Gordon Smith and Senator Jeff Bingaman. They and the Senators from both sides of the aisle who voted their consciences and supported this amendment have brought us a step closer toward ensuring that this Congress will not deny millions of Americans access to health coverage."
