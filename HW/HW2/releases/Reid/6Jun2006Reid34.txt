SEN. REID: GOP SHOULD LISTEN TO AMERICAN PEOPLE ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the ongoing Republican campaign to undermine Americans' retirement security. Rep. Jim McCrery, the Republican Chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, today made clear that Bush Republicans are planning another attempt to privatize Social Security in 2007. The American people overwhelmingly rejected the same Republican plan in 2005.  
   "The American people were loud and clear when they rejected privatizing Social Security, but Bush Republicans don't seem to have listened. They're still trying to push the country in the wrong direction with this misguided approach. Democrats stand side by side with America's seniors in opposing the deep benefit cuts and massive new debt that the GOP's privatization scheme would require. Democrats are fighting for a new direction that will strengthen the retirement security of all Americans, instead of threatening the Social Security benefits of millions of hardworking Americans."
