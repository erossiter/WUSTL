SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON 4,000TH MILITARY DEATH IN IRAQ
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today on the 4,000th military death in the war in Iraq: 
   "Today, as a grateful and grieving nation, we mourn the 4,000 servicemembers who have died in this war and honor their families who have sacrificed so much in service to this nation. The 4,000th death is no less regrettable than the 3,999 before it or any that may yet come; it is but the latest reminder that we still owe our nation's bravest men and women a strategy to redeploy them from an endless civil war and make America more secure.
   "Last week we began the sixth year of this costly war and last month we began the second year of President Bush's surge - and yet Iraq's leaders refuse to take responsibility for their own country. Today we ask the President to be honest with the American people, and finally to answer the question his own commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, asked more than five years ago: 'Tell me how this ends.'"
