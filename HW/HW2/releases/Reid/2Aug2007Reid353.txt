SEN. REID: RATHER THAN PICKING FIGHTS, PRESIDENT SHOULD WORK WITH CONGRESS TO COMPLETE SPENDING BILLS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks this morning: 
  "Among other issues, this year the Senate has worked hard to change course in Iraq, strengthen homeland security, provide health care for our children and balance the budget. The President has stood in the way every time. His comments today once again made clear that he is more interested in picking fights than problem-solving. Our differences amount to less than one percent of the budget, less than half of what the President wants to spend on tax breaks for those with incomes over $1 million, and less than what we spend in two months on the war in Iraq.
  "Democrats are committed to completing these important spending bills - a priority made even more urgent by this Administration's reckless fiscal policy that in six years has turned a $236 billion surplus into a $248 billion deficit, leaving key domestic programs unfunded or under-funded. Instead of threatening vetoes and dodging accountability, we urge the President to work with us to fund our national priorities."
