SEN. REID: VICE PRESIDENT JUST DOESN'T GET IT
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on Vice President Cheney's appearance today on NBC's "Meet the Press."  
   "Vice President Cheney's influence over our nation's foreign policy and defense has made America less safe. The Vice President was a chief architect of the effort to manipulate intelligence to build a case for invading Iraq, he ignored the threat of insurgencies, he took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan, and today he made clear that he would do nothing different. Vice President Cheney's appearance today proves that he just doesn't get it."
