SEN. REID RENEWS COMMITMENT TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE
  I attended a reception yesterday celebrating the passage of minimum wage increases in our great state of Nevada.  
 In the 8-year absence of a federal minimum wage increase, Nevada voters approved initiatives to raise their state minimum wages to $6.15 an hour with annual indexing for inflation. The Nevada initiative passed with 68 percent and will raise the wages of more than 50,000 Nevadans. 
   Here in the Senate, we voted recently to raise the federal minimum wage. Unfortunately, it failed on a mainly party line vote. In a country that values work and the opportunity to get ahead, a hard day's work should bring a decent day's pay. But in America, this is not the case. We have mothers and fathers working full-time in minimum wage jobs, but still living in poverty and struggling to get ahead. 
   I will keep working to raise the federal minimum wage limit. The country should follow Nevada's example. 
   Increasing the minimum wage is not about helping teenagers earn more from their summer jobs. It is about helping families realize the promise of America. I am committed to increasing the federal minimum wage and providing workers a wage that is consistent with the rising cost of living.
