SEN. REID HOSTS FORECLOSURE MOBILE RESOURCE CENTER
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid hosted a Mobile Resource Center at Cashman Center today to provide a one stop shop for those facing the threat of home foreclosure. More than 400 people showed up for one-on-one assistance with housing counselors and mortgage servicers. Reid created the Mobile Resource Centers last year to address the foreclosure crisis facing Nevada and the nation. Reid organized today's stop in Las Vegas due to the large attendance last November. 
   "The purpose of these Resource Centers is to let those facing foreclosure know that there is help available," said Reid. "By bringing all these resources together in one location, Nevadans are able to take a proactive step, have face to face meetings, and find out what options are available to them as they work to keep their homes."
   Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate in the country. To help homeowners at risk of losing their homes, the centers bring together government agencies, lenders, mortgage servicers, and non-profit organizations to provide the information that homeowners need to keep their homes.
   Reid invited the following entities to participate in today's Mobile Resource Center:
   Agencies: Department of Housing and Urban Development
   Counselors: Clark County Legal Services, Consumer Credit Counseling of Nevada, Housing for Nevada, Neighborhood Housing Services (East Las Vegas CDC), Nevada Fair Housing, Nevada Legal Services, Women's Development Center, NID-HCA
   Mortgage Services: Chase, Citi, Countrywide, EMC/Bear Sterns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, GMAC Mortgage, Homecomings Financial, HSBC, Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo & Co.
