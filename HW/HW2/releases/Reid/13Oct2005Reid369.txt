DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN A PHOTO-OP?
  Today, Senate Democratic Communications Center spokesman Jim Manley released the following statement regarding President Bush's Iraq photo-op:  
   "The American people and our brave troops deserve better than a photo-op for the President and a pep-rally about Iraq. They deserve a plan. Unfortunately, today's event only served to highlight the fact that the president refuses to engage in a frank conversation about the realities on the ground. It is long past time for the Commander-in-Chief to provide a clear strategy for success. That will take more than photo-ops. It will require the President to come clean and answer basic questions about how he intends to get the job done."
   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S KEY QUESTIONS ON IRAQ 
   * How many capable Iraqi forces do we need before we can bring our troops home? 
   * What is the administration doing to forge a political consensus? 
   * What is the administration doing to make Iraq's neighbors and other countries a part of our strategy? 
   * What progress is being made on the reconstruction in Iraq and how do we know taxpayers dollars are being spent wisely?
