SEN. REID COMMENDS PASSAGE OF COURTHOUSE SECURITY BILL
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today hailed the passage of the Court House Security Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill that will strengthen courthouse security and offer greater protection for judges and their families.  
   "I am proud that Democratic and Republican Senators worked together pass this bill, which will help protect judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their family members," said Reid. "It will help judges do their jobs without worrying about their safety. This legislation is especially important to the people of Nevada where, last summer, a disturbed man attempted to take the life of Reno Judge Chuck Weller. I look forward to seeing this important bill become law." 
   Key provisions of the bill include: 
   * New resources for state courts to improve security for federal, state and local courts;
   * Enhanced penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses;
   * Limits on the personal information that judges must disclose on official forms;
   * Provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges.
   Reid was a cosponsor of the bill and, as Majority Leader, made the decision to bring the bill to the Senate floor. He has also sought special priority funding for security improvements at the Mills B. Lane Justice Complex - the courthouse where Judge Chuck Weller was shot in a sniper style shooting - for special priority funding for security improvements.
