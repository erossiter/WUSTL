   "Today, I sadly lost a colleague and a friend - a champion for the underdog who was the same kind, gracious man no matter how far he rose in Congress and in life. I will remember Bob Matsui for that big smile he carried. It spoke to what a good, optimistic person he was. In my own life, Bob was not just a great friend but someone I looked up to. My thoughts and prayers go out to Bob's wife Doris and the entire Matsui family. I will miss him very much."
