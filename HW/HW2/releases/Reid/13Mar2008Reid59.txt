SEN. REID RESPONSE TO DISINGENUOUS CLAIMS MADE BY SEN. DEMINT ON EARMARK PROVISIONS, BUDGET
  Rodell Mollineau, Communications Director for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, made the following statement today in response to disingenuous claims made by Senator Jim DeMint on earmark provisions and the budget. Senator DeMint has falsely claimed Democrats are holding up his legislation, but he has yet to even offer it. 
   "We are voting on amendments in the order in which they were offered. As of 1 p.m. Thursday, Senators DeMint and McCain have still not offered any amendment dealing with earmarks.
   "Senator DeMint has been talking about this amendment for three days. If it's so important to him, why didn't he offer his amendment earlier in the week, as more than 20 Senators did? He could be voting on his amendment right now instead of issuing disingenuous press statements.
   "Perhaps Senator DeMint has spent so much time over the last 15 months blocking legislation that he has forgotten how to offer it."
