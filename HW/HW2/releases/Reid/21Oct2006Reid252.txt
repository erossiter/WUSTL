SEN. REID BREAKS GROUND FOR NEW CLARK COUNTY SHOOTING PARK
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada attended a groundbreaking ceremony today for the new Clark County Shooting Park. The park, located on the north side of Moccasin Road between Decatur and Buffalo, will be the largest and most advanced public shooting range in the country. The facility will provide a venue for all shooting activities, from public day use shooting to international events and firearms training.  
   "This site will be - bar none - the finest shooting facility in the world," said Reid. "I have been fighting to make this shooting park a reality for more than five years and I'm proud of the partnerships between Clark County, sportsmen and women, local police, and many others that have made it possible. I look forward to coming back when the doors officially open."

   The park will feature a hunter education center, an indoor range, public day-use ranges, tactical ranges, rifle and pistol silhouette ranges, a benchrest range, a cowboy mounted shooting arena and a 1,200-yard high-power rifle range. Its major program features include firearms safety and education, youth safety programs, women's training/safety programs, public shooting, and shooting competitions. 
   Reid authored the legislation that conveyed the land for the shooting park and has secured over $58 million for construction and development of the site. 
   The world class shooting facility is projected to open in the fall of 2007.
