SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF NEW ENERGY SECRETARY
  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today on the nomination of Sam Bodman to serve as Secretary of Energy:  
   "Dr. Sam Bodman has a distinguished academic and political background, and a proven track record leading large government agencies, having twice been confirmed by the Senate to positions at the Department of Commerce and Department of Treasury. 
   "As Secretary of the Department of Energy, he will have his hands full meeting the challenges our country currently faces. I look forward to a thorough nomination process to determine how Dr. Bodman plans to reduce the skyrocketing cost of oil and natural gas, secure our energy infrastructure, ensure our electrical grid is modern, reliable and safe, and ensure that our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile is safe and reliable. 
   "I had a long and productive conversation with Dr. Bodman early this morning. During our conversation, I asked him to keep an open mind about the wide array of issues facing the Department. I stressed to Dr. Bodman that, while I understand he serves at the pleasure of a President who supports the project, I hoped he would take a fresh look at alternatives to the proposed uclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. He agreed to do so."
