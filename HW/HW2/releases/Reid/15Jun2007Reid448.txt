SEN. REID: NEVADA NATIONAL GUARD MORE PREPARED THAN MOST STATES
  A front-page story by USA Today detailed how America's National Guard is being taxed as a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, more than half of all states have "60 percent or less of their authorized equipment." Fortunately, Nevada is in a much better position than most states. While the Nevada National Guard currently has deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the report found that 90 percent of our Guard's equipment is available to respond in the event of a disaster here at home. Only four other states fell into that same category. 
   "I am glad that the Nevada National Guard has much better equipment levels than we see in most other states," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. "But the reality still remains that a lot of our equipment is left overseas or too damaged to use for training or emergency response. I have worked hard to make sure our state has the resources it needs to respond in the event of an emergency and I will continue working to ensure that the Nevada National Guard is prepared to protect Nevadans."
  "The Nevada National Guard enjoys incredible support from our entire congressional delegation and over the years Senator Reid has certainly led those efforts," said Major General (Nev.) Cindy Kirkland, The Adjutant General for Nevada.
