SEN. REID: PRESIDENT BUSH TURNS HIS BACK ON AMERICA'S CHILDREN IN VETOING HEALTH CARE REFORM
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after President Bush vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007:  
   "Never has it been clearer how detached President Bush is from the priorities of the American people. By vetoing a bipartisan bill to renew the successful Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), President Bush is denying health care to millions of low-income kids in America. 
   "Congress will fight hard to override President Bush's heartless veto. Not only is this a critical program - one that will improve the lives of 6.6 million low-income children currently in CHIP and provide health insurance to 4 million more - but the vast majority of the American people know giving kids the care they need is the right thing to do. Bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and the governors of nearly every state, healthcare providers and patient advocates, rural and urban Americans, and citizens of all ages are united in strong support of our nation's children. With today's veto, President Bush has turned his back on America's children and he stands alone."
