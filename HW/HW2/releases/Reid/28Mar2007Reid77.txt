SEN. REID'S LEGISLATION TO INVESTIGATE BREAST CANCER RECEIVES STAR POWER
  Singer-songwriter and breast cancer survivor Sheryl Crow joined Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada today to promote his legislation that would create a national strategy to research the links between breast cancer and the environment.  
   "Every two minutes, another woman in the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer. Many of these women have no family history or known genetic links to breast cancer," said Reid. "My bill would help to identify the role of the environment in the development of breast cancer so we may learn more about this complex illness, including ways to prevent, treat and ultimately cure it." 
   "Sheryl Crow's personal story of breast cancer survival offers hope to women across the country and in Nevada, and now Congress has the opportunity to offer hope through this important legislation," Reid added. Crow was in Washington with the National Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC) to draw attention to this important legislation. 
   "I'm here to support NBCC and Senator Reid's efforts to get the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act passed now," said Crow. "As a breast cancer survivor, and someone who cares deeply about women's health, I want answers to the question of what causes breast cancer and how to prevent it. BCERA will help find some of these answers." The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act will authorize $40 million each year for five years to establish and operate multi-institutional, multidisciplinary Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Centers of Excellence. Each Center would include institutions with different areas of expertise working together to tackle the same problems from different angles, as well as collaborating with community organizations in the area. Modeled after the successful Breast Cancer Research Program at the Department of Defense, grants would be awarded under a competitive, peer-reviewed process that involves patient advocates.
