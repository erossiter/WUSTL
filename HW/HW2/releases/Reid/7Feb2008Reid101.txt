SEN. REID: SENATE DEMOCRATS IMPROVE HOUSE STIMULUS PLAN TO HELP SENIORS, VETERANS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today announcing a bipartisan agreement on the economic stimulus plan: 
  "Two weeks ago most Senate Republicans were quick to endorse the House stimulus bill without any revisions, even though they knew it was inadequate. I said back then that the Senate had two obligations: to improve the bill and to deliver a timely, temporary and targeted bill by Presidents' Day Weekend. Senate Democrats have kept those promises.
  "It is our responsibility to pass the strongest bill that we can. So I make no apologies for fighting to provide economic relief to as many deserving Americans as possible. If we would have listened to the advice of the White House, House and Senate Republicans, 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans would have been left behind. 
  "We were able to make the House bill better, and while I am pleased with that result, there is still more to do. Because of our hard work to improve this bill, we were able to get 59 votes - and we will work to find that 60th vote so we can continue to strengthen our shaky economy in the coming weeks and months. We will continue fighting to help those who have lost their jobs in the Bush economy, help small businesses suffering in a looming recession, help American families pay their heating bills as energy prices rise, and help American families avoid foreclosure amid a national housing crisis."
