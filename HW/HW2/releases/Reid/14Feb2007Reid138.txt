SEN. REID PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF CONTINUING RESOLUTION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement praising today's passage of a Continuing Resolution needed to fund the government for the rest of the year.  
   "Today's action is another step towards cleaning up the fiscal mess left by the 109th Congress. Democrats have now accomplished more for fiscal responsibility in six weeks than Republicans managed to achieve in six years. This new Continuing Resolution puts benefits for our nation's veterans and educational opportunities for our nation's children ahead of wasteful spending and special interest pork. Last November the American people demanded change. The Democratic Congress is already delivering results, and is taking this country in a new direction."
