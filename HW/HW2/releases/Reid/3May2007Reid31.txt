SEN. REID: NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER REMINDS US OF SHARED VALUES
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement on the occasion of the National Day of Prayer:  
   "We pause today to mark the National Day of Prayer, reflecting on the role prayer plays in our lives and the freedom all Americans enjoy to exercise the faith of their choice. The National Day of Prayer reminds us that people of all faiths, beliefs and perspectives can come together, each in his own way, for a common purpose. As far away as the Middle East, as close as our own communities and even in the halls of government - it is all too clear how our differences divide us. However, all of us, despite ideological, political, and religious differences, are faithfully working to provide for the common good. I remain prayerful and hopeful that this shared goal will improve our nation and humanity."
