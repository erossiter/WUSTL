SEN REID: DEMOCRATS WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH ENERGY BILL THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS, INCREASES ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today: 
   "Democrats are committed to protecting consumers, increasing our energy independence, strengthening our economy and reducing global warming emissions. After the immigration debate, I will move forward with an energy bill that protects consumers against high gas prices, punishes price-gougers and increases our supply of American-made biofuels. For too long, this Administration has made it a priority to give tax breaks to oil and gas companies even as prices have doubled and profits have soared. We believe it is past time to move our national security, economic and environmental priorities ahead of oil industry profits."
