SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON EARTH DAY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, commemorating the 38th Earth Day: 
   April 22, 2008
   "On Earth Day, as every day, Democrats are working to ensure the United States is a leader in environmental protection. Americans have a right to expect their government is working to make the air clean, the water drinkable, and the environment healthier and more sustainable.
   "Its benefits go beyond just our environment - it will improve this weakening economy, one that sees new oil and gas price records shattered every day, including yesterday. Investing in a better environment means investing in jobs in places like my home state of Nevada - the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy.
   "That is why, between last Earth Day and today, the Democratic Congress has acted to make U.S. more energy efficient and independent, raise fuel-efficiency standards, set ambitious standards for renewable fuels grown in America, improved our nation's water infrastructure and provide Western wildfire relief.
   "The Bush Administration and most Republicans in Congress think our energy and environmental future includes dismantling regulations that keep our air and water clean and protect our natural resources. And they have blocked our efforts to invest in renewable electricity standards instead of Big Oil. On this 38th anniversary of Earth Day, Democrats call on this Administration and our Republican colleagues to stand up for our planet to reduce carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy and lessen our dependence on oil.
   "Instead of empty rhetoric, it is time to take tangible steps to protect not just our nation, but our planet. Democrats will continue to lead the way to do so."
