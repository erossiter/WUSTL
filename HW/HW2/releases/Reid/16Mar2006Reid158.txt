SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GOV. KEMPTHORNE
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the nomination of Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to be Secretary of the Interior.  
 "I congratulate Governor Kempthorne on his nomination to head the Department of the Interior. I have known Dirk Kempthorne for many years, serving with him in the House and on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and I have great respect for him. Dirk and I both come from Western states, so I know he understands the issues facing our region. 
 "About 87 percent of Nevada's land is managed by federal agencies, which creates unique challenges that I look forward to working on with Governor Kempthorne. I hope that together we can improve on the Bush Administration's public lands policies of the last five years, and especially that we can protect the intent of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act."
