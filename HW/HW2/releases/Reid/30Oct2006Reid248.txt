SEN. REID CELEBRATES NEVADA DAY
  Sen. Harry Reid issued the following statement in recognition of Nevada Day:  
   "As Nevada approaches its 142nd birthday, we should all reflect on our state's rich heritage and all it has become. The Silver State became the nation's 36th state in 1864. Since then, Nevada has grown to become a proud national symbol of industry, culture, and diversity. 
   "Every year, we welcome tens of thousands of people from across the Nation who choose to make Nevada their home. We are one of the fastest growing states in the country. All Nevadans, past and present, have made the Battle Born State what it is today. From the glittering lights of the Las Vegas Strip to the quiet strength of the bristlecone pines in the Great Basin, Nevada is a place we are proud to call home. Nevada is home to the majestic Ruby Mountains, the world-famous Black Rock Desert, magnificent Lake Tahoe, hard-working mining towns, and of course, Las Vegas, the world-class destination where millions of people from around the world come to visit every year. 
   "So whether your home is Reno, Las Vegas, or any of the beautiful rural communities that remain the heart of our State, home means Nevada. This Nevada Day, let's take a moment to reflect on how wonderful Nevada truly is and honor our rich history and heritage."
