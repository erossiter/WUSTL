SEN. REID: BENCHMARKS IN IRAQ MUST INCLUDE CONSEQUENCES
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks on the war in Iraq: 
   "Democrats remain united in our efforts to change course in Iraq and enact a strategy that makes America more secure. While we welcome the President's comments today, a bipartisan majority of Congress has already concluded that we need more than simple benchmarks without any consequences to accomplish this goal. 
   "In addition to fully funding the troops, Congress believes the best way to change course in Iraq is to redeploy our forces from Iraq; refocus the mission of the remaining forces on security, training and counter-terror operations; launch a diplomatic, economic and political offensive; and hold Iraq accountable, including meaningful benchmarks for the Iraqi government and security forces - and consequences if they do not."
