Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued the following statement on the negotiations between Service Employees International Union and Universal Health Services. 
 "I applaud the nurses on the front lines for agreeing to come back to the negotiating table and am encouraged by Universal Health Services' decision to reconsider the proposal by bipartisan leaders for a cooling off period to re-open negotiations. I encourage the leadership of UHS and SEIU to work in good faith to reach an equitable agreement to avert a skilled nursing shortage in our emergency rooms and ensure the health and safety of Southern Nevadans."
