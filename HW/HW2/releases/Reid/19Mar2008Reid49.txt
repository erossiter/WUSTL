SEN. REID MEETS WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met today with the Nevada chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). During the meeting, Randy Lavigne, executive director of the Nevada AIA, presented Reid with the chapter's Livable Communities Award in recognition of his work to make Nevada a leader in the development of renewable energy.  
   The Nevada AIA adopted a platform last fall to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, the AIA strongly supports green-building standards and building efficiency codes. 
   "It is a great honor to receive the Nevada AIA's Livable Communities Award," said Reid. "This organization shares my vision for making the Silver State a leader in the renewable energy revolution. I commend them for their hard work and dedication to bringing awareness to energy issues within the architectural community."
