DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL SECURITY INDEX SHOWS FAILURE OF BUSH SECURITY POLICIES
  This week the American people learned the extent of the Bush Administration's failure to secure and protect America. America's intelligence community has now concluded that the Bush Administration's failed policies have made terrorism worse, the military is in open revolt over the damage those policies have done to the Army, and a new book by Bob Woodward suggests that the Bush Administration is in a state of denial.  
  Below please find the monthly National Security Index, prepared by the Democratic Policy Committee, which details the true state of America's national security. Five years of failed Bush Republican policies have made America less safe, and Democrats are fighting to take this country in a new direction.
