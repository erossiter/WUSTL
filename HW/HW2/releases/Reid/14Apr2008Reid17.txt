SEN. REID: GET YOUR REBATE, FILE YOUR TAXES
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid reminded Nevadans to file their federal taxes so they can receive their tax rebate. "The only way to get a rebate is to file a tax return. If you are a senior, a veteran, or if you don't typically file a tax return, make sure that you file one this year so that you get your check," said Senator Reid. Most Nevadans are expected to receive a $600 check. 
   As a result of Reid's leadership, Nevada's seniors and veterans, who were left out of the original economic stimulus plan, will also receive checks. To get more info on tax rebate checks go here. Senate Democrats are working to direct tax relief towards Nevadans struggling with the weakened economy. The proposed Democratic budget includes tax cuts to working families and continues the $1,000 per child tax credit, marriage-penalty relief, and the 10-percent tax bracket.
