SEN. REID COSPONSORS BILL TO PROVIDE PERMANENT STATE SALES TAX DEDUCTION
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada is working to protect Nevada taxpayers and the state's economy by cosponsoring legislation that provides a permanent state sales tax deduction.  
  "This legislation will cut taxes and restore fairness to our tax system. It is the right thing to do for Nevada's working families," said Reid. "Making the sales tax deduction permanent will come as a relief to Nevadans who struggle everyday to make ends meet." 
   Reid added, "The importance of making this deduction permanent was made clear with the debacle surrounding last year's temporary extension of the sales tax deduction. Because the last Congress waited until December 9 to extend the deduction for 2006, the IRS has announced that it is unable to process returns from taxpayers claiming the sales tax deduction until February 3 and that any electronic returns sent before this date that claim the sales tax deduction will be returned to taxpayers. We can avoid these problems in the future by passing this legislation and making the deduction permanent." 
   Based on data from 2004 income tax returns, about 327,500 Nevadans benefited from the deduction of state and local sales taxes.
