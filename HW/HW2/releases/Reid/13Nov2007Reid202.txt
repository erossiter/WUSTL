SEN. REID: EVEN AS WAR-COST ESTIMATES CLIMB, PRESIDENT BUSH AGAIN VETOES AMERICA'S PRIORITIES AT HOME
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after President Bush vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill: 
   "It is unfathomable that on the very day the Joint Economic Committee released a report finding the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could reach $3.5 trillion at the expense of America's priorities at home, President Bush has vetoed a Labor-HHS-Education bill that addresses many of those critical needs. The bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill he vetoed increases funding for programs to improve K-12 student performance, makes college more affordable, supports life-saving medical research and provides relief for families struggling with rising home heating costs. And it provides money for veterans' employment programs, homeless veterans, and research to help those suffering from traumatic brain injuries.
   "Democrats want to work together with the President to find a way forward to make critical investments in our country, but the President must come to the table in good faith. Until that time, we will work to override this veto because President Bush's priorities are simply not those of the American people. We also hope Republicans, who initially overwhelmingly voted for this bill, will stand up to the President's irresponsible veto and stand with the American people."
