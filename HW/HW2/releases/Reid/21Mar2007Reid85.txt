DEMOCRATIC BUDGET ADDRESSES NEVADA PRIORITIES
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada said the federal budget drafted by Democrats will cut taxes for Nevada's working families, while addressing issues important to our state including education, health care, and homeland security. The Senate began considering the budget today and a final vote is expected on Friday.  
   "Our budget restores fiscal discipline, addresses Nevada's needs, and puts the working families first," said Reid. "Just like every family in Nevada, the federal government has a responsibility to balance its budget, something that hasn't been done for the last several years. Our budget pays down the nation's debt while cutting taxes for working families. This budget also increases our investment in education, will reduce our reliance on oil by investing in renewable energy and alternative fuels, increases access to affordable health care, and keeps our promises to America's veterans." 
   Revenue for the budget will come from cracking down on tax cheats, closing loopholes, preventing the wealthiest Americans from hiding income overseas, and improving taxpayer services to assist honest taxpayers who need help complying with the tax code. 
   WHAT THIS BUDGET MEANS FOR NEVADA AND THE COUNTRY 
   Education: 
   * Provides a $6.1 billion increase over the President's budget for education programs. The budget restores all of the President's cuts and program eliminations and increases funding for No Child Left Behind programs, Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and Pell Grants.
   Health care: 
   * Reserve fund for the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known in Nevada as Nevada Check Up. The reserve fund provides for funding to maintain and support Nevada's efforts to cover more people who otherwise would lack health insurance coverage.
   Veterans: 
   * Provides $43.1 billion in 2008 for veterans programs, including medical care. $3.5 billion increase over Bush.
   Homeland Security: 
   * Keeps or increases funding for important Nevada grants for Firefighters, Local Law Enforcement and Terrorism Prevention Grants, Urban Area Grants, and State formula grants. The President's proposed budget cuts funding for these grants.
   Energy: 
   * Adds nearly $400 million to the President's request for energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs. This money will help tap Nevada's infinite, renewable resources. Investing in alternative energy would create approximately 3,000 jobs in Nevada alone.
