SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF FEDERAL BUDGET
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed the Democratic budget: 
   "This is a good budget that focuses on issues important to Nevadans. First and foremost it points our economy in the right direction once again. It lowers taxes for Nevada's middle class and helps make health care, college tuition, and energy more affordable. It is a fiscally responsible, balanced budget that adheres to the pay-as-you-go budget rules that created the surpluses of the late 1990's and created millions of jobs.
   "To create more good-paying jobs in America and protect the ones we already have, the budget invests in education, math, science, engineering, and technology. It makes smart investments in renewable energy, creating thousands of new jobs in Nevada. The budget also strengthens national security, restores military readiness, and honors America's commitment to troops and veterans. Finally the budget increases funding, by 25 percent more than the President requested, for Indian health services and facilities construction. This is a dramatic increase to Indian Health Services which has an annual budget of approximately $3.5 billion."
