SEN. REID RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ON IRAQ
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid commented on President Bush's remarks on Iraq and Congressional hearings involving General Petraeus's and Ambassador Crocker's testimonies. "This week's hearings gave the Bush Administration a chance to answer two fundamental questions that would indicate whether we are succeeding in Iraq: 'Has this war made us any safer?' and 'Are our troops any closer to being able to get out of Iraq?' On both counts, the answer is no," said Senator Reid. 
   After nearly a year, the Administration is finally heeding the call of Senator Reid and other Congressional and military leaders to decrease troop deployments to 12 months. But President Bush's insistence on keeping indefinitely 142,000 troops in Iraq further damages our national security and our military's readiness.
   Senator Reid added, "If the President is genuine about providing our troops with the rest, recuperation and training they need, then I call on him and his allies in Congress to support Democratic efforts to codify his announcement into law and also ensure that our troops have sufficient time here at home. In the coming weeks, I plan to bring the dwell-time bill to the floor for a vote, and it is my hope Republicans will not block this crucial legislation for a third time."
