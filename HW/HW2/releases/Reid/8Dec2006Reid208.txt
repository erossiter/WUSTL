SEN. REID: CONGRESS MUST IMPROVE MEDICARE PART D
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement on the third anniversary of President Bush's signing of Medicare Part D.  
 "In the three years since President Bush signed Medicare Part D into law, the prescription drug plan has not delivered all it should have for the seniors it was supposed to help. All Democrats, whether they voted for or against Part D three years ago, are committed to improving this program now and giving our seniors the relief they need. Next year, Congress can begin to help by repealing the ban on Medicare negotiating lower drug prices, making the program easier to understand, improving the low-income subsidy, and working to eliminate the gaps in coverage that penalize seniors struggling with the choice between food and medicine. Working together, we can move America forward to ensure seniors get the support they deserve."
