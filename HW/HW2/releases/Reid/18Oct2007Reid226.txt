SEN. REID: WE MUST CREATE JOBS BY TAPPING INTO NEVADA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released a report about the possible economic impact of developing Nevada's renewable energy industry, including the thousands of jobs that could be created primarily in rural areas.  
   "Renewable resources can provide the affordable and reliable energy we need, while creating an industry which can make Nevadans proud and prosperous. So many states, including Arizona and California, are creating jobs by actively developing this industry. If those other states can do it, then Nevada certainly can do it and be the leader and catalyst in our country's energy revolution. We have endless renewable energy sources that are being wasted everyday that we do not tap into them. The sooner we invest in renewable energy, the sooner we can put more Nevadans to work, meet our state's energy demands, and protect our air."
