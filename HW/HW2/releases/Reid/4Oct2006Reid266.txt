SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS WILL PROTECT AMERICA'S WORKERS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement after the National Labor Relations Board handed down a 3-2 party-line decision that will severely limit the legal rights of millions of workers. The ruling will reclassify shift workers as supervisors thereby eliminating the ability of millions to join a union so they can bargain collectively for better wages, health care and retirement benefits.  
   "The Bush administration and their appointees have led a continuous assault against America's working families. Senate Democrats will work to protect the rights of workers. We will seek to overturn anti-worker decisions of the NLRB when the new Congress convenes in January."
