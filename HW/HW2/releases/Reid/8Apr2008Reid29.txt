SEN. REID LAUNCHES NEW WEB SITE
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid today launched his completely redesigned Web site, reid.senate.gov. This new site will help Nevadans keep up-to-date on the work Reid is doing on their behalf as their senior senator, as well as in his position as majority leader of the United States Senate. 
  "This site uses the very latest in online technology to keep Nevadans informed about the work we're doing in the Senate to make our state an even better place to live and raise a family," said Reid. "In addition to staying updated, they can learn more about the state and other members of Nevada's congressional delegation, and sign up for regular emails with late-breaking information."
  Redesigned with enhanced multimedia features and improved access to information, the site contains detailed information about the issues on which Reid is working for Nevada and the services which his office can provide. It also contains links for sharing comments and questions with the senator, as well as contact information for his Washington and three Nevada offices.
  On the site, people can also sign up to receive the Reid report - the senator's twice-monthly e-mail to Nevadans informing them of current happenings in the Senate that directly affect the state.
