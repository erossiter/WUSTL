SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL FALLON CANCER CLUSTER STUDY
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued the following statement regarding the CDC's results in the Fallon cancer cluster study:  
 "The Centers for Disease Control believe that some of the data gathered warrants further investigation. It is critically important that we continue working with the nation's top experts to investigate the cause of the Fallon's cancer cluster. I've continuously fought for the sick children of Fallon and families who have lost loved ones and they deserve nothing less. 
 "While the exact cause of the cancer cluster is still unknown, I remain committed to finding answers. We must continue our work to help those who have already been affected by the cluster and to protect future generations of Fallon families."
