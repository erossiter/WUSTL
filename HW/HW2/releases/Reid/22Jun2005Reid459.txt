SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ON IRAQ
  Statement by Sen. Reid on Democratic Caucus on Iraq:
   "In recent weeks members of our caucus have come to me to express the concerns they are hearing from their constituents about the Administration's present policy in Iraq and its failure to present the facts about the war to the American people.  
   "It has become clear that the Administration's plan for Iraq is adrift and increasingly disconnected from the reality on the ground. 
   "The caucus meeting was constructive. We discussed the difficult problems we are facing in Iraq, and what additional steps can be taken to support our armed forces and their families. 
   "We agreed on two things. First, we need to give the men and women of our military everything they need to carry out their difficult mission. Second, the President needs to come forward with a plan to succeed in Iraq in his speech to the nation next week and his Administration will be held accountable for its performance."
