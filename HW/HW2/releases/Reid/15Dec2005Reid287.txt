SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI ELECTIONS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on today's Iraqi parliamentary elections:  
   "The elections in Iraq are an historic moment and another important milestone. Americans salute the courage and dedication of our troops who made the elections possible and the brave Iraqis who cast their ballots. By voting today, the Iraqi people expressed hope for their government and their country. 
   "Today's elections must signal the beginning of the crucial transition between the Iraqi and American governments. The next fourth months will be a critical time for Iraqis to assume more control of their country and allow for a successful transition in 2006, which will bring significant numbers of our troops home."
