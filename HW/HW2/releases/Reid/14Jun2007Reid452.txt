SEN. REID DENOUNCES DOE FOR USING STATE WATER TO DRILL AT YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today released the following statement on the news that the Department of Energy stole water from the state to drill rigs at Yucca Mountain. 
   "News that the Energy Department has been stealing water from our state is a slap in the face to the people of Nevada who overwhelmingly oppose building a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain. Using state water resources to lubricate even one drill bit in the pursuit of turning our state into the nation's nuclear dumping ground is one too many. We cannot allow the federal government to use Nevada's water supply to sell us down the river when it comes to nuclear waste. I will continue to leverage my leadership position in the Senate to prevent nuclear waste from being shipped to Yucca Mountain."
