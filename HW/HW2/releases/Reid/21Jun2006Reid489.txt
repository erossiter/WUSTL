SENS. REID, ENSIGN DELIVER $486K TO LANDER COUNTY
Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign announce today that Nevada counties will receive a record level of funding from the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program this month. Lander County will receive $486,107 that is typically used to fund teachers, police, fire and ambulance services, and critical infrastructure.  
 "I am extremely pleased to know that Lander County will soon receive its share of PILT funding to improve local schools, police and fire departments, and water and road systems," said Reid. "Because I know how important PILT is to Nevada, especially rural counties, I am already working to ensure that next year's funding levels are even higher." 
 "This is certainly good news for Nevada's rural communities, which depend on PILT to make up for lost tax revenue," Ensign said. "Senator Reid and I have always made it a priority to look out for our rural counties when it comes to the PILT process and we will certainly continue to do that." 
 The PILT program provides federal payments to local governments (usually counties) that help offset losses in property taxes due to nontaxable Federal lands within their boundaries. It provides funding to county governments for essential services like roads, law enforcement and education. 
 Recently Sen. Reid led a bipartisan effort, joined by Senator Ensign and 55 fellow senators, to encourage the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee panel to increase PILT funding to $240 million in 2007. 
 Nevada is comprised of almost 87% public land, including 48 million acres of BLM land and 6 million acres of national forest land. PILT funds are distributed to counties based on a formula that evaluates the total acreage of federal lands and the size of the local population. 
 All 17 Nevada counties receive PILT payments. This year Nevada counties will receive over $14 million.
