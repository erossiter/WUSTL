SEN. REID: ON IMMIGRATION BILL, REPUBLICANS CONTINUE OBSTRUCTIONISM
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today after Republicans voted against ending debate on the immigration reform bill: 
   "I am deeply disappointed that so many of our Republican colleagues have blocked tough, fair and practical immigration reform. The White House has had six months to work with Senate Republicans toward a solution, yet it failed to show the necessary leadership to get this bill passed.
   "Senate Democrats have given Senate Republicans ample time to amend this bill, twice extending the timeline for debate. We have gone out of our way to make this process fair and equitable, moving through more than 40 amendments - including 20 yesterday alone. Yet as much as they talk about the importance and urgency of immigration reform, a group of Senate Republicans has irresponsibly turned its back on border security and the 12 million people who are living in the shadows of our society. The immigration system remains broken. Senate Republicans and the White House must come to the table in good faith if we are to fix it."
