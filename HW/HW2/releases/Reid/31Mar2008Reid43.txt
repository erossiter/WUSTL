SEN. REID LEADING THE WAY IN ADDRESSING NEVADA'S FORECLOSURE CRISIS
  This week the Senate is working on a bill to address Nevada's housing crisis and help Nevadans avoid foreclosure. Nevada Senator Harry Reid is cosponsoring the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 that will keep families facing foreclosure in their homes, help other families avoid foreclosures in the future, and help communities already harmed by foreclosure to recover. "America is facing a housing crisis, and nowhere are the effects seen more than in Nevada" said Reid. "After spending the past two weeks with fellow Nevadans throughout the state, it is clear that we are all feeling the effects of a weakened economy, and more needs to be done to keep people in their homes. That is why the Senate will begin debate this week on a bill that addresses America's housing crisis." Senate Republicans blocked an earlier attempt to debate the bill last month. 
   Senator Reid is doing everything he can in Washington and in Nevada to bring an end to this crisis. He joined Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute on Monday to discuss Democratic efforts to address the housing crisis. Last month he organized a Mobile Resource Center in Las Vegas to connect Nevadans with state and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and lenders in order to help them with their mortgage situations.
