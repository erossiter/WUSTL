SEN. REID ANNOUNCES DEMOCRATS ANTICIPATED COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS FOR 110TH CONGRESS
  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) today announced the committee assignments he anticipates members of the Democratic Caucus will hold during the 110th Congress.  
   As required by Senate rules, Senator Reid will meet with the incoming Senate Republican Leader following the Republican Caucus's leadership elections to negotiate and finalize the Majority/Minority make-up of each Committee. 
   Outside Foreign Relations, which would gain one member from both the Majority and Minority under this anticipated plan, the number of Senators placed on each committee reflects the committee make-up agreed to in the 108th Congress, the last time there was a 51-49 Senate.
