SEN. REID LEADS PASSAGE OF BILL TO FUND NEVADA CHECK-UP
  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed a bill to renew and improve coverage for the 6.6 million children currently in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covered nearly 40,000 children in Nevada though Nevada Check-Up last year: 
   "More than 100,000 of the 400,000 uninsured Nevadans are children. That's just unacceptable," said Reid. "The Senate did the right thing by passing this important legislation and I am proud we did it in a bipartisan way. Thanks to the efforts of both Democrats and Republicans, our state will be allotted nearly $63 million in FY08 in addition to carry-over and other bonus funds to provide health care for Nevada children.
   "Ten years after Congress created the program, we have reduced the number of low-income, uninsured children by one-third, covering more than 10 million kids. Today, while 6.6 million children have health care thanks to this outstanding program, the cost of quality health care is still prohibitive for too many. We urge the President - who ran on the promise to enroll millions of more children in CHIP - to keep his word rather than deny kids in working families the doctor visits and medicines they need when they're sick and the checkups they need to stay well."
