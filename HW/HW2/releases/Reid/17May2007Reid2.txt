SEN. REID: AGREEMENT WILL HELP START DEBATE ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement in response to the bipartisan agreement on immigration reform: 
   "I applaud the hard work of the bipartisan group of Senators who have proposed a new approach to comprehensive immigration reform. Their agreement can serve as a starting point for the Senate debate next week. I have serious concerns about some aspects of this proposal, including the structure of the temporary worker program and undue limitations on family immigration. We need to improve the bill as it moves through the legislative process.
   "Comprehensive immigration reform needs to be tough, fair and practical. We need to enhance border security, toughen workplace enforcement, bring 12 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and reunite families. We must also have a workable program for new workers to come and help meet the needs of our economy and improve the fabric of our society."
