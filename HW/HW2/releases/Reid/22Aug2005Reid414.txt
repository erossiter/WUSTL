FROM IRAQ TO VETERANS, PRESIDENT FAILS TO LEVEL WITH AMERICAN PEOPLE
  Senate Democratic Communications Center spokesman Jim Manley released the following statement today following the President's VFW speech:  
   "Once again the President missed an opportunity to level with the American people. On Iraq, he chose to deliver the same 'stay the course' rhetoric, despite the fact that it is increasingly obvious to most Americans that his policy is rudderless and adrift. On veterans, he claimed that those who've worn the uniform are his top priority, but failed to reconcile that statement with his budget that denied or delayed access to health care for millions of veterans. After sending hundreds of thousands of Americans overseas to risk their lives for their country, it is hard to understand why this President won't acknowledge his mistakes and do right by our troops and our veterans."
