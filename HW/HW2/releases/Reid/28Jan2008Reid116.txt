SEN. REID MEETS WITH NEVADANS WHO WILL ATTEND STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met today with five Nevadans he invited to attend the President's State of the Union Address.  
   "I appreciate these Nevadans for accepting my invitation to attend the State of the Union address tonight," said Reid. "Their presence will serve as a reminder to the president that what he says tonight and the actions that follow have a tremendous impact on everyday people. From educators to business leaders, to first responders, veterans and troops, people in Nevada are paying close attention to the words President Bush speaks. More importantly we will all be paying attention to his actions that follow during the last year of his presidency."
   Reid's invited guests include Kari Frilot, CEO, Pahrump Valley Chamber of Commerce; Mike Haley, Washoe County Sheriff; Susan Holecheck, Mayor of Mesquite, NV; Jesse Tafoya, Army Lt.; Melanie Teemant, 2007 Teacher of the Year from Bob Miller Middle School.
