SEN. REID PRAISES TAHOE FIREFIGHTERS
  Speaking from the Senate floor today, Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement in recognition of the firefighters battling the fire at Lake Tahoe. 
   "Mr. President, my state of Nevada boasts one of America's great natural treasures, a place that Mark Twain called 'the fairest picture the whole earth affords.'
   "Yet as we speak, hundreds of firefighters are risking their lives to contain the terrible wildfire raging in Lake Tahoe. By latest count, 2,500 acres - Four square miles - have burned. More than 220 homes have been lost and another 500 are in danger. Less than ten percent of the blaze has been contained.
   "The one bright spot in this tragedy is that as of now, no injuries have been reported, and we hope and pray that the residents and emergency teams remain safe. I also want to point out that many of the firefighters who are battling this inferno are doing so while their own homes and their own families are in harm's way.
   "Think about that for a minute. With their own homes at risk, with their own families in harm's way, they are working to protect the homes and families of others. What bravery.
   We owe a great deal to these men and women, and we will surely owe them a lot more before this awful fire is brought under control. They are doing incredible work."
