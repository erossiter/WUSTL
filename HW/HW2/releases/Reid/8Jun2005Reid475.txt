SEN. REID EXPRESSES DEEP CONCERN OVER BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S OUT OF TOUCH PRIORITIES
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement upon news that the Bush administration edited climate change reports: 
   "I am deeply concerned to learn that the White House has once again put its partisan agenda ahead of the needs of the American people. By repeatedly editing government documents on global warming to cater to the special interests, the Bush administration has once again shown that it will abuse its power by any means necessary.
   "What concerns me most is the pattern of behavior this incident points to. From putting radical ideology ahead of scientific reasoning on stem cell research to the politicization of the FDA and the falsification of data and records regarding the safety of Yucca Mountain, the Bush administration has shown a brazen disregard for sound science. The American people are entitled to expect that their elected officials would allow independent experts and scientific research be left untainted by political interests. 
   "It is time for the Republicans and the President to stop their abuse of power and focus on the needs of American people. Democrats believe it is time to cleanse Washington and restore the commonsense center to fight for the priorities of American families. By keeping America strong, expanding economic opportunity, making health care more affordable and available, putting America on the path of energy independence and making retirement more secure for all Americans, Democrats are putting the people's agenda first. We hope the Republicans in Congress and the President will join us in this effort."
