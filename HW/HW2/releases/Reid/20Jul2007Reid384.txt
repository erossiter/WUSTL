SEN. REID, SPEAKER PELOSI CALL ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO JOIN CONGRESS ON BUDGET THAT REFLECTS AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi today sent President Bush the following letter, requesting a meeting to ensure the FY2008 appropriations bill funds America's priorities: 
   July 20, 2007
   The President
  The White House
  Washington, DC 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   We write to request a meeting with you to see if we can reach agreement on FY2008 appropriations issues and avoid a protracted battle over relatively small differences.
   As you know, Congress approved a bipartisan budget earlier this year that would reach balance by 2012 while reinstating strong rules against future legislation that increases the deficit. Although our respective budgets clearly reflect many differences in priorities, we actually are remarkably close to agreement about the overall level of spending. In fact, the difference between our respective levels of total appropriations amounts to less than one percent of the federal budget.
   Many of our individual appropriations bills have also had strong bipartisan support. Our committee chairmen have worked closely with their minority members to develop spending plans that build on your work where we agree, and reflect a broad, bipartisan approach to the services the federal government provides.
   Given our relatively minor difference over total spending levels, we are hopeful we can quickly reach an agreement that funds America's priorities in a timely manner, so long as both sides negotiate in good faith.
   Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you.
   Best regards,
   Harry Reid
  Nancy Pelosi
