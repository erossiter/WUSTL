SEN. REID SPEAKS AT C.A.V.E. DEDICATION
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada spoke about a new technology that can help military and environmental research at the dedication of the Computational Research and Visualization Building, or C.A.V.E., at the Desert Research Institute.   
  "The C.A.V.E. at the Desert Research Institute will provide scientists and researchers with the perspective needed to work on some of the most advanced experiments ever conceived, and it will all take place in Nevada," said Reid. "I am happy that I was able to secure funding for this magnificent piece of technology." 
   The C.A.V.E. is an advanced piece of visualization equipment that will give scientists the capability to create 3-D projections of anything, large or small, simple or complex. 3-D visualization technology is incredibly useful to scientists, giving them an opportunity to actually "see" and quantify the phenomenon they are researching. 
   Reid worked to ensure the C.A.V.E. project become a reality by obtaining $9 million in 2004 and 2005 appropriations for the project. With the C.A.V.E., the Desert Research Institute becomes one of the most technically advanced visual research facilities in the world.
