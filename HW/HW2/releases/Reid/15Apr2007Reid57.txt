REID: CHENEY ABDICATES RESPONSIBILITY, DENIES TROOPS STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today issued this statement following Vice President Dick Cheney's remarks on "Face the Nation" this morning:  
   "Vice President Cheney has long since lost credibility, so it should be no surprise that he would spend time this morning continuing to mislead us about the war in Iraq. The American people know that the height of irresponsibility is to put this country at risk by mismanaging a war from day one, drawing our troops further into a civil war, sending our troops to war without the armor or training they need, repeatedly misstating the grave realities on the ground in Iraq, and distorting deadlines for troop funding to score political points. After five years of war, the American people and our men and women in uniform deserve honesty about our future in Iraq and a policy that transitions our mission and allows the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future. 
   "Democrats are determined to make sure the troops have the funds they need, just like we demanded that they have sufficient body armor and training to go to Iraq and veterans care when they come home. We're also determined to fight for a policy worthy of their sacrifice. Unfortunately, the Vice President and this Administration are clinging to the same failed, irresponsible strategy that has put our troops and our country at risk, and are unwilling to work with Congress or listen to our military to change course in Iraq."
