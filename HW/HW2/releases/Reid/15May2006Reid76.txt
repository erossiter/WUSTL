SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's speech tonight on comprehensive immigration reform. A fact check on the President's record on immigration is attached below. 
   "We need a long-term strategy to fix our broken immigration system. Congress must pass comprehensive immigration reform to secure our borders, enforce our laws, and bring 12 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. The president got off to a good start tonight, but now he must stand up to right-wing members of his own party who are working to block Senate action. He should denounce the misguided approach of House Republicans, and exercise his leadership to get the job done."
