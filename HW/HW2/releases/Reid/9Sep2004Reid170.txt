SEN. REID SECURES $9.8 MILLION FOR NEVADA TRANSPORTATION
  Nevadans will be safer while traveling in the air and on the road thanks to $9.8 million Sen.  
 Harry Reid secured in the 2005 Transportation Appropriations bill. 
   The money will pay for new traffic control towers at several Nevada airports, as well as driver safety projects.
   "These projects will improve our quality of life by making our airports and highways safer," said Reid, a member of the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee that approved the bill Thursday. "We will also keep Nevada's economy strong by improving our transportation system."
   The bill provides $4 million for a new air traffic control tower at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. It also includes funding for airport improvement projects at Reno/Tahoe International Airport, the Carson City airport, and the Beatty airport, although the dollar amount of those projects has not been determined.
   Projects in this year's transportation appropriations bill for highways and transit have not been announced at this time in anticipation of potential action of a Highway Bill before Congress adjourns next month.
   The bill goes next to the full Senate Appropriations Committee and then on the Senate floor.
   The following projects are expected to receive these levels of funding in the final bill:
   * $4 million New Air Traffic Control Tower at McCarran International Airport 
   * $1 million Fiber Optic Loop at McCarran International Airport 
   * $3 million Air Traffic Control Tower at Reno/Tahoe International Airport 
   * $500,000 Runway End Identifier Lights for North Las Vegas and Henderson Airports 
   * $1 million California-Nevada Interstate Maglev Project 
   * $300,000 Driver-mounted Drowsiness Detection, Warning, and Control Systems.
