SEN. REID'S SPOKESMAN: TOUGH TALK CAN'T HIDE BUSH ADMINISTRATION INCOMPETENCE
  Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, released the following statement on Vice-President Dick Cheney's attempts today to deflect attention from the Bush Administration's dangerously incompetent record on national security:  
   "Under this Administration's watch, Iraq has become a training ground and launching pad for international terrorism, North Korea has likely quadrupled its nuclear arsenal, bin Laden remains on the loose, terror attacks across the world are on the rise, and Katrina exposed the staggering gaps in the Administration's ability to protect America. So, it's no surprise that the Vice President wants to talk about Democrats instead of focusing on his and the President's dangerously incompetent job performance."
