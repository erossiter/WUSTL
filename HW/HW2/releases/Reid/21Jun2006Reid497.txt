SEN. REID: IT IS TIME TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE
Calling for new hope and a new direction for America's workers, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) today urged the Senate to support raising the minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years.  
 "All of us in the Senate, don't we believe that someone working full-time should be able to live a life out of poverty?" said Reid on the Floor of the U.S. Senate. "I believe the answer is yes, and I believe that is reason enough for us all to vote yes to increasing this wage." 
 Senator Reid has long been an advocate of raising the minimum wage--an issue of profound importance to thousands in Nevada and millions across the United States. Some 56,000 Nevadans work jobs that pay the minimum wage, and the Democrats' proposed increase to $7.25 an hour would help each of them earn an average $4,370 more to support their families. 
 "We can't wait any longer," continued Reid. "There are only a few weeks left in this Congress, and those 56,000 Nevadans deserve a raise." 
 Raising the minimum wage is a top priority for Democrats, who included it in a list of domestic items they announced last week. Unfortunately, today's measure failed in the Senate on a near party-line vote.
