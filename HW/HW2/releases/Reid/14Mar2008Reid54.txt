SEN. REID ENSIGN ANNOUNCE NURSING GRANT FOR TRUCKEE MEADOWS COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Nevada Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign announced that the Truckee Meadows Community College was awarded a $1,544, 233 grant for education and training in the nursing field by the Department of Labor (DOL). The funds will be used to implement a nurse mentor program and create student forums and other venues for learning. The Washoe County School District, Renown Medical Hospital, Northern Nevada Medical Hospital, Job Opportunities in Nevada (JOIN), Nevada Job Connect, and the Redfield Foundation contributed $1,385,954 in addition to the funds awarded by the DOL. 
   The Northern Nevada Nursing Project will use the grant to address a nursing shortage by recruiting, training, and placing 264 new nurses within Northern Nevada.
   "I commend these businesses for their work in training and retaining much-needed health care professionals," said Reid. "Not only will this funding provide training and job placement for Nevada nurses, it will improve the nursing curriculum for current students. The training is invaluable to these students and to Nevadans who reap the benefits of well-trained medical workers."
   "The state of Nevada has made no secret of its need for qualified nurses," said Ensign. "The nursing shortage has been felt throughout our state. The grant money for the Truckee Meadows Community College will help provide the means necessary to continue to educate and train those seeking employment in the nursing field. I believe putting trained nurses into our hospitals will only increase the quality of health care we can offer in Nevada."
