SEN. REID: SENATE SHOULD ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO AMERICA
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today called on Bush Republicans in the Senate to put aside their partisan agenda and tackle the issues that matter most to Americans. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Frist has announced the Senate will spend June focusing on gay marriage and the politics of division and distortion.  
   "Today, Bush Republicans kicked off their campaign of dividing the country instead of addressing the real priorities of American families. Our country faces great challenges: record high gas prices, skyrocketing health care costs and an intractable war in Iraq. Yet instead of addressing these issues, Senator Frist has chosen to put the politics of division ahead of real progress by pushing for a debate on a divisive amendment that will write discrimination into the constitution."
   "This is exactly why the American people are looking for a new direction that puts their priorities ahead of partisan politics. Democrats stand ready with real solutions for the country. This Memorial Day, Democrats will be focused on the high cost of gasoline that is squeezing millions of American families who are filling their tanks and hitting the road this weekend. Unfortunately, Bush Republicans would rather focus on purely divisive maneuvers than real solutions that address the growing energy crisis."
