SEN. REID MEETS WITH SHERIFF GILLESPIE
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Doug Gillespie met today to discuss ways to make Southern Nevada safer.  
  "Making sure Nevada continues to remain a safe place to live and raise a family is a top priority of mine," said Reid. "Sheriff Gillespie and I discussed the importance of securing funding for the Las Vegas Fusion Center. This center, and a similar one in Reno, would serve as a as a command center for first responders in the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster. I am diligently working to ensure Nevada receives the funding it needs to get the fusion centers get up and running as soon as possible." 
   Currently, 46 states have operational fusion centers. Reid and the Nevada Department of Homeland Security are striving to add Nevada to that list in 2007. 
   Senators Reid and John Ensign recently wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff requesting $1.7 million over three years to ensure Nevada's fusion centers are fully equipped and staffed.
