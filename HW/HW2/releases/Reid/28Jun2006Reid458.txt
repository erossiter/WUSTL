SEN. REID RENEWS EFFORTS TO FIGHT FIRES
  In the midst of raging wildfires burning across Nevada, Sen. Harry Reid renewed his efforts to ensure Nevada has the resources necessary to combat wildfires. 
   In support of Governor Kenny Guinn's declaration of a state of emergency for Nevada that resulted from current fire activity, Reid called Guinn, and top officials at the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to work together to combat the Nevada wild fires. They discussed current fire conditions and federal assistance with the ongoing suppression efforts. "This is just the very beginning of what promises to be a destructive fire season. The federal government must do all it can to help prevent life and property loss as a result of wildfires," said Reid. "I will continue doing all I can to ensure Nevada has the resources necessary to fight current and future blazes." 
   A wet spring followed by a very hot early summer has created ideal conditions for wildfires across much of Nevada.
   Crews are battling at least two dozen fires in Northern Nevada. Wildfires temporarily closed sections of I-80 yesterday between Carlin and Elko because of a 40,000 acre blaze threatening the town of Carlin, the local low security prison, and the University of Nevada Reno Fire Sciences Academy.
   Reid pledged to work with other members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation to do what he can to ensure Nevada has access to assistance for wildfires.
