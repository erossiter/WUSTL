SEN. REID: PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE OF LOBBYING AND ETHICS BILL MARKS SIGNIFICANT DAY FOR AMERICANS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today following the President's signature of the lobbying and ethics reform bill into law: 
   "Today marks a significant day for our nation, as the President signs the toughest ethics and lobbying reform in generations, and Democrats continue to deliver on our promises to the American people. This important law will help change the way that business is conducted in Washington- banning gifts and travel from lobbyists and companies who hire lobbyists, dramatically increasing public disclosure of the activities of lobbyists, slowing the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying world, requiring transparency in the earmark process, and increasing penalties for corruption. I am pleased that the President has joined Democrats in helping to restore trust in our government and protect the interests of the American people."
