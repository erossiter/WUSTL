SEN. REID: SEN. FRIST IGNORES IMMIGRATION REALITIES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to reports that Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist will push for an immigration enforcement bill that will not include immigration reform:
   "Heightened enforcement without reform will not work or allow us to better control our borders. Our laws need to take into account reality before we will be able to enforce them. We should combat the illegal flow of immigrants over our borders by creating legal channels for them to come here, work, and continue to contribute to American economic growth. America can do better."
