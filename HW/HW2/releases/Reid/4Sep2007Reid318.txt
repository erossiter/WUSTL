CONGRESS SENDS PRESIDENT BUSH LANDMARK ETHICS, LOBBYING BILL TO CHANGE HOW WASHINGTON DOES BUSINESS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the following statement today upon sending the Ethics and Lobbying Reform bill to President Bush for his signature:  
   "Democrats continue to deliver on our promises to the American people, as today Congress sends the President the toughest ethics and lobbying reform in generations. We are pleased that the President has now signaled that he will join us in giving the American people a government as good and honest as the people it represents by signing this legislation that independent reform groups have hailed as a landmark bill.
   "This bill will significantly reform the way business gets done in Washington. It prohibits gifts and travel from lobbyists and companies that hire lobbyists, puts an end to pay-to-play schemes like the Republican K Street Project, dramatically increases public disclosure of the activities of lobbyists, slows the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying world, requires transparency in the earmark process, and increases penalties for corrupt politicians and lobbyists. The American people are sick and tired of the corruption that has plagued this city for the past six years, and we look forward to the President quickly enacting this sorely needed reform upon his return to Washington."
