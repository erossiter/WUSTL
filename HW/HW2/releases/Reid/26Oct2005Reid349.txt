SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS A COHERENT, COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR CHINA
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the Bush administration's decision to use the World Trade Organization to Pressure China on Intellectual Property Rights:  
   "I applaud the Bush administration's decision to use the WTO to increase the pressure on China to enforce U.S. intellectual property rights. It is long past the time that the U.S. showed China we are serious on this issue. America needs a coherent and comprehensive policy to address the rise of China, something the Bush administration has failed to do. 
   "China continues to be a leading violator of intellectual property protections, costing a wide variety of U.S. industries billions per year - from film, music and software to auto parts and semiconductors. I hope the Administration will follow its own lead and use the WTO to ratchet up the pressure on China in other critical areas, including its currency manipulation, subsidies, and forced technology transfer policies. Together, we can do better than today's piecemeal approach and I hope that the president will lead us in formulating such a strategy."
