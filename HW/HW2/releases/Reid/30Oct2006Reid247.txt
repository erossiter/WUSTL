SEN. REID: ANOTHER DAY, STILL NO PLAN, NO END
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's failure today to provide a plan for victory in Iraq:  
   "On a day when the United States reached a grim milestone in Iraq, President Bush resorted to the same tired old partisan attacks in a desperate attempt to hold onto power and avoid accountability for his mistakes. Instead of trying to bring the country together at a very difficult time and find a common way forward in Iraq, the Campaigner in Chief chose to once again attack those who question his flawed policies. 
   "Our troops and the American people deserve better. We can achieve success in Iraq, but it will require the President to admit that his stay-the-course policy has failed. We don't need another public relations campaign. We need a Commander in Chief who understands it is long past time to drop the deceptive and divisive rhetoric and change direction."
