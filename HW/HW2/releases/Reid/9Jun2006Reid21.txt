SEN. REID ANNOUNCES ELY-WHITE PINE COUNTY AIRPORT TO CONTINUE AIR SERVICE
  U.S. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced today that Ely Airport will continue necessary airline service with Scenic Airlines. The Department of Transportation is prohibiting Scenic Airlines from terminating its subsidized service contract with Ely.  
   "Dependable air service is so important to rural communities. In some cases, it is indispensable. I will continue to work with Congress and the Department of Transportation to make sure funding for Ely continues," said Reid. 
   In November 2001, the only air carrier providing service to Ely shut down. Since that time the Department of Transportation sought assistance from Scenic Airlines to provide the replacement air service. 
   In November 2005, Reid ensured nearly $700,000 to help Ely-White Pine County Airport fund a service program. The program, Essential Air Service, is designed to ensure that rural communities are served by commuter airlines by providing them with an annual federal subsidy. 
   The Department of Transportation chose Scenic Airlines to provide air service at Ely for a two-year period. Scenic Airlines signed a contract with various rural airports including Ely, Nevada. The Department has determined that Scenic Airlines must continue its binding contract. Scenic Airlines will continue to provide six nonstop round trip flights to Las Vegas with a 19-seat DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. 
   Senator Reid, a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, ensured that Ely was included in the program by having them listed in the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations bill. The bill was signed by the President on November 30, 2005.
