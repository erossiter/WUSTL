SEN. REID PRAISES NEW HORIZON PROJECT REPORT
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today praised a new report released by the Horizon Project, a coalition of business and policy leaders committed to the public interest and to America's long term economic strength.  
   "The Horizon Project deserves tremendous credit for a remarkable new report that offers much-needed new economic, health, and education policy ideas that will be critical to ensuring America's economic interests and restoring our political leadership throughout the world. The failed policies of the last six years have sent high-paying jobs overseas, sent health care costs skyrocketing, and left behind a middle class struggling to get by. Democrats understand that today's complex problems will require innovative solutions like those proposed by the Horizon Project report. It's no longer enough simply to identify the challenges facing our nation. The American people demanded a change at home and abroad, and Democrats are prepared to lead this country in a new direction."
