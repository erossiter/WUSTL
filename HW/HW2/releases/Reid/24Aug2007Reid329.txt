SEN. REID HOSTS ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION ON YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  The Department of Energy (DOE) has spent more than $9 billion on the proposed dump, and mounting liability for not taking title to nuclear waste is around $500 million each year. The life-cycle cost of this project could total $100 billion. 
   "Yucca Mountain quality assurance failures have plagued the project for decades," said Reid. "I'm pleased that these leaders and experts came together to help Sen. Dorgan better understand Yucca Mountain and Nevada's concerns about this project. Today's discussion makes it abundantly clear that Yucca is dangerous for Nevada and a threat to our national security."
   During the meeting, the group discussed quality assurance failures. The Government Accountability Office recently reported that the Yucca Mountain project continues to suffer from poor management. The DOE has tried to patch up its quality assurance failures, but the changes have not been significant enough to be considered effective. Yucca Mountain has a history of poor management, cost overruns in the tens-of-billions of dollars, missed deadlines, and inadequate transparency.
   The DOE is planning to submit a License Application to build the repository that will be grossly inadequate. Reid will continue working to ensure the Yucca Mountain project never becomes a reality.
   U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada hosted a Yucca Mountain roundtable discussion with Nevada leaders and U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, chair of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, today to discuss efforts to prevent the construction of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump 90 miles outside of Las Vegas.
