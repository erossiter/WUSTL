NEW NATIONAL GUARD READINESS CENTER WILL HELP PROTECT NEVADANS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada helped unveil the Nevada National Guard's new $27 million Las Vegas Readiness Center, a project that will help ensure Nevada is prepared in the event of a disaster.  
   "It took seven years and a lot of work by a lot of people to get to this day, but this facility will be well worth it," Reid said. "The Nevada National Guard's force continues to grow and that's why this new facility is crucial. I'm happy that I was able to help deliver funding that will better equip and train our front line defenders. Efforts like these help to ensure Nevada is safe in the event of a crisis or natural disaster." 
   The 80,000 square feet building sits on a nearly 50-acre plot of land and will house communications, engineering and medical Guard units. The new facility will include a 200 person theater-style auditorium, medical examination rooms, distance learning classrooms, a weight room, locker rooms, multiple arms vaults, a kitchen, and a maintenance bay. 
   Reid worked to secure $12.8 million in funding for the new facility. The entire process of land acquisition, funding and construction took seven years. The Readiness Center, which is expected to house 300-400 Guardsmen during a typical drill weekend, is the first to be constructed in Las Vegas in more than 10 years.
