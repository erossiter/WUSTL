  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada recently met with the mayors of Nevada's three largest cities, Reno Mayor Bob Cashell, Henderson Mayor James B. Gibson, and Las Vegas Mayor Oscar B. Goodman. While meeting with Reid, the mayors discussed transportation, homeland security, growth, and ways the federal and local governments can work together on behalf of Nevada.  
   In their meeting, Reno City Mayor Bob Cashell shared with Reid his firsthand knowledge of the need for support from the federal government for critical programs, such as providing all necessary tools to Nevada's first responders. 
   "I was delighted to meet with Reno City Mayor Bob Cashell," said Reid. "We discussed many ways we can work together to improve Northern Nevada. I will continue working at the federal level to help Nevada's local governments create more affordable housing, improve our transportation systems, and increase Nevada's homeland security." 
   The mayors were in the nation's Capital for the 75th Winter Meeting of The United States Conference of Mayors.
