ON OUR 100TH DAY, LET'S REVIEW REPUBLICAN AGENDA
  On the Senate's 100th day of legislative business and as the Senate approaches the August recess, it is appropriate to take stock of what the Senate has accomplished this year.  
   "In the past 100 days, Republicans found time to confirm right-wing judges, to protect Karl Rove and to take up the business of their special interest friends. But at the same time, they couldn't spend an extra day supporting our troops or helping families afford health care. It's a record that reveals how out of touch Republicans have become. There are not many days left on the Senate Calendar, but there is still time for Republicans to stop doing the business of a radical few and to join Democrats in taking up a common-sense reform agenda that works for America's families," said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. 
   A quick review shows the Republican agenda has been one focused on special interests and a narrow minority that caters to the radical right. After spending at least 46 legislative days wasted on this out of touch agenda, it is no surprise the American people feel the Republican Congress has misplaced priorities.
