SENS. REID, ENSIGN CALL YUCCA RADIATION STANDARDS 'WHOLLY INADEQUATE'
  Nevada Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign told the Environmental Protection Agency today that the agency's proposed radiation protection standards for Yucca Mountain are "wholly inadequate" and do not "protect human health and safety."  
   As part of the process of creating the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear dump site, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set standards for the maximum levels of radiation to which humans can be exposed.
   The EPA's first proposal was voided by the Court of Appeals in 2004 because it did not protect public health and safety and comply with the recommendations of the National Academies of Science as required by law. The EPA published its revised standards in August and is now accepting comments on those standards.
   Senators Reid and Ensign submitted their comments this afternoon, saying "EPA's proposed standard is wholly inadequate, does not meet the law's requirements, and does not protect human health and safety. Instead of sticking to the commitment that Yucca Mountain would proceed only if it were based on sound science, EPA has cast sound science aside in favor of political expediency in the myopic pursuit of Yucca Mountain."
