SEN. REID: SENATE FAILED TO STAND UP FOR AMERICA'S PRIORITIES TODAY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the Senate's failure to stand up for America's priorities:  
   "Democrats are working to provide educational opportunities for our children, lift more Americans out of poverty and help working families heat their homes. Unfortunately, Republicans rejected these efforts and stood in the way of progress for working families. Instead of standing up for America's real priorities, the Republican-led Senate again stood in the way tonight of real help for middle-class families. We can do better. Democrats will continue our fight to put America's priorities first." 
   Democrats Fought to Provide More Educational Opportunities for our Children. Senate Republicans rejected an amendment to provide an additional $5 billion in Title I resources. $2.5 billion would have provided targeted grants to those areas with a large number of disadvantaged students and an additional $2.5 billion for education finance incentive grants. The amendment, which required 60 votes, was rejected 44-51. [RC 269, S. Amdt. 2275 to H.R. 3010, 10/26/05] 
   Democrats Fought to Provide Additional Assistance to Help Working Families Heat Their Homes. Senate Republicans rejected an amendment to provide $3.1 billion in emergency funding to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This funding increase would have restored the program that helps working families meet their heating bills from the cut in the Bush budget. The amendment, which required 60 votes, was rejected 54-43. [RC 270, S. Amdt. 2194 to H.R. 3010, 10/26/05] 
   Democrats Fought to Provide 20,000 more young Americans the Benefits of the Head Start Program. Senate Republicans rejected an amendment to provide $153 million to the Head Start program to allow an additional 20,000 young Americans the proven benefits of the program. The amendment, which required 60 votes, was rejected 47-52. [RC 272, S. Amdt. 2254 to H.R. 3010. 10/26/05] 
   Democrats Fought to Provide an Additional $4 Billion in Education Funding for Students with Disabilities. Senate Republicans rejected an amendment to provide $4 billion to the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. The amendment would have brought the funding to the authorized level. The amendment, which required 60 votes, was rejected 46-53. [RC 273, S. Amdt. 2292 to H.R. 3010, 10/26/05]
