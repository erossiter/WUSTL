BUSH MUST FOLLOW HIS WORDS, URGE HIS PARTY TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  The following is a statement by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on President Bush's speech today.  
 Fact sheet follows: 
   "After five years of inaction, I'm glad to see that the President is finally trying to push his party to address comprehensive immigration reform. I share his concerns about the need to strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws. But the President recognizes that strengthening enforcement is a necessary but not sufficient component of any realistic plan to fix our broken immigration system. Now the President needs to stand up to the right-wing of his party and exercise his leadership to encourage bipartisan and realistic reforms to our immigration laws in the upcoming session of Congress. 
   "America deserves a system that will truly protect our borders and honor our history as a nation of immigrants."
