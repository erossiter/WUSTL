SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE $4.7 MILLION TO EXPAND FALLON NAVAL AIR STATION
  Fallon Naval Air Station will be more secure and efficient thanks to $4.7 million secured by Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign. 
   The funding will be used to construct two high-explosive magazines with the capacity to store 325,000 pounds of explosives. The current storage facility is routinely full, interfering with the ability to complete training on time and requiring over-flow ordinance to be housed in sub-standard and unsafe facilities. 
   "The Fallon Naval Air Station is one of the finest tactical air warfare training facilities in the country," said Reid. "We must accommodate its growing needs so it can continue to keep Nevada and the entire country safe." 
   "We must make certain that nothing stands in the way of providing our troops with a sufficient level of training," said Ensign, Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "Fallon Naval Air Station has played a valuable role in defending our nation and this funding will allow that crucial work to continue." 
   The high-explosive magazines would include a concrete loading dock and ramp. Funding would also support electrical, water, and excavation work. With the expansion of the Fallon mission over the years, the ordinance requirements for the aircraft and training missions have also increased substantially. 
   The project will be funded through the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill, which received final approval on Monday. It will now go to the President for his signature.
