SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF DANA REEVE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the passing of Dana Reeve.  
   "Today, we mourn the passing of Dana Reeve--a devoted wife, a loving mother, a tireless advocate on behalf of individuals with spinal paralysis, and a talented singer and actress. I met Dana during one of her frequent visits to Washington, DC to advocate on behalf of the Christopher Reeve Foundation. She was an articulate and passionate voice for a wide range of issues that affect individuals with paralysis, from quality of life issues to stem cell research. Dana will be remembered not only for her activism, but for her devotion to her family and her uncommon strength and grace in the face of adversity."
