SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF SEN. WARNER
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement following the announcement by U.S. Senator John Warner of his retirement from the U.S. Senate next year:  
   "The Senate will be losing a friend and a colleague with the retirement of Senator John Warner. I was fortunate to serve with him for many years on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee where I was able to see first hand his respect and devotion to this body.
   He has been a true gentleman and has served the people of Virginia and our nation with distinction and honor throughout his nearly three decades of service. While this is a sad day for the Senate, Senator Warner's indelible impact on this institution will not be forgotten."
