SEN. REID HAILS PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL THAT STRENGTHENS NEVADA
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the Senate passed the energy bill: 
   "The passage of this bill is a victory for Nevada and the nation. This bill starts America on a path toward reducing our reliance on oil by increasing the nation's use of renewable fuels and, for the first time in decades, significantly improving the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. 
   "We are saving hard-working Nevadans money, protecting them from gas price-gouging, making our country safer, and opening the door to the creation more than 1,200 new jobs for Nevada - all while taking steps to reduce global warming. And because I believe Washington must lead by example, several provisions in the bill will help make the U.S. Capitol and the Federal government more energy efficient, use more renewable power, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   "I believe it is more important to invest in clean, affordable energy produced in places rich with renewable energy resources, like Nevada, than to protect the multibillion-dollar oil industry. That is why in the coming months I will continue to move forward by enacting additional measures that place Nevadans, the economy, our national security and the environment first."
