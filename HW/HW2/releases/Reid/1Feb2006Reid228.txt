SEN. REID: BUSH'S RECYCLED RHETORIC HITS THE ROAD
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today after President Bush's speech in Nashville, TN.  
   "Last night, the president failed to deliver a credible address on the state of our union and instead resorted to recycled rhetoric and tired policies. He took the same show on the road today, but has yet to offer a single real solution to the problems facing the American people." 
   "Americans expect more from President Bush on national security, the economy, health care, energy independence, and ethics reform than the same rhetoric they've heard a hundred times. Words do nothing to fix the problems in Iraq, nothing to help a middle-class squeezed by this administration's economic policies, and nothing to lower the cost of healthcare." 
   "Democrats are committed to action, and are ready to start with the Honest Leadership Act. We must first clean up Washington from the Republican culture of corruption so that Americans can trust that their government is serving their interests, not the special interests."
