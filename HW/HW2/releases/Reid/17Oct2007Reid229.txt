SEN. REID COMMENTS ON UPCOMING YUCCA MOUNTAIN HEARING
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement on the announcement by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that it has scheduled an oversight hearing on the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump.  
   "This is the most important issue facing the state of Nevada. That's why I've been working with the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to schedule this hearing for the last few months. I am confident that the information that comes out of the hearing will shine a bright spotlight on the problems associated with this dangerous plan to transport 77,000 tons of nuclear waste across the country and turn Nevada into the nation's nuclear dumping ground."
  The hearing is scheduled for October 31. Additional details about the hearing, including the list of witnesses, will be announced on October 24.
