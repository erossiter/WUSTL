SEN. REID: BUSH MUST THROUGHLY REVIEW IRAN POLICY IN LIGHT OF NEWLY RELEASED INTELLIGENCE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today ahead of President Bush's remarks this morning, calling on the President to conduct a thorough review of his Iran policy in light of the new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program that concluded Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003: 
   "President Bush's heated rhetoric on Iran - including comments about a potential World War III - is even more outrageous now that we know the intelligence community had informed him that it believes Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program four years ago. This is the latest in a long line of inaccurate and misleading comments that got us into the Iraq war to begin with. They further diminish the credibility of a President with a dangerous record of overstating threats."
   "In light of yesterday's remarkable new National Intelligence Estimate on Iran, I urge the President at his press conference today to announce a top-to-bottom review of his Iran policy and a diplomatic surge to advance U.S. interests with regard to Iran. He should announce that his Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense are prepared to meet anytime, anywhere with their Iranian counterparts to conduct vigorous diplomacy to advance U.S. interests and address the challenges of Iran.
