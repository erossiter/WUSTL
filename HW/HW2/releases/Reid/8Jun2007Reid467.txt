SEN. REID: SENATE WILL REVISIT IMMIGRATION WHEN REPUBLICANS SHOW GREATER COMMITMENT TO SOLUTIONS THAN OBSTRUCTIONISM
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today in response to President Bush's radio address, in which he urged the Senate to bring the immigration bill back to the floor:
   "The White House has so far failed to rally Senate Republicans behind tough, fair and practical immigration reform. I will bring the immigration bill back to the Senate floor as soon as enough Republicans are ready to join us in moving forward on a bill to fix our broken immigration system."
