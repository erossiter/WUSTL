SEN. HARRY REID ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Today, a Senate subcommittee approved the FY '07 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. The measure contains language instructing the Department of Energy to work with states that have nuclear reactors to identify storage sites within those states or regions. Nuclear waste could be stored at those sites for 25 years. Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) released the following statement after today's subcommittee meeting: "My goal is on-site, dry cask storage of nuclear waste. While this bill does not fully accomplish that personal goal of mine, it is a significant step in the right direction. This bill acknowledges something I've said for years - that no geological repository will be operational for decades, and the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump is so riddled with problems that it will never open. This measure will give us time to study the problem of nuclear waste and work towards a solution that is safe and viable. It is a bipartisan compromise, and I'm happy I was able to work with Chairman Domenici to reach this agreement."
