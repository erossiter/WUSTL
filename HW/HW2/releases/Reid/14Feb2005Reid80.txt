SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF EXTREMIST JUDGES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today:  
   "The President is at it again with the extremist judges. 
   "Last year, the Senate worked to confirm 204 of the President's judicial nominees and rejected only the 10 most extreme. This confirmation record is better than that achieved by President Clinton, President George H.W. Bush and President Reagan. Despite our unprecedented effort to work with the President in discharging our constitutional duty to advise and consent to his nominees, today he renominated 7 of the 10 rejected nominees. We should not divert attention from other pressing issues facing this nation to redebate the merits of nominees already found too extreme by this Chamber. 
   "To replay this narrow and completed debate demonstrates the Bush Administration's failure to craft a positive agenda for the American people."
