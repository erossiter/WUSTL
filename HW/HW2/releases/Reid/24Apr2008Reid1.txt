SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAKE YOUR CHILD TO WORK DAY
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today after Republicans blocked legislation that would have ended income inequalities that exist between men and women:  
   "Today is Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. What should be a great day for Nevada families has unfortunately been overshadowed by the poor decision Republicans made last night when they blocked important legislation that would have provided men and women equal pay for equal work. 
   "Wage discrimination is not only a gender issue, but a family issue as well. There are a record 70.2 million women in the workforce today. Nationwide, working families lose $200 billion in income annually due to the wage gap between men and women. 
   "The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act would have reversed a Supreme Court ruling, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. Inc., ending the 180-day statute of limitations on filing a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commicssion (EEOC). This bill would make it easier for victims of discrimination to sue their employers over unequal pay. It would help to ensure all workers, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability, receive equal pay for equal work. 
   "Republicans should stand up for equality instead of standing in the way. Nevada's families deserve better."
