SEN. REID: IT IS TIME TO CHANGE THIS DO NOTHING REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
  With the Do Nothing Republican Congress taking a month-long vacation it has done little to deserve, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement. 
   "It's no surprise this Do Nothing Republican Congress is taking a vacation. It's been on vacation for the last 19 months. This Republican Congress will go down in history for getting next to nothing done for the American people. It spent more time on French fries and freedom fries than the concerns of Americans who can't afford food. Americans have had enough of a Congress that has made America less safe and only works when it wants to reward its special interest friends. Democrats are fighting for a Congress that serves ALL Americans, and to take this country in a new direction."
