SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMINISTRATION'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today. 
   "If the president wants to know how people really feel about his Social Security plan, he should start by asking them how they will react to having their benefits cut nearly in half, which is what seniors will see if Republicans proceed with their privatization plan. 
   Social Security is America's promise to those who work hard and play by the rules. But through news reports and White House leaks, we know the President intends to break this promise. I hope the President uses today's conversation to come clean about this fact."
