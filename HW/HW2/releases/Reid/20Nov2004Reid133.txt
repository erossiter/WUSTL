HOOVER DAM BYPASS BRIDGE NAMED FOR GOV. O'CALLAGHAN
  Congress gave final approval tonight to a bill that will name the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge after Nevada's late Gov. Mike O'Callaghan. Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) originally proposed the measure, which will officially designate the span between Nevada and Arizona the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge. It passed as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report that now goes to the President to be signed into law.  
   O'Callaghan, a decorated Korean war veteran and two-term governor of Nevada, died in March at the age of 74. Tillman, a professional football player with the Arizona Cardinals and a volunteer with the U.S. Army Rangers, was killed in action in Afghanistan in April at the age of 27. 
   "Mike O'Callaghan always supported the Hoover Dam Bypass Project, so I know he would be honored that the bridge will carry his name," said Reid. "Mike O'Callaghan and Pat Tillman were both war heroes. This project will make sure that Americans always remember the sacrifices they made for their country, and the contributions they made to our states." 
   The Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge is now under construction. It will allow traffic to move between Nevada and Arizona without going directly over Hoover Dam, which could be a Homeland Security risk. Reid has won approximately $60 million in federal funding for the project over the last five years. 
   The bipartisan amendment is supported by Senators John Ensign (R-NV), John McCain (R-AZ), and Jon Kyl (R-AZ). 
   "This bridge will serve as a permanent connection between Mike O'Callaghan and Pat Tillman and be a constant reminder of their brotherhood as American patriots and heroes," said Ensign. "Though decades apart in their service to this nation, they each made unforgettable contributions to our states and to our nation. I am proud to support this landmark for two brave and admirable men."
