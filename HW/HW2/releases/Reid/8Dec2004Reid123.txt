SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF INTELLIGENCE BILL
  "Our enemies caught us off guard on September 11, 2001.  
 And even as we vowed that it must never happen again, we realized that we needed to make some fundamental changes in our intelligence agencies. 
   "The creation of the 9/11 Commission was a major step toward needed change. These reforms will make it harder for information to slip through the cracks of our intelligence system. It will make it easier for our intelligence officials to connect the dots and see the kind of warnings that could have prevented the tragic events of 9/11. It will make it easier to coordinate the efforts of the 15 different agencies that are responsible for providing the good intelligence we must have to win the war on terror. 
   "I appreciate the hard work of the Commission and its co-chairs Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, who endorsed this conference report. And especially the unrelenting support of the families of the 9/11 victims. 
   "One of these family members is Denise Keasler of Las Vegas, who lost her daughter, Karol Keasler, in the twin towers. Denise has dedicated herself to reforming our intelligence system. And it was because of the dedication of people like her that the 9/11 Commission was created."
