  Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid and Congressman Dean Heller today announced three grants totaling nearly $2.5 million for water and waste disposal improvement. These grants were awarded to Nye and Pershing Counties through the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development.  
   "I am pleased that the USDA has awarded these grants to further the development of infrastructure in Nevada," said Ensign. "This money will help in the effort to modernize water and waste treatment in Nye and Pershing Counties."
   "Water is such an important issue throughout the state of Nevada," said Reid. "This amount of money will go a long way toward improving water infrastructure in these counties." 
   "Providing rural Nevada with the necessary resources to build and update critical infrastructure is vitally important to the health and safety of many of our communities in Nevada. I am pleased that USDA made these funds available to Nye and Pershing Counties," said Heller. 
   The grant awarded to Nye County will be used to provide a new well and storage tank for the town of Manhattan and totals $965,000. The grant awarded to Pershing County will be used to fund improvements to the city of Lovelock's wastewater system and totals nearly $888,000. A second grant awarded to Pershing County, in the amount of $646,000, will be used to assist the Lovelock Meadows Water District in replacing inadequate main lines throughout the water system.
