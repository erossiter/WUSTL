SEN. REID: SENATE REPUBLICANS CUT $2 BILLION FOR OUR TROOPS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on today's vote in the U.S. Senate to cut billions meant to help troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to fund border security.  
   "Today, Democrats offered a way to secure our borders and support our troops. Instead, Senate Republicans chose to slash $2 billion desperately needed by our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in order to offset the costs of additional border security. We all agree it is vital that we secure our border, but Democrats believe we shouldn't do it on the backs of our troops. It is outrageous that Senate Republicans have decided at a time of war that we could do without defending against Improvised Explosive Devices, training the Iraqi Security Forces, and giving our troops the body armor and benefits they deserve. Democrats will continue to fight for Real Security priorities that are both tough AND smart."
