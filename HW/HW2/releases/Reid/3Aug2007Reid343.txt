SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE ACTION ON FISA LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to the Senate's vote in favor of the Bond FISA legislation: 
   "A few weeks ago, I made a personal commitment to the Director of National Intelligence that I would lead the Senate to passage of a bill that would help protect America from terrorist attack by enhancing our intelligence community's foreign intelligence collection capability.
   "Senate Democrats worked in good faith with the Director of National Intelligence to produce the Rockefeller-Levin bill that was tough on terrorists, provided much-need oversight of the Attorney General, and did not infringe on the constitutional rights of American citizens. Rather than pass this bill, my Republican colleagues chose to rubberstamp a flawed Administration proposal that fails to provide the accountability needed in light of the Administration's repeated past mismanagement of key tools in the war on terror.
   "This bill will sunset in six months. Over the course of the fall, I expect the Senate to work diligently on more permanent legislation that will better serve American national security interests and the American people."
