SEN. REID: BUSH'S PRIORITIES ARE NOT AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks this morning:  
   "It is laughable that a man who has turned record surpluses into record deficits would lecture anyone about proper investments for our nation. In the last month alone President Bush has signaled that he would block Democratic legislation to strengthen homeland security, provide healthcare for children and decrease America's dependence on oil. President Bush may think he has his priorities straight, but unfortunately they align with his special-interest friends and not those of the American people.
   "Whether it is privatizing Social Security, giving massive tax breaks to oil companies while consumers pay more at the pump or letting Osama Bin Laden roam free while we keep our troops mired in an open-ended Iraqi civil war, America has had just about enough of President Bush's misguided priorities."
