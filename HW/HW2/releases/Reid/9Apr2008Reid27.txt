SEN. REID COMMENTS ON YUCCA
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid commented today after the head of the Yucca Mountain Project, Ward Sproat, testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water. Sproat said the Energy Department (DOE) needs more than $1 billion next year to stay on schedule, but they are only requesting half that amount to keep the Yucca Mountain project limping along. 
   As the project was wounded by budget cuts of more than $100 million last year, it is clear the DOE will not receive anywhere near what they had been planning for. "American taxpayers have already spent too much money on a dangerous project that has proven to be too costly and too controversial. There is no way we're going to ship 77,000 tons of nuclear waste across the country. The dump will never be built, and the Energy Department knows it," said Senator Reid. Despite bipartisan opposition to the dump, the DOE seems intent on wasting millions more hard-earned taxpayer dollars to file a license application to build Yucca, knowing that it will later abandon the project because it is too costly and controversial.
