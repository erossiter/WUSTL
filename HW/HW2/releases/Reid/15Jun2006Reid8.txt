DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO STOP AMNESTY FOR IRAQI TERRORISTS
  Democrats today demanded an immediate retraction and reversal of the reported proposal that terrorists and insurgents who kill American soldiers in Iraq may be granted amnesty by the new Iraqi government. 
   "It is shocking that the Iraqi Prime Minister is reportedly considering granting amnesty to insurgents who have killed U.S. troops," said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. "On the day we lost the 2,500th soldier in Iraq, the mere idea that this proposal may go forward is an insult to the brave men and women who have died in the name of Iraqi freedom. I call on President Bush to denounce this proposal immediately."
   Democrats offered a Resolution demanding that this policy be repudiated, and that President Bush immediately inform the government of Iraq-in the strongest possible terms-that the United States opposes granting amnesty to anyone who attacks American soldiers. The text of the Sense of the Senate resolution is attached below.
   "We ask you Prime Minister Maliki, are you willing to have 'reconciliation' on the pool of American blood that has been spilled to give your people and your country a chance for freedom?" said Senator Menendez, a sponsor of the resolution. "We reject that notion and are outraged that the sacrifice of American troops and the American people could be so devalued."
   "Terrorists and insurgents shouldn't be rewarded for killing American soldiers," said Senator Bill Nelson, of Florida, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who also sponsored the resolution."
   Four years into a war, the Bush Administration's management of which has been marked by failure and incompetence, the American people expect better than to have American troops killed without threat of punishment. It is time for a change.
