SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PENTAGON'S BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSING RECOMMENDATIONS
  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today:
   "I have supported the BRAC process because I believe it is important to give the Pentagon the authority to ensure that we have the right defense infrastructure to meet the threats to our national security in the most cost effective way. 
   "Overall, the Pentagon's latest recommendations have will result in a net gain of military and civilian personnel for Nevada. Nellis AFB will gain over 1400 military and civilian personnel and Fallon Naval Air Station was named the Fleet Readiness Center for the West. The Defense Department is right to look to Nevada to play a major role in defending America.
   "However, the decision to recommend closing Hawthorne Army Depot and to realigning the Reno Air Guard National Guard Station is troubling. Congress and the Department of Defense have spent tens of millions of dollars in recent years building a premier weapons demilitarization capability at Hawthorne Army Depot. It plays a unique role in our country's national security. Likewise, the Reno Air Guard is playing a critical role in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the global war on terror.
   "The recommendations released today by the Department of Defense are the first step of a long and important process. The appointed members of the BRAC Commission will now conduct public hearings, and make site visits and analysis. During the course of its work, I hope the Commission carefully examines the Defense Department's decisions to put an end to the critical and historic mission at Hawthorne, as well as reducing the capacity of the Reno Air Guard. Neither decision appears to be consistent with our national security objectives."
