SEN. REID: AMERICANS DESERVE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "I hope that tomorrow President Bush will take real steps to provide the assistance that the victims of Hurricane Katrina so desperately need.  
 In addition, I call upon him to endorse an independent commission to provide straight answers to the American people about what went wrong with the government's preparation for and response to the Katrina disaster and how we can do better. 
   "We must take the politics out of this process, period. The only way to achieve this is through the establishment of a non-partisan, blue ribbon commission. The Senate should adopt Senator Clinton's proposal and join us in getting the answers the survivors and the American people deserve. 
   "The American people expect more; we must and can do better."
