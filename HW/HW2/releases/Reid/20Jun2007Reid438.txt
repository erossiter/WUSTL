SEN. REID DEMOS PLUG-IN CARS
  Today, Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada held an event to discuss the benefits of energy-efficient transportation.  
   Reid also viewed a plug-in hybrid car that gets 150 MPG. Instead of relying solely on oil these innovative cars can be recharged with energy supplied by wind, solar or geothermal. 
   "New energy technologies, like environmentally safe car batteries in these plug-in cars, will help increase energy-efficiency," said Reid. "We have the technology to become a more energy-efficient nation, and we should embrace it. Nevada is poised to be a huge producer of all three of these forms of clean renewable energy. Developing these sources of energy will create thousands of jobs for Nevadans and make Nevada a leader in alternative energy technology development."
   Reid is leading his Democratic colleagues this week to move ahead with The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, which will help lower energy costs, create jobs, protect consumers from price-gouging, strengthen national security and reduce global-warming emissions.
