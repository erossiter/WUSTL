SEN. REID CALLS FOR PRESIDENT TO RECONSIDER STEM CELL VETO THREAT
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "Today, we have the great opportunity to open a new frontier in science that has the potential to save millions of lives and end the unnecessary suffering of so many Americans.  
 Embryonic stem cell research provides us the hope of new cures and therapies and we should embrace this research opportunity and not allow radical ideology to stand in the way. 
   "President Bush has made the wrong choice, putting politics ahead of safe, responsible science. With broad bipartisan support in Congress and the overwhelming support of the scientific community and the American people, we must join together to expand our research opportunities and make our nation's hope a reality."
