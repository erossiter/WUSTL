SEN. REID: WATER IS TOO PRECIOUS A RESOURCE TO SPEND ON FUTURE POLLUTING COAL PLANTS
  Today, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released a report about the adverse effects of coal power plants on Nevada's already scarce water resources.  
   "Water is a precious resource and our state doesn't have enough of it to spend on future polluting coal plants," said Reid. "Not only would coal power plants further deplete our water supply, they could also directly pollute our water resources and contribute to global warming. We have a moral obligation to our future generations, to be good stewards of Nevada's water resources today. We must refocus our efforts on renewable energy."
