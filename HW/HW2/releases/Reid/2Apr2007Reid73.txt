SEN. REID SPOKESMAN: BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS HEAD IN SAND
  Jim Manley, Spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, released the following statement today after comments made by White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino:  
   "As we learned last November, the only thing that has shifted is the public support for the war in Iraq. As more and more Americans demand to see the troops get out of what is clearly a civil war, this Administration stubbornly continues to stick its head in the sand." 
   The major components of the bipartisan language contained in the Senate-passed Supplemental and the Feingold bill are identical. They are: 
   -Commence transition of the mission and phased redeployment in 120 days 
   -Transition mission to three purposes: 
   (1) Provide security for United States infrastructure and personnel. 
   (2) Train and equip Iraqi security services. 
   (3) Conduct targeted operations, limited in duration and scope, against members of al Qaeda and other international terrorist organizations. 
   -Finish transition by March 2008 
   Feingold ensures that the President complies with this March 2008 deadline by limiting funding after that deadline to only those three missions.
