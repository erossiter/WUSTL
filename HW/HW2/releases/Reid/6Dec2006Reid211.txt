SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONTINUATION OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, LOCAL NURSES
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued the following statement on the continuation of negotiations between Universal Health Services and Service Employees International Union:  
 "I am encouraged by the agreement to a cooling-off period and renewed talks between Universal Health Services and local nurses. I am also confident that a solution acceptable to everyone can be reached through a strong, mutual commitment to productive negotiation. 
 "Hopefully, recent pessimistic statements by Universal Health Services are not a true indication of their willingness to negotiate constructively during the next sixty days. The patients and families of Southern Nevada are counting on an urgently needed settlement, reached through earnest negotiation, between UHS and Nevada's dedicated nurses."
