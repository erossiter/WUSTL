SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON OCTOBER TRADE REPORT
  Today, Sen. Harry Reid issued the following statement on the upcoming economic summit and the October Trade Report:  
   "Tomorrow the President will convene an economic summit with corporate CEOs and economists. But ordinary families don't need a bunch of experts to tell them that the economy still isn't working for all Americans. 
   "Today we learned that our trade deficit set another record - imports from China continue to increase while American jobs are shipped overseas. Job growth was down last month. And as winter sets in, Americans face record costs to heat their homes because of soaring energy prices. 
   "This summit is an ideal opportunity for the President to make good on his promise of bipartisan leadership, by seeking bold ideas for a new economic strategy that benefits all Americans, not just those at the top."
