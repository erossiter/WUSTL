SEN. REID: THIRD STRAIGHT MONTH OF JOB LOSS UNDERSCORES THE URGENT NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to a Department of Labor report that U.S. employers cut 80,000 jobs in March - the third month in a row that the number of lost jobs went up.  
   "If anyone still doubts the need to act swiftly and decisively to reverse the impact of Bush Republicans' economic policies, look no further than today's unemployment numbers that show the third straight month of job losses for American workers and businesses. 
   "This distressing trend tells us everything we need to know about the dangers of Republicans' 'wait-and-see' approach to the economy. And it underscores that now more than ever, America needs the investments Democrats want to make in infrastructure, unemployment insurance, alternative energy and housing - all of which will give the economy a shot in the arm and create good-paying jobs here at home. 
   "Democrats will continue to take every opportunity to strengthen our economy in the short-term and address the long-term economic problems hurting America's middle class. We hope that Republicans who have been slow to recognize the urgency of helping Americans being pushed out of the workforce will join us in this effort."
