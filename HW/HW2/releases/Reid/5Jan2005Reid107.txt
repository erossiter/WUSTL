SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPTS TO SHIELD NEGLIGENT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to reports that the president's medical malpractice bill will shield pharmaceutical companies: 
   "Congress should not be giving a free pass to big drug companies at a time when millions of Americans may have had their health put at risk by pharmaceutical giants. And we should not be enacting measures that will drive up profits for the insurance industry but have little impact on prices for doctors and families. 
   "The skyrocketing cost of health care is a critical issue facing this country, and we must all work together to bring down costs for working families. If the president is serious about bringing down health care costs, Senate Democrats stand ready to work with him to enact reforms that deal with the health care crisis in a meaningful way."
