SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS MOVING FORWARD ON IMPORTANT ENERGY, IMMIGRATION REFORMS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today, signaling his intent to keep the Senate in session until work is finished on the energy and immigration bills: 
   "Democrats are committed to two domestic priorities that have important consequences for our national security and economy - energy and immigration reform. The American people want their Congress to help lower gas prices, make us more energy independent and reduce global warming emissions, and we look forward to passing bipartisan energy legislation that does just that.
   "We have also reached an agreement to return the immigration bill to the Senate floor after completion of the energy bill. To get to this point, I have insisted on a process to prevent endless debate and get the bill through the Senate. When the bill returns to the Senate floor, I plan to add $4.4 billion in guaranteed funding - to be funded by the fees and penalties established by the bill's new programs - to strengthen border security and speed other important elements of comprehensive reform.
   "We hope the President will work with us and that Congressional Republicans will not stall our efforts to strengthen our national security and economy. If they do, Democrats are prepared to work through the weekends and the July 4 district work period to accomplish our goals."
