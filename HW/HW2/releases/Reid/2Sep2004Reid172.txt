SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE OVER $4 MILLION FOR HENDERSON AIRPORT EXPANSION
  The Henderson Executive Airport will be safer for aircraft and passengers thanks to a $4.37 million grant announced by Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign today. 
   These funds, awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation, will be used to construct an apron, its associated taxiway, and apron components including marking, lighting and signage. 
   "These funds will ensure the safety of the growing number of travelers who are using the Henderson Executive Airport," said Reid. 
   The construction of the terminal apron at Henderson Executive Airport is necessary to meet the current and future capacity needs of the Clark County airport system. The construction of the associated taxiways will support the terminal apron and enhance safety at the airport. 
   "Safety and security are the highest priorities for our airports, and this grant will help construct the new features to accommodate Henderson Executive Airport travelers," Ensign said. 
   Of the grant money, $1.79 million is a grant determined by a pre-set formula. The remaining $2.58 million is a discretionary grant allocated from a pool of money for projects submitted by the airports and funded at the DOT's discretion.
