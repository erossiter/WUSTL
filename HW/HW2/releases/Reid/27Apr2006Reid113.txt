SEN. REID: AMERICAN FAMILIES' BUDGETS SHOULD MATTER MORE THAN BIG OIL'S PROFITS
  With today's announcement that Exxon enjoyed sky-high profits while Americans struggled with sky-high gas prices, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "It is a travesty that oil companies should be making such staggering profits on the backs of Americans trying to fill their gas tanks. Americans expect their government to do something to help, and it's time for the Republican Congress to act. Democrats have offered real solutions to provide immediate relief, and I hope Bush Republicans will join us to ease the burden on the American people."
