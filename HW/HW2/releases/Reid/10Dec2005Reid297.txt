SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER SEN. MCCARTHY
  Former Sen. Eugene McCarthy was a man of compassion and a tremendous figure in the Democratic Party. He dedicated his life to public service and made an enormous difference for the people of Minnesota and the entire United States. Though he left the Senate many years ago, he remained an important, respected voice in our nation. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family. He will be missed.
