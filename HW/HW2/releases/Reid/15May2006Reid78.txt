SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' MEMORIAL DAY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial Day, a part of Police Week. 
   "Today, as part of Police Week, we celebrate National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial Day. It is a chance to pause and give special thanks to those law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty in 2005. These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety of our communities."
   "My home state of Nevada was lucky in 2005. Fortunately no officer was killed in the line of duty. We have not been so lucky in 2006. Only a few months ago Sgt Henry Prendes, a 14 year veteran of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, was shot and killed responding to a domestic violence call. I do not need to wait until next year to send my thoughts and prayers to his wife and two young daughters."
   "I hope all Nevadans, and all Americans, will pause for a moment to remember those brave men and women who have been killed in the line of duty, and to give thanks for all those still serving the public every day."
