SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUDGET AMENDMENT TO HELP NEVADA VETERANS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released a statement hailing the passage of his amendment ending a previous five-year roadblock that prevented veterans from receiving full concurrent receipt benefits. The amendment was included in the budget which passed the Senate early this morning. 
   "Last night was a huge victory for Nevada's veterans. By passing my concurrent receipt budget amendment, the Senate took a huge step in caring for our nation's heroes. Starting this fall, this legislation ends the final five years of the ten year phase-in period for those awaiting concurrent receipt and allows all eligible disabled veterans to receive disability and retirement pay simultaneously. The phase-in limbo for concurrent receipt was an impractical policy that robbed our military men and women of benefits, and I'm glad to see it go.
   "I have worked to implement a better veterans' benefit payment system for eight years now, introducing legislation every year since 2000. I am glad that this amendment passed. This is another step toward ensuring that our veterans will finally receive the full support and care they were promised when they enrolled."
