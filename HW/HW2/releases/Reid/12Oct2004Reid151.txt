SENS. REID, ENSIGN SECURE $12.8 MILLION TO KEEP NEVADA SAFE
  Working to ensure our Army National Guard has all it needs to protect Nevadans in case of an emergency, Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign secured $12.8 million to construct a new Army National Guard Readiness Center in southern Nevada.  
   This funding is included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction bill. The bill won final approval by both the House and Senate this weekend, and is now on its way to the White House to be signed into law. 
   "Nevada's role is becoming more and more vital in protecting our homeland," said Reid. "With this readiness center, the National Guard will be well-prepared to protect the people of Nevada and the country." 
   "The new Readiness Center will greatly improve the ability of our Army National Guard to coordinate with local first responders in combating threats to Nevada and the Nation," said Ensign, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of its Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee. 
   The Readiness Center is likely to be the headquarters for the newly established Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team for the State of Nevada. This team is responsible for assisting local first responders in investigating and combating emerging chemical, biological and other terrorist threats to the State. 
   The Army National Guard Readiness Center would house all elements of the 1-99th Troop Command, the 1846th Transportation Company, 777th Engineer Utility Team, 72nd Military Police Department, Medical Detachment Area Support Unit, and the 1-99 the Troop Command Headquarters. 
   Without this Center, the units would have to operate in locations spread over 25 miles, creating command and control problems. The new facility will also allow the National Guard to grow in size by about 600 soldiers. Currently, manning is limited because of a lack of facilities. A 54-acre site is available for this project.
