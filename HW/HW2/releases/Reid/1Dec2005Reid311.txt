SEN. REID PAYS TRIBUTE TO ROSA PARKS
  Today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement commemorating the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, AL bus:  
   "Fifty years ago today, Rosa Parks, through her quiet act of refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a public bus, stood up for the civil and human rights of generations of Americans. Ms. Parks, the 'mother of the modern-day Civil Rights Movement,' contained the quiet resolve that changed the moral, social and political fabric of this country. We would do a disservice to her great legacy should America ever fall short of advancing the principled causes to which she humbly devoted her life."
