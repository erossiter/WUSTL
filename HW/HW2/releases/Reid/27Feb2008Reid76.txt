SEN. REID MEETS WITH NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met today with Nevada Department of Transportation Director Susan Martinovich to discuss transportation infrastructure needs. In light of the challenges facing the State's budget cuts, Reid remains committed to doing what he can at the federal level to ensure the state has the resources it needs. 
   "Nevada faces a projected budget shortfall of nearly $25 million," said Reid. "That's a big concern. I remain committed to working with NDOT on strategies to keep projects on schedule despite this shortfall. We need to do everything we can to keep Nevada's roads moving quickly and safely."
  "I want to thank Senator Reid for all his work and efforts in addressing our Transportation needs in Nevada," said Martinovich. "Senator Reid and the entire Nevada delegation are always responsive not only in the funding area, but in the delivery of transportation projects across the state."
  Working in conjunction with the Nevada Department of Transportation, Reid aims to provide the funding needed to meet Nevada's growing transportation needs.
