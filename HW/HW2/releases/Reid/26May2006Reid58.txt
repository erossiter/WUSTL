SENATE CONFIRMS SEN. REID NOMINEE FOR NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
The U.S. Senate today confirmed Sen. Harry Reid's choice for a seat on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  
 The Senate unanimously confirmed Dr. Greg Jaczko to a full term on the NRC. Jaczko was recess appointed to the post in 2004 and has had an exemplary record as a Commissioner since then. 
 Jaczko is a Ph.D physicist who served as a scientific advisor to both Reid and the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
 "Dr. Jaczko has served honorably in his year and a half with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission," said Reid. "I am pleased that the full Senate confirmed him to the post today so he can serve Nevada and the nation for his full term." 
 The Senate also confirmed two other nominees for the five-member NRC today. Dale Klein was confirmed as Chairman of the NRC, and Peter Lyons was confirmed as a Commissioner.
