SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON ALITO HEARINGS
  Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, released the following statement today on the Alito nomination:
   "News reports that Senator Reid told Senator Frist that Democrats would delay the committee vote on Judge Alito are inaccurate. No decision has been made regarding a Senate Judiciary Committee rule that permits any committee member to request a one-week postponement of a committee vote."
