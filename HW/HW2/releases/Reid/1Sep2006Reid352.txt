SEN. REID: WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on a new report released by the Pentagon that asserts the conditions for civil war exist in Iraq. A fact check on President Bush's recent attempts to downplay the threat of civil war is attached below. 
   "The Pentagon's new report today indicates that President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Secretary Rumsfeld's speeches are increasingly disconnected from the facts on the ground in Iraq. Even the Pentagon acknowledges Iraq is tipping into civil war. Failed Republican policies have left America bogged down in Iraq, with our military stretched thin and less able to fight and win the war on terror. With the security of the American people at risk, Republicans' failed stay the course strategy is not acceptable. It is time for a new direction to end the war in Iraq, win the war on terror, and give the American people the real security they deserve."
