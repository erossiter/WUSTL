SEN. REID FIGHTS TO IMPLEMENT 9/11 RECOMMENDATIONS
  Working to increase homeland security in Nevada and around the country, Sen. Harry Reid is pushing for prompt implementation of the recommendations made by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.  
   Five years after the attacks of September 11, only about half of the recommendations made by the Commission have been implemented. 
   "This long overdue legislation is important to the nation and to the millions of people who visit Nevada each year," said Reid. "I've continuously fought to make sure Nevada has the resources it needs to better protect our homeland and will continue doing so. My Democratic colleagues and I are ready with tough and smart policies that will improve homeland security and make America safer." 
   S. 4, The Improving America's Security Act of 2007, which has already been introduced, will fully implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to: 
   Ensure rail, airline, and border security; Block terrorists from traveling freely into the country; Improving intelligence sharing at all levels of state, local, and federal law enforcement; Give first responders the tools they need to keep us safe 
   President Bush's policies are failing America and have made our country less safe. The document below shows where Bush has fallen short and how Democrats are taking action to improve homeland security by implementing the 9/11 recommendations.
