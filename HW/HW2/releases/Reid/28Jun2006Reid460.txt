SEN. REID: AMERICANS SHOULD NOT PAY FOR BUSH REPUBLICAN INCOMPETENCE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement after the Bush Administration announced that it would pay for free credit checks at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by slashing funding needed to support farmers, college students, and Americans on food stamps. The credit checks are necessary because the VA allowed the personal information of 26.5 million veterans to be compromised by the theft of a laptop from an employee's home. 
   "It is bad enough that the American people will have to pay for the Bush Administration's dangerous incompetence at the Veterans Administration, but it is a disgrace that this White House expects farmers, college students, and Americans on food stamps to pay the whole bill. After five long years, the American people are sick and tired of paying the price for Bush Republican incompetence. It is time for a new direction."
