SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) issued the following statement on Veterans Day: 
   "Veterans Day is a day for heroes. It's a day we pause and come together for the brave men and women who wore our country's uniform. We will never be able to repay them for their sacrifice, but we take this day to honor their service and say thank you: Thank you for you courage. Thank you for your sacrifice. And thank you for standing up for freedom and liberty. I hope every American will thank a veteran today. Because of them, we are free.
   "Veterans Day is also a day to recommitment ourselves to making sure Veterans have the health care, benefits and full pay they deserve. Our Veterans gave us their best, and we must do the same for them. Not just on Veterans Day, but every day of the year.
   "Finally, this Veterans Day, we remember that a new generation of Veterans is currently serving overseas and in harm's way. These men and women remain in our thoughts and prayers. Their heroism and valor are unequaled in the world, and they deserve our deepest respect and full support. Together, we can do better."
