SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIGNING OF ADAM WALSH CHILD PROTECTION AND SAFETY ACT
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement following the signing of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act by President Bush:  
   "This law is an important step to improve the safety of our nation's children. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this significant legislation."
   "Today is the 25th anniversary of the tragic abduction and murder of the six-year old, Adam Walsh. I commend Adam's father, John Walsh, for his perseverance in fighting to protect children from sexual predators. He, his wife Revé, and other advocates have demonstrated that ordinary citizens can make a difference in our country and our world."
   "My home state of Nevada has been a leader in this movement. Our state recently made changes to improve the accuracy and reliability of the Nevada registry requirements."
   "Not all states have been as vigilant as Nevada, and that is a problem when sex offenders cross state lines. This law will establish uniform rules for the information sex offenders are required to report and when they are required to report it. It will also give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to enforce these requirements."
