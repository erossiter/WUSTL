SEN. REID: AS LABOR DAY APPROACHES, DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO PUT WORKING FAMILIES FIRST
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today to commemorate Labor Day: 
   "This Monday we will pause to honor America's hard-working men and women and the daily contributions they make to our country. But we cannot forget that so many workers in the world's wealthiest nation continue to struggle. New Census data show that while wages have declined, the number of Americans without health insurance has increased - all at a time when unemployment continues to rise.
   "Democrats are committed to an agenda that values our workers and is grounded in fiscal responsibility. We gave working Americans a long-overdue raise by increasing the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, passed a bill to make college more affordable for more Americans, passed legislation to give health care to millions of low-income children, and passed a budget that cuts taxes, controls spending and provides for our nation's priorities.
   "When Congress returns after Labor Day, Democrats will continue fighting for America's workers and to take this country in a new direction."
