SEN. REID JOINS ACTOR, ACTIVIST MICHAEL J FOX IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 810, STEM CELL RESEARCH
Americans from across the country and across the political spectrum, including the actor and activist Michael J. Fox, have spoken out in support of H.R. 810, the only legislation that offers hope to the millions of Americans waiting for the promise of stem cell research. Adding his support to this growing chorus, Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today issued the following statement.  
 A copy of the letter Mr. Fox's sent to the president, urging him not to veto H.R. 810, is attached to this release. 
 "It should be plain for President Bush to see that the American people overwhelmingly support stem cell research. He should listen to Nancy Reagan, to Michael J. Fox, and to the millions of Americans who are calling on him to sign H.R. 810. Americans with debilitating illnesses have no alternative to this important legislation, and all they ask is for the President to give them hope. It would be a tragedy if the first veto of this Administration were used to deny it to them."
