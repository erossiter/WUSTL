SEN. REID ANNOUNCES TOLL-FREE PHONE NUMBER FOR NEVADANS
  Continuing to find new and innovative ideas that will allow him to be even more accessible to his constituents, Sen.  
 Harry Reid has added a new toll-free telephone number for Nevadans to reach him in Washington, D.C. 
   The new number - 1-866-SEN-REID (736-7343) - is active as of today. 
   "My first priority always has been and always will be the people I represent in Nevada," Senator Reid said. "This toll-free number will help make sure lines of communication are open and efficient and that I'm getting as much feedback as possible. I don't want anything, such as long distance charges, to deter Nevadans from calling me whenever they have a concern or an idea about any issue." 
   To ensure that Nevada callers receive top priority when calling Reid's office, the 1-866-SEN-REID is restricted to phone numbers with (702) and (775) area codes. 
   Sen. Reid recently won reelection in Nevada with an historic 61% of the vote. Reid received broad support from Democrats, Republicans and Independents who returned him to the United States Senate.
