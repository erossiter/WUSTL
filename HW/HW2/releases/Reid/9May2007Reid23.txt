SEN REID DISCUSSES HIS COMMITMENT TO COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today discussed the need for comprehensive immigration reform, as debate on the issue is set to begin next Monday on the Senate floor.  
   Reid is committed to fixing America's broken immigration system in a tough, fair and practical way, urging the President to work with Senate Democrats to reach a bipartisan solution. 
   "We need bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens border security, reunites families, creates tough and smart workplace enforcement, and brings 12 million people out of the shadows of our society," Reid said. "We believe that our immigration laws should be realistic and reflect our nation's values. Our immigration system should make us safer while recognizing the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our nation."
