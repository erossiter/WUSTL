SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST JUSTIFICATION FOR NSA SURVEILLANCE
  After receiving a letter from the Justice Department today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the need for Bush administration officials to cooperate fully with the Senate investigation into the NSA domestic spying program:
   "The Administration's latest justification for circumventing the law to spy on Americans falls far short of answering the many questions Congress and the American people have about this activity. That is why there have been bipartisan calls for Administration officials to come to Congress to answer these questions and ensure that the Judiciary and Intelligence committees can thoroughly investigate the Administration's actions."
