SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF SEN. HAGEL
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement following the announcement by U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel of his retirement from the U.S. Senate next year:
   "Chuck Hagel has served the people of Nebraska and our nation with honor, and I will be losing a friend and colleague when he retires. He is a battlefield hero who has used his experience in war to advocate for a foreign policy that is in the best interests of our troops and our country. I hope his fellow Republicans will emulate his independence as we shape our Iraq policy in the coming months."
