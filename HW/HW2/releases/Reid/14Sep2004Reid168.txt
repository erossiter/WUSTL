SENATE PANEL APPROVES SEN. REID'S MEASURE TO NAME BRIDGE AFTER GOV. O'CALLAGHAN, TILLMAN
  The Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge would honor Nevada's late Governor Mike O'Callaghan, under a proposal by Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) that was approved by a Senate subcommittee today. Reid's measure would officially name the bridge between Nevada and Arizona the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge.  
   O'Callaghan, a decorated Korean war veteran and two-term governor of Nevada, died in March at the age of 74. Tillman, a professional football player with the Arizona Cardinals and a volunteer with the U.S. Army Rangers, was killed in action in Afghanistan in April at the age of 27. 
   "Mike O'Callaghan was my mentor and my good friend," said Reid. "He was also a big supporter of the Hoover Dam Bypass project, so I think it's appropriate that the bridge will carry his name. This is a great way for Americans to honor two of our war heroes - distinguished men who fought to protect us in two different conflicts half a century apart." 
   The Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge is now under construction. It will allow traffic to move between Nevada and Arizona without going directly over Hoover Dam, which could be a Homeland Security risk. Reid has won approximately $60 million in federal funding for the project over the last five years. 
   The bipartisan amendment is supported by Senators John Ensign (R-NV), John McCain (R-AZ), and Jon Kyl (R-AZ). 
   "This will serve as a meaningful and appropriate tribute to two American heroes," Ensign said. "Mike O'Callaghan served Nevada and his country through a lifetime of sacrifice, dedication, and leadership and Pat Tillman turned down athletic fame and fortune only to die defending America. I'm proud to support this tribute." 
   The measure was added as an amendment to the Transportation Appropriations Bill, which passed a Senate subcommittee this afternoon. It now goes to the full Senate Appropriations Committee.
