SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION REFORM BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following remarks today after the Senate Banking Committee approved the FHA Modernization Act of 2007 by a vote of 20 to 1: 
   "Today the Senate banking committee - through Senator Dodd's leadership and the important contributions of many other Democratic members of the committee - took an important step in addressing some of the problems that have arisen in our nation's housing and mortgage markets. The FHA Modernization Act of 2007 is designed to bring added flexibility to the Federal Housing Administration so that more American families will have more options for safer mortgage products. It does so by raising the loan limits for FHA insurance eligibility, thus increasing the availability of safe, FHA-backed loans in the marketplace, and adjusting the amount and manner in which FHA-insurance premiums are paid by mortgage borrowers. These changes should make the FHA program a better option for both new homeowners and those borrowers looking to refinance their mortgage. This is particularly important in states such as Nevada, where the rate of foreclosure on homes is three times the national average. Nevada homeowners who were duped into predatory loans and have fallen behind need the kind of alternatives afforded by this legislation. I applaud Senator Dodd's leadership and the Senate banking committee's action in ordering that this important legislation be reported to the full Senate."
   Nevadans are disproportionately affected by the sub-prime lending crisis:
   * Nevada reported one foreclosure filing for every 165 households - more than three times the national average. 
   * The state had 6,197 filings in August, an increase of 21 percent from July and more than triple the year-ago figure.
