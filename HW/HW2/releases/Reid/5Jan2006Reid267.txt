SEN. REID: RECESS APPOINTMENT OF PETER KIRSANOW TO NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD IS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO AMERICAN WORKERS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the recess appointment of Peter Kirsanow to the National Labor Relations Board: 
   "I am deeply disappointed that the President chose to recess appoint Peter Kirsanow to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Mr. Kirsanow's background raises serious questions about his ability to fulfill the NLRB's important work of protecting the rights of workers to unionize and of enforcing against unfair labor practices. At a time when American workers face ever greater challenges, this appointment sends to them a disheartening and distressful message."
