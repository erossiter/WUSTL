SEN. REID: A YEAR AFTER KATRINA, THE GULF COAST STILL NEEDS HOPE AND RECOVERY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement to mark the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall.  
   "It has been one year since Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of the Gulf Coast and ripped away the illusion that our government was prepared to respond to a national emergency. In that year, the residents of the battered region have struggled to move on and to rebuild. Unfortunately in Washington, too many have simply moved on."
   "One year later, it is time for a new direction. Too many across the Gulf Coast still have not seen the reconstruction they deserve, and across America, too many are still waiting for the real security they demand. Now is the time for the government to keep the promises it made after the hurricanes. It is time to put aside the failure and incompetence of the last year and change the destruction and despair across the Gulf Coast to a new spirit of hope and recovery."
