SEN. REID: BUSH IS NOT CREDIBLE ON NATIONAL SECURITY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on President Bush's comments today about national security.  
   "President Bush is no longer credible with the American people, no matter how many campaign speeches he gives in the next month. The President won't listen to the 16 intelligence agencies that say that the war in Iraq has made the threat of terrorism worse. His Secretary of State apparently ignored warnings of an Al Qaeda attack months before September 11. His Republican leader in the Senate thinks America should empower the Taliban terrorists who aided and abetted Osama bin Laden. The sad truth is this White House and this Republican-controlled Congress have put our national security at risk. It's time for a change. The American people expect more than tough talk from their leaders. They expect tough and smart action. Democrats are fighting to take this country in a new direction."
