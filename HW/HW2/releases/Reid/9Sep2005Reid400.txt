SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NRC LICENSING UTAH NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE SITE
  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "Transporting high-level radioactive waste to Utah is as dangerous as it would be transporting it to Nevada. Thousands of tons of deadly nuclear material will pass homes, schools, businesses and churches in communities all across the country, and there is simply no way to safely do this. In Nevada, we will continue to fight as hard as we always have to stop the proposed Yucca Mountain site. The safest and smartest solution to solving the nation's nuclear waste problem is to store waste at the facilities where it is already being produced, as Sen. Ensign and I have proposed."
