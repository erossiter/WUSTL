SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE $400K TO HELP LAKE TAHOE
  Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada announced the Desert Research Institute in Reno will receive $400,000 to develop strategies to improve the air quality in the Lake Tahoe Basin.  
   "Lake Tahoe is one of Nevada's glistening jewels," said Reid. "Air pollution harms the health of our residents and the Lake's ecosystem, as well as limiting its beautiful vistas. We must do more to protect this important lake. This funding will help Nevada's talented scientists perform the research needed to analyze pollution and improve the air quality in the Lake Tahoe Basin." 
   "Lake Tahoe is a national treasure, and it is important that we work to protect not only the clarity of the water but also the quality of the air," said Ensign. "Individuals from around the world come to Lake Tahoe for its beauty and year-round recreational activities. These funds will protect this pristine area now and into the future." The Desert Research Institute is a non-profit research campus of more than 500 faculty, staff and students that conduct environmental research on a local, national, and international scale. This project is part of the Lake Tahoe Environmental Improvement Program and is funded by the Lake Tahoe Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA). Reid and Ensign have been instrumental in developing the SNPLMA legislation that allows money generated from land sales to be used for high priority conservation, park, and trail projects.
