SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LITTLE ROCK NINE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High School:  
   "Fifty years ago today, nine courageous students helped change the course of history of the United States. The individual and collective efforts of these students - commonly known as the Little Rock Nine - in the fall of 1957 led to enormous changes in the American education system and American society as a whole. But we need to look no further than the tragedy of Katrina or the injustice in Jena to realize just how much work there is left to do. Inspired by the nine African-American teen-agers who walked into an Arkansas public high school half a century ago, Senate Democrats will continue working to keep the march of progress moving forward."
