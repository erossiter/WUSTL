SEN. REID: NICHOLSON MUST RESIGN
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement, calling on Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson to resign after his department admitted to having lost the personal information of tens of thousands of veterans yet again. A fact sheet detailing the incompetence at the Department of Veterans Affairs is below.  
   "Less than a month after promising to make the VA the 'gold standard' in data security, Secretary Nicholson has again presided over loss of the personal information of thousands more veterans. Our brave troops, who risk their lives to protect our country, should not also have to fight to protect their personal data again and again. Unfortunately, this dangerous incompetence has become all too common in the Bush White House, and it has made America less safe."
   "Enough is enough. From Iraq to the VA, it is time President Bush and his Republican Congress started demanding accountability on matters of national security. Secretary Nicholson must resign immediately and be replaced with an individual who will do more than talk, but deliver on the promises America makes to those who serve."
