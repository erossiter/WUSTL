SEN. REID: LONG-OVERDUE TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on the passage of middle-class tax relief.  
 "Congress has finally taken a long-overdue step to provide much deserved tax relief to middle-class Americans. This bill continues important deductions for state sales taxes, tuition payments and teachers' out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies. Businesses will continue to have access to critical tax incentives for conducting research and development in the U.S. and providing jobs to those transitioning from welfare to work. Unfortunately, since the Do Nothing 109th Congress pushed this important tax relief to the very last day of the session, millions of Americans will face confusion when preparing their tax returns because the tax forms won't adequately reflect our work today. This did not have to be the case. Hopefully in the 110th Congress, Democrats and Republicans will put aside partisanship and work together on behalf of America's middle class."
