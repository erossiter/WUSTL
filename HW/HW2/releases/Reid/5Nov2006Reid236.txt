SEN. REID: JUSTICE FOR IRAQI PEOPLE, OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE COURSE
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on Saddam Hussein's verdict and the need for a change of course in Iraq:  
   "Today, the Iraqi people received the justice they long deserved. Saddam Hussein was a brutal tyrant who brought nothing but fear and oppression to millions. Hopefully, this verdict will be an important part of healing the deep wounds he inflicted on his own country. 
   "How much the verdict and sentence will affect the course of the war remains to be seen. It is clear, however, that more than three and a half years after the invasion, Iraq has descended into a civil war. 
   "The Iraqis have traded a dictator for chaos. Neither option is acceptable, especially when it is our troops who are caught in the middle. 
   "We have seen milestones pass in Iraq before, with no lasting signs of progress. If today's sentencing is to be any different, we need to take a new direction in Iraq. On this day of justice for the Iraqi people, President Bush must explain to the American people how he intends to change course, so that our troops will finally have a strategy to complete the mission, Iraqis will finally have a plan to restore order to their country, and the mission can finally be accomplished."
