PRESIDENT BUSH VETOES WATER RESOURCES BILL WITH IMPORTANT NEVADA FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after President Bush vetoed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007:  
   "I'm disappointed President Bush vetoed this important legislation that would help ensure Nevada's water systems and flood control projects are appropriately funded. Although 81 Senators voted to strengthen our environment and economy and protect our natural resources through the Water Resources Development Act, President Bush has again said no to these critical priorities. Through his veto the president has again made clear that he is out of touch with the needs of Nevadans and the West. He has said no to providing authority for essential rural water conservation and quality improvement projects, no to programs to combat flood and natural disaster damage and no to programs to restore ecosystems. By saying no to this bill Bush is denying much needed resources to the residents of rural and urban Nevada. I'll work hard to override the president's veto; after all it has received wide bipartisan support. I will continue my work to ensure Nevada's needs are met."
