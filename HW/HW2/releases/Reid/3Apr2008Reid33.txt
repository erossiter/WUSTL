SEN. REID MEETS WITH CARSON CITY MAYOR TEIXEIRA
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met today with Carson City Mayor Marv Teixeira to discuss anti methamphetamine efforts, transportation projects, and Waterfall Fire rehabilitation efforts.  
   "During our meeting we discussed the latest developments for the V & T Railway Reconstruction Project, Partnership Carson City Anti-Meth Coalition and the Carson Freeway," said Reid. "I'm also working to secure more funding for the Waterfall Fire rehabilitation efforts after the 2004 Waterfall wildfire devastated the community." 
   "It was a pleasure to meet with Senator Reid," said Teixeria. "He is more than a Senator to me; he is my dear friend and always extends the greatest courtesy when I'm in town. It's always a nice to work with the Senator and his staff on issues important to Carson City." 
   Carson City suffered a wildfire July 14, 2004 that blackened more than 8,700 acres and charred all the vegetation. Carson City now faces threats from flooding and potential debris flows and severe damage to surface water supplies. With Reid's support, the City received $286,977 this year for rehabilitation work necessary to control erosion and prevent flooding. Reid is working to secure additional funding to continue the rehabilitation efforts.
