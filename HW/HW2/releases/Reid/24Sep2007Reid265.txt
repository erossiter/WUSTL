SEN. REID: PRESIDENT MUST WORK WITH DEMOCRATS TO INVEST IN AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today following President Bush's remarks this morning: 
   "After running up $3 trillion in new debt - including more than half a trillion dollars for his flawed Iraq policy - it is astounding that the President is once again lecturing Congress about fiscal responsibility and fiscal priorities. Democrats are investing in the priorities of America's middle class families, veterans and children, and are dedicated to fighting terror more effectively; President Bush wants to continue investing only in Iraq.
   "Average Americans are struggling to make ends meet under the Bush economy, as more than 2 million Americans have lost health care in the last year and the economy lost jobs in August. Meanwhile, Osama bin Laden remains at large while brave Americans die in an Iraqi civil war. But as the President stubbornly refuses to fund basic necessities, Democrats have worked to cut taxes for middle class families, raise the minimum wage, make college more affordable, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and invest in America's infrastructure - which would create many new jobs.
   "The only things 'harmful to our economy' and 'unfair for the taxpayers' are President Bush's misguided priorities - billions for Iraq and tax breaks for multi-millionaires. It is time for President Bush and Republicans in Congress to work with Democrats to put the middle class first."
