SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEWLY RELEASED UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement in response to the unemployment numbers released today by the United States Department of Labor: 
  "The unemployment numbers released today by the Labor Department show that the number of unemployed Nevadans increased by more than 20 percent in the last year. This is another reminder that the Bush administration's 'wait and see' approach isn't working in Nevada or anywhere else. Bush continues to turn a blind eye to Nevadans suffering in this economic slump. In fact, just last month, he refused to extend unemployment insurance benefits to those most in need. It's time for a change. 
   "Our economy is suffering and, while economists are examining all the contributing factors, it is clear the foreclosure crisis is playing a major role. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to end Nevada's home foreclosure crisis. At the same time, I will also stay focused on making Nevada the leader in renewable energy so we can create thousands of jobs that will put unemployed Nevadans back to work."
