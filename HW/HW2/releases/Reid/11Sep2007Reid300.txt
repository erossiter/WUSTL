SEN. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE GRANT FUNDING FOR FORENSICS EQUIPMENT FOR CITY OF HENDERSON
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada announced today that the City of Henderson has been awarded a grant of $83,653 from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice for the purchase of forensics equipment. 
   "This equipment will significantly improve the efficiency of forensic services needed by the Henderson Police Department," said Reid. "The ability to complete forensic testing on site will expedite the processes investigators and the courts use to keep dangerous criminals off the streets." 
   "We must work to ensure that law enforcement has the ability to perform at the highest possible level," said Ensign. "These additional resources will help accelerate the identification of criminals, making the residents of Henderson safer."
   Currently, the City of Henderson relies on two Las Vegas laboratories for the analysis of specimens. This outsourcing of blood and urine specimens requiring toxicological analysis causes delays and threatens their integrity.
