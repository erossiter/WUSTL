SEN. REID ANNOUNCES CONTRACT AWARDED FOR ELKO'S CALIFORNIA TRAIL CENTER
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management announced today that a $9.45 million contract will go to West Coast Contractors of Nevada, Inc., a Reno-based company, to construct the California National Historic Trails Interpretive Center.  
   "I'm pleased to know this project, a project that I have worked on for over 6 years with Elko's community leaders, will be built by a Reno based company," said Reid. "West Coast Contractors of Nevada will build an exemplary Center. When completed, the California Trail Interpretive Center will chronicle the pioneering spirit of our early settlers. It will be an important tourist destination in northern Nevada." 
   Reid passed legislation in 2000 authorizing construction of the center and has secured more than $8 million to support construction of the facility. 
   Northeast Nevada played an important role in the history of the great western migration to the California gold fields. Between the late 1840s and 1860s, more than 300,000 people passed through the California Trail in pursuit of a dream. More than 650 miles of the California Trail traverses Nevada. 
   Construction is estimated to take 18 to 20 months and the Trail Center is scheduled to open in the late summer of 2008.
