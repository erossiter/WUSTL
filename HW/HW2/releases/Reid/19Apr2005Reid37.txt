NEVADA'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TEAMS UP TO PROTECT FARM, RANCH LAND, PROVIDE WATER FOR WALKER LAKE
  Nevada's Congressional delegation released news of their latest efforts to provide a balanced and comprehensive approach to managing land and resources in Nevada. Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign and Rep. Jim Gibbons announced today more than $95 million for agriculture and water projects primarily in Lyon and Mineral counties. The bulk of the money, $70 million, will go to the University of Nevada to conduct research and carry out restoration activities in the Walker River Basin and to give added flexibility to ranchers and farmers in the region.  
   "Nevada's sportsmen, farmers, ranchers, and Tribes are among the best stewards of our land and wildlife. With this funding, we are creating a way for these folks to partner with our university experts to solve some of the toughest natural resource challenges in the country," Senator Reid said. "We believe that this deal allows us to begin real efforts to save Walker Lake while improving the quality of life throughout the Walker River Basin and creating a pre-eminent University resource in rural Nevada." 
   "This project will tap into the expertise of the University of Nevada, Reno as we bolster our water conservation efforts, especially as they pertain to Walker Lake," Senator Ensign said. "This is proof that we can implement meaningful conservation measures while protecting Nevada's farmers and ranchers." 
   "I am pleased that with the efforts of Senators Reid and Ensign, we were able to create an innovative agriculture program at the University of Nevada, Reno that will focus on the conservation and restoration of the Walker River Basin," Congressman Jim Gibbons said. "This program will help to protect one of Nevada's most endangered lakes, Walker Lake, and support new cooperative environmental activities in the region while still ensuring the livelihood of farmers and cattlemen." 
   "The University is pleased to have this opportunity to leverage its growing agricultural and natural resources academic and research expertise on behalf of Nevada's citizens," said President John M. Lilley. "We are grateful to Nevada's congressional delegation for creating this important partnership to address the resource challenges facing the state." 
   The amendment provides: 
   * $70 million to the University of Nevada to establish and administer an agricultural and natural resources center to work on research, restoration and educational activities in the Walker River basin. 
   * Land, water, and facilities to work on Walker River basin conservation projects will be purchased only from willing sellers. Of the funding, $5 million will be used for wild horse and burro research and adoption marketing. 
   * $10 million for a water lease and purchase program for the Walker River Tribe 
   * $10 million for tamarisk eradication and riparian area and channel restoration 
   * $5 million for fishery improvements and the Western Inland Trout Initiative 
   * $850,000 to help expedite the restoration of Argenta Marsh and related wetlands 
   The funding was originally included in the Farm Bill which passed Congress in 2002. At that time, Sen. Reid included $200 million in funding for conservation projects at places like Walker Lake. The legislation introduced today was added as an amendment to the Iraq Supplemental bill currently before the Senate, and was needed in order to release the money secured in the Farm Bill. Additionally, the legislation instructs how the money should be used and directs the $70 million to UNR.
