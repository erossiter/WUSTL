SEN. REID CALLS SEN. DEMINT'S AMENDMENT A DISTRACTION
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "Once again the Republicans in Congress are distracting, distorting and refusing to deal with the real problem at hand. If they are serious about protecting benefits and strengthening Social Security, they will drop their privatization plan and the benefit cuts and massive debt that come with it. Democrats are ready to work across the aisle to strengthen Social Security for the long term and we will continue to side with American people against any privatization plan."
