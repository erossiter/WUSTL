SEN. REID: INTELLIGENCE REPORT DETAILS FURTHER EVIDENCE ADMINISTRATION IGNORED PRE-WAR WARNINGS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's release of one of the final remaining sections of the its review on pre-war intelligence: 
   "Despite more than three years of stonewalling by Republicans in Congress and the Bush Administration, Democrats have taken another major step forward in restoring accountability to government by completing another exhaustive investigation of the Bush Administration's dangerous incompetence. This new Senate Intelligence Committee report clearly demonstrates that the Bush Administration ignored and dismissed its best intelligence experts' warnings to expect major challenges in post-war Iraq. We have seen the terrible consequences to American national security that have resulted from the Bush Administration's failures over the last five years. 
   "What concerns me most is that the Bush Administration continues even today to ignore the advice of the best experts and the will of the American people when it comes to our Iraq strategy. We need a change of course in our Iraq strategy as called for by the Iraq Study Group and Congressional Democrats, and there is no time to waste."
