SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DOE'S PLAN TO REVIVE YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement in response to the Energy Department's announcement that it will introduce legislation to revive the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain.  
   "The proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain is dying and the Energy Department knows it. This is just the Department's latest attempt to breathe life into this dying beast and it will fail. As Senate Majority Leader I will continue to leverage my leadership position to prevent the dump from ever being built. 
   "While Nevada is always my top priority, this is more than a Nevada issue, it is a national issue. The Energy Department cites a 'moral obligation' to build the dump, but it is highly immoral to put millions of people at risk by hauling more than 70,000 tons of the most dangerous substance known to man past America's schools, hospitals and businesses."
