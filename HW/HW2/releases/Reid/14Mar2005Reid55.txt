SEN. REID ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR GRIFFIN AS NASA CHIEF
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), the Senate Democratic Leader, announced his support today for the appointment of Dr.  
 Michael D. Griffin to serve as the next Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 
   Griffin holds seven degrees, including a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering, an M.S.E. in Aerospace Science, an M.B.A., and an M.S. in Civil Engineering. He was recently the head of the prestigious Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. 
   Reid said Griffin's academic achievements and long career in aerospace have prepared him well to take control of NASA. 
   "NASA has a proud history and a dedicated workforce," said Reid. "However, as the Columbia tragedy shows, the agency's future remains uncertain and significant reforms will be required. Michael Griffin has the talent and the will to shepherd NASA through what are bound to be some difficult times." 
   Reid also highlighted the need for NASA to pay more attention to small businesses. 
   "The success of Burt Rutan and Paul Allen's SpaceShipOne showed what small businesses can do," said Reid. "NASA needs to be much more aggressive in using the creativity of entrepreneurial groups, in Nevada and around the country. From his publications and speeches, it appears that Dr. Griffin has an excellent understanding of the need to collaborate with entrepreneurs. I look forward to working with him to ensure that NASA supports these exciting new endeavors."
