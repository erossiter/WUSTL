SEN. REID REACTS TO BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSALS
  Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the Bush Administration's proposed plan to privatize Social Security.
   "I recognize the need and am happy to work with the President on a responsible and bipartisan plan to reform Social Security. However, there is no emergency at this time. The Social Security trust funds will provide full benefits for almost 50 years. We need to see the details of the President's plan. And I will not support a plan that requires deep benefit cuts or massive increases in debt."
