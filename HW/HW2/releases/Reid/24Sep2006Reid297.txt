SEN. REID: CONTRARY TO WHITE HOUSE PR CAMPAIGN, BUSH IRAQ POLICIES HAVE MADE AMERICA LESS SAFE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on press reports that the National Intelligence Estimate, the most authoritative summary of the opinion of America's intelligence community, has concluded that the war in Iraq has made the threat of terrorism worse.  
   "Once again, the American people have learned that the Bush Administration has not been honest with them about the war in Iraq. Press reports say our nation's intelligence services have confirmed that President Bush's repeated missteps in Iraq and his stubborn refusal to change course have made America less safe. No election-year White House PR campaign can hide this truth. It is crystal clear that America's security demands we change course in Iraq. The war in Iraq is now in its fourth year and Congress has yet to ask the tough questions and get the honest answers our nation's security demands. Tomorrow, that will change. With the Democratic Policy Committee's hearings into the conduct of the war in Iraq, we will finally take America in a new direction."
