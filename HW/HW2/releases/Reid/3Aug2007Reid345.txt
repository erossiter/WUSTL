SEN. REID: SENATE PASSES BILL TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE TO MILLIONS OF LOW-INCOME CHILDREN
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed a bill to renew coverage for the 6.6 million children currently in the Children's Health Insurance Program and enroll 3.2 million more: 
   "The Senate did the right thing today in fulfilling our promise to improve the lives of millions of American children, and we did it the right way - in a bipartisan fashion. By renewing and enhancing the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), we are combining the best of public and private health coverage to keep low-income kids covered and enroll millions more.
   "Ten years after Congress created the program, we have reduced the number of low-income, uninsured children by one-third, covering more than 10 million kids. Today, while 6.6 million children have health care thanks to this outstanding program, the cost of quality health care is still prohibitive for too many. We urge the President - who ran on the promise to enroll millions of more children in CHIP - to keep his word rather than deny kids in working families the doctor visits and medicines they need when they're sick and the checkups they need to stay well."
