SEN. REID PRIORITIZES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PRIVACY, SECURITY OF NEVADAN
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced today that he is supporting bipartisan legislation that would provide Nevadans with greater privacy protection and notifies them if a security breach could result in their information landing in the wrong hands.  
   "As technology continues to grow and our reliance on electronic record systems increases, so does the sophistication of those looking to prey on innocent people," said Reid. "This is tough and smart legislation that will protect Nevada consumers and prosecute criminals." 
   Americans continue to face increased identity theft. Last summer there was a security breach involving two federal agencies that admitted losing the personal information of a combined 171,000 individuals. Most recently, TJX Companies, parent company to TJ Maxx and Marshalls, fell victim to a data breach when hackers broke into their credit card processing network to steal customer's financial information. 
   The bill, called the Leahy-Specter Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2007, provides tough monetary penalties for failing to provide privacy and security protections and notices of security breaches, and toughens criminal penalties for those who infiltrate systems to compromise personal data. It also imposes a criminal penalty in cases were there is intentional and willful concealment of a security breach. 
   The bill also: 
   * Adds unauthorized access to sensitive personally identifiable information to the criminal prohibition against computer fraud;
   * Requires data brokers to let individuals know what information they have about them, and where appropriate, allow individuals to correct inaccuracies;
   * Requires companies that have databases with personal information on more than 10,000 Americans to establish and implement data privacy and security programs, and vet third-party contractors hired to process data;
   * Requires that law enforcement, consumers and credit reporting agencies be notified when digitized sensitive personal information has been compromised;
   * Addresses the government's use of personal data by requiring the General Services Administration to evaluate the privacy and security practices of potential government contractors. Federal departments/agencies would also be required to conduct privacy impact assessments on their use of commercial databases to access personal data on U.S. persons and to adopt regulations to ensure the security and privacy of this data and to audit the information security practices of commercial data brokers hired for projects involving personal data.
