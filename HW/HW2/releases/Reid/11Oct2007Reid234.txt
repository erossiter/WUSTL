SEN. REID HELPS DEDICATE NEW HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOME
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada was joined by the Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas Advisory Board, and other community leaders today to dedicate the newest Habitat for Humanity home for Maria Martinez and her family. 
  "This home is a symbol of how successful partnerships can be in Nevada," said Reid. "Ms. Martinez and her family are able to enjoy this new home because people from different walks of life were kind enough to donate their time, energy, and resources to help Habitat for Humanity make it possible."
  In addition to dedicating the new home, Todd Nigro, the 2007 Chairman of the Board of Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas introduced the 2007 Advisory Board, of which Reid is a member.
  "We are honored to have Senator Reid as a member of the Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas Board of Advisors," said Guy Amato, President & CEO of Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas. "By lending his name and good offices to the Habitat mission along with other community leaders, we hope to advance the cause of affordable housing in our valley. Habitat for Humanity Las Vegas is part of the answer, but we need a broader community response to begin to address the issue comprehensively. Advocating for affordable housing solutions, even beyond the scope of our organization, is part of our mission."
  Each new homeowner, in addition to making a down payment and the mortgage payments, has to invest at least 200 hours of their own time or "sweat equity" into building their house and houses for others.
