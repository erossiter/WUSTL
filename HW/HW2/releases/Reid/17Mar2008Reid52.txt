SEN. REID: CHENEY'S CURRENT VIEW OF IRAQ WAR ECHOES HIS PREVIOUS MISTAKEN ASSESSMENTS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to comments made by Vice President Cheney that the Iraq war has been a "successful endeavor" that is "well worth the effort":  
   "The Vice President's remarks today minimizing the costs and consequences of the Administration's Iraq strategy are reminiscent of his comments five years ago that we would be greeted as liberators and his comments three years ago that the insurgency was in its last throes. It would be far better if the Vice President would explain how his Administration intends to use its final months to find Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's senior leadership - neither of whom are in Iraq - as well as how it intends to win the war in Afghanistan and address our military's readiness challenges that leave us unprepared for the next crisis."
