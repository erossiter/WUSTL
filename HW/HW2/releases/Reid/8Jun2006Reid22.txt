SEN. REID ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR CLEANER, SAFER WATER IN DOUGLAS COUNTY
  Sen. Harry Reid announced today that Douglas County will receive $725,000 in federal funding to help make its drinking water safer. 
   The money will be used to replace a non-functioning well, construct a new pump house and replace a transmission line. The project will bring the water system into compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
   "This is great news for Douglas County," said Reid. "This funding will ensure that the residents of Topaz Ranch Estates have access to the safest and cleanest drinking water possible. I am pleased to know this money will be used to protect the health of Nevadans."
   The Safe Drinking Water Act was originally passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. The law was amended in 1986 and 1996 to further protect drinking water and its sources: rivers, lakes, reservoirs, springs, and ground water wells. 
   Topaz Ranch Estates General Improvement District has been approved for a $614,000 loan and an $111,538 grant. The funds are provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development.
