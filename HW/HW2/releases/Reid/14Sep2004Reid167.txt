SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROY HORN VIDEOTAPE
  "I have been working to end an impasse between the USDA and Feld Entertainment.  
 The USDA is investigating the October Siegfried and Roy show where Roy Horn was injured. Feld Entertainment has a videotape of that show. USDA investigators wanted to take custody of the tape, but given the interest in the case, I had serious concerns that the tape would be leaked - and that would be simply unfair to Mr. Horn. 
   I drafted an amendment to protect Mr. Horn's privacy, while also helping the investigation to move forward. However, I'm happy to say my amendment will not be needed. The USDA and Feld Entertainment have worked out a compromise. Their lawyers will view the tape together in Washington, D.C. next week - but the USDA will not keep the tape. I think this is the best possible solution and I hope it will resolve the issue entirely, but I will be happy to help Mr. Horn if I'm needed."
