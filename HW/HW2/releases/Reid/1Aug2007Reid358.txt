SEN. REID: DOE HIRING PR FIRM TO DO YUCCA'S DIRTY WORK
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after learning the Department of Energy is searching for a public relations firm: 
   "Nevadans know that the Energy Department has a long history of playing fast and loose with the facts when it comes to Yucca Mountain, but the fact that the Department is hiring a P.R. firm to do its dirty work is yet another example that this project is on its last legs. The D.O.E. and the nuclear industry are desperate to turn Nevada into a nuclear dumping ground, despite the risks it poses to Nevada and the communities through which the waste would travel. The Energy Department should stop wasting taxpayers' dollars and work on ways to safely store the waste at the sites where it is produced."
