SEN. REID: EARTH DAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSH TO CHANGE COURSE
As we celebrate Earth Day, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the Bush Administration's flawed priorities and failed policies that have allowed gas prices to skyrocket and America to remain dependent on foreign oil.  
 "Earth Day is normally a wonderful time to celebrate environmental accomplishments. This year, with gas prices skyrocketing around the country and Americans struggling just to fill their cars and go to work, it sadly highlights the failure of the Bush Administration's energy policies. Now is time for a real change, and for a new direction. The Bush Administration's energy failure is not about politics, it's about priorities. 
 "It's time we put aside partisan differences and do what is best for the American people. That is why Democrats have called on President Bush to immediately convene a bipartisan national energy summit to solve the problem of America's dangerous dependence on foreign oil and offered solutions to lower gas prices. Today, as we celebrate Earth Day, I hope Republicans will join Democrats and do what is best for our country."
