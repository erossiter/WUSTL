DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ASK PRESIDENT TO INVESTIGATE, RELIEVE HIGH GAS PRICES
  Today, Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Assistant Democrat Leader Dick Durbin, and Sen.  
 Maria Cantwell sent a letter to the White House asking the President to take a leadership role in helping to bring down gas prices. While oil companies are experiencing record profits, American families and businesses are facing record gas prices, even when crude oil supplies are at record highs. 
   Democratic Senators are calling on the President to work with the Federal Trade Commission to help calm the oil futures market, to investigate any artificially inflated prices, and the lack of transparency in oil and gasoline markets. It's time for the Bush administration to show some leadership on this issue. The Administration needs to put the concerns of average Americans ahead of the special interests by addressing the crushing burden skyrocketing gas prices have placed on Americans.
