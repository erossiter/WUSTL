SEN. REID: AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE DEMANDED NEW DIRECTION
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement.  
   "The American people have spoken and they have demanded change. They want, they deserve, and they are going to get a new direction--at home and in Iraq. Americans chose Democrats because we fought for the people and we fought for change. Now the Congress must honor that choice with a new beginning. I have already reached out to Senator McConnell and asked him to join me in making the Congress work for the American people again. Americans have had enough of the partisanship. Now we must work together to move America forward. 
   "America needs change, and change starts in Iraq. The President must listen and work with Democrats to fix his failed policy. Americans have demanded a new direction. Democrats are ready to deliver."
