SEN. REID JOINS SEN. CANTWELL IN WORKING TO END GAS PRICE GOUGING
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in support of Sen.  
 Maria Cantwell's legislation to stop gas price gouging: 
   "American consumers and families are struggling in the face of skyrocketing gasoline and energy prices. The staggering increase in gas prices that occurred throughout the past summer was greatly exacerbated by Hurricane Katrina as prices jumped through the roof. It is time that we give our families immediate relief and the assurance that oil and the big energy companies are playing by the rules. 
   "I am pleased to join Senator Cantwell in her efforts to stop gas price gouging and I join her in calling for swift action on the Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act. We must stop oil companies from taking advantage of natural disasters by gouging consumers at the pump. We must toughen our enforcement and increase transparency in the oil market so that Big Oil does not take advantage of American workers. 
   "We must take action immediately to provide relief for the current crisis but we must also take real steps to break America's dependence on foreign oil. Democrats are determined to put America on a firm and sustainable path towards energy independence by 2020. This will not only stabilize prices, it will benefit our economy and make America more secure for the future."
