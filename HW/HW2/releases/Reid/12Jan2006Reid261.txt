SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONCLUSION OF ALITO TESTIMONY
  The following is a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on the conclusion of Judge Alito's testimony. 
   "I have followed the Alito hearings closely. Democrats on the Committee did their jobs by asking tough questions about important issues: civil rights, privacy, environmental protections, the danger of unchecked presidential power and others. Unfortunately, Judge Alito's responses did little to address my serious concerns about his 15-year judicial record.
   "I have not forgotten that Judge Alito was only nominated after the radical right wing of the President's party forced Harriet Miers to withdraw. The right wing insisted that Justice O'Connor be replaced with a sure vote for their extreme agenda. Four days of hearings have shown that Judge Alito is no Sandra Day O'Connor. 
   "Senate Democrats will meet next week to discuss the nomination."
