SEN. REID: THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN IRAQ
  Today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the challenges ahead in Iraq:  
   "The parliamentary elections in Iraq this week are an important step forward and I salute the bravery of the Iraqi people and our troops who are working to make these elections possible. However, a significant amount of work lies ahead after the elections if we are to make the crucial transition to place the future of Iraq squarely in the hands of the Iraqi people and allow our troops to come home. 
   "The window of opportunity for the Iraqi people and this Administration to get things right will not stay open for ever. While the president gave his third major address on his Iraq policy in the past two weeks, I regret that the American people have still not received a plan that identifies the remaining political, military and economic objectives that must be met in order to succeed. Until the president achieves that goal, Democrats will continue to ask the hard questions and demand a strategy for success that will successfully complete the mission and bring our troops home."
