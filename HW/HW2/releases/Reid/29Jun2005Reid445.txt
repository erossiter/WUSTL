SEN. REID REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO STOP PRIVATIZATION
  "By now my Republican colleagues should realize that proposals to weaken Social Security are out of place in this debate.  
 Yet once again, the Republican majority is pushing a risky privatization scheme that will weaken Social Security, cut benefits and increase the debt. 
   "I also would have hoped by now that my Republican colleagues would have realized that Democrats are not going to fall for their publicly announced bait and switch scam. We have not and we will not. Democrats are ready, willing and able to join together in a bipartisan conversation to strengthen Social Security and are eager for the president and the Republican leadership in Congress to put their risky privatization scheme aside so we can address the real concerns of the American people."
