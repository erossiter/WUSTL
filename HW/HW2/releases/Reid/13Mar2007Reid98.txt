SEN. REID PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF CRITICAL 9/11 LEGISLATION
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on the Senate's passage of landmark legislation to fully implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.  
   "Preventing another 9/11 tragedy should be the highest responsibility of government. Today, the Senate has taken another major step towards fully implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. For too long, the Bush Administration and a complacent Republican Congress ignored these critical homeland security improvements and left our country less safe than it should be. The American people have demanded change, and Senate Democrats are delivering the tough and smart solutions needed to make this country more secure. Now President Bush must take back his threat to veto the 9/11 legislation. He and Republicans in Congress must not stand between the American people and the security they deserve."
