SEN. REID EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "This year, we are taking important steps forward in opening a crucial avenue of medical discovery, embryonic stem cell research.  
 The House passed stem cell bill was a victory for millions of Americans who suffer from deadly diseases and for their families. It was also a victory for bipartisanship. I am pleased that this spirit of bipartisanship continues in the Senate. 
   "Stem cell research has the potential to lead to treatments and cures for many debilitating diseases, including Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, and diabetes. We have a moral obligation to pursue promising avenues of research, like stem cell research, that has the potential to cure disease and alleviate human suffering. 
   "I look forward to working with the leaders on this issue in the Senate -- Senators Harkin, Specter, Kennedy, Smith, Feinstein and Hatch - to pass this important legislation. I hope that Senator Frist will join us in this fight and take up the bill after the July 4th recess and pass this key piece of legislation."
