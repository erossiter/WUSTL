SEN. REID HOSTS MEET ON NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND TOWN HALL WITH NEVADA PARENTS, EDUCATORS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada hosted an education town hall meeting with parents, teachers, and administrators across the state to discuss ways to improve the No Child Left Behind Act and how to make it work for Nevada's schools. 
   "No Child Left Behind was created with good intentions, but it needs a great deal of improvement," said Reid. "The parents and teachers who participated in this event provided tremendous input on ways we can improve the law. I will work to incorporate their views as Congress prepares to reauthorize the Act so we can improve on it and provide a better education for Nevada's children."
   The town hall was also video conferenced into Carson City and Elko, giving residents statewide an opportunity to participate.
   The No Child Left Behind Act is scheduled for reauthorization this year. Reid will continue working to ensure the Act:
   * Makes sure that schools compare student progress over time, not one group of students to the next as the act currently does; 
   * Features more effective ways to assess limited English proficient and special needs students; 
   * Ensures that other important subjects, such as history, the arts, and music, aren't sidelined just because they aren't tested, and; 
   * Shows different degrees of improvement in student achievement and avoid unfairly labeling schools. 
   Reid's chief priority is to fully fund No Child Left Behind, which has been under-funded by nearly $55 billion since it was first enacted. Under the leadership of Senator Reid, the new Congress has already taken steps this year to reverse some of the funding shortfalls for the Act. The 2008 Budget will provide $62.3 billion, which will include significant increases to programs under No Child Left Behind, a $6.1 billion increase over the President's budget.
