SECURING NEVADA'S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid testified this week before the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power to address the nation's aging water infrastructure and its effect on Nevada. In January, the Truckee Canal, one of the oldest Reclamation water facilities in the country, failed resulting in a devastating flood that damaged 590 homes in Fernley. 
   Reid cited the Fernley flood as an example of the many aging water infrastructure projects that would benefit from the passage of the Aging Water Infrastructure and Maintenance Act - legislation introduced by Reid and 3 other western Senators earlier this month to provide the Bureau of Reclamation with the resources it needs to inspect and maintain older water facilities. All Americans, and the residents of Fernley, should be able to live without fear that their community could be flooded at any time. They shouldn't have to worry that the government is letting aging water infrastructure crumble to save money in the short term," said Reid. He added, "We all know that prevention is better than cure. That is why I introduced legislation last week to provide the Bureau of Reclamation with resources and the direction to inspect and maintain aging water facilities." Reid's bill would provide $11 million over the next five years, including $5 million in FY 2009, for required inspections of aging federal water infrastructure like the Truckee Canal. It also directs the Department of the Interior to perform maintenance and urgent repairs to ensure the safety of homes and businesses in nearby communities.
