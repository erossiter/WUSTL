U.S. FOREST SERVICE CHIEF BRIEFS SENS. REID, ENSIGN ON WILDFIRES
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada met with Gail Kimbell, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service, to discuss current fires burning in Nevada and recovery efforts following the Angora fire near Lake Tahoe. 
   "Wildfires like the ones burning in Nevada can have a devastating effect on communities, families and the economy," said Reid. "We have to do everything possible to limit the damage wildfires create by making sure firefighters have the resources they need to prevent fires from spreading so quickly."
   "Early in the fire season, wildfires have had a devastating effect on residents and businesses in Nevada," said Ensign. "These recent fires have shown how vulnerable Nevada is to catastrophic wildfires, and it is imperative that we do all that we can to give local residents and communities the resources necessary to fight this dangerous threat. As we work to restore the burned areas, we must thoroughly examine current regulations and policies to determine the best prevention practices for the future."
   "We are in the midst of another severe fire season, with thousands of trained and equipped firefighters on scene," said Kimbell. "Reducing fire danger across landscapes requires the cooperation of our partners and the public. Our Forest Health projects around Lake Tahoe helped to save over 500 homes. Fire behaves differently where fuels have been removed and we know we are on the right track to make communities fire-safe."
   The group also discussed the forecast for fires across the West and strategies for dealing with increasing fire threats across Nevada.
