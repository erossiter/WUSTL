SEN. REID: KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL, MR. PRESIDENT
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on President Bush's comments today on national security. 
   "Instead of ranting and raving every day on the campaign trail, President Bush should spend more time on the trail of Osama bin Laden. The American people are tired of the President's empty tough talk. They want leaders who are tough and smart. The President and his Republican Congress have no credibility left, and it's time for a new direction."
