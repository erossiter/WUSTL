SEN. REID, BUSINESS, LABOR, HISPANIC LEADERS HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  At the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce building today, Sen. Harry Reid was joined by leaders from across the community to highlight the need for comprehensive immigration reform. Congress is slated to take up the issue as early as next month. Sen. Reid was joined by representatives from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, MGM Mirage, the Nevada Restaurant Association, labor, Hispanic and religious leaders to announce principles all agree should be part of any final legislation.  
   "There is a crisis at our borders, and we must do something about it," Senator Reid said. "I strongly believe in tough and effective enforcement of our immigration laws. But, we also need to be clear that legal immigration is crucial to our economic vitality because it fills gaps in workforce shortages which can impede business growth. I am joined today by representatives of many interests and industries--gaming, business, labor, religious and advocacy groups--and we all agree on fundamental principles when it comes to immigration reform." 
   Reid was joined at the press conference by Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce Vice President of Public Affairs Christina Dugan, Nevada Restaurant Association President Paul Hartgen, Culinary Workers Union Local 226, Secretary D. Taylor & President Geoconda, and U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Diocese of Las Vegas, Bishop Joseph A. Pepe. 
   According to Christina Dugan of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, "Southern Nevada's job growth is almost four times higher than the national average. As a result, Las Vegas businesses are continuously challenged to find qualified employees. Immigration reform is a positive step towards connecting people who need jobs with growing companies in order to retain Nevada's competitive edge and dynamic economy." 
   Reid added, "We need to create more realistic laws that take into account the needs of the American economy and that are structured to better protect American workers. We also must look at this with a national security perspective. We have to know who is living in our country and who is crossing our borders. We need to be able to conduct background checks on these people and to have records of who is here." 
   Principles for reform follow:
   REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS MAKES SENSE:
   * Immigration reform is crucial to our national security. We need to know who is living in our country and who is crossing our borders. Reform will allow us to focus our resources on catching criminals, terrorists, and those who truly wish to do us harm. 
   * Immigration reform will allow us to keep families together. Many immigrant families include some who have U.S. citizenship or residency and some here illegally. U.S. citizens and residents who want to bring their family members here legally must wait years due to long processing backlogs and strict limits on family immigration. 
   * Immigration reform will help us protect American wages and working conditions. When there are people working illegally in our economy and powerless to complain about exploitation, it undercuts the wages and working conditions of everybody else. 
   * Immigration reform will contribute to our economic growth. Immigrants create jobs. Immigrants help expand our economy and provide labor and expertise for new businesses that also employ Americans. Immigrant consumers spend money on American products. 
   * Immigration reform will help us fight criminal activity. Our current system encourages the operation of fraudulent document syndicates, smugglers, and traffickers. Immigrants often avoid the police and are reluctant to report crimes, for fear that they or an undocumented family member will be deported. 
   PRINCIPLES FOR REFORM: 
   * We need a worker program that would require undocumented immigrants living in this country to come forward and register and that would provide for additional immigrants to enter on work visas as needed by our economy. 
   * Any worker program must be structured to prevent all workers from exploitation and abuse, so that we protect the jobs, wages, and legal rights of American workers. We must ensure that immigrant workers only fill jobs for which no American workers are available or that no American workers are willing to accept. 
   * We must get tough and effectively enforce our laws against those who work illegally and against employers who hire workers who are not registered. 
   * Immigrants who work hard, pay taxes, learn English, and play by the rules should be allowed to participate in a multi-year process to earn legal residency. 
   * Nobody should be allowed to cut to the front of the line, but immigrants living in this country should be allowed to earn their legal status if they pay fines and penalties, work steadily for several years, and pass criminal background checks. 
   * We need to clear out the long processing backlogs and eliminate the years-long waiting periods for immigrants to reunite with their close family members in the United States. 
   * We must support the principles behind the DREAM Act and allow students who came to the United States as children access to educational opportunities and the right to permanent residence in their adopted homeland.
