SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS ENDORSE PRESIDENT'S IRAQ POLICIES
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on a landmark vote in the United States Senate on whether to change the course of the war in Iraq.  
   "Today's vote demonstrated the difference between Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate. Democrats believe that our troops should not be policing a civil war, that Iraq must take responsibility for its own future, and that our troops should begin to come home. Senate Republicans support President Bush's plan to commit more men and women to policing an open-ended civil war. For months, Democrats have pushed for a vote on the most important issue facing this country. Today was one step. We will not stop until President Bush and Senate Republicans listen to the American people and change course in Iraq."
