  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the nomination of Michael Chertoff, a federal appeals court judge from New Jersey, to replace Tom Ridge as homeland security secretary:  
   "I look forward to the confirmation process of Judge Michael Chertoff. As we learned during the nomination of Bernard Kerik, a thorough confirmation process is a vital part of our democracy.
