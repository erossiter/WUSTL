   In their meeting, both Henderson City Mayor James B. Gibson and Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman shared with Reid their firsthand knowledge of the need for support from the federal government to address critical issues including growth and funding for first responders. 
   "I'm pleased I was able to meet with Mayors Gibson and Goodman," said Reid. "We discussed many ways we can to work together to improve Southern Nevada. I will continue working at the federal level to help Nevada's local governments create more affordable housing, improve our transportation systems, and increase Nevada's homeland security."
