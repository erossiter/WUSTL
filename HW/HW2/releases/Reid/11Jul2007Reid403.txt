SEN. REID: NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEWS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFER
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement following the House's passage of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, which requires our intelligence community to thoroughly analyze foreign companies' and governments' investments in America to ensure they are in our nation's interest: 
   "The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 will ensure that as we encourage investment in America, those ventures do not compromise our national security. Democrats have delivered on our promise to make America more secure by passing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, bringing accountability to the war in Iraq and addressing troop readiness shortfalls. Now that both Houses of Congress have passed this landmark legislation, we call on the President to strengthen the national security reviews of foreign investments in our country."
