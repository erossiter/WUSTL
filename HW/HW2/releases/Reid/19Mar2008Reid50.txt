SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IRAQ WAR
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement today marking the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War: 
   "As we enter the sixth year of the war in Iraq, we reflect on the sacrifices that have been made by America's brave troops overseas and the effects this war has had on Nevada and our country as a whole. The Iraq War has made America less secure and has been a major influence on our weakening economy. We owe it to all Americans to change course in Iraq and bring a responsible end to this war. Each day that we continue our involvement in this intractable civil war is another missed opportunity to focus on our priorities here at home. I will continue working with my colleagues to end this war and bring our troops home safely. Until that day comes, I will continue to fight for them as they have so bravely fought for us."
