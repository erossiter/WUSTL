SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, NOT CRIMINALIZATION
  With Chairman James Sensenbrenner releasing a new report on immigration and standing by his attempt to turn 12 million immigrants into criminals, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement.  
   "We've tried an enforcement-only immigration policy for years, but the result is a porous border and millions of undocumented workers. And while the Republican National Committee ran ads to blame Democrats for turning millions of immigrants into criminals, House Republicans want to take credit for that discredited approach. If President Bush is as serious about comprehensive immigration reform as he says, he needs to rein in his party and ensure that a bipartisan compromise doesn't get hijacked by the radical right."
