SEN. REID: BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS IN DISARRAY ON IRAQ
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on comments today on the war in Iraq by President Bush.  
   "The Bush Administration's Iraq policy, like Iraq itself, is in complete disarray. One day, the Administration calls for a timetable, the next day Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki objects to it. One day, our senior military leaders indicate more troops may be needed, the next day the President discounts that option. One day, it's stay the course, the next day it's change the course. It is increasingly clear that the President does not know what to do to stop the escalating violence in Iraq and that his so-called 'National Strategy for Victory in Iraq' has failed. 
   "Not surprisingly, the American people have had enough of this Administration's costly mistakes and politically motivated misstatements. They know it's long past time for the President to admit his plan is not working and to truly change course."
