SEN. REID: SENATE IS ON RECORD AGAINST ESCALATION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement on today's vote in the United States Senate in which a bipartisan majority voted against President Bush's flawed plan to escalate the war. 
  "Today, a bipartisan majority of the United States Senate voted against the President's flawed plan to escalate the war. The Senate joined the House of Representatives, put itself on the record, and told the President that America needs a new direction in Iraq. As for the Republicans who chose once again to block further debate and protect President Bush, the American people now know they support the escalation. 
   "Today's vote against the escalation is not the end of this Iraq debate in the Senate. This war is too important to permit Senate Republicans to brush it aside. The Bush Administration's failures have put our troops and America in a deep hole, and it is time for this country and this Congress to climb out. The Republican Leadership can run from this debate, but they can't hide. The Senate will keep fighting to force President Bush to change course."
