SEN. REID ANNOUNCES NEW SENATE DEMOCRATIC COMMUNICATIONS CENTER STAFF DIRECTOR
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today announced that Andrew Fois has joined the Senate Democratic Communications Center as Staff Director. Fois brings his years of political management experience to the successful media operation, taking responsibility for all communications activities, long term planning, policy and outreach coordination. 
   Fois brings nearly 20 years experience in policy, politics, and press. A frequent TV and radio political analyst, Fois has been Assistant Attorney General in the Clinton White House, Chief Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Most recently he served as a Senior Fellow at Globalsecurity.org, a national security think tank. 
   "I opened the Senate Democratic Communications Center to ensure that all Americans - from my hometown of Searchlight to our nation's biggest cities - learn how America can do better than the current policies and priorities of Republicans in Washington. The office has had an extremely successful first year, and I'm confident that Andy's incredible talent and experience will only improve our ability to get the truth out to the American people," said Reid. 
   Senator Reid opened the Senate Democratic Communications Center at the start of the 109th Congress to provide a visible and vocal platform for Democrats to communicate with the American people. Fois takes charge of a media operation that has proven critical to unifying Senate Democrats under Reid's leadership. 
   Current Staff Director Jim Manley moves into to a more public role, serving as Chief Spokesman and Senior Communications Advisor to Senator Reid and the rest of the caucus.
