SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF GEN. PETRAEUS TO CENTCOM COMMANDER
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to news that Gen. David Petraeus will be nominated as head of U.S. Central Command and Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno will be nominated to be top commander on the ground in Iraq: 
   "The next CENTCOM commander and field commander in Iraq will have to help the next President with a number of critically important challenges: making America more secure, restoring America's power and influence in the world, fixing our costly strategy in Iraq, and articulating a more effective strategy for winning in Afghanistan and defeating Al Qaeda in Pakistan.
   "Our ground forces' readiness and the battles in Afghanistan and against al Qaeda in Pakistan have suffered as a result of the current costly Iraq strategy. These challenges will require fresh, independent and creative thinking and, if directed to by a new President, a commitment to implementing major changes in strategy.
   "The Senate will carefully examine these nominations and I will be looking for credible assurances of a strong commitment to implementing a more effective national security strategy."
