SEN. REID REQUESTS MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO MINING FEES
  In order to help curb the damaging effects a 25 percent increase in mining claim and maintenance fees would have on the mining industry, Nevada Sen.  
 Harry Reid is asking the Bureau of Land Management to phase the increase in over the next five years. The BLM notified the public of the proposed change in a June 30 press release. 
   "Mining is the backbone of Nevada's rural economy, and a 25 percent increase all at once would be a large blow to the industry," said Reid. "I am suggesting a commonsense solution to this problem that will cushion the blow and allow miners to budget over a reasonable amount of time." 
   According to statute, BLM is supposed to adjust fees every five years according to the Consumer Price Index; however, fees have not been adjusted since 1993. 
   Susie Mason, Secretary of the Nevada Landmen's Association and a 31-year mining industry employee, said, "I am very grateful that Senator Reid has taken steps to address the impact of the proposed fee increase on unpatented mining claims. While the increase is provided for in statute, the imposition of a 25% increase in fees during the middle of most companies' budget year is staggering. Senator Reid's suggestion of a phased approach is indeed fair and balanced. Mineral exploration is only beginning to recover from the effects of low gold prices for almost a decade. Phasing in the increase would certainly lessen the blow." 
   The mining industry is not only directly responsible for about 250,000 jobs throughout the United States, 12,000 of which are located in Nevada, but also indirectly responsible for approximately three million more jobs in supporting industries.
