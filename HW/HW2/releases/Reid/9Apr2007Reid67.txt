SEN. REID: AMERICANS STILL SEEK STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS FOUR YEARS AFTER BAGHDAD FELL
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today on the fourth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad:  
   "Four years ago, our men and women fought bravely to capture the city of Baghdad and bring an end to the reign of a dictator. Today, they desperately need a post-war strategy that recognizes the political situation on the ground and removes them from policing a civil war. Democrats believe we must transition the mission in Iraq in order to increase America's security and more effectively fight terrorism. As we reflect on this Administration's failed policies of the past four years, we hope the President will join us in moving forward to change course in Iraq, empower Iraqis to govern their own land, and give our troops the resources they need and a strategy worthy of their sacrifices."
