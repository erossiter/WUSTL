SENS. REID, ENSIGN, REP. HELLER ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR WIND ENERGY RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, and Congressman Dean Heller of Nevada announced the approval of a Rural Business Enterprise Grant for the South Fork Indian Reservation near Elko today. The $50,000 grant will be used to provide a wind energy resource assessment, feasibility study and business plan for the establishment of a renewable energy business. 
   "These grant funds are vital for the creation of renewable energy businesses in rural Nevada," said Reid. "Projects like this will help strengthen Nevada's standing as the leader in renewable energy development, while making the state more energy independent and protecting the environment."
   "Our state is in a position to lead the nation in renewable energy," said Ensign. "This grant is an important step toward increasing in-state energy production in Nevada."
   "Nevada is rich in renewable energy potential. Helping businesses in Nevada develop wind and other forms of renewable energy will greatly benefit our state and the country. I am pleased these funds have been made available to the South Fork Indian Reservation," said Heller.
