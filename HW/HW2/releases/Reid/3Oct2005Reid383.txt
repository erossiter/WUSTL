SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO U.S. SUPREME COURT
  "I like Harriet Miers. As White House Counsel, she has worked with me in a courteous and professional manner.  
 I am also impressed with the fact that she was a trailblazer for women as managing partner of a major Dallas law firm and as the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association. 
   "In my view, the Supreme Court would benefit from the addition of a justice who has real experience as a practicing lawyer. The current justices have all been chosen from the lower federal courts. A nominee with relevant non-judicial experience would bring a different and useful perspective to the Court. 
   "I look forward to the Judiciary Committee process which will help the American people learn more about Harriet Miers, and help the Senate determine whether she deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court."
