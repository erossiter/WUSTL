SEN. REID: TOGETHER WE CAN DO BETTER FOR AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the failure of Congressional Republicans to advance their immoral budget: 
   "It's refreshing to see a few Republicans in the House and the Senate have the courage to put the priorities of the American people ahead of the agenda of special interests and right-wing ideologues. I hope this is a sign of things to come, and that Republicans have finally learned that we're here to address the needs of the American people. From energy prices to avian flu and Iraq, we have a lot of work to do, and together we can do better."
