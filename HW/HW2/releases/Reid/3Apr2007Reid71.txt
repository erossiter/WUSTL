SEN. REID: AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD BUSH STRATEGY ANY LONGER
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, released the following statement today after comments made by President Bush at the White House:  
   The President today asked the American people to trust him as he continues to follow the same failed strategy that has drawn our troops further into an intractable civil war. The President's policies have failed and his escalation endangers our troops and hurts our national security. Neither our troops nor the American people can afford this strategy any longer. 
   Democrats will send President Bush a bill that gives our troops the resources they need and a strategy in Iraq worthy of their sacrifices. If the President vetoes this bill he will have delayed funding for troops and kept in place his strategy for failure.
