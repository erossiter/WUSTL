SEN. REID SECURES FUNDS FOR CLEANER BUSES
  Working to protect our children and environment, Nevada Sen.  
 Harry Reid secured $500,000 to replace and repair current school buses to reduce emissions. 
   Reid had already introduced legislation earlier this year that would help rural counties purchase new buses, after Nevada school superintendents told him of their transportation needs. This new funding is a first step toward making school buses safer and cleaner for children. 
   "Reducing emissions of our school buses will protect the health and safety of our children and our environment," said Reid. "I hope this first step will pave the way to replacing and repairing the outdated, unsafe buses that our kids are still riding in." 
   The $500,000 will go to the State of Nevada which will work with the school districts to determine the level of immediate need for school buses. 
   Reid requested the funding in the FY 2005 Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, which passed out of committee today.
