SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR WASHOE COUNTY BUS PROJECT
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada secured a grant for the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project, which will improve the flow of traffic in Reno. 
   "There is a great need to develop the public transportation system in a city that serves over 3,000 riders per day," said Reid. "I am pleased that the Bus Rapid Transit project will continue to encourage the residents of Reno to utilize the public transportation resources that the city has to offer."
   "The rapid growth of Washoe County has created a need for increased public transportation," said Ensign. "These funds will add essential infrastructure improvements, reduce traffic congestion, make public transportation more accessible and enhance the quality of life in the Reno area."
   "RTC is very appreciative of the work of Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign in securing this grant that will help us improve the quality of transit service to thousands of riders each day in the South Virginia Corridor," said Greg Krause, Executive Director of the Regional Transportation Commission.
   The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County will receive $291,779 from the Federal Transit Administration to improve Reno's BRT project. The BRT system will include low-floor level boarding vehicles, special branding service, and signal-priority preemption.
