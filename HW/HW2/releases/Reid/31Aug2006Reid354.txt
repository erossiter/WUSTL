SEN. REID: BUSH REPUBLICAN POLICIES HAVE MADE AMERICA LESS SAFE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's speech to the American Legion today. 
   "No matter how many speeches the President gives, the truth is that his failed policies have taken the country in a dangerous direction. The American people know that five years after September 11th, we are not as safe as we should and could be. Iraq is in crisis, our military is stretched thin, and terrorist groups and extremist regimes have been strengthened and emboldened across the Middle East and the world. It is time for a new direction. Democrats will lead the American people with tough and smart policies that will make us safer by beginning the redeployment of troops from Iraq, refocusing our efforts on the war on terror, and protecting Americans from terrorism here at home."
