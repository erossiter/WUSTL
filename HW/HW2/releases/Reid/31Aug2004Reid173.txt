SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE $222,000 FOR ELKO AIRPORT
  Nevada Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign announced today that Elko has won a $222,000 federal grant to help establish new flights between Elko and Las Vegas.  
 Reid and Ensign worked to help Elko win the highly competitive grant. Scenic Airlines will open the new route between Elko and Las Vegas this fall. 
   "This is great news for the people of Elko," said Reid. "Elko is a great town, but it's far from Nevada's big cities and tourist centers. These new flights will make it much easier to get to Elko, and that will attract business and help create jobs. It will also make it much more pleasant for Elko residents to take vacations and visit family." 
   "This grant is wonderful news for travelers between Elko and Las Vegas," said Ensign. "By increasing travel options and encouraging economic growth, we are working to improve access and opportunities for rural Nevadans." 
   The funding is from the Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASD), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. SCASD helps small communities address air service problems caused by insufficient service and high airfares. More than one hundred communities around the country applied for grants this year; only 46 grants were awarded. 
   "This is a very important grant," said Cris Jensen, director of the Elko Airport. "The funding will support our efforts to expand air service to our community. All of us at Elko Airport and Scenic Airlines are very excited about launching the new route this fall, and I expect it will be a very successful partnership. I'd like to thank Senators Reid and Ensign for all their help in getting this grant."
