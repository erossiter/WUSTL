SENATE PASSES SEN. REID'S LEGISLATION TO CREATE NEW PRESIDENTIAL $1 COIN
  The U.S. Senate has approved a plan to create a new series of coins carrying the images of all the U.S. Presidents and First Ladies. The Senate voted unanimously to pass the measure, which was originally introduced by Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and co-sponsored by Sen. John Ensign (R-NV).  
   The bill authorizes the creation of dollar coins imprinted with the pictures of U.S. Presidents, and gold bullion collectors' coins with images of the First Ladies. The program is modeled after the popular state quarters now being produced. 
   "These new coins will be good for the American economy and good for our Nevada economy," said Reid. "The state quarter program has raised about $4 billion for our national treasury, and I expect the new Presidential coins will be just as popular and just as profitable. Plus, a lot of the ore used for the gold bullion coins will be mined in Nevada, and that means more jobs for our state." 
   The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 is also designed to place the dollar coin in greater circulation in the U.S. economy. That would save taxpayer money by reducing the cost of keeping cash in circulation. Dollar bills have a lifespan of about 18 months, while coins can last for 30 years. 
   "The Presidential Coin Act is historic and patriotic legislation," said Ensign. "It will make a significant contribution to the economy while creating great opportunities for coin collectors and history buffs. Americans will no doubt benefit from the infusion of these dollar coins into the marketplace. 
   The House of Representatives now needs to pass this version of the bill. More details about the legislation are listed below.
