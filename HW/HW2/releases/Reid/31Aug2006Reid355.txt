SEN. REID DEDICATES VETERANS MEMORIAL SIGNS
  Today Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada joined community leaders in dedicating a series of Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) commemorative signs honoring veterans.  
   "I am pleased to dedicate these signs in honor of our veterans," said Reid. "Nevada has a rich military history and is home to the third largest veteran population in the nation. About 250,000 veterans live in Nevada, and without their service, America would not be what it is today. The people of Nevada and those who drive on U.S. 95 will now be reminded of the dedicated service by these men and women who were willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of our nation's freedom." 
   The signs, honoring veterans who served in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War, were unveiled between mile markers 26 and 27 on US-95 North of Searchlight. Each war is represented by quarter miles on the highway.
