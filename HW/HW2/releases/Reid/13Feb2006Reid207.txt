SEN. REID ADDRESSES 2006 CATHOLIC SOCIAL MINISTRY GATHERING
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today addressed 500 local, state and national Catholic Leaders at the 2006 Catholic Social Ministry Gathering, an event sponsored by the Department of Social Development and World Peace of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Reid spoke of the need to apply faith and morality to Washington's priorities, and for Congress to do more to help the needy than to enrich itself. 
   Through their faith in social and economic justice, organizations like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops represent much of the best of America. Yet their commitment to helping those in need is being forgotten in much of the work of the government. While Americans are calling on their government to provide for the needs of the poor, the sick, and the elderly, some are content to put the interests of the wealthy first.
   "Our government should represent our best values, not our worst vices," said Senator Reid. "Yet while Americans believe in justice and equality, not gluttony and greed, some have chosen the wrong priorities. Americans can do better, and its leaders can help the common good, not just the powerful few." 
   America's leaders must work together for the common good, putting the focus on providing for those who need help the most: the poor, the elderly, and children. While some would cut food aid, health care, housing assistance, and education to pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy and giveaways to corporate special interests, the common morality of the American people calls for better priorities. 
   "If we are the wealthiest nation on earth, we can be the healthiest too," continued Reid. "We can eliminate poverty, we can take care of the vulnerable among us, and we keep our country safe. It just requires each of us to answer our call, and commit to working towards the common good."
