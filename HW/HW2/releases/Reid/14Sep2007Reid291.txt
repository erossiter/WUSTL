SEN. REID: DECLINE OF COAL POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION NATIONALLY SHOULD BE A MESSAGE TO NEVADA
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released a report highlighting several states where planned coal power plants have been cancelled. Among those states are Colorado, Florida, Kansas, North Carolina, Texas and Washington. Reid is reiterating his commitment to make Nevada a leader in renewable energy while opposing three proposed coal power plants. 
   "All these states are saying no to coal power plants that use inefficient and polluting technology. Instead, they're investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency because that makes so much more sense in the long run for the environment, consumers and their economies," said Reid. "If they're saying no, Nevada can too. I want to help Nevada become the national leader in renewable energy and energy independence. We have vast wind, solar and geothermal resources and we're wasting energy every day we're not tapping into those free, clean, and reliable power sources. 
   "Investing in Nevada's renewable energy potential is the right thing to do to protect our air, fight global warming, and strengthen Nevada's economy," added Reid. "Importing millions of tons of coal to be burned in Nevada has too many hidden costs like the health impacts, reduced visibility, and climate change. As proposed, these coal plants are old news, the way of the increasingly distant past. Nevada is poised to lead the way in developing renewable energy and I will do everything I can to encourage the development of a stronger clean renewable industry that holds so much promise for our state."
