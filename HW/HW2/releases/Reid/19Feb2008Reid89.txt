SEN. REID: CASTRO'S RESIGNATION WILL ONLY MEAN REAL CHANGE FOR CUBA IF IT LEADS TO DEMOCRACY
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to Cuban Dictator Fidel Castro's resignation:
  "Today's news from Cuba should not focus on one man who is merely formalizing the transfer of power he initiated a year and a half ago. It should focus on the more than 11 million Cubans who still seek the freedom they deserve. After nearly 50 years of an oppressive regime, it is long past time for democracy to displace dictatorship, and we must continue to support those who long for liberty in Cuba."
