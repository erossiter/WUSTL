SEN. REID'S BILL TO BOOST PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PASSES SENATE
  The U.S. Senate today passed a bill by Sen. Harry Reid that would create thousands of jobs in Nevada while giving consumers relief from high energy bills and gas prices. 
   For years, Sen. Reid has taken the lead in Congress to pass tax incentives that will spur development of renewable energy resources such as geothermal and solar power.
   "Nevada has been blessed with abundant energy resources that we need to develop," Senator Reid said. ACompanies are just waiting for these tax incentives so they can come to Nevada and start production. We will create hundreds and hundreds of jobs in the state and really strengthen our economy."
   Under Reid's legislation, companies that produce energy using "renewables," such as geothermal, solar and wind, would get tax refunds to help them compete with oil and coal companies which already receive substantial subsidies from the federal government.
   By producing energy from sources we can find right in the United States, and especially in Nevada, the country can reduce its dependence on fossil fuels including oil. This will provide energy stability and lower energy bills.
   "Every driver in Nevada knows that our nation needs a new energy strategy" Reid said. "Since the beginning of this year, gasoline prices have soared to record levels. We still remember the electric power crisis of a few years ago, which cost Nevada consumers billions. And we all understand that America's dependence on oil from the volatile Middle East is not good for our national security."
   The legislation offers a production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt hour to renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar, wind, and biomass energy. Companies would have until January 2007 to qualify, or begin production, and would then receive the tax credit for ten years.
