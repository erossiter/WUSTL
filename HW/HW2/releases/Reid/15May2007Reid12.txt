SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON LAS VEGAS' RECORD GAS PRICES
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement regarding the news that Las Vegas' gas prices have hit an all-time high.  
   "The news that Las Vegas' gas prices have hit a record is yet another reminder that we need to reduce our reliance on oil, increase the supply of clean renewable fuels, and get more efficient vehicles into the market. The high cost of gas can have a major impact on families who are already struggling to make ends meet. Gas prices become especially problematic as we move towards the Memorial Day Weekend which marks the beginning of the summer travel season. "As the Majority Leader in the Senate, I have made energy reform a top priority in Congress. Soon, we will debate a bill that will reduce Nevada's and America's reliance on oil and punish gas price gouging. It is also extremely important that any legislation increase our investments in clean alternative energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power and develop ways to use that power to drive our cars and our economy. In addition to saving consumers' money and making America more secure by reducing our reliance on oil from unstable regions, investing in renewable energy could create about 3,300 Nevada jobs."
