SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON KARL ROVE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement:
   "I agree with the President when he said he expects the people who work for him to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. The White House promised if anyone was involved in the Valerie Plame affair, they would no longer be in this administration. I trust they will follow through on this pledge. If these allegations are true this rises above politics and is about our national security."
