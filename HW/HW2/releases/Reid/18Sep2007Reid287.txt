SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS DENY D.C. CITIZENS BASIC CIVIL RIGHT OF VOICE IN CONGRESS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the Senate Republicans blocked a debate on the D.C. Voting Rights Act: 
   "By blocking a debate in the Senate on D.C. voting rights, Republicans have continued to deny 600,000 U.S. citizens the right to voting representation in Congress. It is an offense to democracy that the citizens of the District of Columbia - who pay federal taxes, sit on federal juries and serve bravely in our Armed Forces - remain deprived of a basic civil right upon which our country was conceived: equal representation. If we can send D.C. citizens to fight for democracy in Baghdad and ensure Iraqis have the opportunity to vote, the least we can do is give the same opportunity to our fellow Americans."
