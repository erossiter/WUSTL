SEN. REID: IT IS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on Republican obstruction of progress on comprehensive immigration reform.  
   "House Republicans looking for someone to blame for the delay on immigration reform should look in the mirror. It is House Republicans who are blocking progress to the conference committee, House Republicans who want to take the unprecedented step of holding hearings on the Senate bill. Democrats are ready to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform right now. We are only waiting for Republicans to join us. If President Bush is as committed to comprehensive immigration reform as he claims, he will pick up the telephone and tell his Republicans in Congress to stop obstructing this important bill."
