SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT TO COMMEMORATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement marking the beginning of Black History Month. 
  "Today, as Nevada and the rest of the nation celebrate the first day of Black History Month, we pause to honor the contributions and successes of African Americans. These moments and individuals demand and deserve their rightful place in our nation's history.
  "While we recognize great national figures that fought against segregation and demanded that everyone be treated with equality and respect, let us also recognize great Nevadans who have made countless contributions toward achieving equality in the Silver State.
  "Nevada leaders like Dr. James McMillan, former President of the Las Vegas NAACP, who was principal in the effort to integrate casinos in Las Vegas and State Senator Bernice Mathews, a former nurse and nursing instructor at the University of Nevada Reno. And others like the Honorable Johnnie B. Rawlinson and the Honorable Karen Bennett-Haron who were the first African-American female judges in Nevada. The efforts of these Nevadans have moved us closer to equality in the Silver State and are something we should all be proud of.
  "As we reflect upon the legacy and accomplishments of countless African Americans, we must continue working together to bring about greater equality and fairness in the future."
