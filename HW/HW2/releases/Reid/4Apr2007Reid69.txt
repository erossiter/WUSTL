SEN. REID ATTENDS GRAND OPENING OF UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS'S ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada participated today in the grand opening of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Public Health's Environmental and Occupational Health Laboratory.  
   "This lab will play a vital role in advancing research and education on health issues important to Nevada and ensuring that every member of our community receives quality health care," said Reid. "Universities stand at the forefront of confronting illnesses and fostering our knowledge of public health. I look forward to seeing the results of the work that will be done at this new facility." 
   The Environmental and Occupational Health Laboratory will study environmental contaminants and their effect on the health of people and wildlife in Southern Nevada. The lab will study lead poisoning in children and potential sources of lead poisoning in the home. It will also study mercury levels in fish coming from Lake Mead. 
   The School of Public Health, created in 2004, was able to fund the construction of the new lab with help from a $500,000 federal appropriation secured by Senator Reid. 
   The opening ceremony took place during National Public Health Week. Reid, along with UNLV President David Ashley, and guests toured the facility and engaged in an interactive demonstration of the lab's equipment.
