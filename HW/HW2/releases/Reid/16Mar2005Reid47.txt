SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON FALSIFICATION OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN DOCUMENTATION
  The Department of Energy admitted today that employees falsified documentation required to ensure the accuracy and the credibility of the work at Yucca Mountain.  
   Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement. 
   "This proves once again that DOE must cheat and lie in order to make Yucca Mountain look safe. We aren't just talking about false documentation on paper, this is about the health and safety of Nevadans and the American people. It is abundantly clear that there is no such thing as "sound science" at Yucca Mountain, and I'm disappointed President Bush rushed so quickly to push the project through and continues to make it a priority. I do not believe Yucca Mountain will ever open, and Nevada and our nation will be safer for our successful efforts to stop the project. 
   "It should be obvious to everyone now that Yucca Mountain isn't going anywhere. Sen. Ensign and I are working on legislation that would allow waste to be stored on-site at nuclear facilities. The tide is turning on Yucca Mountain, and it's time we look at this viable alternative and realistic approach to long term waste storage."
