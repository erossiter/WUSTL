SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Statement On Release Of The 9/11 Commission Report
   "I think the commission should be commended for its work.  
 I am very impressed with the way the commissioners worked in a bipartisan manner, with the help of dozens of experts in a variety of fields. They created a thorough and serious document that deserves our full attention. 
   This report doesn't cast blame on any one person or agency. Instead, it shows that we need to make changes in the way our government gathers intelligence, and the way we disseminate information. We need teamwork. We need government agencies to work together better. We have to use this report as a blueprint for our safety in the future. I'll do everything I can to implement the suggestions made in the report."
