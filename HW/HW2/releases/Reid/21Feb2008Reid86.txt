SEN. REID LEADS RENEWABLE ENERGY FORUM IN RENO
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid led a forum of energy and business leaders today to discuss how businesses' bottom-line and the environment can benefit by incorporating renewable energy into their products, services and plans for future growth.  
  "It is time for Nevada to lead a renewable revolution," Reid said. "Investing in Nevada's renewable energy resources will decrease our dependence on fossil fuels while preserving our outdoor areas. It will also help strengthen our state's economy by creating thousands of good paying jobs. Every day we don't tap into the sunlight, wind and heat of the earth, is a day that we are losing money. I hope today's event showed Northern Nevada business leaders how they can profit and at the same time improve our economic, environmental and national security."
  During the forum, Reid discussed the economic development that comes along with investing in Nevada's vast solar, wind and geothermal energy resources.
  This forum is part of Reid's legislative priorities to make Nevada the world leader in renewable energy.
