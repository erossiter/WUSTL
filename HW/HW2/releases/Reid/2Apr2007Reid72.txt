SEN. REID: ADMINISTRATION MUST FOLLOW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after the Supreme Court's ruling today against the Bush Administration's position on global warming regulation.  
   "Today, the Supreme Court ruled twice against the Bush Administration's efforts to help special interests avoid environmental regulation. For six long years, the Administration has deliberately misapplied the law and undermined science to protect polluters instead of the American public. 
   "Now, the President needs to start implementing the Clean Air Act and all our environment laws the way they are written, not the way their friends want to read them. That will make the air we breathe cleaner and really start dealing with global warming. The message to the President and Vice President Cheney in the Supreme Court's decisions couldn't be clearer - stop obstructing environmental progress and start finding solutions."
