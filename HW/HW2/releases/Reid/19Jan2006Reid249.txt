SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON HHS SECRETARY LEAVITT'S VISIT TO NEVADA
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) released the following statement today about the difficulties Nevada's seniors are facing under the new Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage program:  
   "I am disappointed that Secretary Leavitt could not make time to meet with the many seniors in Nevada who have had difficulty getting prescription drugs. Instead of seeing a benefit, many seniors are worse off, facing additional costs and confusing choices. Some have completely fallen through the cracks and are getting no coverage.
   "I have long supported adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, but I could not support the final Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 because it was riddled with special interest giveaways while failing to provide seniors and people with disabilities with the drug coverage they need. 
   "For more than a year, I have worked to correct the problems created by this bill. Just last week I asked Secretary Leavitt to address the problems that Nevadans have faced, and I hope that he will work with me to end the confusion, get seniors the drugs they need and fix this poorly implemented program."
