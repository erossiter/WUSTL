SEN. REID: GEN. JONES REPORT REITERATES NEED FOR CHANGE OF COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to Gen. James Jones's report: 
   "Gen. Jones's report today, like all other objective assessments before it, unfortunately tells us more of the same: that the President's strategy brings us no closer to the necessary political reconciliation and it is past time to change course in Iraq. It is discouraging that the President stubbornly claims his failed policy is working even as this latest report describe many Iraqi security forces as focused more on fostering civil war than on suppressing it.
   "Democrats will continue to push for a new strategy because only by changing course can we best protect our troops and make America secure."
