SEN. REID: SENATE IS WORKING TO FIX FAILED BUSH POLICIES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's press conference today: 
   "Five years after September 11, not a single terrorist has been brought to justice under the President's flawed policy. There is a bipartisan process underway in the United States Senate to fix the failed Bush Administration system that was struck down by the Supreme Court. Instead of picking fights with Colin Powell, John McCain, and other military experts, President Bush should change course, do what the American people expect, and finally give them the real security they deserve."
