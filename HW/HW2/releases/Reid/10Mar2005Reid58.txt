SEN. REID REMINDS BUSH IT IS BENEFIT CUTS, DEBT THAT ARE SCARY
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "The President fails to understand that the truly scary proposition for the American people is benefit cuts up to nearly 50 percent and $5 trillion in new debt. This is why Americans of all ages are rejecting the Republican plan. It is time for the president to put aside his flawed Social Security privatization proposal so we can engage in a bipartisan conversation about measures that will truly strengthen Social Security for the long haul. Democrats are eager to address Social Security's long term fiscal challenges and increase our savings. Privatization fails to meet that standard."  
   GOP Plan Will Cut Benefits by 45 Percent or More for Seniors. The Republican plan will reduce benefits for all seniors, even those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, "benefits for the 1980s birth cohort would be...30 percent lower...and benefits for the 2000s cohort would be...45 percent lower." [CBO, "Long-term Analysis of Plan 2 of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security," 7/21/2004, pp. 11 and Figure 2A] 
   Republican Privatization Plan Would Cost $5 Trillion. A Senior Administration Official stated in a briefing that the president's plan would cost $754 billion over ten years. "These figures are misleadingly low. They are generated by using a ten-year budget window (2006- 2015) that includes only five years of the fully phased-in plan. The plan would not be launched until 2009 and not be in full effect until 2011. Over the first ten years that the plan actually was in effect (2009-18), it would add about $1.4 trillion to the debt. Over the next ten years (2019- 28), it would add about $3.5 trillion more to the debt. All told, the plan would add $4.9 trillion (14 percent of GDP in 2028) to the debt over its first 20 years."
