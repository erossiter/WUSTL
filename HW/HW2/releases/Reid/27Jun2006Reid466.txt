SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AMERICANS' RETIREMENT SECURITY
  With President Bush repeating his commitment to undermining Americans' Social Security benefits today at a speech in Washington, DC, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement. A fact check on the effects of President Bush's Social Security Privatization scheme is attached below. 
   "It's now clear that Bush Republicans will never give up their drive to privatize Social Security, cut benefits and explode the debt. Democrats remain committed to standing up for working Americans and our seniors and rejecting any attempt to privatize Social Security. Democrats stopped this misguided approach in 2005 and will again in 2006 and beyond."
