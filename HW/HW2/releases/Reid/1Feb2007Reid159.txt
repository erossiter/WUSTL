SENS. REID, ENSIGN MEET WITH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
  Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada met today with thirty-five students from Bishop Gorman High School, who were in town visiting the nation's Capital with Close Up, a program that promotes responsible and informed participation in the democratic process.  
   "I always enjoy the opportunity to visit with teenagers from Nevada," said Reid. "These bright students are our country's future. It's important we encourage them to participate in the political process while they're young." 
   "It is always encouraging to see the enthusiasm of these young people when they come to visit Washington, D.C.," said Ensign. "These students are our future leaders, and I enjoy the opportunity to discuss the different issues, hear their points of view and share my thoughts with them." 
   Reid and Ensign spoke to the students about the importance of their role in a participatory government, education issues and the way the Senate functions. They also answered questions from students about local and national political issues. 
   In addition to meeting with the Senators, the students also participated in a tour of the Capitol building arranged by Reid. 
   The Close Up Foundation is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan citizenship education organization. Since its founding in 1970, Close Up has worked to promote responsible and informed participation in the democratic process through a variety of educational programs.
