EQUAL PAY FOR ALL NEVADANS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid discussed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 (Fair Pay Act) that was blocked by Republicans today. The act would help to ensure equal pay for equal work for all workers, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability. 
   "I don't know how anyone would oppose something like this. It just makes sense that people should be treated fairly," Reid said. "Today, Democrats tried to restore equal pay for equal work regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability, but were again blocked by Republican tactics." The Fair Pay Act would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., ending the 180-day statute of limitations on filing a discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The legislation would restore the "paycheck accrual" rule, ensuring that employees who can prove pay discrimination will not be forever barred from seeking redress because they did not learn they were victims of pay discrimination within six months after being hired.
