SEN. REID: CHENEY MISSES CHANCE TO COME CLEAN, MOVE FORWARD
  The following are remarks from Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid on the Vice President's speech today. 
   "This speech was yet another missed opportunity by the Vice President to come clean with the American people and lay out a strategy for success in Iraq 
   "The Vice President and this Administration have a credibility problem. Rather than giving our troops a plan to move forward in Iraq and changing their failed course, they continue to ignore the facts and lash out at those who raise legitimate questions about how the Administration misused intelligence in its rush to war. 
   "Together, we can do better."
