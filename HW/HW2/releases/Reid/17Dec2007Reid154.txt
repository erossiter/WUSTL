SEN. REID LAUDS COMPLETION OF U.S. 95 WIDENING PROJECT
  Today U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada celebrated the completion and subsequent opening of the widened U.S. 95 in Las Vegas. 
   "The U.S. 95 Widening Project is the result of tremendous efforts to improve the quality of life for Nevadans and tourists that visit our state," said Reid. "Projects like this help reduce growing congestion and improve air quality. I'm thankful for the cooperation between the Nevada Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, along with the Regional Transportation Commission of Clark County and the cities here in Clark County. Together, we have all worked to develop a project that is reflective of Nevadans' needs. I will continue working to make the Silver State a better place to live."
   "The successful process involved multi-agency coordination and extensive public involvement," said Susan Martinovich, director of the Nevada Department of Transportation. "Senator Reid was very supportive in helping us work through the issues with the Sierra Club and have resulted in a superior project for our citizens."
   The U.S. 95 Widening Project includes widening U.S. 95 from six to ten lanes - one general purpose and one High Occupancy vehicle land in each direction - from Rainbow Boulevard to I-15 and installing a freeway management system.
   Reid helped secure $400 million of the federal portion of the total cost of $520 million.
