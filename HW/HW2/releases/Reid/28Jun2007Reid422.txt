SEN. REID: SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN ETHICS LAW
  Today, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid again tried to move ethics and lobbying reform legislation forward but for the second time this week, Senate Republicans blocked the effort. 
   "The Senate passed the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform legislation in a generation this January. The House passed similar legislation in May, but Senate Republicans are now blocking progress on the bill. The bill Republicans are blocking includes significant reforms to change the way the federal government works - it prohibits gifts and travel from lobbyists and companies that hire lobbyists; it puts an end to pay-to-play schemes like the Republican K Street Project; it dramatically increases public disclosure of the activities of lobbyists; it slows the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying world; it requires transparency in the earmark process; and it increases penalties for corrupt politicians and lobbyists." 
   "Since we took control of the Senate, Democrats have been working hard to pass ethics and lobbying reforms that have languished in past Congresses. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have chosen to obstruct our efforts and, in doing so, continue to delay this sorely needed ethics reform."
