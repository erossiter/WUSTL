SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS PROVIDING CARE REPUBLICANS HAVE IGNORED FOR TROOPS, VETERANS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to the introduction of the "Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act," which lays out a comprehensive path to address shortfalls in the care of injured troops and veterans, and the Senate Appropriations Committee's mark-up of a bill today that increases funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs: 
   "The Wounded Warriors Act ensures our service-members receive the care they deserve and do not fall through the cracks when they need that care the most. Since taking over the majority, Democrats have provided billions in veterans' funding, addressing this important issue in the Supplemental, our budget and now through the Veterans' Appropriations Bill. We are working hard to reverse Republicans' failure to care for our troops and veterans. From enlistment to retirement and beyond, Americans willing to pay the ultimate price for our nation deserve the best. These bills are steps in the right direction, and I look forward to bringing them before the full Senate."
