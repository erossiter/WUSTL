FRESHMEN SENATE DEMOCRATS HIGHLIGHT CHANGES THAT ARE LEADING AMERICA IN NEW DIRECTION
  The freshmen Democratic Senators, elected to send the country in a new direction, today released an online video highlighting the promises they have kept and changes they have helped deliver in their first seven months in office. 
   The American people demanded change in November, electing a Democratic majority - including nine new Democratic Senators - that has kept its promises to change course in Iraq, put working Americans first and change the way business is done in Washington. Among Democrats' many accomplishments since assuming the majority, these Freshman Senators have worked to make America more secure, strengthen our economy, and restore accountability to Washington.
