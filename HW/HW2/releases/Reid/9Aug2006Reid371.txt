SEN. REID: WAIT WILL END FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH
  On the five year anniversary of President Bush's stem cell ban, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid renewed his commitment to fighting for this potentially life saving research: 
   "Today marks a day of renewed determination. Despite five years of setbacks, no one should give up hope. With the right leadership, the promise of stem cell research will be realized. For too long, our nation has been stuck in the wrong direction because President Bush and the Republican Congress have stood in the way. On this anniversary, Democrats remain undeterred. We will continue to fight to bring the benefit of stem cell research to millions of Americans. After so much delay, the time has come for a new direction."
