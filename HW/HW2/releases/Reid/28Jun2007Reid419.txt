SEN. REID: SUPREME COURT DECISION ON SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IS JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today in response to the Supreme Court's decision on school desegregation:
   "The Supreme Court decision in the school desegregation cases is appalling. Ever since Brown v. Board of Education, it has been settled law that the Constitution requires racially mixed schools. Today's decision turns Brown upside down and ignores decades of constitutional history. If this isn't judicial activism, I don't know what is."
