SEN. REID PRAISES PASSAGE OF MINE SAFETY BILL
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said today that a new Senate bill will help keep miners around the country safer and prevent deadly accidents at mine sites.  
   The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (S. 2803) passed the Senate unanimously today. The measure calls for improved safety emergency response plans for mines, sets guidelines for improved underground communications and tracking strategies, enhances mine rescue and air supply, and authorizes more federal funding for research into mine safety. 
   "Mining is probably the most dangerous job in the country, and our miners deserve the best possible protections," said Reid. "I made a commitment that I would do everything I could to help improve our mine safety laws, and today's bill represents an important bipartisan effort to protect American workers. We have seen too many mining tragedies this year, and we need to do everything we can to prevent future accidents - in Nevada, West Virginia, Kentucky, Utah, Colorado, and mines across America." 
   Reid grew up in the mining town of Searchlight, Nevada and knows about the dangers of the profession first-hand. Senator Reid's father was a hard-rock miner and worked in mines in Nevada and Arizona throughout Reid's childhood. 
   "I know, personally, that better mine safety will save lives and protect families. That's why I'll keep doing everything I can here in Washington to help improve mine safety and protect our hardworking Nevadans." 
   Throughout his years in Congress, Senator Reid has been a champion for miners and the Nevada mining industry. Mining is an essential industry in Nevada and employs thousands of people statewide. Reid continues to work with members from both sides of the aisle to defend responsible mining, mining families, and their communities.
