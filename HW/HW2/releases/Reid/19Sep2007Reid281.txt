SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS COMMITTED TO MODERNIZING FISA TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER, PROTECT CITIZENS' RIGHTS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following remarks today in response to President Bush's comments today on FISA legislation:
   "Democrats will provide every legal and effective tool the intelligence community needs to protect America. The Democratic Congress will pass legislation to strengthen the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, while also respecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Neither the White House nor congressional Republicans should use this process to create a political wedge issue. We must work in a bipartisan fashion to pass a good bill that will protect Americans and American values."
