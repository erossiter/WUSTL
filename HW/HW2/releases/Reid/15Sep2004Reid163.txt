SEN. REID SECURES NEARLY $3.3 MILLION FOR NEVADA JUSTICE PROGRAMS
  In an effort to support justice programs in Nevada, Sen. Harry Reid has secured $3.3 million that will benefit law enforcement operations, legal education centers, and domestic assistance programs.  
   These programs are included in the fiscal year 2005 Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary (CJSJ) Appropriations bill, which was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee today. 
   "As a former police officer, I know how important it is for our law enforcement officers to have the equipment they need," said Reid. "These funds will help the police protect our families and communities." 
   The CJSJ Appropriations bill will now go to the Senate floor for a full Senate vote. 
   Following is a list of justice programs funded in the bill: 
   * $1.5 million for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to meet the new communication requirements of the Department of Homeland Security for radio interoperability. This will improve ability to communicate in real time with other local and federal public safety agencies. 
   * $550,000 for the Henderson Emergency Operations Center. Henderson does not have a secondary Emergency Operations/Dispatch Center. Specifically, the funds will be used to equip secondary centers which will be housed in the police substation in southwest Henderson. 
   * $250,000 for Nevada Child Seekers, a non-profit agency in Las Vegas dedicated to locating missing, abducted and runaway children. This agency provides a networking system for the identification of missing children, conducts crisis counseling, and aids in locating these children.

Specifically, the funds will supplement the current program in Washoe County and will expand the program to Douglas, Storey, and Western Lyon Counties. 
   * $100,000 for the S.A.F.E. House Domestic Violence Counseling Center. This center counsels victims of domestic violence and their children.
