SEN. REID CELEBRATES OPENING OF NELLIS SOLAR PLANT
  Today U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada celebrated the opening of the Nellis Air Force Base 14 megawatt solar plant. 
   "I'm thrilled the Nellis Air Force Base solar plant is now open," said Reid. "Nevada is blessed with wind, solar, and geothermal abundance. This project is another step toward harnessing the Silver State's vast clean, renewable energy potential. I will continue to do everything I can to help Nevada become the national leader in renewable energy and energy independence."
   The 30 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) solar energy system, the biggest solar plant in the U.S., will generate clean electricity to support over 12,000 military and civilians at Nellis.
