SEN. REID: CONTRACTING REFORM SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR SENATE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement after Bush Republicans in the Senate successfully blocked Democratic efforts to reform government contracting. 
   "On a day the Senate is set to pass $95 billion to fund wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it should be a priority for this Congress to ensure that the American people's money will be honestly and appropriately spent. After all we have learned about incompetence, mismanagement, and corruption in government contracts in Iraq-incompetence that put the safety of our troops at risk-it should be a priority to ensure that these abuses never happen again. Unfortunately, with today's vote Bush Republicans have made clear they do not believe reform is a priority for this Congress."
