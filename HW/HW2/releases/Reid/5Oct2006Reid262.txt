SEN. REID: REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP OWES AMERICA ANSWERS ON FOLEY SCANDAL
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the continuing and unfolding Foley scandal in the House Republican leadership.  
   "This Republican Congress has now completely failed the American people. We knew they wouldn't stand up to big drug companies. We knew they wouldn't repeal the tax breaks they gave to big oil. But we did expect them to protect our kids. It is now clear we expected too much of them. They are not up to the job of upholding America's values. 
   "It is not enough for House Republican leaders to work to ensure this disgrace is not repeated in the future. Every parent in America expects them to fully investigate why it was permitted in the first place. The problem today isn't the page program, which has been in existence since the time of Daniel Webster. The problem today is that House Republican leaders had evidence of a sexual predator in their ranks and chose to cover it up instead of choosing to protect these children. What is needed is for Republican leaders to testify under oath about what they knew, when they knew it, and why they didn't properly act."
