SEN. REID LEADS PASSAGE OF EMERGENCY FUNDING BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today led Senate passage of an emergency spending bill that provides funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, victims of Hurricane Katrina, and pressing issues facing Nevada.  
   "This bill ensures that our troops serving overseas will have the resources they need to do their work," said Reid. "This bill also provides our troops in Iraq, including nearly 300 Nevadans, with a strategy worthy of their service. We have given the president all of the funding he has requested and while he has been very vocal in his threats to veto this legislation, I hope he will instead choose to work with us on a solution that will get our troops the money they need and implement the change of course in Iraq being called for by the American people." 
   On a national level, the bill includes: 
   * More than $96 billion for the Department of Defense, primarily for Iraq and Afghanistan; $1 billion for the National Guard and $1.1 billion to improve military housing; 
   * More than $4.3 billion to ensure returning troops and veterans receive the health care that they have earned; 
   * $6.7 billion for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; 
   * $2 billion to improve security at airports, shipping ports, and mass transit systems; 
   * $745 million in emergency funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); 
   * $4.2 billion to assist farmers and ranchers as a result of severe drought and agricultural disasters; 
   * Emergency funding for forest firefighting, for low-income home energy assistance, and for pandemic flu preparations. 
   The bill also addresses important issues facing Nevada, including: 
   * $15 million to fight Mormon crickets in Nevada, Idaho, and Utah. These crickets have impacted more than15 million acres of rangeland and agricultural land in Nevada alone; 
   * $4.7 billion to strengthen rural communities by fully funding the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program and restoring funding to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act, also known as county payments. Senator Reid led efforts to revise the distribution formula for Secure Rural Schools funding, which will now deliver over $30 million in new money to Nevada's counties over the next 5 years; 
   * $22.7 million for continuing the geothermal energy research and development program.
