SEN. REID CARRIES TORCH FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS
  Working in a bipartisan manner to provide more opportunities for children and adults with disabilities, Nevada Sen.  
 Harry Reid joined Senate and House leaders in introducing legislation to expand the Special Olympics.
   The Special Olympics Sports and Empowerment Act of 2004 would create a five-year, $75 million authorization for Special Olympics.
   "The impact of Special Olympics goes well beyond the many who have participated," said Reid. "Sport has helped break down barriers, improve living conditions and change attitudes, and I am proud to play a role in expanding this global movement."
   Melissa Rufino, a Special Olympics gymnast from Las Vegas, NV, joined Reid at a press conference touting his legislation. Also present was Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who found the Special Olympics in 1968.
   "Today, I am joined by two very important ladies: Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Melissa Rufino. Because of Mrs. Shriver, athletes like Melissa are directly benefiting from her life-changing idea," Reid added.
   Special Olympics is an international organization dedicated to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities to become physically fit, productive and respected members of society through sports training and competition. Special Olympics offers children and adults with intellectual disabilities year-round training and competition in 26 Olympic-type summer and winter sports.
   Special Olympics currently serves more than one million persons with intellectual disabilities in more than 150 countries.
