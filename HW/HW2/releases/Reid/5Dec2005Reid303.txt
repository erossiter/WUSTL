SEN. REID ON 9/11 COMMISSION GRADES
  Today, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the 9/11 commission's final report:  
   "Protecting Americans should be the top priority of the United States government. That is why, this year, Democrats have fought to increase security at our ports and chemical plants, to make our transit system safer and to help first responders get the equipment they need to do their job. Unfortunately, our efforts have been blocked by leaders of the Republican Party. 
   "Given their lack of attention to homeland security, an 'F' is too high a grade for the Bush White House and Washington Republicans. It's not that they're failing. They aren't even trying. America can do better."
