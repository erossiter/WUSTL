SEN. REID MEETS WITH BOULDER CITY OFFICIALS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met with Boulder City Mayor Roger Tobler, Councilman Travis Chandler, and City Manager Vicki Mayes to discuss issues facing Boulder City, such as water treatment, transportation projects and the development of renewable energy.  
   "Boulder City has major project proposals in the works, including an expansion of US 95, the construction of an alternate water intake for its residents, the building of a regional training facility for law enforcement, and the exploration of solar energy projects," Reid said. "I appreciate Roger taking the time to speak with me about the city's needs. Helping Nevadans is my main priority, one that the mayor and I share. Hopefully what we discussed today will positively impact the state as much as it will benefit Boulder City." 
   Boulder City has been proactive in helping fund development of alternative water sources so its residents will no longer need to rely solely on water from Lake Mead in the future.
