SEN. REID ADDRESSES NEVADA'S FORECLOSURE CRISIS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid delivered the keynote address to members of the Nevada chapter of National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals this week. His speech focused on the foreclosure crisis that is hurting Nevada families and weakening the economy. Nevada currently has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation. "I am doing everything I can here in Nevada and back in Washington to bring an end to the crisis so we can stabilize our economy and keep working families in their homes. We've made some good progress but there is still more to be done," said Senator Reid. 
   Reid is cosponsoring the Foreclosure Prevention Act that helps struggling families remain in their homes. Most recently, Reid organized Mobile Resource Centers across the state that helped connect more than 1,000 Nevadans with state and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and lenders in order to help them with their mortgage situations.
