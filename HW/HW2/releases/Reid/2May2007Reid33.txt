SEN. REID: CONGRESS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after meeting with the President this afternoon: 
   "We are always open to discussion with the President, and our goals are clear: We want a bill that fully funds our troops, holds the Iraqi government accountable and changes the mission in Iraq. It's too bad President Bush delayed funding to the troops by vetoing a bill supported by a bipartisan majority of Congress, leading military experts and the American people, but that does not deter us from doing what is right. Our troops are mired in the middle of an open-ended civil war, the Iraqi government is ignoring benchmarks, and the U.S. is spending $8 billion a month in Iraq. The President may be content with the current situation, but we are not and neither are most Americans."
