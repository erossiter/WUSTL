SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE NEARLY $1 MILLION FOR NEVADA HEALTH CENTERS
  School children in Las Vegas will have better access to primary health care, thanks to a $950,000 grant announced today by Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign. 
   The grant will help an estimated 4,653 students, 60 percent of whom are uninsured. Nevada Health Centers, Inc. will operate three school-based health centers serving 10 schools in the poorest section of Las Vegas. 
   "These school-based health centers have been operated by Clark County Health District," said NVHC CEO Steve Hansen. "We feel honored that they have asked NVHC to assume the operations of these successful clinics." 
   The grant is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services as part of a five-year plan to help communities create more comprehensive health centers. 
   "We are proud of the services these centers provide in Nevada," said Reid. "This funding means more kids will receive quality health care no matter where they live or how much money their families make." 
   "It is difficult for students to focus on their education if they are not physically healthy," Ensign said. "This grant will provide them access to quality health care so they can concentrate on doing well in school and enjoying their childhoods." 
   NVHC is a private non-profit organization and currently operates 16 health clinics throughout rural and urban areas in Nevada.
