SEN. REID MEETS WITH MARTINES ABOUT STRENGTHENING NEVADA HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met today with Larry Martines, Director of the Nevada Department of Homeland Security, to discuss ways they can work together to strengthen homeland defense and improve safety throughout the state.  
   "I am looking forward to working with Nevada's new Homeland Security Director on developing innovative approaches to making Nevada safer," said Reid. "It is imperative that we work together to ensure the safety of Nevada's residents and the millions of people who visit our state. I will continue doing everything I can to make certain that the Nevada Department of Homeland Security has every resource it needs to keep our state secure." 
   Martines plans to establish fusion centers in Clark and Washoe Counties with a command center in Carson City at the newly constructed Emergency Operations Center to further increase Nevada's homeland security efforts. Fusion centers serve to streamline the process of sharing homeland security-related and crime-related information and intelligence. 
   Making Nevada safer is a top priority for Senator Reid, who has played a crucial role in acquiring funding for Nevada firefighters and local law enforcement. In addition, Reid has secured terrorism prevention grants, urban area grants, and state formula grants. Reid has secured funding for first responders, enhanced security efforts at McCarran Airport, and successfully fought to put Las Vegas on the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) funding list which provides additional resources needed to prevent, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other disasters. 
   Martines was appointed as Nevada Director of Homeland Security in January.
