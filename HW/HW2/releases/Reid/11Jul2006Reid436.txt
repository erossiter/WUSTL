SEN. REID: RECORD DEFICITS ARE NOTHING TO CELEBRATE
  With President Bush today celebrating new economic numbers that show his Administration has created a $296 billion deficit, larger than any deficit in American history before the Bush Administration, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement. A fact check on today's economic news is attached below. 
   "Only Washington Republicans would think a $300 billion deficit is good news. President Bush has turned record surpluses into record deficits largely through handouts to special interests and multi-millionaires. Instead of standing up for all Americans, this Republican Congress is proud to do nothing but rubberstamp President Bush's policies. The American people deserve a new direction from Congress."
