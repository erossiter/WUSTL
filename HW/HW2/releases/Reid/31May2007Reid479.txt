SEN. REID: ADMINISTRATION MUST SHOW LEADERSHIP ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to President Bush's call for a global greenhouse-gases emissions goal:  
   "The Bush Administration's 'head in the sand' position on global warming has defied reason and common sense. For six long years, it has suppressed scientists and scientific evidence, undermined international efforts to find solutions and delayed implementation of a strategy to protect the long-term interests of the nation. It has failed spectacularly to show constructive American leadership at home or abroad in keeping with our moral responsibility to reduce the nation's massive greenhouse-gas emissions. We hope today's announcement is the beginning of a reversal of the Administration's untenable and unwise position on global warming and not a public-relations stunt to defuse criticism going into the G-8 discussions in Germany."
