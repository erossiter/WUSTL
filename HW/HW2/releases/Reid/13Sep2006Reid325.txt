SEN. REID ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR STUDY THAT IMPROVES TRANSPORTATION, ENCOURAGES TOURISM
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced today $38,700 will go towards the continued feasibility study of a high speed rail corridor built between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. When built, the high speed corridor will be similar to Amtrak's current high speed corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston.  
   "Nevada is the fastest growing state in the nation with about 6,000 new residents every month and millions of visitors every year. We must continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure to keep pace with this rapid growth and reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and pollution," said Reid. "A high speed train between Las Vegas and Los Angeles would be great for Nevada's economy, great for tourism and great for travelers. I will continue to work on ways to provide more efficient forms of transportation for the people of Nevada." 
   The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada will receive the funding for their Rail Corridor Improvement Feasibility Study. When completed, the survey is expected to preview ridership rates and possible revenue forecasts. The study will determine fares, frequencies, and times to analyze the impacts on projected ridership. A station location analysis will also be done for the Las Vegas area. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Reid has worked to bring federal funds to Nevada to build better roads, expand public transit, and improve airports in Nevada. Reid, who initially secured $300K for this project, has also worked to secure money to widen I-15 between Las Vegas and Southern California. 
   This funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
