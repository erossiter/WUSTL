SEN. REID: CONGRESS DOES RIGHT THING IN PASSING CHIP; IT IS NOW PRESIDENT BUSH'S TURN
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed the CHIP reauthorization bill:  
   "Democrats and Republicans, healthcare providers and patient advocates, rural and urban Americans, and citizens of all ages have all come together today in support of our nation's children. The bill we are sending to the President improves the lives of low-income, uninsured children by ensuring they get the doctor visits and medicines they need when they're sick, and the checkups they need to stay well.
   "We are covering all 6.6 million low-income children currently in CHIP and providing health insurance to 4 million more. This is the result of a bipartisan effort, and it is essential that the President join us in doing the right thing for America's children. Rejecting this program - as he has threatened to do - is immoral and irresponsible."
