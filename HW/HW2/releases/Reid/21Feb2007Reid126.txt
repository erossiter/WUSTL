SEN. REID: BRITISH ACKNOWLEDGE A REALITY BUSH REFUSES TO ACCEPT
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada today released the following statement on news that the British government will begin to redeploy its troops from Iraq. 
   "By announcing its decision to redeploy troops from Iraq, the British Government has acknowledged a reality that President Bush still stubbornly refuses to accept. There can be no purely military solution in Iraq. The British recognize there must be a political solution, and the Iraqis themselves must make the necessary political compromises. It is past time for President Bush to acknowledge that basic truth.
   "Today's news is further evidence that the Bush plan to escalate the war is misguided, and demonstrates once again why it was strongly rejected by bipartisan majorities of the House and Senate. At a time when President Bush is asking our troops to shoulder a larger and unsustainable burden policing a civil war, his failed policies have left us increasingly isolated in Iraq and less secure here at home. Instead of escalating against the express will of Congress and the American people, the President should follow the advice of military leaders and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and change course in Iraq."
