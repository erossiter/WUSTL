SEN. REID ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO EXPAND VETERANS SERVICES FOR SOUTHERN NEVADANS
  Working to ensure that veterans have vital programs and services, U.S. Sen. Harry Reid announced today that $420,000 will go towards funding a homeless veterans shelter and a job training program in Southern Nevada.  
   "Homelessness and employment training are important issues to Nevada veterans," said Reid. "I'm pleased to know that Southern Nevada veterans will receive additional assistance through these programs." 
   $250,000 has been allocated through the Veterans Workforce Investment Program to address the employment and training needs of eligible veterans. Services are for veterans who have significant barriers to employment, veterans who served on active duty in the armed forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, and recently separated veterans. 
   $170,000 has been allocated through the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program to reintegrate homeless veterans into the labor force. Thousands of homeless veterans annually enroll in these programs. 
   Reid, a champion for veterans issues, worked to ensure that these competitive funds were specifically allocated to Southern Nevada veterans. Reid is also currently working to continue to solve the problem of concurrent receipts, when veterans are prohibited from collecting both retirement pay and disability pay. 
   In August 2000, Senator Reid was joined by Heather French, Miss America 2000, at the groundbreaking ceremony for the 300-bed facility that will house and help Southern Nevada homeless veterans. 
   Veterans living in Las Vegas, Henderson, Boulder City, and Clark County will benefit from these projects.
   The grants are awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor.
