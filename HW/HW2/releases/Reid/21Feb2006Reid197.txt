SEN. REID: SENATE MUST ACT TO ENSURE SECURITY OF AMERICA'S PORTS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement calling on Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to take action immediately to prevent a deal allowing a Middle-East based company from running port security in the United States:  
   "I am pleased to hear that Majority Leader Frist is concerned about the Bush Administration's ill-conceived decision to place the security of our ports in the hands of a company based in the Middle East. While I appreciate Senator Frist's statement that further review is necessary, it is already clear this deal should not go forward and I hope he will permit the Senate to act expeditiously in this matter when the Congress returns next week."
