SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS ARE STANDING IN THE WAY OF REFORM
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on Majority Leader Frist's refusal to recognize the priority of lobbying and ethics reform legislation:  
   "This morning, Senator Frist showed a national TV audience why Republicans cannot be trusted to reform Washington. They're more interested in obscuring the facts by throwing mud than they are in cleaning up the culture of corruption they have created. 
   If Senator Frist is serious about addressing corruption, he'll stop being disingenuous about the fact that he is opposing Democratic reform efforts and start working with us to bring our Honest Leadership Act to the floor of the Senate. Democrats know we can do better and we are ready to take action to clean up Washington immediately."
