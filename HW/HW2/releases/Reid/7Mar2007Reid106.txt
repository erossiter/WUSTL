SEN. REID MEETS WITH NEVADA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
  Today, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with numerous Nevada county commissioners to discuss local Nevada issues including the importance of working together to fight the growing methamphetamine epidemic and funding allocations for the valuable Payment In Lieu of Taxes program and Workforce Investment Act. The group also discussed opposition to the proposed federal budget that will repeal geothermal rents and royalties.  
   "These Nevada leaders have traveled a great distance to address a number of critical issues for our state, and I appreciate them taking the time to meet with me today," said Reid. "One of the top issues we discussed was the toll the meth epidemic is taking on Nevada. The commissioners expressed their desire for more federal support in combating the challenges associated with meth. I pledged my commitment to continue working with Nevada's county commissioners to ensure our state has the resources needed to combat meth and to make Nevada an even better place to live and raise a family."
