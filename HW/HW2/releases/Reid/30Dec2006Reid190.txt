SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the death of Saddam Hussein.  
   "With the death of Saddam Hussein, a dark chapter in Iraq's history is closed. He has received the justice he deserves for his crimes against his own people. Now, the Iraqi people have an opportunity to open a new chapter, by quelling the sectarian violence and building a nation for themselves. President Bush must implement a policy that ensures the Iraqi's take responsibility for their own future and removes our troops from a dangerous civil war. Our troops have served bravely and superbly, but the Iraqis need to find a political settlement to guide their own future."
