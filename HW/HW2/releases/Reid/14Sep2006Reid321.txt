SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, urging the Congress to move forward on this bipartisan compromise to help the American people.  
   "Because of the good bi-partisan work of Senator Landrieu, Senator Domenici and others, the Senate has passed and sent to the House a carefully crafted compromise to open significant new areas of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration and drilling. That bill represents what is achievable in the Senate at this time - of which there is very little left in this session of Congress. The Senate passed bill helps fund Gulf coast restoration, increases money going into the state-side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and provides necessary protections for the coast of Florida. By not over-reaching for a broader agenda, these provisions form the essential framework for final legislation that can pass the Senate in the 8 legislative days left. I am hopeful the Congress can move a bipartisan bill to the President's desk for signature before the upcoming recess and will urge my colleagues to continue discussions."
