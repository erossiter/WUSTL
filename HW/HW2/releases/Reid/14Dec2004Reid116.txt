SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEDAL OF FREEDOM AWARDS
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), the incoming Senate Democratic Leader, released the following statement on the Presidential Medal of Freedom awards:  
   "The President awards the Medal of Freedom to those who have exhibited exemplary meritorious service. While I appreciate the President's desire to recognize the service of the three men honored today, the real heroes are those soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen who have fought bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are the ones who have consistently exhibited exemplary courage, grace under pressure, and a determination to keep this nation strong. Hundreds of thousands have chosen to risk their lives, and nearly 1300 have made the ultimate sacrifice, all so that Americans and others around the world can live in freedom. Despite the Administration's many mistakes in pre-war intelligence, war planning, and post-war reconstruction, the members of the U.S. military have performed in a manner that should make all Americans proud. All those who serve or have served this nation so well deserve the honor bestowed by the President today."
