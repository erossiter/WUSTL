SEN. REID: BORDER SECURITY NEEDS MORE THAN A PRESS CONFERENCE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the Homeland Security Agency's photo-op enforcement of America's immigration laws. 
   "For five years, the Bush Administration has failed to secure America's borders and enforce our laws. A photo-op crackdown by its Homeland Security Agency to prove a political point won't erase its failed record. Americans know our country needs a real change. President Bush must stand up to the radical right wing of his party and stop Republicans from filibustering tough, comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform."
