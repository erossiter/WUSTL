SEN. REID UNVEILS NEW SWAT B.E.A.R.
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada helped unveil the Metro SWAT unit's newest vehicle yesterday. The Ballistic Engineered Armored Response (BEAR) vehicle was designed to provide members of the SWAT unit a new level of protection, mobility, and durability. Reid secured more than $300,000 to help Metro purchase the BEAR. 
   "This is an incredible piece of equipment that will go a long way toward helping Metro do its job of protecting the people of Nevada," said Reid. "Our police officers are put in harm's way every day. This vehicle will help provide the protection they need so that they are safe while they are looking out for us."
   In addition to being able to perform rescue missions in dangerous situations, the BEAR can also be used for:
   * Serving high risk warrants
   * Officer Rescue
   * Tactical emergency medical services (EMS)
   * Rapid Deployment (The BEAR fits 15 fully equipped officers)
   * Gang Intervention
   * Group Evacuation (The BEAR fits 25-30 evacuees)
