SEN. REID FIGHTS FOR ADDITIONAL HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING FOR NEVADA
Sen. Harry Reid announced today that Nevada will receive more than $20 million in federal funding for homeland security next year. Due to Bush Administration cuts, next year's grant is less than this year, although proportionately more for Nevada than most of the country.  
 "The entire Nevada Congressional delegation and state officials worked together, across party lines, to convince the Bush Administration that Nevada needs more funding," said Reid. "Thanks to that hard work, Nevada will do better than many other states, but overall the funding is still inadequate. This is a poor reflection on the White House's commitment to Homeland Security. They talk a good game, but they won't provide the necessary funding to get the job done. I'll keep working to get more funding for Nevada in the future. We should not cut corners on security." 
 The grants issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) comprise the majority of federal homeland security funding for the 50 states. Overall, national homeland security funding was cut by 37 percent. Almost every state will face cuts in homeland security funding - many of them severe. 
 Nevada will receive less federal funding than last year, but will face fewer cuts than most of America. Nevada will get $20,508,913 - 22 percent less than this year. Certain areas fared better; Las Vegas will face only an 8 percent cut from this year's funding. 
 The Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) awards federal funds to enhance the ability of states, urban areas, and territories to prepare for and respond to terrorist attacks and other disasters. 
 During FY 2005 DHS awarded Nevada $26,312,438.
