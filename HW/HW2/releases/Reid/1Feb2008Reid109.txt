SEN. REID: JOBS REPORT UNDERSCORES URGENCY OF STRENGTHENING ECONOMY, CREATING JOBS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to a Department of Labor report that U.S. employers cut 17,000 non-farm jobs in January - the first time in nearly four-and-a-half years that payrolls shrank - with continuing losses in the construction and manufacturing sectors: 
  "Today's report that 17,000 jobs disappeared last month is yet more evidence that President Bush's assessment of the state of our economy is greatly misguided. While employers slow hiring and the economy stalls, Democrats are continuing to lead the way for change by both strengthening our economy in the short-term and addressing the long-term economic problems facing America's middle class.
  "In addition to sending Americans families checks to boost the economy in the short term, our stimulus plan extends unemployment insurance to provide much-needed assistance to those workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. We hope Republicans similarly recognize the urgency of helping Americans who are being pushed out of the workforce, and our stimulus bill is one important step in that direction."
