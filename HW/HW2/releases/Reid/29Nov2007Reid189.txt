SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON COAL PLANT DELAY
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement regarding Sierra Pacific Resources' decision to build a natural gas power plant before moving forward on building a coal plant near Ely, NV. 
  "I am very pleased that Sierra Pacific has decided to speed up their plans to expand the Harry Allen natural gas power plant before attempting to build a dirty coal plant in Nevada.
  "When the company's representatives came to me this summer saying they needed a 'bridge' to meet Nevada's power needs while they look into renewable power, I suggested they use natural gas. I am glad they are choosing to go in that direction. I hope Sierra Pacific's executives will take the additional time they now have to reexamine their plans to build a dirty coal plant and, instead, invest in a renewable energy and energy efficiency plan that will protect our air and create thousands of Nevada jobs."
