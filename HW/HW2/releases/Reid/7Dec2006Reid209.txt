SEN. REID HONORS PEARL HARBOR VETERANS
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued the following statement on the 65th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor:  
 "Today as we remember the devastating attacks on Pearl Harbor, we pay tribute to the sacrifice, bravery and dedication of all who have served in our armed forces - past and present. 
 "Sixty-five years ago the U.S. suffered a surprise attack that transformed our country. The attack on Pearl Harbor killed 2,500 brave men and women. 1,200 were wounded. On that early Sunday morning, only a few American ships escaped destruction. Despite receiving major torpedo and bomb hits, the U.S.S. Nevada was one of them. But while the ship survived, more than fifty servicemen aboard did not. More than one hundred others were wounded. 
 "We learned a difficult lesson from that attack, and one that still has meaning today- that we must be ever vigilant, always on guard, and fully prepared to defend our homeland. 
 "Today, we honor all the brave men and women who have fought for our country. All Americans send our deepest thanks to everyone who risks their lives protecting our nation, our freedom, and our ideals and values."
