SEN. REID: TOGETHER, WE CAN DO BETTER THAN MISPLACED PRIORITIES OF REPUBLICAN BUDGET
  Today, Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the so-called Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005: 
   "Democrats know that together, we can do better than the misplaced priorities of the Republican budget passed today. The Republican Senate stood up for the special interests and against the American people's interest today. In the pursuit of their immoral budget that will increase the deficit, Republicans stood in the way of important initiatives for middle-class Americans.  
   "Today's budget debate hides the irresponsible Republican priorities that are still to come. After cutting important priorities for working Americans, Senate Republicans will now turn to spending billions more on tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. Democrats will continue to stand on the side of the American people."
