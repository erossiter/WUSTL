DEMOCRATS COMMITTED TO STAYING AT WORK THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY UNTIL IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL BILL GOES TO PRESIDENT
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi today issued the following statement:
   "Democrats are committed to fully funding our troops and changing course in Iraq. In the coming days, we will work to send the President a bill that does just that. We hope the President and Congressional Republicans will negotiate in good faith so that we can provide our troops the funding they need and an effective strategy by next week. If they do not, we are prepared to work through the Memorial Day district work period to accomplish our goals."
