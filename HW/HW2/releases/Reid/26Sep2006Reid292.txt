SEN. REID: SENATE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD ON U.S.-INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION BILL
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), made the following statement after Republicans blocked his unanimous consent proposal that would have guaranteed Senate consideration of and a final vote on the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation bill before Congress adjourns for the November elections:  
   "Last night, I offered a unanimous consent agreement to ensure that the Senate could complete consideration of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation legislation before Congress leaves town this week for the November elections. Unfortunately, the Republican Leader objected to the proposal. 
   "Senate Democrats have been strong supporters of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation bill since the Administration announced this proposal in March and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved it in June. Unfortunately, since this bill was favorably acted on by the Foreign Relations Committee, the Republican Leader chose to bring 16 different legislative matters to the Senate floor rather than this important legislation, which is critical to the U.S./India relationship. 
   "The facts are that Republican differences over the substance of this bill have delayed its consideration and some of those disagreements have still not been resolved, as I learned last evening in my discussions with Senator Frist. I would encourage people following this debate to review the complete transcript of our discussion last evening. 
   "I do believe it is important for the Senate to act on this matter without further delay. Its passage would mean so much to the vitally important U.S./India relationship. I pledge to do what I can to ensure that we do just that. I hope the Majority Leader will not pass up yet another opportunity to get this bill done."
