SEN. REID SECURES $500K TO CONTINUE CARSON CITY EROSION CONTROL PROGRAM
Working to help Carson City avoid future flooding, Sen. Harry Reid announced today that he secured $500,000 in the FY07 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill yesterday to continue funding the Carson City Erosion Control program.  
 "Carson City suffered devastating wild fires in July 2004. Because the area lost its lush vegetation, Carson City now faces flooding threats," said Reid. "I am extremely pleased to know that Carson City will receive the funds necessary to reforest the area devastated by the wildfires. This is a great victory for the people of the community," said Reid. 
 During the July '04 wildfires, over 8,700 acres across the west side of the city-county were blackened, removing all native vegetation. Carson City now faces continued threats from flooding and potential debris flows and severe damage to surface water supplies. 
 The funds will allow for essential reforestation and erosion control work, including the collection and planting of native seeds. Young trees will be planted to stabilize slopes, prevent erosion, and restore local watersheds. 
 This year's funding is a $129,000 increase from last year's funding for this program. 
 Now that the bill has been passed out of the Appropriations Committee, it will head to the Senate floor for passage, then to conference committee before it becomes law.
