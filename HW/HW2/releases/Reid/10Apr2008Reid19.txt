SENS. REID, ENSIGN, REP. HELLER ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AT NEVADA AIRPORTS
  Nevada Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, and Representative Dean Heller today announced three grants for the state of Nevada totaling more than $11.7 million to aid improvements to Nevada airports. The funding is administered through the US Department of Transportation, and will go toward runway improvements at Carson, Reno/Tahoe International, and Beatty Airports. 
   "These grants will help ensure safe air travel throughout Nevada," said Reid. "I commend the Department of Transportation for joining us in this endeavor that will positively impact anyone flying into or out of the Silver State."
   "This grant is important not only to ensure safe travel for so many people but also because our state relies on air travel as an economic engine," said Ensign. "These funds will improve security at airports across Nevada and ensure safer air travel for those coming in and out of our state."
   "Due to the vast expanses of Nevada, the ability to travel by airplane is critical to many of our communities. Airports are vital to commerce and economic growth in our local communities. I am pleased these funds have been made available," said Heller.
   The grants will enable these airports to increase security, develop additional space for aircrafts, and improve runway safety by removing small obstructions that disrupt smooth landings.
