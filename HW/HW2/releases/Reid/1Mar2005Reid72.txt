DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HIT THE ROAD TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
  Responding to Americans everywhere who are concerned with the President's plan to privatize Social Security, Democratic Senators are hosting a series of events throughout the country this week to talk about the Democrats' commitment to protecting and strengthening Social Security.  
   Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Democratic Policy Committee Chair Byron Dorgan (D-ND) will participate in Social Security forums in New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Las Vegas on Friday and Saturday.
