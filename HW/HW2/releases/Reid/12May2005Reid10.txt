SEN. REID EXPRESSES CONCERN FOR SURVIVORS, CHILDREN WITH BUSH SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION SCHEME
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today:
   "It is deeply disturbing that the President wants to slash benefits for widows and children to pay for his risky private accounts.  
 Deep benefit cuts for retirees are bad enough, but it would be outrageous to pull the rug out from vulnerable families who have lost a loved one and a breadwinner. The Administration's benefit cuts would undermine the financial security of millions of families. That's wrong. 
   "One minute, the Administration proposes massive new breaks for special interests and the very wealthy. The next, they propose deep benefit cuts for widows and orphans. Obviously, we just have different priorities and very different values. 
   "Not only would the President's plan drastically slash guaranteed benefits for middle-class seniors, survivors and children, eliminating them entirely for some, but it also would drive Social Security into insolvency 11 years earlier and add trillions in new debt. 
   "Democrats are committed to strengthening the program and will work to find ways to address Social Security's long term financial challenge while also encouraging Americans to save and take other steps to enhance retirement security."
