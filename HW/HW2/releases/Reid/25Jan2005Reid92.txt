SEN. REID RESPONDS TO WHITE HOUSE SOCIAL SECURITY STRATEGY MEETING
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today:  
   "I know some of my Republican colleagues are headed up to the White House this afternoon to discuss Social Security strategy. I hope they make it clear to the President that taking bipartisan action in the Senate will not be possible when the President has failed to disavow the suggestions by Chairman Thomas that we should use race or gender as a factor in determining benefits. 
   "I want to work with the President to strengthen Social Security, but I hope when the president and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they want to act in a bipartisan way, they understand that some things are simply off the table. We cannot use race or gender to determine benefits, just as we should not pursue a privatization plan that will make deep cuts in benefits and create $2 trillion in additional debt."
