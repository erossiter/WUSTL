   A copy of his speech as prepared for delivery is below:
   "Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to honor Nevada State Trooper Kara Kelly-Borgognone.
   "Monday night, Trooper Kelly-Borgognone responded to a dangerous assignment: a suspicious package had been reported at a gas station in Spanish Springs, Nevada.
   "While on route to the location, her patrol car was struck by a driver headed in the other direction.
   "Trooper Kelly-Borgognone was rushed to Renown Regional Medical Center, critically injured.
   "Today she has succumbed to her injuries and passed away.
   "Trooper Kelly- Borgognone gave her life protecting the people of Nevada, just as she did every day.
   "Even in passing, she donated her organs to save more lives.
   "In the final hours of her life, her brothers and sisters on the Nevada Highway Patrol have stood by her side, guarding her.
   "They cared for their fallen sister, just as they care for us every day.
   "Today, as their solemn vigil comes to an end, we will try, in some small way, to share the burden of their grief.
   "Our hearts and prayers are with the trooper's husband, Dirk, and their two daughters, Blair and Ashlyn.
   "I hope it is some comfort for them to know that their wife and mother gave her life in honorable service to the people of Nevada.
