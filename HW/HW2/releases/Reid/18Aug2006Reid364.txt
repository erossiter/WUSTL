SEN. REID: PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE MADE AMERICANS LESS SECURE
  Today, while meeting with his economic advisors at Camp David, President Bush continued his PR campaign to convince Americans that the economy is in good shape. From rising gas prices and health care costs, to the ballooning budget deficit and tax giveaways for multi-millionaires, the President's economic policies have put the special interests ahead of middle-class Americans. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the Administration's failed economic record and the need for a new direction on the economy: 
   "The President doesn't need to meet his economic advisors in order to learn one simple truth: for millions of hardworking middle-class families, life under Republican rule has grown less affordable and less secure. Our economy badly needs a new direction, one that puts the interests of all Americans above the interests of a privileged few."
