SENS. ENSIGN, REID, REP. HELLER TOUT NEW DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS
  Douglas High School was selected by the Army for a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) unit starting in the 2007-2008 school year, thanks to the efforts of Sen. John Ensign, Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Dean Heller. Sen. Ensign and Sen. Reid passed legislation last year to expand the JROTC program nationwide. The program expansion allowed for Douglas High School, which had been on the waiting list for five years, to receive a JROTC unit.  
   "JROTC provides young students an opportunity to develop strong leadership skills and values that will be beneficial throughout their lives," said Ensign. "This program gives many high school students a sense of direction and responsibility that will help them to become successful adults, and I am proud to have helped bring this program to Douglas High School." 
   "JROTC is a wonderful high school program that teaches our young men and women discipline, leadership and teamwork," said Reid. "I am very happy that Douglas High School now has the resources to start this program and that students will have the opportunity to learn how they can serve their community, their state, and their country." 
   "Giving Douglas High School the opportunity to establish a JROTC unit will provide great character building opportunities for the students. Young Nevadans who participate in this program often receive essential tools that make them successful in their endeavors in life," said Heller. 
   Ensign was originally approached about the lack of a JROTC program at Douglas High School by Principal Marty Swisher at a constituent breakfast in Washington, D.C. There are currently 749 high schools on the waiting list for a JROTC program, six of those schools in Nevada.
