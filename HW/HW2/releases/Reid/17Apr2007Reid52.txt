SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON WALKER RIVER PAIUTE TRIBE DECISION TO PROHIBIT TRANSPORTATION OF NUCLEAR WASTE THROUGH ITS RESERVATION
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement in response to the Walker River Paiute Tribe's decision to prohibit the transportation of nuclear waste through its Reservation:  
   "I am so pleased that the Walker River Paiute Tribe has made the decision not to allow nuclear waste to be transported through their Reservation. With this decision the Tribe has made the determination that the risks associated with transporting thousands of tons of nuclear waste through Nevada communities far outweigh any potential benefits being touted by those looking to turn Nevada into the nation's nuclear dumping ground. There are better ways to strengthen the economy in Nevada's rural and tribal communities, like investing in renewable energy sources, which alone could create more than 3,300 Nevada jobs. 
   "Further, what is true for Nevada is true for the nation. It is not safe to haul 77,000 tons of the most dangerous substance known to man through this nation's cities and towns so it can be buried 90 miles outside of Las Vegas. The Tribe's decision is yet another blow to this project, which is on its last legs. It is time for the federal government to come to the realization that on-site storage is the answer to America's nuclear waste challenges."
