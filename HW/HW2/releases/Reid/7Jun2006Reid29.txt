SEN. REID: FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT WAS THE WRONG PRIORITY FOR SENATE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on the Senate's decision today not to proceed to consideration of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  
   "This week's debate underscores the misplaced priorities of the Bush Republicans. Instead of a divisive and unnecessary amendment, we should be addressing the war in Iraq and how to better protect our nation from terror. We should be doing something about skyrocketing gas prices. We should be working on college affordability, retirement security, stem cell research to find new cures for diseases, and making our nation energy independent. These are the priorities of the American people."
   "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman, and the people of Nevada have passed a law to say just that. We don't need politicians in Washington writing family law into the Constitution for the first time in American history."
