SEN. REID ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS TO NATIONAL COMMISSION ON CHILDREN, DISASTERS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid today announced his appointments to the National Commission on Children and Disasters. Nevada Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie and Mark Shriver, Vice President of Save the Children, have been asked by Reid to serve on the newly created commission. The commission is designed to create a comprehensive study assessing the needs of children as it relates to preparation for and response to any disaster or emergency. 
  "I am so pleased both Sheila and Mark will serve on this important commission," said Reid. "Both have extensive backgrounds in caring for children in times of need. I know that their combined experience will provide invaluable insight into ways our nation can improve the care of children during unforeseen disasters."
  The 10-member commission will submit a final report to Congress within two years of being created.
  For more than 25 years, Nevada Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie has worked on behalf of children, youth and families in the Reno area and throughout Nevada. While serving as the Executive Director of the Children's Cabinet, Leslie created numerous programs including Family Preservation, the Child Care Resource Council, Homeless Youth Advocacy, Truancy Prevention Center, RAD Tutoring Program, Parent Education Network, Gang Prevention and Intervention, and Nevada's first comprehensive Adolescent Health Care program.
  Mark Shriver, Vice President and Managing Director of U.S. Programs for Save the Children, leads advocacy efforts for children living in poverty throughout rural communities here in the United States. For more than 17 years, Shriver served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates where he was Maryland's first-ever Chair of the Joint Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
