SEN. REID: BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION WILL HURT HISPANICS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today:
   "If the president wants to know how people really feel about his Social Security plan, he should start by asking them how they will react to having their benefits cut nearly in half, which is what seniors will see if Republicans proceed with their privatization plan.  
   Bush's plan to cut benefits will be particularly damaging for the Hispanic community, which relies on Social Security during their retirement more than other Americans. Without these benefits, almost 33 percent of older Hispanics would fall into poverty.
   Social Security is America's promise to those who work hard and play by the rules. But through news reports and White House leaks, we know the President intends to break this promise. I hope the President uses today's conversation to come clean about this fact."

   GEORGE BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION WILL HURT HISPANICS 
   Social Security is one of the most successful programs ever created by the government. It has provided retirees, survivors, and people with disabilities a benefit, paid in full and on time, every month for the last 75 years. This program is especially important for Hispanics who rely on Social Security during their retirement more than other Americans. Bush's plan to cut benefits will be particularly damaging for the community. 
   SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE KEYSTONE OF RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR MILLIONS OF HISPANICS: 
   * Hispanics Greatly Benefit from Social Security. 
   The Social Security program has been remarkably important for Hispanics. The Government Accounting Office found that, "In the aggregate, blacks and Hispanics have higher disability rates and lower lifetime earnings, and thus as a group tend to receive greater benefits relative to taxes than whites." [GAO, Social Security and Minorities, April 2003] 
   * Retired Hispanics Have Lower Levels of Private Savings and Rely More on Social Security.
   "Older Hispanics are less likely to have income from private pensions and assets than whites." 76 percent of all Hispanics over the age of 65 rely on Social Security benefits for 50 percent or more of their total income while nearly half rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more. [AARP Public Policy Institute, September 2003] 
   * Hispanics Have Longer Expected Retirements Making Social 
  Security Particularly Important.
   Hispanics on average live longer than other racial and ethnic groups. Because of their longer lifespan, Social Security is a key component of their retirement security. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "By comparison, a white man who was 20 in 2001 is expected to have 16 years of retirement and a Latino is expected to have 19 years." Social Security provides a guaranteed benefit every month for as long as the recipient is alive - unlike with private accounts, a worker cannot outlive her benefits.

   CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT HISPANICS: 
   * Without Social Security, Almost 33 Percent of Older Hispanics Would Fall Into Poverty.
   Social Security is remarkably successful at keeping retired Americans out of poverty. Without these benefits, almost 33 percent of older Hispanics would fall into poverty. [AARP Public Policy Institute, September 2003]
   * Cuts to Traditional Social Security Benefits Will "Disproportionately Affect Equity for Minorities."
   Because Hispanics disproportionately rely on Social Security as their sole source of retirement income, they will also be disproportionately hurt by any cuts. "Reforms that...[tie] benefits more directly to contributions may affect the progressivity of the system and are likely to disproportionately affect equity for minorities." [GAO, Social Security and Minorities, April 2003] 
   BUSH'S PLAN TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS: 
   * Bush's Plan Will Cut Guaranteed Social Security Benefits. 
   The Bush plan will cut benefits by tying benefits to the rise of inflation instead of wages. "Because wages tend to rise considerably faster than inflation, the new formula would stunt the growth of benefits, slowly at first but more quickly by the middle of the century." Younger workers are more likely to be Hispanic than others, thus cuts in benefits for the next generations will have a greater impact on Hispanics working today. [ Washington Post, 1/4/05]
   * Benefits Will be Cut By 45 Percent or More.
   By changing the way Social Security benefits will be calculated, seniors will see their benefits greatly reduced. "According to the Social Security Administration's chief actuary, a middle-class worker retiring in 2022 would see guaranteed benefits cut by 9.9 percent. By 2042, average monthly benefits for middle- and high-income workers would fall by more than a quarter. A retiree in 2075 would receive 54 percent of the benefit now promised." [ Washington Post, 1/4/05] 
   * Bush's Proposed Cuts Would Replace an Ever-Smaller Share of Preretirement Income. 
   The Bush proposal to change the indexing mechanism used to calculate Social Security benefits will continually reduce the portion of workers' preretirement income that Social Security will replace. "Social Security benefits currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at 65. Under the new formula, that benefit would fall to 20 percent of pre-retirement earnings. Future retirees would, in effect, be consigned to today's standard of living." [ Washington Post, 1/4/05]
   * Private Accounts do not Guarantee a Minimum Benefit and Threaten Future Hispanic Retirees with a Greater Likelihood of Poverty.
   Because current Hispanic workers are less likely to hold other assets or to participate in private pensions or retirement accounts, the risk involved in diverting Social Security funds into the stock market would be more greatly felt by Hispanics than other workers. Several studies have shown that stock market returns are not always better than the guaranteed benefit that Social Security provides - it all depends on timing, and a person cannot choose when they become disabled or when the sole income provider dies.
