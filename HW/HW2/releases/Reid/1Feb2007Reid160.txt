SENS. ENSIGN, REID: I-15, I-80 ONE STEP CLOSER TO FAST-TRACK IMPROVEMENTS
  Sens. John Ensign and Harry Reid announced today that two major Nevada interstate highways are one step closer to being selected for improvements through a new federal transportation program aimed at reducing congestion and improving safety.  
   "This announcement brings us one step closer to improving the major driving routes across our state," said Ensign. "Being on this list means we have some of the worst traffic in the country; on the other hand it means we could receive support to address those concerns. This would put Nevada's road improvements on a fast track." 
   "I've been working closely with the Department of Transportation for several months now to encourage them to add the two corridors," said Reid. "I am elated to see the announcement today. The bottom line is this is good news for southern and northern Nevada. If Nevada is identified as a finalist, this project will provide a tremendous economic boost for tourism as well as increase the safety of those that regularly travel on the highways." 
   The Corridors of the Future Program, which is administered through the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), identified I-15 in southern Nevada and I-80 in northern Nevada as semi-finalists for improvements. Fourteen projects nationwide were selected based on their potential to reduce traffic, relieve bottlenecks and improve safety conditions for motorists. 
   DOT will announce the five finalists in the summer of 2007. Benefits of being selected include expedited environmental review, accelerated review and conditional approval through the Federal Highway Administration, expedited credit assistance, priority consideration for innovative financing programs and access to DOT experts.
