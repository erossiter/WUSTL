SEN. REID CALLS FOR ACTION ON STEM CELLS, ON ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement to mark the one-year anniversary of House passage of bipartisan stem cell legislation, calling on Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to finally make good on his promises to bring the legislation to the Senate for debate. 
   Exactly one year ago today, in a rare act of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives passed H.R .810, The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. This legislation would expand President Bush's 2001 policy for federal funding for stem cell research and permit federal researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - with the strongest oversight in the world - to finally explore the many possibilities stem cell research holds. 
   "Over the past year, I have repeatedly asked the Senate Majority Leader to find time to consider this bill, which a bipartisan majority of Senators support. My requests for action have been met by delay and inaction. 
   "As Nancy Reagan stated it in a letter to Senator Hatch dated May 1, 2006, "For those who are waiting every day for scientific progress to help their loved ones, the wait for United States Senate action has been very difficult and hard to comprehend. 
   "Few issues are as important to the American people as legislation that could provide medical breakthroughs that would benefit hundreds of millions of people suffering from illnesses like cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, and ALS. We can do better for the 100 million Americans counting on the promise of this ground breaking research. It is time for the Republican leadership to stop delaying and denying hope and to take up and pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act (H.R. 810) immediately."
