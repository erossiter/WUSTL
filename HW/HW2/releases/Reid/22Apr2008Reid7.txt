SENS. REID, ENSIGN INTRODUCE ORCHARD DETENTION BASIN FLOOD CONTROL ACT
  Nevada Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign today announced the introduction of the Orchard Detention Basin Flood Control Act. This legislation will release approximately 65 acres of land from the Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Release of this small acreage will allow the construction of a critical flood control project on the east side of the Las Vegas Valley. 
   "I am pleased to join with Senator Ensign in sponsoring this necessary piece of legislation," Reid said. "This bill clears the way for the construction of the Orchard Detention Basin project which will protect homes and schools from flash floods off of Sunrise Mountain. This project will go a long way toward improving public safety."
   "The Las Vegas Valley has fallen victim to the damaging effects of flooding throughout the years," said Ensign. "The Orchard Detention Basin Flood Control Act will seek to protect our communities in danger of flood waters by releasing land to construct a critical prevention project. I am pleased to join with Senator Reid in sponsoring this important legislation."
   The legislation would change the boundary of the Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area. An "instant study area" designation places development restrictions on public lands similar to those on wilderness study areas. This designation currently prevents the construction of this important flood control project, leaving the land and residents living downstream vulnerable to flood damage.
