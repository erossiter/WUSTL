  Sens. Harry Reid and John Ensign announced today that the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) will be awarded in the amount of $1,156,066 for various criminal justice programs in Clark County.  
   "I am proud to know the JAG grant will help improve the quality of life for Las Vegas citizens," said Reid. "This grant will assist in controlling crime in Southern Nevada and educating youth through programs like the Zero Weapons Zero Violence which helps prevent drug and weapon use while teaching conflict resolution." 
   "The JAG grant will provide Clark County law enforcement officials with the assistance needed to keep the county safe," Ensign said. "Southern Nevada residents will benefit greatly from this grant and its programs." 
   The Clark County 2005 JAG award will be spent on the following projects: Criminal Court Exhibit Preparation Unit, Drug Court Program, Zero Weapons Zero Violence Program, Metropolitan Police Gang Unit, Taser Program, Gang Task Force, and the Juvenile Sex Offender Program. 
   JAG allows local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own local needs and conditions. Grant funds can be used for state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice in the following areas: 1) law enforcement programs; 2) prosecution and court programs; 3) prevention and education programs; 4) corrections and community corrections programs; 5) drug treatment programs; and 6) planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.
