SEN. REID NOMINEE JON WELLINGHOFF CONFIRMED BY SENATE
  The U.S. Senate has given final approval to Senator Harry Reid's selection for a seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Las Vegan Jon Wellinghoff was recommended for the prestigious post by Reid. The Senate unanimously approved his nomination this morning. 
   "Jon Wellinghoff will serve Nevada and the nation with great distinction as a FERC Commissioner," said Reid. "I knew from the beginning that he was the right person for the job, and I'm pleased my fellow Senators have agreed with me. We need someone with Jon's talent and experience to protect American consumers and handle the energy problems facing Nevada and our country."
   FERC is an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, and electricity. FERC also regulates natural gas and hydropower projects. 
   Wellinghoff has an extensive background in energy issues and is known for his work to protect consumers. He has served as Chief of the District Attorney's Consumer Fraud Division in Reno, counsel to Nevada's Public Utilities Commission and a seven-year appointment as Nevada's Consumer Advocate. 
   In that work, Wellinghoff saved Nevada's utility customers more than $40 million. Jon also helped to write and enact Nevada's renewable energy requirements, one of the strongest in the nation. He is currently a shareholder in the law firm of Beckley Singleton in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he specializes in energy and consumer law.
