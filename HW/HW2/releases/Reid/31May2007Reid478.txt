SEN. REID: AFTER DEADLIEST PERIOD OF WAR, PRESIDENT STILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE REALITY ON GROUNDS IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to the White House's announcement that it would like to see a lengthy U.S. troop presence in Iraq like the one in South Korea: 
   "More U.S. troops died in April and May than in any other two-month period of this war. As we mark this troubling milestone, President Bush is now equating U.S. troop involvement in the endless Iraqi civil war to the post-Korean War security model, telling Americans that he may keep our troops mired in Iraq for as long as half a century. Neither our nation nor our troops nor the Iraqis can afford this failed policy any longer.
   "It is long past time for President Bush to recognize the reality on the ground in Iraq. The President has put our troops in the middle of an endless Iraqi civil war, and America is less secure as a result. Democrats know that we urgently need a strategy to change course. That is why we have consistently offered a plan to begin the phased redeployment of our troops and focus our efforts on counter-terrorism and training Iraqi security forces."
