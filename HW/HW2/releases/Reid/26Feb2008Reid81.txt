SEN. REID MEETS WITH MEMBERS OF SIERRA NEVADA JOB CORPS CENTER
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid met today with Sierra Nevada Job Corps Director Ken Dugan and students from the Sierra Nevada Job Corps Center. The Sierra Nevada campus, which recently opened a number of new facilities and provides training in such fields as auto repair, carpentry, electrical, hospitality and culinary arts, serves nearly 600 students and is among the largest Job Corps sites. 
  "Job Corps helps thousands of disadvantaged young people get the training and education they need to be successful in life," said Reid. "It's unfortunate that the president's proposed budget severely limits their resources by cutting their funding by $34 million. I want to see that change. Job Corps helps prepare these young people to succeed in jobs that provide essential services needed by all Nevadans."
  "Today was a great opportunity to be able to meet with Senator Reid and talk about the needs of Sierra Nevada Job Corps," said Dugan. "Job Corps has served the needs of Nevadans for 27 years by providing educational service opportunities. Through our programs, tens of thousands of young men and woman have obtained access to success." 
  During the meeting the representatives and students from the Sierra Nevada Job Corps Center also spoke with Reid about the need for a Job Corps center in Las Vegas.
