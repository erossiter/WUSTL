DEMOCRATS OPPOSE AMNESTY FOR IRAQIS WHO KILL AMERICAN SOLDIERS
  Senate Democrats offered the following amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to reject the Iraqi government's attempt to offer amnesty to those Iraqis who have attacked U.S. Armed Forces:
   Sense of the Senate:
   (1) The Iraqi government should not grant amnesty to persons who have attacked, killed, or wounded members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving heroically in Iraq to provide all Iraqis a better future.
   (2) President Bush should immediately notify the government of Iraq that the United States government opposes granting amnesty in the strongest possible terms.
