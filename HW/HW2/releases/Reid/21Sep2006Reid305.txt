SEN. REID MEETS WITH NEVADA REPRESENTATIVES TAKING PART IN AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY'S 'CELEBRATION ON THE HILL 2006'
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with the Nevada representatives from the American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Action Network. The 14 representatives were from Las Vegas, Carson City, Pahrump, Spring Creek, Fallon and Henderson. They are among the 10,000 advocates from around the country who are a part of American Cancer Society's "Celebration on the Hill 2006."  
   "This year, more than 11,000 Nevadans will be diagnosed with cancer," Reid said. We must do everything we can to reduce the number of people who are diagnosed with this terrible illness in the future. In order to meet that goal, we need to invest in medical research at the National Cancer Institute and provide the resources necessary to educate people and ensure all Nevadans have access to early detection." 
   This year in Nevada: 
   * Approximately 34,050 residents are 1-5 year cancer survivors 
   * 11,600 people will be diagnosed with cancer, including: 
   * 1,329 new colorectal cancer cases
   * 1,660 new breast cancer cases 
   * 1,520 new lung cancer cases 
   * 1,970 new prostate cancer cases 
   * Cancer will kill 4,680 Nevada Residents 
   Senator Reid supports the group's goals, which includes reauthorizing and increasing funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and increasing funding for the National Cancer Institute. Senator Reid signed ACS's Congressional Cancer Promise, which asks members of Congress to make the fight against cancer a national priority.
