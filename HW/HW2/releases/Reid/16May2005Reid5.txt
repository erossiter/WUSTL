DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, LABOR LEADERS FIGHT AGAINST REPUBLICAN ABUSE OF POWER, TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY
  Sens. Reid and Dorgan joined labor leaders today at a rally demonstrating Democratic resolve in the fight against Republican abuse of power and attempts to turn the Senate into a rubber stamp for George Bush's radical agenda.  
 AFSCME President Gerald McEntee and UNITE HERE Vice President Clayola Brown also spoke.
   "Republicans want it all - even if it means abusing their power and putting the interests of the right-wing ahead of the American people." said Democratic Leader Harry Reid "They stubbornly insist on privatizing Social Security, even if it brings deep benefit cuts, massive debt and insolvency 11-years earlier. And while they are focusing on seven radical judges, they're ignoring issues like gas prices and health care. This abuse of power is preventing the work of the American people from being done. It's time to put partisan politics aside."
   Republicans are trying to pack the courts with judges who would attempt to dismantle Social Security. One of George Bush's appointees, Janice Roger Brown has even equated Social Security, the most successful social program in history, with "cannibalism."
   "In their continuing quest for absolute power, Republicans want to turn this great institution into a rubber stamp for President Bush's agenda, including deep Social Security benefit cuts for middle-class Americans and sweeping changes to that program which has been a cornerstone of retirement security for generations of Americans," said Senator Byron Dorgan. "Let me say this as plainly as I can. Anyone who tries to take a wrecking ball to our Social Security program is in for a fight and those of us who value the Social Security program intend to win that fight."
