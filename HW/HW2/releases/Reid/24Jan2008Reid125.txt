SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS DEAL STRUCK BY HOUSE, PRESIDENT
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to the agreement reached by Congress and the President on a bipartisan stimulus package to revive our faltering economy:  
   "I am pleased the Speaker and the House Minority Leader, working with Secretary Paulson, have reached an agreement to send stimulus checks for individuals and provide tax relief to businesses. And I am proud that Democratic negotiators were able to secure tax relief for millions of Americans who would have been completely left out of the President's proposal.
   "In an effort to get the bipartisan process moving in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley will conduct a markup of stimulus proposals next week. I expect that the Committee and other Senators will work to improve the House package by adding funds for other initiatives that can boost the economy immediately, such as unemployment benefits, nutrition assistance, state relief and infrastructure investment. I look forward to this proposal's quick passage in the House so that the Senate can debate these provisions soon and meet my goal of sending the President a package by the President's Day recess."
