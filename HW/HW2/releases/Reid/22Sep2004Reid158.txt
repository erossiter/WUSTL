SEN. REID WILL SUPPORT GOSS AS NEXT CIA DIRECTOR
  Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on the nomination of Porter Goss to become the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  
 A Senate vote on the nomination is expected this afternoon. 
   "Today I met with Porter Goss and told him I will support his nomination to become the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. As a former Army intelligence officer, CIA operative, and Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Goss has the credentials to do the job. I have been concerned about his past partisan statements, but Mr. Goss assured me today that his interest in petty politics and partisanship has ended. These are serious times, with serious threats to the nation before us. I trust that Mr. Goss will stand by his word, respond to these many security challenges, and provide the President and the Congress with the best possible unvarnished intelligence. Our nation's security depends upon it."
