SEN. REID ANNOUNCES SEN. NELSON TO JOIN INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today announced that, subject to the approval of the Steering Committee and of the Caucus, Senator Bill Nelson will join the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 110th Congress. Nelson fills a seat previously held by Senator Carl Levin, who as incoming Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman will continue to participate in the work of the Intelligence Committee as an ex officio member of the committee. The change was suggested by Senator Levin because of the increased demands on his time now that he will be chairman of both the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the 110th Congress.
