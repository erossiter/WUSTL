KEY QUESTIONS FOR REPUBLICAN SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZERS
  Republican Sens. Jim DeMint, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham are widely expected to introduce a Social Security privatization bill soon that will use current Social Security surpluses to fund private accounts carved out of the traditional Social Security system. There are a number of key questions that must be answered when analyzing this bill. The following is a guide for those interested in the latest effort to privatize Social Security:  
   * How Deep are the Benefit Cuts? If the privatization bill takes dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund, what impact will that have on guaranteed Social Security benefits when those dedicated funds are needed to pay guaranteed benefits for current and future retirees? 
   * How Much New Debt will be Created? Diverting payroll taxes into private accounts would increase the federal government's need to borrow from the private sector. Supporters of the new privatization plan should explain how much new debt would be created, and the extent to which taxpayer's interest costs will increase as a result. 
   * To What Extent will Social Security's Solvency be made Worse? By raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to finance private accounts carved out of the traditional system, the health of the Social Security Trust Fund will be threatened as those dollars no longer will be available to pay guaranteed benefits for current and future retirees. What impact will raiding the Trust Fund have on the long term health of the Social Security system? 
   * Will there be a Privatization Tax that will Further Cut Traditional Benefits? In a number of different Social Security privatization schemes, a privatization tax, or benefit offset, is used to cut traditional Social Security benefits to finance the private accounts. Will such a tax be used in this new system and how deeply will traditional benefits be cut? 
   * What New Administrative Costs and Increase in Government Will the Plan Require? In order to administer a large new program carved out of the traditional Social Security system, the government and employers will be burdened by new administrative responsibilities. What will be the cost of these new administrative duties for employers and the federal government? 
   * What Impact will the Privatization Plan have on Current Government Programs? As the federal budget has run massive deficits since President Bush took office, the surpluses from the Social Security system have been used to supplement the federal budget. If those surpluses are no longer used to finance the federal budget, what impact will that have on government programs? Will essential services be cut in order to finance private accounts?
