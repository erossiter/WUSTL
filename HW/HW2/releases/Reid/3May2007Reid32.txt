SEN. REID STATEMENT ON RENO'S RECORD GAS PRICES
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement regarding the news that Reno's gas prices have hit an all-time high.  
   "The news that Reno's gas prices have hit a record is yet another reminder that we need to reduce our reliance on oil. The high cost of gas can have a major impact on families who are already struggling to make ends meet. As the Majority Leader in the Senate, I have made energy reform a top priority in Congress. Soon, we will debate a bill that will reduce America's and Nevada's reliance on oil, and increase our investments in alternative energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal power. In addition to saving consumers money, investing in renewable energy could create about 3,300 Nevada jobs."
