SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11
  Sen. Harry Reid today delivered the following remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate to mark the fifth Anniversary of 9/11.  
   "Five years and a day ago we rarely saw flag flying at every door. Five years and a day ago men in suits rarely wore flags pins."
   "Today, five years after September 11th, from sea to sea, flags fly proudly, in our front yards, on our suit's lapels, and in our hearts."
   "The acts of terrorism that September morn, lit for all Americans a lamp blazing through the smoke and pain, the tears and flames. Even as our hearts ached our hopes soared, inspired by the selfless courage and devotion of ordinary people performing extraordinary feats of courage and devotion."
   "Men and women, good, kind, loving Moms and Dads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters died that day. For that we can never cease to grieve."
   "But the light that shone on September 11th cannot die, it cannot be dimmed, it cannot fail, because it is the light of their spirit and of ours; it is the light of a great republic; of a free and democratic people."
   "September 11th will always be our burden. Our minds, our souls, our hearts cannot forget. We must not forget. But we must also always remember that our fallen children in those fallen towers relit a lamp that outshines the evil done to us. In their loss and in ours, they remind us, as could nothing else, of that for which we stand. That liberty is our central value that freedom is our cardinal virtue that we love our country, and our flag and our people for the light we shine, on ourselves, to the world, and for the future of humanity."
