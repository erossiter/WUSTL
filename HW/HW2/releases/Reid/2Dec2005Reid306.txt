SEN. REID: THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the release of November's jobs report:  
   "While any job creation in the Bush economy is good news, America can do better. This is not the time for self-congratulatory pats on the back. It's time to get to work on issues that American families struggle with every day, issues like rising energy prices, skyrocketing health care costs and middle-class tax relief.
   "The Bush-Cheney economic record is one with far too few benefits for too many American families. Republicans should set aside their misplaced priorities that benefit a special few and join Democrats in our effort to deliver real results for working families. We will continue to focus the Congress on the priorities of American families by working to lower fuel prices, make America energy independent, safeguard pensions, make higher education more affordable and make quality health care more available to all Americans."
