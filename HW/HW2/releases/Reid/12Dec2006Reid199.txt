SEN. REID: PRESIDENT MUST NOT DELAY CHANGE IN IRAQ
  Incoming Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on news today that President Bush has pushed off announcing a new Iraq strategy until after the new year.  
   "It has been six weeks since the American people demanded change in Iraq. In that time Iraq has descended further toward all-out civil war and all the President has done is fire Donald Rumsfeld and conduct a listening tour. Waiting and delaying on Iraq serves no one's interests. The President needs to understand how important and urgent change is for Iraq and for our troops. Talking to the same people he should have talked to four years ago does not relieve the President of the need to demonstrate leadership and change his policy now. The ball remains in his court, and time is running out."
