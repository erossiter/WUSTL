SEN. REID SPEAKS ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS AT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE FREEDOM FUND DINNER
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada spoke about the importance of voting and maintaining voting rights at the Las Vegas NAACP Chapter's annual Freedom Fund Banquet.  
   Earlier this year Democratic and Republican members from U.S. Senate and House of Representatives gathered at the White House to witness President Bush sign H.R. 9, the "Fannie Lou Hamer Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. The Voting Rights Act and its subsequent reauthorizations is one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress. It provides and protects the rights of Americans who have been discriminated against based on the color of their skin while trying to cast their ballot. 
   "It's a cause for which Americans - just decades ago- were willing to die," said Reid. "The struggle for civil rights and economic equality continues, and we must do everything we can to ensure all Americans are afforded the basic right to vote. I am honored to participate in this event with Congresswoman Shelly Berkley and a true pioneer for civil rights, Congressman John Lewis."
