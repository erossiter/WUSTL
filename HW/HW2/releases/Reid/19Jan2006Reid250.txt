SEN. REID CALLS FOR GREATER PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today announcing his support and sponsoring of the Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 to provide greater privacy security to American consumers: 
   "Over the last week we have seen reports of phone customers' proprietary information being made available for purchase online. Americans are rightfully outraged by the sale of their private information and the ease with which anyone with a credit card can gain access to it. Privacy rights are too important to be routinely squashed by swindlers looking to make a quick and easy buck. 
   "Attacking this problem requires a two-prong approach. First, those who have access to confidential information from consumers must abide by our laws designed to protect that information. That is why I sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission last week asking that they investigate whether wireless and landline phone companies are doing all they can to protect their customers' sensitive information, and whether any laws might have been broken. 
   "Second, we need to stop those who wrongly seek and acquire the protected confidential information of others and then offer it for sale. That is why I am sponsoring the Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006, which makes clear that those who are caught engaging in this conduct will be punished with stiff criminal sanctions. Calls made in Vegas should stay in Vegas. By getting tough on those who seek, acquire, and misuse sensitive and protected information, we will go a long way toward providing Americans with the security on their private information that they deserve."
