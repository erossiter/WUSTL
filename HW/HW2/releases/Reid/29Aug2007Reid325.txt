TWO YEARS AFTER KATRINA, DEMOCRATS CONTINUE WORK TO REBUILD GULF COAST
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today on the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall:
   "Today is a solemn day for the Gulf Coast and all of America as we mark the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. While some progress has been made in the region, there is still much more to do. Senate Democrats have made a strong commitment to the Gulf Coast region, authorizing and financing vital projects in the region and fighting to provide aid to hurricane victims despite obstacles imposed by the White House and executive branch agencies.
   "The Bush Administration's continuing efforts to hinder Gulf Coast recovery efforts are misguided. Rather than working to block an investigation into levee failures after Katrina and threatening to veto funding to both restore the Gulf Coast and strengthen Louisiana's levees, President Bush should back up his words and photo ops with real action to help the people of the Gulf Coast. We call on the President and Republicans will work with us to ensure the Gulf Coast has the necessary resources not only to rebuild, but to prevent a disaster such as this from occurring again."
