SEN. REID MEETS WITH STUDENTS FROM CLARK COUNTY
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met with Lyon Middle School students who visited Washington, D.C., to participate in the National History Day Contest. Students John Rockenbach and Autumn Higgins won the state competition for their documentary on nuclear weapons testing in Nevada, and Danielle Pray won for her performance entitled "A Confederate Spy."  
   "One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is getting to meet with young people from our state," said Reid. "I am thrilled to see these young scholars taking an active interest in subjects so relevant to Nevada's history. Their documentary and performance help history come alive."
   The National History Day program encourages educators to teach history in a more innovative manner. The program engages more than half a million participants in grades 6-12 through an annual competition in which students submit a project on a historical topic. The Clark County students are in D.C. to compete against students from other states in the National History Day Contest held each year at the University of Maryland.
