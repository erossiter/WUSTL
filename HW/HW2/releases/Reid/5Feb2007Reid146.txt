SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF BUSH'S FY 2008 BUDGET
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today released the following statement regarding President Bush's Budget. A fact sheet detailing the effects this budget would have of Nevada is attached.  
   "The president's budget is a reflection of his priorities. But with cuts to children's health care, Medicare, and homeland security funding, his priorities don't match those of Nevada. 
   "Rather than sending Congress a budget that strengthens homeland security, energy independence, education, affordable health care and fiscal discipline, the president proposes nearly a half-billion dollars for the nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain. The proposed dump is a project whose time has passed. As Majority Leader of the Senate, I promise the highest Congressional scrutiny for this waste of taxpayer dollars. 
   "Under the president's plan, more than 200,000 Nevada veterans could be hurt by funding shortfalls to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the president's Social Security privatization proposal, 239,000 Nevadans could see a cut in their retirement benefits. Most concerning - the president's budget slashes millions in funding for Nevada terrorism prevention and disaster response. 
   "My Democratic colleagues and I remain interested in working cooperatively with the president and congressional Republicans to address fiscal issues. We want to produce a budget that while making the investments in priorities that meet real needs of the middle class and our nation. Although the president's budget is disappointing, we have not given up hope that we will be able to work with our GOP colleagues to address the priorities of the American people in a fiscally responsible manner. I am calling on the president to develop better budget priorities."
