SEN. REID COMMENTS ON FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION INVESTIGATION INTO PRIVACY RIGHTS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the FCC's decision to investigate the sale of cell-phone users' private information:  
    "I am pleased to learn that after my request, the Federal Communications Commission has decided to open an investigation into whether telecommunications companies are doing enough to protect consumer information and how online data brokers are obtaining cell-phone user information. This action is a step in the right direction to ensure that private and sensitive information about consumers is protected. I hope that the FCC will remain committed to this critical issue until real solutions are proposed and implemented that will adequately protect Americans' privacy rights and ensure that private information is not sold online."
