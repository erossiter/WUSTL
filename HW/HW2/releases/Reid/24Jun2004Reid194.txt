SENS. REID, ENSIGN WIN MORE THAN $100 MILLION FOR NEVADA DEFENSE PROJECTS
  The U.S. Senate has given the green light to more than $100 million for national defense projects in Nevada. The Senate passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2005 tonight. Sens. Harry Reid (D-NV) and John Ensign (R-NV) worked to include a wide range of Nevada projects in the measure. 
   "Nevada has always been at the forefront of national defense," said Reid. "We have the best military bases in the country, and now we have some of the best high-tech research facilities as well. These projects will help protect our troops and our civilians. They'll keep Nevada and the entire country safer, and will help us win the war on terror."
   "These funds will allow to Nevada to continue to be one of the nation's leaders in military training and technology," Ensign said. "The men and women risking their lives for our nation deserve our full commitment, and funding for these important projects is part of living up to that commitment."
   The funding covers more than two dozen projects based in Nevada, including:
   * $8 million to Mask High Density Electronics
   A Henderson-based company is developing this project to help the military protect its computers, weapons systems, and troops from enemy detection. The high-tech system will mask the heat signals produced by electronics, so they won't be visible to enemy satellites or radar systems. 
   * $7 million for a Computer Automated Virtual Environment facility, or CAVE
   The Desert Research Institute is developing this virtual reality facility in Reno. CAVE uses computer technology to create three-dimensional simulations of other terrains. Military personnel can practice maneuvers in realistic settings before they deploy to combat locations. For instance, pilots can practice landing a helicopter in a sandstorm in the virtual-reality Iraqi desert, without risking their own safety or their helicopters. They could then deploy to Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East with a better idea of what to expect.
   * $2 million for Battle Field Blood Transfusion Technology
   A group of Nevada researchers is developing this system to make blood transfusions possible on the battlefield. Donated blood must be stored at 34 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can't be transplanted into a human body until it's close to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or it will cause hypothermia and shock. Hospitals use electric-powered equipment to heat blood for transfusions, but military medics often have to work in locations with no electricity. The Nevada team is developing battery-powered equipment to heat blood, which could make transfusions available to wounded troops on the front lines. The technology could also help civilian hospitals during blackouts or natural disasters when power supplies are interrupted.
   The bill also includes: 
   * $3 million in additional funding for the Nevada National Guard counter-drug program
   * $6 million for new research initiatives at the Hawthorne Army Depot
   * $2 million to support Nevada medical researchers working to improve the visual capabilities of air combat pilots
   * $7 million for the next generation of anti-terrorism communications and surveillance technology being developed in Nevada
   * $4 million for high-powered military flashlights made in Nevada. 
   The Department of Defense Appropriations bill will now go to a Senate/House Conference Committee.
