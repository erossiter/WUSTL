SEN. REID JOINS IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE
  Today, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada joins in recognition of the 65th anniversary of the National Day of Remembrance, commemorating the World War II internment of Japanese Americans.  
   February 19, 2007 marks 65 years since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced 120,000 Japanese American citizens and legal residents into internment camps during World War II solely based upon their Japanese descent. 
   "The exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans based on fear and hysteria marks a profound and shameful departure from our values as a nation " said Senator Reid " We must continue to remember this tragic time in our history to learn from our errors of the past, reaffirm our commitment to the protection of civil liberties and to ensure that we never walk the same path again." 
   As we reflect upon this day, we should also recognize the significant contributions of Japanese Americans to our nation and to Nevada, who from the earliest times, have shaped our country with hard work, great courage and hope.
