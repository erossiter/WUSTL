DEMOCRATS FIGHT FOR RURAL AMERICA IN ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Sen. Mark Dayton (D-MN), and Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO) today highlighted the many benefits for rural America Democrats successfully included in the Senate energy bill, and called for members of a joint House-Senate conference committee to maintain these important provisions in the final bill sent to the President. Among the biggest victories for rural America are key measures to substantially increase use of domestic biobased and renewable resources, giving an economic boost to rural America, and increasing clean, affordable, homegrown energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  
   "We have made important progress over the past two weeks to put America on the path towards energy independence to make America more secure, to strengthen our economy and to protect our environment," said Democratic Leader Harry Reid. "By relying more on energy made here in America, we have a great opportunity to strengthen the rural economy. I am pleased this bill takes the right steps in this direction." 
   "It's time Congress acts to make clean, affordable, home grown resources the centerpiece of our national energy policy," said Harkin. "It's a better deal for America's rural communities, national security, consumers, and environment when we increase renewable energy from the heartland. This bill makes great strides in that direction," 
   The Senate energy bill includes: 
   * A Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) of eight billion gallons per year, doubling the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the country by 2012. Harkin originally proposed this eight-billion gallon standard earlier this year. 
   * A Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) to expand production of wind energy 
   * A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to ensure that at least 10% of the nation's energy comes from renewable energy sources
  "Home grown, renewable fuel sources would not only help us curb our dependence on foreign oil imports, but they would provide new markets for our agriculture producers," Senator Blanche Lincoln said. "At this time of global insecurity, it's imperative that we do everything we can to make biofuels cost-competitive. To foster favorable market conditions for renewable fuels like biodiesel, we need market support and tax incentives."
  "As America's energy focus shifts from oil fields of the Persian Gulf to the corn, soybean, and wheat fields of America, this will be a major boost. It will mean new markets for our farmers, new opportunities for rural businesses, and tens of thousands of new jobs in the emerging bioeconomy," Harkin said. 
   "I would like to see an E-10 mandate, nationwide, by 2015 or even 2012. I think it's easily achievable and anyone who thinks that gas prices will go down by then is wrong. But, this bill is a step in the right direction. I commend the leaders on this legislation, particularly Senator Domenici and Bingaman. I just wish that it did more. America needs more," Dayton said.

   The Energy Bill and Rural America: What's at Stake? 
   Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) 
   The Senate version of the energy bill contains an eight billion gallon a year renewable fuels standard (RFS) to dramatically increase production of ethanol and biodiesel. The House version contains a five billion gallon RFS. The Senate's RFS will mean more jobs, less dependence on foreign oil and a more vibrant, prosperous rural economy. 
   An 8-billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard will: 
   * Create 200,000 new jobs in rural communities nationwide 
   * Increase rural household income $43 billion 
   * Add $200 billion to US Gross Domestic Product 
   * Replace two billion barrels of imported oil and save $64 billion on foreign oil spending 
   * Over 60 new ethanol and biodiesel plants nationwide (70% are cooperatively owned) 
   Each new ethanol plan will: 
   * Create 41 jobs at the plant 
   * Create 694 jobs throughout the local economy 
   * Increase the average local corn price by 5-10 cents a bushel 
   * Add $142 million to the local economy 
   Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) 
   While the House version does nothing to extend the wind energy Production Tax Credit, the Senate bill extends it for three and half additional years. Wind power currently only represents about .1% of energy production, but it is the fastest growing energy source in the United States. The growth of wind power depends on the federal Wind Energy Production Tax Credit. 
   Extending the Wind Energy Production Tax Credit indefinitely will: 
   * Create 80,000 new jobs 
   * Increase wind energy as a percent of national energy from .1% to 5% 
   * Generate $1.2 billion in additional farm income 
   * Result in $60 billion in capital investment, largely in rural America 
   * Lower natural gas, oil and coal costs, saving consumers throughout the nation 
   Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) 
   The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in the Senate Energy Bill commits the U.S. to getting ten percent of the nation's electricity come from clean, renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar power, and biomass. 
   The Renewable Portfolio Standard will: 
   * Generate $1.2 billion in rural income, including $430 million in lease payments for farmers and rural landowners 
   * Bring in $18 billion in investment in renewable energy 
   * Dramatically increase the US commitment to clean energy production.
