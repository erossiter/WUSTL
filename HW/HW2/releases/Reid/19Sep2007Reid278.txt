SEN. REID MEETS WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MUKASEY
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada met today with Judge Michael Mukasey, President Bush's nomination for the next U.S. Attorney General.  
   "I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to meet with Judge Mukasey today," said Reid. "I'm very impressed with his legal credentials. I understand the situation we find ourselves with the Justice Department needing repair and renovation. I look forward to the hearings with the Judiciary Committee. I feel this man has the ability to renovate the Justice Department. This is an important time in the history of our country. I think it's admirable that he's decided to take this job."
   During the meeting, Reid asked Mukasey to follow up on his request to create a federal Polygamy Task Force. Reid's goal is to fight child abuse and human servitude, which is often disguised in the mask of religious freedom by polygamists.
   Reid looks forward to confirming an Attorney General who can effectively fight crime and restore integrity to the Department of Justice. He will work with U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to ensure prompt and thorough hearings on the nomination of Mukasey as United States Attorney General.
