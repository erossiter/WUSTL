SEN. REID CUTS $104.5 MILLION FROM YUCCA BUDGET
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada announced today that in the negotiations over this year's final appropriations bill, he was successful in cutting an additional $54.5 million from the budget for the Yucca Mountain Project. This cut, combined with the previous $50 million Reid was able to cut earlier this year, brings this year's total Yucca Mountain budget cut to $104.5 million below the President's request and last year's level. 
   "While the Department of Energy continues to move forward with a flawed license application on a scientifically and environmentally unsound project, I am proud that I was successful in cutting $104.5 million from Yucca's Budget," said Reid. "It is clear that the Yucca Mountain Project is a dying beast and I hope that this cut in funding will help drive the final nail into its coffin."
