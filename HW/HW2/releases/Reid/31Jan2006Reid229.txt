SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON HEALTH OF SEN. ENSIGN
  "I called John Ensign's wife, Darlene, as soon as I heard about the car accident this morning, and offered to do everything I could to help make sure he gets the best care possible. I am relieved to hear that John's injuries, and his driver's injuries, are not life-threatening. I hope everyone involved in the accident heals quickly and gets out of the hospital soon."
