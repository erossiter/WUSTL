SEN. REID: PRESIDENT'S VETO WILL NOT DETER EFFORTS TO CHANGE COURSE IN IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement in response to President Bush's veto of the Emergency Supplemental conference report: 
   "The President may be content with keeping our troops mired in the middle of an open-ended civil war, but we are not; and neither are most Americans. 
   "A bipartisan majority of Congress sent the President a bill to fully fund our troops and change the mission in Iraq. The president refused to sign it. That is his right, but now he has an obligation to explain his plan to responsibly end this war. 
   "In the coming days we will continue to reach out to the President. And we hope Congressional Republicans who have remained silent through this debate will work with us as well. 
   "But if the President thinks that by vetoing this bill, he will stop us from working to change the direction of this war, he is mistaken."
