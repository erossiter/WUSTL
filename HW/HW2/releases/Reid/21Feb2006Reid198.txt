SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS MORE THAN RHETORIC ON ENERGY REFORM
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on President Bush's speech today on energy policy in Milwaukee.  
   "All Americans appreciate President Bush's apparent new commitment to changing our energy future and to ending our dependence on foreign oil, but we need more than just rhetoric from a president who let Big Oil write our energy policies. Now the president has offered a budget with much different priorities than his speeches, putting off green technologies and energy reform until 2030." 
   "America needs a major new initiative to end our dependence on foreign energy and to work for new energy efficient technologies, and Democrats are ready to work with the president if his new words match new actions. At a time when so many Americans are struggling with the cost of fueling their cars or heating their homes, America can do better than to sell our energy future to the oil companies."
