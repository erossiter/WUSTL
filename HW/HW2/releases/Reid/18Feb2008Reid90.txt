SEN. REID CALLS ON SENIOR DOE OFFICIAL TO LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT YUCCA MOUNTAIN
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid called on Ward Sproat, the Director of the proposed dump at Yucca Mountain, to level with the American people about the future of the dump. Sproat is scheduled to deliver an update of the dump's progress and priorities for 2008 on Monday in Washington, DC. 
   "I hope the Energy Department can find it within itself to actually shoot straight with the American people about the future of Yucca Mountain," said Reid. "The dump will never be built, especially after the devastating blow Congress dealt it last year when we cut its funding by $108 million. As support for the dump deteriorates among the nuclear industry and among its few cheerleaders in Congress, it could not be more clear that its days are numbered. The Energy Department should stop wasting taxpayer dollars and look at real solutions to the nation's nuclear waste challenges that don't put the lives of millions of Americans at risk by hauling it across the country."
