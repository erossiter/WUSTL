SEN. REID GETS VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EDWARDS' COMMITMENT TO STOP YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT
  In a conversation earlier this morning, Vice Presidential candidate John Edwards told Sen.  
 Harry Reid that he is fully committed to stopping the Yucca Mountain project. Edwards joins John Kerry's fierce opposition to a nuclear waste dump opening in Nevada. 
   Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "John Edwards supports John Kerry on all issues important to the people of Nevada, including Sen. Kerry's pledge to stop nuclear waste coming to Nevada. 
   "As a presidential candidate, we saw John Edwards' intellect, optimism and ability to connect with people from all walks of life. He is a self-made man whose success comes from hard work, perseverance and belief in the American dream. He has worked to strengthen the middle class by fighting for better health care, education and jobs. 
   "He brings these qualities with him to the ticket, and I look forward to an exciting few months and an ultimate Kerry/Edwards victory this November."
