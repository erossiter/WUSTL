SEN. REID SECURES $130 MILLION FOR FORECLOSURE COUNSELING
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid announced today that $130 million will be awarded to agencies in Nevada and around the nation to help individuals and families facing the threat of foreclosure. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 provided funds to NeighborWorks America and, through language included by Sen. Reid, instructed the organization to direct funds to areas with the highest rates of foreclosure, leading to increased funding for Nevada.  
  "The Silver State suffers from the highest rate of foreclosure in the country, and we're all feeling the effects," said Reid. "The funds that we were able to direct towards Nevada will have far reaching effects by allowing agencies to hire counselors to help with foreclosure prevention. By preventing more foreclosures, we're helping more families remain in their homes."
