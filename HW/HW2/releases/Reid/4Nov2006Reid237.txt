SEN. REID: MILITARY PAPERS ARE RIGHT; BUSH MUST FACE TRUTH, RUMSFELD MUST GO
  The following is a statement by Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid on calls by the Army Times, Air Force Times, Navy Times, and Marine Corps Times for Rumsfeld to resign.  
   "George Bush and his Republican Congress don't get it, but the military papers do. If we want to succeed in Iraq, we need a better policy than stay the course and we need better civilian leadership at the Pentagon. 
   "America's troops have done their part. President Bush and Congressional Republicans have not done theirs. Where they have failed, Democrats will force the White House to change course from chaos and get on the path to victory. It's the new direction America needs to keep our country safe."
