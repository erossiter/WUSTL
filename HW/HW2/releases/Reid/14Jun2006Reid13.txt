SEN. REID SAYS PRESIDENT STILL MUST OFFER A STRATEGY FOR IRAQ
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on President Bush's press conference on the war in Iraq. A fact check on President Bush is attached. 
   "I'm glad the President went to Iraq. It's good for our troops and the new Iraqi government. But in the fourth year of this war the American people are still waiting for the president to lay out a strategy that will stabilize Iraq, redeploy our troops, and refocus on threats that have been largely ignored by this Administration. Last year, the Congress called on the President to make 2006 a year of significant transition in Iraq and yet halfway through this year, the President is simply maintaining the same tired mantra, 'as Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.' Yet at the same time more Iraqi security forces are in the field, U.S. force levels have actually increased in recent weeks. This is not a real plan and is not acceptable. The President must take responsibility for laying out a strategy for stabilizing Iraq and bringing our troops home."
