SEN. REID, EDUCATION LEADERS MET TO DISCUSS IMPROVING EDUCATION FOR ALL NEVADANS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada met today with education leaders from the Clark County School District and higher education officials from Nevada's colleges and universities to discuss efforts to make college more affordable and accessible in Nevada. 
   "I am concerned that, because of stagnant federal aid and the increasing cost of college, higher education is becoming further out of reach for too many Nevadans," said Reid during the meeting. "I'm so pleased to see the strong support from our state's great education leaders who are working to keep the door open to college. I will continue doing all I can to make college more affordable."
   The group, which included financial aid administrators at Nevada colleges and universities and high school guidance counselors discussed the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, Pell Grants, the Nevada Millennium Scholarships, and student loans.
   One way Reid is working to make sure more Nevadans have access to higher education is through the College Opportunity Act of 2007, which he introduced this past January. The bill will expand Pell grants, make student loan payments more manageable, and provide permanent tax breaks for college tuition.
   In Nevada, nearly 44 percent of undergraduates have taken out loans to finance their college education. The average college graduate in Nevada has almost $13,000 in loan debt.
