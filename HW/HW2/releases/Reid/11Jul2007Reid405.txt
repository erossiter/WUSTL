SEN. REID: GROWING AL QAEDA THREAT UNDERSCORES NEED TO CHANGE IRAQ STRATEGY, REFOCUS BUSH ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS ON TERRORISM
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to press reports that U.S. intelligence analysts assess al Qaeda has rebuilt its operating capability to pre-Sept. 11 levels: 
   "Given President Bush's stubborn dedication to keeping our overextended military mired in an Iraqi civil war, it is not surprising that al Qaeda has been able to reorganize and rebuild. Democrats are continuing to fight to change course in Iraq so we can refocus our nation's efforts on a strategy to more effectively fight terrorism.
   "It is a travesty that Osama bin Laden remains at large nearly six years after the 9/11 attacks and appears to have found new sanctuary to operate freely in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. The Bush Administration and most Congressional Republicans would rather stubbornly stick with a flawed strategy and fight a war that senior military leaders say cannot be won militarily, than adapt to fighting the enemy who attacked us nearly six years ago. It is essential that we dedicate our resources and attention to al Qaeda and the real threat it poses."
