SEN. REID: REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTIONISM ENDANGERS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada today issued this statement following Republicans' blockage of the Intelligence Authorization Bill:  
   "Democrats are leading the fight to make America safer and support our troops. But the Republican minority has once again irresponsibly blocked the progress that the American people and a bipartisan majority in the Senate seek. 
   "Republicans today blocked a bill that would fund the CIA, FBI, NSA and other intelligence community agencies, combat terrorism, enhance our intelligence-collection capabilities, and strengthen intelligence oversight. This is a troubling pattern - Republicans have previously worked hard to prevent passage of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and legislation to fully fund our troops and change course in Iraq. 
   "While they talk tough on national security, Republicans' actions tell another story. Their obstructionism is endangering national security. Democrats will continue to fight to makes America more secure."
