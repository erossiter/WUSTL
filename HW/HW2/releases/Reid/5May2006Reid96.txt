SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF PORTER GOSS
  With the abrupt resignation of CIA Director Porter Goss, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement.  
   "Events in Iraq and elsewhere demonstrate that unbiased and accurate intelligence is critical to our national security. That's why it is essential that the President's next nominee for CIA Director be a non-partisan individual with strong national security and intelligence credentials. The men and women of the CIA are part of our front lines in the war on terror. They deserve a professional and dedicated Director who will ensure that America's intelligence is free from political pressure and who restores the CIA to the premier intelligence agency that it once had been."
