SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS ARE DELAYING 9/11 LEGISLATION TO AVOID DEBATE ON IRAQ
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today released the following statement on Senate Republicans' efforts to delay progress on implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission in an attempt to delay a debate on Iraq.  
   "Senate Republicans have stalled final passage of the 9-11 Bill in another attempt to delay debate on Iraq. At every turn, Republicans have slow walked this debate. Their effort to attach non-related measures to the 9/11 bill was a cynical ploy, that is not only a slap in the face to the families of 9/11 victims, but a signal that they care more about protecting the President than about heeding the calls of the American people to change course in Iraq. 
   "Senate Republicans have twice blocked debate on Iraq. This week we offered Republicans yet another opportunity to debate. Their response: We'll get back to you. The American people are waiting for answer. 
   "America is losing 20 soldiers a week and spending $280 million a day in Iraq. Democrats believe, as do our own commanders in the field, that this war must be won with a political not a solely military solution. Senate Republicans must decide: Will they work with us to bring stability to Iraq and our troops home from a civil war, or will they sit silent and endorse the President's failed policies? Democrats may be in the majority but this issue requires leadership from both sides of the aisle."
