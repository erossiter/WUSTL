SEN. REID: NEW WORLD BANK LEADERSHIP AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFOCUS ON INSTITUTION'S IMPORTANT MISSION
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to the White House's selection of Robert Zoellick to replace Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank: 
   "The selection of Robert Zoellick as the new president of the World Bank provides an opportunity for the Bank to return to its fundamental mission of alleviating poverty and offering vital aid to developing countries, a mission that no internal crisis should jeopardize. Under its new leadership, I hope the Bank will be able to refocus on helping millions of people around the world."
