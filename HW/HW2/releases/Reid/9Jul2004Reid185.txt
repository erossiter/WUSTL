COURT HANDS NV MAJOR VICTORY
  In a decision handed down today, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the people of Nevada in an argument to stop the Yucca Mountain project.  
 The state of Nevada sued the Department of Energy claiming a proposed nuclear waste repository would not be safe. The court decided that federal regulations are not stringent enough to protect the public from the significant risks associated with nuclear waste. 
   Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. John Ensign released the following statements today: 
   "Nevadans have won a huge victory today," Senator Reid said. "I've never believed Yucca Mountain would open, and today it could not be more clear that's true. The court's ruling is a significant blow to the Department of Energy and the Yucca Mountain project and I believe enough to effectively kill the project. There is a reason we have fought this project for more than two decades. It is impossible to open this kind of nuclear waste repository and still guarantee the health and safety of Nevadans." 
   "Today's court ruling provides Nevada a crucial legal tool to defeat the Yucca Mountain project once and for all," Sen. Ensign said. "Our state's legal team should be congratulated for this victory against all those forces that would like to turn Nevada into the country's nuclear dumping ground. Our united effort, in which Nevadans of all political affiliations joined, is the reason for this victory and our celebration today."
