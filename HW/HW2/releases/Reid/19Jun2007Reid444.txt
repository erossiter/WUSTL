SEN. REID: UNITED STATE REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO STAND WITH ISRAEL
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to the Capitol: 
   "We welcome the Prime Minister to the Capitol and we express our commitment to support the state of Israel - the same commitment we have made for nearly 60 years. As the Middle East explodes in violence, Israel is again caught in the middle. A proud democracy and our closest friend, Israel is surrounded on all sides by hostile activity. Israel is no stranger to hostile activity. It has defended itself bravely. While Israel faces threats from all sides, Prime Minister Olmert knows Israel has an ally in the United States. We look forward to having a serious dialogue about how to bring normalcy and stability to the Middle East and, most importantly, how to bring peace and security to our friends, the Israeli people."
