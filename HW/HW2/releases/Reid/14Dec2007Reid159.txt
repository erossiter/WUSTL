SEN. REID: PASSAGE OF FARM BILL OFFERS REAL RESULTS FOR NEVADA
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after the passage of the 2007 Farm Bill. 
   "The passage of the farm bill has far-reaching effects in Nevada. Not only does this bill protect rangeland in the Silver State and help develop rural communities it also delivers real results for Nevada's families. This legislation encourages investments in renewable energy ensures disadvantaged families can put food on their tables, and provides school children with fresh fruits and vegetables. I'm pleased we passed this important bipartisan legislation that will mean so much to our state."
   Items included in the Farm Bill are listed below.
    NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEVADA'S PRODUCERS 
   * $426 million in grants to invest in specialty crops, allowing for the enhancement of business opportunities for Nevada grown agriculture. 
   ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
   * $230 million provided for expanding the development of farm-based energy through Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (REAP) grants and loans. This expanded program makes it easier for farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses to improve their use of clean energy. 
   * $40 million included for technical assistance and microloans for rural entrepreneurs. 
   * $50 million provided for rural hospitals so fewer Nevadans have to travel for medical treatment. 
   * $40 million to invest in rural day care facilities. 
    PROTECTING NEVADA'S RANGELANDS AND LAKES
   * The 2007 Farm Bill follows Nevada's example of how conservation has preserved the American landscape and invests more than $4 billion in new money, over ten years, for conservation. 
   * $200 million to reauthorize the Desert Terminal Lakes Program for Nevada's Pyramid, Summit and Walker Lakes. 
   * Increased funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to address unmet needs of farmers and ranchers across the country. This program will focus more on the environmental health of rangeland and wildfire presuppression efforts. 
   * Ranchers will now be able to access permanent disaster assistance for losses caused by drought or wildfire. 
    COMMITMENT TO NUTRITION
   * More than $4 billion in new funding to go toward feeding families and the elderly through expanded food assistance programs. 
   * $1 billion in funding for the Fresh Fruits and Vegetable Program, a program aimed at increasing health and wellness of children through the improvement of school lunch programs. This program, currently limited to only 14 states, will be expanded to all 50 states and will help schools offer their students nutritious food choices.
