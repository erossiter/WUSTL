SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE PASSAGE OF HARDROCK MINING REFORM LEGISLATION
  For the third time since enactment of the Mining Law of 1872, the House of Representatives today approved legislation to reform the law that governs hardrock mining on public lands. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada testified earlier this year at a Congressional field hearing in Elko about the importance of developing a modern National Minerals Policy that protects and strengthens Nevada's mining communities. 
   "Today the House of Representatives, led by Chairman Rahall and Chairman Costa, laid down a marker on mining policy," said Reid, a native of the hardrock mining camp of Searchlight, Nevada. "I am pleased to be working with Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici on legislation that will provide a constructive counterpoint to the Rahall-Costa bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the Senate and House who care about mining, public lands and rural America to provide a new vision for industry and conservation in the West. While I cannot support many of the provisions in the House bill, I believe that the opportunity still exists for common sense reform. It is in no one's interest to leave the regulation of this important industry to the whims of each passing Administration, as is the case today. When Congress succeeds in this challenge, communities like Elko, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain, and Ely, Nevada will have a much brighter and more certain future."
