SEN. REID COMMITS TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today: 
   "President Bush has a lot of new Social Security rhetoric, but the facts remain the same.  
 His risky privatization scheme is an assault on middle-class seniors and would mean deep benefit cuts even for those who choose not to risk their money in private accounts. It also would add $5 trillion in new debt, much of which would have to be borrowed from foreign countries like China and Saudi Arabia. 
   "The president likes to take credit for bringing the Social Security's long term challenges to the forefront. Yet his solution is worse than the problem. In fact, under his plan, many middle-class seniors would do worse than if Congress did absolutely nothing. 
   "The President and Democrats simply have different goals. The President wants to replace Social Security with a privatized program and cut middle class benefits. Democrats' goal is to strengthen the program and protect benefits as much as possible. 
   "Democrats are eager to work with the President and Congressional Republicans to find bipartisan solutions to the long term challenges facing Social Security. However, as long as Republicans insist on a risky privatization plan that makes deep cuts in benefits and adds massive new debt, we're going to stand on the side of hardworking Americans who shouldn't have the guaranteed benefits they earned replaced by risky private accounts."
