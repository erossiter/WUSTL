SEN. REID, NEVADANS CALL FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) will join minimum wage workers, small business representatives, and leaders of Nevada's labor unions to call for an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Nevadans voted to raise the state minimum wage in the last election, and that initiative is on the ballot again. The measure needs to pass a second time this November to go into effect.
   Reid is also working to raise the federal minimum wage for working families in Nevada and around the country. 
   The federal minimum wage was last increased in 1997. Reid has vowed to block any pay raise for members of Congress until they agree to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 and hour. 
   Reid will be joined at tomorrow's news conference by Danny Thompson of the Nevada State AFL-CIO and Donovan Chambers of the Nevada Small Business Alliance. He'll also be joined by two students at the Culinary Training Institute, Shawnta Young and Maria Rojo, who worked at minimum wage jobs until recently.
