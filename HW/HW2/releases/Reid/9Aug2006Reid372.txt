SEN. REID: BUSH SHOULD TAKE ACTION NOW TO EASE OIL SUPPLY CRUNCH
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement calling on President Bush to take swift action to ease the strain on oil markets caused by British Petroleum's pipeline shutdown in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska:  
   "After months of doing little to nothing to address the record high gasoline prices Americans are paying all across the country, the Bush administration seems poised to once again sit on their hands during a major oil supply disruption. I urge President Bush to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to offset the disruption in supply caused by the shutdown of production in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. 
   "This current supply disruption provides even further evidence of how urgent the need is to change our nation's energy policy. For far too long, President Bush and the Republican Congress' leadership have taken us in the wrong direction resulting in greater dependence on foreign oil and higher prices at the pump. Democrats are offering a new direction with our Clean EDGE Act that will expand the use of renewable and alternative fuels, provide relief from high prices and put American firmly on the path towards energy independence."
