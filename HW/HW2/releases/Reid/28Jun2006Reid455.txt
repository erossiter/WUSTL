SEN. REID DEMANDS CONGRESS RAISE MINIMUM WAGE FOR NEVADA WORKERS
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) vowed today that Congress won't get a raise until it approves a raise for workers in Nevada and across America. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Reid said he will vote against any pay raise for members of Congress until lawmakers act to raise the minimum wage to $7.50 and hour. 
   "Raising the minimum wage would help 56,000 Nevadans," said Reid. "Hardworking Nevadans deserve a wage that lets them pay their bills and take care of their families. So this year, there will be no raise for Congress until there's a raise for America's workers." 
   The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 1997. Since that time, members of Congress have granted themselves $31,600 in pay raises.
   "This is a matter of fairness," said Reid. "The work of minimum wage workers in Nevada is just as valuable as the work of Congress. I think Congress should earn its raise by putting America's workers first."
