SEN. REID CELEBRATES NEVADA DAY
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada issued the following statement in recognition of Nevada Day: 
   "With Nevada Day upon us, we should reflect on our great heritage, and note the tremendous accomplishments and successes of our state. Nevada became a state 143 years ago in 1864, at a time when the country was divided by bitter conflict. Born into the chaos of the Civil War, Nevada proved herself a patriot. Since then, the people of Nevada have time and time again shown patriotism in their actions, their sacrifices and their celebrations. 
   "Many outsiders once viewed Nevada as just a stop along the road on the way to California; today, Nevada has become the destination. Where once there was just a railroad stop, there is now a shining city of nearly 2 million people. Where once there was just a vast swath of desert, solar and geothermal energy plants dot the landscape, with many more on the way. 2.5 million people now live in Nevada, and thousands more come every month, seeking opportunity, natural beauty and the better quality of life for which Nevada has become famous. 
   "Nevadans, past and present, have made the Battle Born State what it is today. This Nevada Day, let's take a moment to reflect on how wonderful Nevada truly is, honor our rich history and heritage, and look forward to Nevada's bright future."
