SEN. REID LAUNCHES NEW, IMPROVED WEBSITE
  Providing Nevadans with valuable information about issues that affect their lives, Sen.  
 Harry Reid launched his new, revamped website today.
   Reid's site was a 2003 winner of the Congress Online Gold Mouse Award, which recognizes the best websites in Congress. It is now better than ever with more easily navigable homepage and focused content. 
   "Since I can't be in Nevada as often as I would like, my website lets Nevadans see the work I am doing in Washington, D.C. and how it touches their lives," said Reid. "I'm using this new technology to stay in touch with Nevadans, and I hope Nevadans will use it to stay informed about issues like health care and education."
