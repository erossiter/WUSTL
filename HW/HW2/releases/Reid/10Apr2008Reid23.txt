SENS. ENSIGN, REID ANNOUNCE SENATE PASSAGE OF SOUTHERN NEVADA READINESS CENTER ACT
  Legislation sponsored by Senators John Ensign and Harry Reid that would convey land from Clark County to be used by the Nevada National Guard for important national defense and security purposes passed the Senate today. 
   "The Las Vegas Readiness Center and the surrounding area will help prepare our soldiers, both physically and technically, to respond to the missions of the Governor of Nevada and the President of the United States," Ensign said. "The men and women of the Nevada National Guard are an extraordinary group, and we need to do all we can to support them and enable them to do their jobs."
   The Southern Nevada Readiness Center Act would allow Clark County, Nevada, to convey land to the Nevada Division of State Lands for use by the Nevada National Guard. The National Guard currently has an 80,000-square-foot facility on the proposed land and will use the surrounding area for expansion of vehicle maintenance facilities and emergency response support to First Responders in weapons of mass destruction situations. The land will also provide a site for the future Civil Support Team Ready Building.
   "This is important legislation because without it, Clark County would have to charge the National Guard hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent each year," said Reid. "Instead of using their resources to pay for rent, the Nevada Army Guard can concentrate on protecting Nevada and training for the global war on terror. These facilities will provide a location for approximately 430 soldiers in signal, medical, engineer and maintenance units."
   The Southern Nevada Readiness Center Act was included in the omnibus lands bill, S. 2739, that passed the Senate today. Congressman Jon Porter led the effort in the House of Representatives by sponsoring companion legislation that passed last year.
