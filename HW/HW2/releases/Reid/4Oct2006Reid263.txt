SEN. REID: NEVADA'S WORKERS MUST BE PROTECTED
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after the National Labor Relations Board handed down a 3-2 party-line decision that will severely limit the legal rights of a large percentage of working Nevadans, including tens of thousands of Nevada health care workers. The ruling will reclassify shift workers as supervisors, thereby eliminating the ability of thousands to join a union so they can bargain collectively for better wages, health care and retirement benefits.  
   "From raising taxes on the middle class to this latest blow to working Nevadans, the Bush Administration and its appointees have led a continuous assault against America's middle class. As Nevada's Senior Senator and the Democratic Leader, I'll work to overturn anti-worker decisions of the NLRB when the new Congress convenes in January, so the rights of our state's families are protected."
