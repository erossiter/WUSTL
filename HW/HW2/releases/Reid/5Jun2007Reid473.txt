SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. THOMAS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in recognition of Sen. Craig Thomas, who died Monday night: 
   "Craig Thomas was an honorable public servant and a proud Marine who worked tirelessly for the people of Wyoming. He fought hard for the causes in which he believed. 
   "We hear it often said that the Senate is a family, and it is at times such as this we truly come together as one. We are a very small family of 100, but today we are just 99. Our thoughts and prayers are with Senator Thomas's wife, Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg; his daughter, Lexie; and with the people of Wyoming."
