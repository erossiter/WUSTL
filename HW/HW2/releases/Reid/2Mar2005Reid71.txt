SEN. REID'S STATEMENT ON NEED TO PASS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement in response to the Republican poverty agenda that was unveiled earlier today.  
 Reid concentrated on the need to pass a minimum wage increase: 
   "My Republicans colleagues will have to excuse my skepticism today. 
   While I am heartened to see Republicans talk about the issue of poverty, I find it difficult to believe that a Party that stubbornly pushes tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and gives out special interest favors hand over fist will undertake any meaningful efforts on behalf of our nation's working poor. 
   However, if they are serious about doing something on poverty, I call on them to join with Senate Democrats to finally pass an increase in the minimum wage. 
   The best anti-poverty program is a good paying job, and Congress has it in its power TODAY to ensure hardworking Americans get a decent day's wage for a hard day's work. 
   Three times in the last Congress the Republican leadership brought down a minimum wage bill rather than let us have an up or down vote. 
   If Republicans are serious about combating poverty - as they have insisted today, I call on them to reverse this course and let's get to work on raising the minimum wage."
