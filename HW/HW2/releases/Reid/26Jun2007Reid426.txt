SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS AGAIN BLOCK EFFORTS TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER, CLEAN UP WASHINGTON
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after Senate Republicans blocked Democrats' efforts to send the 9/11 Commission recommendations and the ethics and lobbying reform to conference. Attached are Reid's remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
   Democrats have been working hard to pass critical legislation despite efforts by some Republican Senators to slow down or stop our progress. Whether the issue is immigration reform, implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations or instituting new ethics reforms to clean up Washington, the American people are counting on Republican Senators to help us lead the way, not stand in the way. Every day Republicans delay is another day we are not as safe as we should be. Every day Republicans delay, they are endorsing the status quo on ethics. Republicans need to stop wasting time - the American people's time."
