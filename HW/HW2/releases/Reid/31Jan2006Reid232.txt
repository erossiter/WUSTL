SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING, REAUTHORIZING PATRIOT ACT
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the reauthorization of provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act:  
   "This Friday, a small number of provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act are due to expire. Congress is already working to make sure that doesn't happen. Work is underway on another 6-week extension, and Senate Democrats stand ready to provide law enforcement with all necessary tools to keep Americans safe from terrorism." "Democrats supported the original Patriot Act that passed in 2001, we supported the reauthorization bill that passed the Senate unanimously last summer, and we support reauthorization of the Patriot Act now with modest improvements. We must give government the tools it needs to fight the terrorists, but the checks we need to stop it from abusing its powers" "Democrats are committed to protecting Americans from terrorism. We do not want the Patriot Act to expire, and there is no reason that it should."
