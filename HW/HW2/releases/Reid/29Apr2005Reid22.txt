   The text of Senator Reid's actuality follows: 
   Democrats are disappointed to see the President's Social Security tour end. Because the more the President talks about his misleading privatization plan, the more the American people learn what a bad deal it is. 
   Democrats are committed to strengthening Social Security, not privatizing it. President Bush could talk about privatization for another 60 years, but it will not change the fact that his plan makes deep cuts in middle-class benefits and adds 5 trillion dollars in debt, borrowed largely from foreign countries like China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. 
   In recent years, Republicans have taken your Social Security money and used it for handouts to special interests and the wealthiest among us. In his White House press conference, the President said, in effect, that he won't pay the money back. Instead, he would make deep cuts in the benefits seniors worked hard to earn. That's wrong.
