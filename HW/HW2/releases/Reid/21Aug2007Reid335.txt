SEN. REID: PRESIDENT BUSH'S COMPARISON OF IRAQ TO CONFLICTS IN EAST ASIA MISSES MARK
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, in advance of President Bush's planned speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention tomorrow morning.  
   "President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall."
