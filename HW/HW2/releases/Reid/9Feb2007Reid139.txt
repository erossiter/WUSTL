SEN. REID: BUSH'S BUDGET FAILS RURAL NEVADA
  In his continued work to champion rural issues, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada spoke about the harmful effects President Bush's proposed budget could have on Nevada's rural communities.

   "The president's budget is a reflection of the president's priorities and values and this budget makes it clear that President Bush's priorities are not in line with those of Nevada's rural communities," said Reid. 
   While the budget proposal includes numerous cuts that could be harmful to Nevada, Reid is particularly concerned about proposed cuts to the Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program. 
   "Growing up in the little town of Searchlight, Nevada, taught me the values and needs of rural Nevada," said Reid. "I'm disappointed but not surprised that the proposed budget slashes funding from the PILT program. Because nearly 90 percent of Nevada land is federally owned, our rural communities are unable to collect property taxes to pay for vital services including law enforcement and medical services. PILT payments help cover those costs. Make no mistake, the president has delivered quite a blow to rural communities across the country and in Nevada." 
   Under the President's annual budget proposal, which was submitted to Congress earlier this week, funding for PILT would be cut for the fourth year in a row, from $233 million to $190 million in FY 2008, a cut of $43 million. PILT funds help all 17 Nevada counties compensate for losses to their tax base that result from federal land ownership. These funds help local governments carry out vital services including search and rescue, law enforcement, and construction of public schools and roads. 
   Reid added, "PILT is extremely important for rural Nevada. Without adequate funding of this program, crucial roads to and from our small communities are not maintained and the quality of our student's education is lowered. I will continue fighting to ensure that rural Nevada's priorities are addressed and that they get the necessary funding they deserve."
