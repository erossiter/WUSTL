SEN. REID WINS MORE THAN $70 MILLION FOR NEVADA TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Harry Reid has set aside approximately $71 million in the federal budget for transportation projects across the state of Nevada.  
 The funding is part of the Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report. 
   "These projects will make travel safer and easier all across Nevada," said Reid. "This funding will help us develop public transportation systems and fix highways, which will cut down on traffic jams and air pollution. We'll improve our airports and keep working on the Hoover Dam Bypass project, which will help visitors come to our great state and contribute to our economy." 
   The money in the bill will be used for new traffic control towers at Nevada's two major airports, highway improvements, bus and rail service, and driver safety programs, among other projects. A few examples are listed below: 
   $10 million for work on the Hoover Dam Bypass project
