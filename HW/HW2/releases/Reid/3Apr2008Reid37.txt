SEN. REID JOINS BIPARTISAN GROUP OF LEADERS THIS WEEK IN CONGRESSIONAL CEREMONY TO CELEBRATE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid joined a bipartisan group of leaders this week in a congressional ceremony to celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Friday marks the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King. "Dr. King taught us that dreams have power -- and that dreams coupled with action have the power to change the world," said Senator Reid. 
   Reid added, "In Dr. King's memory, we must not be silent about the things that matter to this generation. It is not enough to honor him with speeches, tributes or ceremonies alone. He would be the first to tell us this. Our responsibility is to continue his dream - with courage and hard work - so that we can, as he said, "make our old world a new world."
