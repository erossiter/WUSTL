SEN. REID: AMERICA NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's speech on immigration reform today in New Mexico. 
   "President Bush has made an important step by engaging on immigration reform. Unfortunately, a photo-op in New Mexico won't make Republicans in Washington, D.C. support comprehensive reform. Just yesterday, Senate Republicans blocked the Senate's own bipartisan comprehensive reform plan from moving forward in Congress. After years of Bush Republican incompetence, our borders are unsecured and our immigration system is broken. The Senate took a major step toward fixing our immigration system. Now the president must convince his party to enact the comprehensive immigration reform our nation deserves."
