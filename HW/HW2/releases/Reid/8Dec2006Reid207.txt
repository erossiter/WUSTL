SENS. REID, MCCONNELL ANNOUNCE JOINT CAUCUS TO START 110TH CONGRESS
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and incoming Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell today announced that the Democrats and Republicans will open the Senate in the 110th Congress with a joint caucus meeting. The joint conference will allow Senators an opportunity to meet before the Senate is in session and before any official legislative business is considered. The American people made clear they are tired of partisanship and gridlock in Washington. Democrats and Republicans are ready to work together right from the start of the 110th Congress and are committed to moving America forward.  
 "Americans made clear a month ago that they want Washington to start working for their interests, not political interests," said Senator Reid. "To do that, we must work together and across party lines to move this country forward. We won't always agree, but can sit down, side by side, and forge consensus on the issues important to the American people. I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to establish a new tone and to produce real results next year, and this joint caucus is the first step in that process." 
 "Sen. Reid and I have had a number of conversations over the past two weeks about how we can work together to create a condition favorable to bipartisan accomplishment," said Senator McConnell. "Senate Republicans intend to be as cooperative as possible to help the Senate get off to a good start next year. We won't agree on every single issue, but that shouldn't stop us from working constructively on the big issues facing America." 
 To be held on January 4th, the bipartisan meeting will take place in the Old Senate Chamber, the first such joint meeting since impeachment. It stands in significant contrast to the partisan rancor of that period and marks the beginning of a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation in the United States Senate.
