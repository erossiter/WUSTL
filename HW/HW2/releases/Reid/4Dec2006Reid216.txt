SEN. REID: CHANCE FOR CHANGE AT UNITED NATIONS
Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement on news that John Bolton will step down in January at the end of his commission as U.N. Ambassador. 
 "President Bush has made the right decision in accepting Ambassador Bolton's resignation. Hopefully this change marks a shift from the failed go-it-alone strategies that have left America less safe. President Bush should now nominate a UN Ambassador who is ready and willing to work with our allies around the world, and who understands the pressing need to change course in Iraq."
