SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI GOVERNMENT AMNESTY PROPOSAL
  "Despite having received two credible reports that the Iraqi government is actively considering giving amnesty to those who kill American soldiers, President Bush and the Republican Congress have refused to join with Senate Democrats to denounce this terrible policy, proposing instead that we 'respect Iraqi sovereignty'.
   "We call upon President Bush and Republican leaders to join with us immediately to send a clear and unmistakable signal to the Iraqi government that we strongly oppose any effort to provide a get out of jail free card to those who kill or injure our brave troops."
