SEN. REID WELCOMES NOMINATION FOR NEW NEVADA U.S. ATTORNEY
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after President Bush nominated Greg Brower to be the United States Attorney for Nevada: 
   "I welcome Greg Brower's nomination to be the new United States Attorney for Nevada. Greg has strong roots in our state and has wide-ranging experience in the military, in elected office and as a prosecutor. He has big shoes to fill - our previous U.S. Attorney Dan Bogden did an outstanding job and was treated very unfairly by the current Administration. Greg Brower will play an important role in restoring the confidence of Nevadans in the Department of Justice."
