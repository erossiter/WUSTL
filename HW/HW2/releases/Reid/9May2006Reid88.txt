SEN. REID: BUSH REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN TAKES THE COUNTRY IN WRONG DIRECTION
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on the Bush Republican tax plan that will put multi-millionaires ahead of middle-class families: 
   "Bush's tax plan offers next to nothing to average Americans while giving away the store to multi-millionaires. The tax reconciliation bill giveaway on capital gains and dividends will do much more for ExxonMobil board members than it will do for ExxonMobil customers. Their tax plan takes the country in the wrong direction."
