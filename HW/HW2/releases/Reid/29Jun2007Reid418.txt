SEN. REID LEADS CONGRESS IN NEW DIRECTION
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada today reflected on the Democratic-led Congress's accomplishments in the six months since assuming the majority. 
   At a press conference with other members of Senate and House leadership Reid discussed that fact that despite Republican roadblocks at every turn, Reid is leading this Congress in delivering on promises to move America forward. Under Senator Reid's leadership, the 110th Congress is delivering on Nevada's priorities -cutting taxes, lowering energy prices, making our country safer, strengthening Nevada families, and preserving the planet.
   "Democrats have made great progress in addressing America's priorities and tackling problems this Administration and past Republican Congresses have ignored," Reid said. "We have much to be proud of from the first half of the year, and we have even more to do as we enter the second. As the leader, I'm working hard to make sure I deliver results on the issues Nevadans care about. Nevada has always been my top priority and it will remain on the top of the list. In the coming weeks, I will lead the senate in continuing to force a change of course in Iraq until the President and Congressional Republicans finally heed the advice of military experts, respect the will of the American people, and join us in bringing the war to a successful and responsible end. Neither our troops nor the American people can afford to wait until September for a new strategy."
   Both the House and Senate have passed the bipartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations and tough ethics and lobbying reform, while also raising the minimum wage and balancing the budget. Yesterday Republicans once again objected to making our country safer and cleaning up Washington by blocking Democratic efforts to move the 9/11 Commission recommendations and ethics reform bills to a conference committee that would produce a bill for President Bush to sign.
