SEN. REID: AMERICANS REJECT BUSH'S FAILED POLICIES ON IRAQ
  Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Harry Reid today spoke out against the President's failed leadership on Iraq.  
   "The President's stump speech gets more and more desperate by the day. It's clear that he has his back up against the wall with the upcoming election, and for good reason. The American people are rejecting his failed policies in Iraq and the war on terror, and are looking for a new direction. Instead of lashing out on the campaign trail, the President should be reaching out for a new policy in Iraq, where our troops are caught in the middle of a civil war. If we want a new direction, it is clear we need new congressional leadership who will stand up to this President and demand a new way forward. Republicans haven't done it. Democrats will."
