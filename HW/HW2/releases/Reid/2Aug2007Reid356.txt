SEN. REID: SENATE LEADERSHIP WILL WORK TO SECURE EMERGENCY FUNDS FOR MINNEAPOLIS BRIDGE TRAGEDY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, pledging to help secure emergency funds for Minneapolis following Wednesday's tragic bridge collapse. Under the Emergency Relief highway program, states can receive assistance for the repair or reconstruction of highways and roads that have suffered serious damage as a result of disasters of this nature. States are eligible to receive up to $100 million in emergency relief funds per year, but Congress can expand funding beyond $100 million with special legislation. All relief construction within the first 180 days of the disaster is covered by the Federal government, and covered 90 percent by federal payments thereafter. 
   "The Senate Leadership stands together with Senator Amy Klobuchar and the entire Minnesota delegation, and will help Minneapolis get everything it needs in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedy. I spoke today with Senator Klobuchar, heard her firsthand accounts of the situation on the ground, and gave her my commitment to work with her to authorize $250 million in funding to repair the bridge - including exempting recovery costs from beyond the $100 million cap for Federal Highway relief efforts. The House has identical legislation which I believe they will attempt to pass tonight. I intend to seek consent to move to this legislation when it arrives on the Senate side."
