SEN. REID GREETS RESIDENTS AT CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada visited residents from the Center for Independent Living, a sanctuary for homeless youth, and spoke to them about the importance of an education.  
   "I grew up in a small town called Searchlight. We didn't have a lot of money and my parents never had a high school education. Life was tough growing up," Reid told the teens. "But I'm here today to tell you that you can reach any goal. Never forget the importance of strong mentors in your life and the value of an education." 
   The Center for Independent Living is a residential facility for at-risk youth aged 16 to 21, that provides adolescents with an environment to grow and develop independent living skills in a structured, supervised setting. With help from the staff, residents at the Center work towards completing their high-school diploma and learn skills to help them enter the work force. The Center also assists homeless youth with job placement and mentoring. 
   Before speaking with the residents, Thomas Kelly, Program Director of the Center and Carrie Seymour, an 18 year old resident, led Reid on a tour of the residential facility which included a stop in a classroom, outdoor recreational area, and a live in studio apartment. 
   "Senator Reid's message to our youth about personal accountability, a sense of community, overcoming life's obstacles and having a spiritual center was refreshing and timely," said Kelly. "Overall his words of encouragement touched the hearts of our staff and our homeless teens." 
   During the visit, Reid delivered a gift basket to the Center and stressed the need for people to give generously to smaller, local charities who may be forgotten during the holidays.
