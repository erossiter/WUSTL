SEN. REID: RISING OIL COSTS HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR STRONGER ENERGY POLICY
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to reports that oil futures prices rose today to a record $80 a barrel: 
   "Oil prices rose to a record $80 a barrel today, again underscoring how vital it is that we lower energy costs, cut oil consumption and make America more energy independent. Democrats are working to do just that while Republicans continue to pander to big oil companies.
   "We hope President Bush and Senate Republicans will join us in our efforts to strengthen our national security, protect the environment and lower gas prices through sound fixes to our nation's broken energy policy."
