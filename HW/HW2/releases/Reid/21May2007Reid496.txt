SEN. REID: PRESIDENT MUST LISTEN TO WILL OF AMERICAN PEOPLE, IMPLEMENT IRAQ STUDY GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid made the following statement today in response to a Washington Post story that reported "an evolution in administration attitudes toward" the Iraq Study Group report: 
   "Six months ago, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group called the situation in Iraq 'grave and deteriorating,' an assessment that is just as true today. Since January, a bipartisan majority of Congress has worked to implement their recommendations. The President has opposed these efforts at every step, refusing to change course in and bring accountability to Iraq, let the Iraqis take responsibility for their own nation, and redeploy American troops from an intractable civil war.
   "It is long past time for the President to take seriously the recommendations of bipartisan experts of the Iraq Study Group, the will of the American people and the bipartisan efforts in Congress to bring this war to a war to a successful and responsible end."
