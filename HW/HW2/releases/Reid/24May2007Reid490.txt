SEN. REID: PRESIDENT'S PLAN 'B' HAS BEEN AMERICA'S PLAN 'A'
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks this morning: 
   "The President continues to mismanage and mischaracterize this war. His refusal to recognize the reality on the ground is evident in his continuing misrepresentation that his Iraq war strategy is a response to 9/11 and helps us defeat terrorism. In fact, it is his failed conduct of the war that has turned Iraq into a training ground and recruiting poster for a new generation of terrorists.
   "While we are glad the President has started to acknowledge the value of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group as a 'Plan B,' this has been 'Plan A' for Democrats, military experts and the American people since before the report came out in December. Republicans' increasing support for timetables and benchmarks demonstrates we have made some progress. But Democrats also know we must continue to press more of our Republican colleagues to work with us at every opportunity if we are to bring this war to a successful and responsible end."
