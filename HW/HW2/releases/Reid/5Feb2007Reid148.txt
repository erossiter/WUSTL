SEN. REID ANNOUNCES NEW EFFORT TO HELP NEVADA TEST SITE WORKERS
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada announced a petition that will put Nevada Test Site workers, who contracted cancer from their work during the under-ground nuclear tests, one step closer to receiving the compensation they deserve. 
   The goal of this petition is to increase the number of former Test Site workers who receive Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) designation. The SEC is a legal designation that simplifies and expedites the compensation process for workers within the cohort. Currently, only people who worked at the site for 250 days or more between 1951 and 1962 fall in this category. That represents only about a third of all claimants.  
   Reid's goal is to expand the SEC designation to all Test Site workers who may have been put in harm's way between 1951 and 1993. 
   "This is the right thing to do for Nevada Test Site Workers who have become ill as a result of their work," said Reid. "These are atomic energy veterans who deserve nothing but the best in return for the contributions they made to protect our country. I look forward to the day when I can announce that they and their families will receive the compensation they truly deserve." 
   There are two ways to become part of an SEC. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) can initiate the SEC process or an SEC can be established through legislation. NIOSH initiated an SEC for workers present at NTS before 1963 as a result of a letter Reid wrote to President Bush in November of 2005. This SEC was passed by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health in May of 2006 and went into effect on July 26, 2006. The current SEC covers Nevada Test Site workers who were employed there from 1951-1962 for at least 250 days. This affected approximately one-third of all claimants. Reid submitted legislation last Congress, but was unsuccessful in an attempt to attach it as an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. Reid will begin work on updated legislation for the 110th Congress. 
   The petition signed by former workers, Paul Stednick and Peter White, and Lori Hunton, daughter of a former worker, will cover employees of the Department of Energy (DOE) or any DOE contractors or subcontractors who were: 
   * Present during an underground nuclear test and/or performed drill backs, re-entry, or clean up work following such test at the Nevada Test Site (NTS);
   * Present at an event involving the venting of an underground test at NTS or at other events where there was an uncontrolled episodic radiation release;
   * Present for tests or post test activities related to the Nuclear Rocket Testing Program;
   * Assigned to work in Area 51 (or other classified program areas);
   * Employed at NTS in a job activity that was monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation or worked in a job activity that is or was comparable to a job that is, was or should have been monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation at NTS, during the period from January 1, 1963 through September 30, 1992, or in combination with work days with the parameters established for one or more other classes of employees in the SEC.
   The U.S. held 100 above-ground nuclear tests and 828 underground tests at the site between 1951 an 1993 - when the below ground nuclear tests stopped. Many people at the Test Site worked with significant amounts of radioactive materials without knowledge of the risks. Some of those workers have been waiting for decades for the government to acknowledge the sacrifices they made for their country. Many have been waiting for compensation while they suffer from life-threatening cancers, and others have already died.
