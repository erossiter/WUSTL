SENS. REID, ENSIGN WORK TO SPUR HENDERSON ECONOMY
  Working to create jobs and spur economic growth in Henderson, Nevada Sens.  
 Harry Reid and John Ensign introduced legislation today to develop an employment and business center. 
   The Southern Nevada Limited Transition Area Act would convey 547 acres of land from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to the City of Henderson. 
   "Henderson is growing rapidly and its economy must adapt to changing conditions," Reid said. "This project will help the city's leaders realize their vision of planned development and more diversified employment." 
   "As Henderson is one of the up and coming cities in the country, this pro-growth legislation will assist Henderson officials in their ongoing mission to strengthen and diversify the city's economy," said Ensign. "I am pleased that this development will help the local economy and its well-being." 
   The BLM has designated land, located adjacent to the Henderson Executive Airport, for disposal because of urban surroundings and isolation from other public land make it difficult for the agency to manage. Aircraft noise and overfllights from the nearby airport make the land unsuitable for residential use. 
   The city would subdivide and sell lots at fair market value. As was established in the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, eighty-five percent of the proceeds from sales would return to the BLM's Special Account for acquiring environmentally sensitive land; five percent would go to the State of Nevada's general education fund; and the City of Henderson could use the remaining ten percent to cover expenses associated with subdividing the property and providing infrastructure.
