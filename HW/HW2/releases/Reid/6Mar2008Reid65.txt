SEN. REID: PRODUCT SAFETY BILL VICTORY FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS
  Nevada Senator Harry Reid made the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed the Consumer Product Safety Commission bill, 79-13: 
   "This is a victory for the American consumer and a strong statement that the Administration's lax regulation standards on children's safety are unacceptable. It is also a strong statement that the Administration's hands-off, wait-and-see approach to governing doesn't work.
   "This bill gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission the resources, authority, and oversight it needs to protect our children from lead, dangerous toys and other unsafe products. For years now, the CPSC's budget and staff had been slashed. It employed only one full-time tester in an under-equipped lab to test toy safety for the entire country. We simply cannot rely on one tester to make sure more children are not among to 28,200 deaths and 33.6 million injuries each year.
   "It is our hope that after the Senate and House reconcile the differences in their respective bills, the President quickly signs this good bill into law."
