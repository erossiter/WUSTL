SEN. REID: PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH MISSES MARK
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today, following President Bush's speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention this morning.  
   "President Bush's speech this morning missed the mark yet again. Instead of providing the country with a history lesson, the President should be reevaluating his flawed strategies that have led to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our nation's history. Today our soldiers remain caught in the middle of a civil war and the President's strategy is still failing to deliver the political solution necessary for Iraq's stability. A change of course in Iraq is long overdue, and Congress will continue to fight for that change in the coming weeks - a change that is essential for America's national security."
