SEN. REID WINS MORE THAN $61 MILLION FOR NEVADA
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has set aside more than $60 million in the federal budget for Nevada's roads, bridges and airports. 
   The funding is part of the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill, which was signed into law by the President this week. The money will be used to build new roads and bridges, widen and reconstruct highways, and provide new buses and mass transit systems.
   "Nevada is the fastest-growing state in the union, and this funding will help us keep up with our increasing transportation demands," said Reid. "These projects will help commuters get to work and help tourists come visit our state. They construction work will create jobs and add to Nevada's economy, and when the projects are done they'll ease traffic jams, improve safety, and make life easier for all of us."
   Reid previously set aside $27 million for mass transit and airport projects in a Senate version of the bill. Additional funding for road construction was added to the measure during a House/Senate Conference, and Reid earmarked another $34 million of that funding specifically for Nevada projects.
   The funding in the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations Bill is in addition to other money announced earlier this year from the SAFETEA Bill.
   SAFETEA is a massive long-term transportation funding measure. SAFETEA money comes from a special trust fund for large-scale and interstate transportation projects, which is handled separately from the annual federal budget. Nevada will get $1.3 billion over five years from SAFETEA, plus an extra $300 million from Reid's specific earmarks.
