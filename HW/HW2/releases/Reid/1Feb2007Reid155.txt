SEN. REID LEADS PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Today, under the leadership of Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate passed The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 in support of workers and small businesses in Nevada and across the country. The act would increase the federal minimum wage by $2.10 an hour, from $5.15 to $7.25 in three increments over two years.  
   "It's been ten long years since the minimum wage was last increased," said Reid. "In that time, household costs have risen - including the price of gas, the price of food, and the price of health care. Even the salary of Members of Congress has increased - eight separate times, by $31,000. But Nevadans and Americans alike are working more even though the minimum wage has stayed the same. It's long past time America's workers get the raise they deserve." 
   Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns only $10,700 a year, which is nearly $6,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. Raising the minimum wage would give over 50,000 Nevadans a raise. 
   The bill includes $8.3 billion in tax breaks that will benefit small businesses in Nevada and throughout the country. 
   Small Business Tax Provisions Included in the Bill: 
   * Immediate deduction for the cost of property and equipment purchased during the year;
   * Extension of the 15-year depreciation period for leasehold and restaurant improvements to March 31, 2008 and an expansion to include new restaurant and retail property owned by the taxpayer;
   * Simplification of small business recordkeeping by allowing greater use of the cash method of accounting for purposes of tax reporting;
   * Extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for five years. WOTC provides employers tax credits against wages for hiring recipients of public assistance, qualified veterans on assistance, and high risk youth. The proposal also expands the qualified veterans' targeted group to include an individual who is certified as entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability incurred after September 10, 2001. For these veterans, the proposal doubles the amount of credits available to employers.
   Reid added, "History shows that increasing the minimum wage strengthens business and improves our economy. And a fair minimum wage reduces employee turnover, decreases dependence on welfare, improves worker morale, and is simply the right thing to do."
