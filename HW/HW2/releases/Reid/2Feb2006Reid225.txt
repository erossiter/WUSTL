SEN. REID: DEMOCRATS REMAIN COMMITTED TO IMPROVING, REAUTHORIZING PATRIOT ACT
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the extension of the USA PATRIOT Act:  
   "I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to another 5-week extension of the USA PATRIOT Act as Senate Democrats remain committed to improving and reauthorizing the bill. We stand ready to provide law enforcement with all necessary tools to keep Americans safe from terrorism. "Democrats supported the original Patriot Act that passed in 2001 and continue to support the reauthorization of the Patriot Act now with modest improvements. We must give government the tools it needs to fight the terrorists, but the checks we need to stop it from abusing its powers. "Democrats are committed to protecting Americans from terrorism. We do not want the Patriot Act to expire, and there is no reason that it should."
