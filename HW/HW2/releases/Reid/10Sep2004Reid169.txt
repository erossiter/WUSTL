REMEMBERING 9-11
  None of us will ever forget September 11, 2001. We will always remember where we were, and who we were with, as we watched the horrors of that fateful day unfold. We'll always remember the flood of emotions - the numbing shock, the anguish, and the anger.  
   September 11 will be forever written in our memories as one of those defining dates, like the attack on Pearl Harbor and the assassination of President Kennedy. It is a moment that changed the way we look at the world, and divides history into before and after. 
   But our memories of September 11 must be about more than how it affected us personally. When we think of September 11, we must never forget the thousands of people who died in those cowardly attacks, the brave firefighters and police, the workers going about their lives at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the passengers on the four doomed airplanes. We have a duty as Americans to remember them, not just for their sake, but for our own. Because as painful as those memories might be, they will always remind us of important truths. 
   The unprovoked slaughter of thousands of innocent people reminds us that, while the world is not always clear cut, there is a difference between right and wrong, and between good and evil. 
   As Americans we believe that all men are created equal. But all forms of government are not equal, and we are justifiably proud that we have the greatest system of government on earth. For more than two centuries, no nation has held the flame of freedom higher, or opened the doors of opportunity wider, than the United States of America. 
   Remembering September 11 also reminds us to treasure the rhythms and patterns and simple moments of everyday life - the routine of getting up in the morning, going to our jobs, sharing time with our family and friends. Those reminders are a great gift to us; a gift from the heroes of September 11.
