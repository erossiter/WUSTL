SEN. REID'S EFFORTS MOVE NTS WORKERS CLOSER TO COMPENSATION
  Nevada Sen. Harry Reid's efforts to ensure compensation for Nevada Test Site employees who contracted cancer from their work moved closer to completion this week upon receipt of a letter from the Health and Human Services Department (HHS). On Monday, June 26th, the Secretary of Health and Human Services transmitted to Congress his recommendation that a Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) be established for NTS workers employed at least 250 days from 1951 - 1962, the years of the above ground nuclear tests. This moves NTS workers closer to SEC status which, once granted, will result in an expedited compensation process for NTS workers. Senator Reid initiated the process in November 2005 when he asked the Bush Administration to initiate an SEC for Nevada Test Site workers.  
   "The Secretary of Health and Human Services action is a giant step toward ensuring compensation for the Nevada Test Site's atomic energy veteran's. I am pleased to announce that nearly one-third of NTS claimants would be compensated under this Cohort," said Reid. "The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security of the United States throughout the Cold War and since is unparalleled. The United States conducted 100 aboveground and 828 underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951 - 1992. That is 88 percent of the nuclear tests conducted in the United States. It is time we compensate these Cold War heroes for the illnesses they have suffered." 
   According to HHS, approximately 400 of NTS claimants will be compensated under this SEC. 
   Once the letters are transmitted to Congress, Congress has 30 days to act. If Congress does nothing to block it, the SEC is granted.
   In addition, Senator Reid continues to push for passage of his legislation, the Nevada Test Site Veteran's Compensation Act, which would grant SEC status for a greater number of Test Site Workers.
