SEN. REID CONDOLES DEATH OF SOLDIER FROM NEVADA IN IRAQ
  Sen. Reid's statement on the death of Sgt. Eric Morris: 
   I was deeply saddened to learn that the war in Iraq claimed another victim from the state of Nevada. The death of an American soldier is always a tragedy, but losing a Nevadan brings direct and personal sadness to everyone in our state. 
   Sergeant Eric Morris of Sparks, Nevada was killed last week in Tal Afar, Iraq. He was part of an infantry division that was supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. He and three other men were killed when a bomb exploded near their military vehicle. Sergeant Eric Morris was only 31 years old. 
   Sergeant Morris is part of a long line of heroes from our state who served their country to make the world a better and safer place. My thoughts are with his friends and family, and I send them my deepest condolences.
