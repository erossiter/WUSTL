SEN. REID PRAISES PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today commented on the U.S. Senate's passage of the minimum wage bill.  
   "In less than one month, Democrats in both the House and Senate have kept yet another one of their promises to move America in a new direction and we will continue to do so. For the first time in 10-years, Congress voted to in a bipartisan fashion to increase the minimum wage. In the time since the last minimum wage increase, household costs have risen - including the price of gas, the price of food, and the price of health care. Even the salary of Members of Congress has increased - eight separate times, by $31,000. This increase is long over-due and with today's vote, we have given hard working Americans, struggling to get by, the raise they deserve."
