SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING REVISED SCHEDULE FOR PROPOSED YUCCA MOUNTAIN NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) issued the following statement regarding the official announcement of the Energy Department's revised schedule for the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain:  
   "I want to make sure that every Nevadan knows that the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump is not even close to being built, and I am working with my colleagues in Nevada's congressional delegation to make sure it never will be. The Energy Department's new timeline is neither based on political nor scientific reality, and amounts to little more than a wish list by those hoping to turn Nevada into the nation's nuclear dumping ground."
   "Storing nuclear waste is a security concern for our nation but there is absolutely no justification for endangering the public by rushing to build this repository that is fraught with scientific, technical and geological problems. That's why we introduced a bill that requires commercial nuclear waste to be secured and licensed using on-site dry cask storage facilities."
   "We are talking about the most dangerous substance known to man. For the millions of dollars the Energy Department has spent studying Yucca Mountain, all we have learned is that the site is not safe to store nuclear waste and there is no way to safely and securely ship 77,000 tons of it across the country. This project is clearly unsafe and the dump at Yucca Mountain will never open."
