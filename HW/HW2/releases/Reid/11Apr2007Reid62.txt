SEN. REID: LENGTHENED TOURS IN IRAQ YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BUSH'S FAILED WAR STRATEGY
  Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid today issued the following statement in response to the Pentagon's announcement that the Army will extend tours in Iraq to 15 months:  
   "Today's news that active-duty troops' tours in Iraq will be extended to 15 months is another in a long line of examples of how the President's Iraq policies are making us less secure. A bipartisan majority of Congress sees it, the American people see it and military experts see it. 
   "It is time for the President to work with Congress to change course in Iraq. Congress will send President Bush a bill that gives our troops the resources they need and a strategy in Iraq worthy of their sacrifices. If the President vetoes this bill he will have delayed funding for troops and kept in place a strategy that neither our troops nor the American people can afford any longer."
