SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2007: 
   "Democrats are continuing to work to strengthen our environment and economy, and protect our natural resources. The Water Resources Development Act provides authority for essential new navigation projects, programs to combat flood and coastal-storm damage, programs to restore ecosystems, and other projects guided by the Army Corps of Engineers. I call on President Bush to drop his veto threat and listen to the bipartisan Congress that has voted overwhelmingly to address the needs of communities across America, from rural areas to our coasts."
