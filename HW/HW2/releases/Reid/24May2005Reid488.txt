SEN. REID CALLS FOR BUSH TO EMBRACE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement: 
   "Today, the president once again stood on the wrong side of science and the American people. We must put politics aside in the interest of giving new hope to those who suffer today. Embryonic stem cell research will provide scientists the tools to do groundbreaking and lifesaving research to find new cures and therapies. 
   "I hope the president will reconsider his veto threat while a broad bipartisan majority in Congress, a majority of the American people and the scientific community all strive to make this research possible."
