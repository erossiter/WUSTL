SEN. REID MEETS WITH HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY CHERTOFF TO ADDRESS SHORTAGE OF CUSTOMS, BORDER PROTECTION AGENTS AT MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada released the following statement after meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today.  
   "In our meeting today, Secretary Chertoff and I spoke about the shortage of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents at McCarran International Airport. As one of the busiest airports in the country, operating in a 24 hour town, McCarran requires a different level of attention, security and staffing than other airports do. 
   "We need to do more to ensure that our guests aren't spending their first three or four hours in Las Vegas waiting on the runway or in line at the international arrivals area at the airport. Putting additional CBP agents on the ground in Las Vegas would have great benefits for security, tourism, the economy and airport efficiency. I look forward to working with Secretary Chertoff to provide McCarran Airport with the tools it needs to enhance the experience of those visiting the great state of Nevada."
