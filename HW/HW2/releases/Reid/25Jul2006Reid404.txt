SEN. REID: REPUBLICANS PUT PRIVELEGED FEW ABOVE ALL AMERICANS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on the Republicans' decision to strip the Pensions Conference Report of middle-class tax breaks in order to continue to pursue fiscally irresponsible estate tax giveaways:  
   "For months, Republicans held the retirement security of millions of workers hostage to their desire to provide hundreds of billions in estate tax giveaways to the privileged few. Now that the effort was rejected, Republicans are holding hostage needed tax relief for working Americans, businesses, and students in an effort to pass fiscally irresponsible estate tax breaks. We need a Congress that works for all Americans, not one that puts special interests first. The Senate rejected fiscally irresponsible estate tax giveaways twice this year and will reject them again. It is time to move in a new direction that puts average Americans before special interests."
