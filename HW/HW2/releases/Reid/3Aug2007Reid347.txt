SEN. REID: SENATE STRENGTHENING AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS IN GLOBAL ECONOMY
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the Senate passed the conference report on the America COMPETES Act, which will help the United States maintain its leading edge in science and technology by investing in research and education: 
   "One of the best ways we can ensure America remains competitive in this increasingly global economy is by investing in our future. The America COMPETES Act - which strengthens our math and science education programs and increases our commitment to the National Science Foundation, NASA and other science-related federal agencies - will help maintain that advantage. It is encouraging to see the Senate unite in a bipartisan fashion to ensure America keeps its edge in the science, research and technology that strengthens our economy, national defense and future."
