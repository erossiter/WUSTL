SEN. REID REACTS TO REP. THOMAS'S SOCIAL SECURITY COMMENTS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today in response to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas's Social Security comments: 
   "The President's plan is a 'dead horse' not because of partisan politics but because it is a privatization plan based on massive benefit cuts, risky Wall Street accounts and $2 trillion in new debt. It will undermine Social Security at a time when we should be looking to strengthen the program and help Americans save.
   "And if a 50 percent benefit cut is not enough, now we learn Republicans are aiming to push even deeper cuts for America's women. Any suggestion that women do not deserve the same benefits as men is just plain wrong.
   "Retirement security is America's promise to all its workers, and I will ensure that promise is kept."
