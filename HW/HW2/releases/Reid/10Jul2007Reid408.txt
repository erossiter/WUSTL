SEN. REID: AS CIVIL WAR RAGES SIX MONTHS AFTER BUSH ANNOUNCES SURGE, DEMOCRATS AGAIN PUSH STRATEGY TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today in response to President Bush's remarks on the progress of the war in Iraq: 
   "In the six months since President Bush announced his surge, nearly 600 brave Americans have been killed while trying to provide Iraq's political leaders with the breathing space needed to unite their country. But Iraq's leaders have been frozen in a dangerous stalemate and have met virtually none of the critical political and economic benchmarks they set for themselves. Meanwhile, American taxpayers are being asked for more than $10 billion per month to finance the war and support an Iraqi government that shows little interest in helping itself. In short, the President's strategy and the surge in particular have delivered few of the promised results. 
   "Unfortunately, we are learning that President Bush is unwilling to offer a strategy other than more of the same - plunging our brave military forces even deeper into a civil war in hopes that Iraqis will eventually act. That path is not sustainable. Democrats believe we need a new strategy, one that forces the President to change the mission and bring our troops home responsibly. We hope Republicans will join us to deliver the real change of course in Iraq that the American people and our troops deserve."
