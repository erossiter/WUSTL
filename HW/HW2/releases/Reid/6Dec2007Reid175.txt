SEN. REID MEETS WITH NEVADA EDUCATION LEADERS TO DISCUSS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND
  U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada met with Nevada education leaders to discuss the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act.  
   "Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act with all the right intentions, but over the last five years, it has been poorly implemented and drastically under funded," said Reid. "We've heard from teachers, parents, and administrators across the state that No Child Left Behind needs to be reformed so that Nevada students receive the high quality education they deserve. I am committed to improving this legislation, and I will be working with members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to develop a strong, bipartisan reauthorization bill." 
   Reid met with members of the Nevada State Education Association. Among the attendees were Lynn Warne, President of the Nevada State Education Association, and Nevada National Education Association Representatives Ken Buhrmann and Tom Wellman.
