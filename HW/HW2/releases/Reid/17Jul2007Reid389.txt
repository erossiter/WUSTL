SENS. REID, ENSIGN ANNOUNCE $5 MILLION TO IMPROVE RURAL NEVADA AIRPORTS
  U.S. Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign of Nevada announced more than $5 million in funding to upgrade airports, primarily throughout rural Nevada. 
   "This is important funding for Nevada to upgrade their facilities," said Reid. "Among other things, this money will help these airports grow, become more accessible, and improve safety.
