SEN. REID: REPUBLICAN BIG OIL ADDICTION GROWS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement today on the Republican plan to lower gas prices by giving new hand outs to the oil industry.  
   "It is disappointing that neither sky-rocketing gas prices nor obscene oil company profits can break the bond between Bush Republicans and Big Oil. Americans are struggling to pay the rising cost of gas, and they are not interested in hand outs to help oil companies make more money by letting them drill in wildlife refuges. The people want immediate relief and a new energy policy. It's refreshing that Republicans have adopted so many Democratic proposals to lower the price of gas. Now it is finally time the Republican Congress acts to provide relief and to reduce our addiction to oil."
