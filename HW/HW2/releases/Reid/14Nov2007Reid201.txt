SEN. REID: WITH PROVEN, LASTING RESULTS, HEAD START IS A WISE INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today after the Senate passed the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007: 
   "As we continue to invest in America's priorities, Democrats today passed important improvements to the Head Start program - one of the hallmarks of our country's efforts to provide low-income young Americans with a quality education and the opportunity to succeed. We are investing in teacher training, increasing accountability and expanding income-eligibility limits to allow thousands more children to take advantage of this vital program. Since its inception, Head Start has benefited more than 20 million children and families; this legislation will expand access and eligibility for tens of thousands of children in Nevada and across America.
   "This is an important bill that I hope the President will sign. However, his veto yesterday of the Labor-HHS-Education bill, which includes basic funding for Head Start, was discouraging. We hope he will reconsider and recognize the importance of opening the doors of education for children across America and enact this reauthorization and expansion of the program."
