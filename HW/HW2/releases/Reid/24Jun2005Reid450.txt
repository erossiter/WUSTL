SEN. REID WORKS TO GET NEW BUSES FOR RURAL NEVADA SCHOOLS
  Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has introduced a bill to help keep schoolchildren in Nevada's rural areas safe.  
 The bill would provide funds for rural school districts to buy new buses, and replace the old, unsafe school buses on the roads now. 
   "Rural school districts put a lot of stress on their buses," said Reid. "In some rural Nevada counties, the buses travel a million miles in a year. They wear out quickly, but the school districts don't have the money to replace them. This funding will help them invest in new, safe, reliable school buses." 
   Reid's bill would provide $50 million in competitive grants each year, for five years. Rural school districts could apply for grants to cover up to 75-percent of the cost of new school buses. 
   Reid first started working on the problem after he met with the school superintendents of all 17 Nevada counties last year, and they told him that aging buses were one of their main concerns. He introduced a similar bill last year, but Congress adjourned before it was brought to a vote. 
   Reid's co-sponsors for the bill include Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Sen. Ken Salazar (D-CO), who also represent Western states with large rural areas. 
   "My colleagues and I understand that our rural school districts have tight budgets and big expenses," said Reid. "Right now, with soaring gas prices and the extra demands the federal government has placed on them under the No Child Left Behind Act, our schools are really strapped for cash. They need federal help to buy big ticket items like buses. 
   Without basic essentials, like school buses, we might end up literally leaving children behind in rural Nevada."
