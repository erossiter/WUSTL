SEN. REID: VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY HAS NO CREDIBILITY ON NATIONAL SECURITY
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid released the following statement on comments made today by Vice President Dick Cheney: 
   "When the U.S. intelligence community confirmed that America is losing the war on terror because of Bush failures in Iraq, this White House lost all credibility on matters of national security. With Iraq in a civil war, Afghanistan moving backwards and our own borders unsecured, it's clear George Bush and Dick Cheney are desperate to hide their record and distort the truth. America needs a new direction, one that is tough and smart and gives Americans the real security they deserve."
