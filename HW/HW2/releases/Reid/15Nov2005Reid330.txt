SENATE TELLS WHITE HOUSE THAT NO PLAN, NO END APPROACH IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE
  Sen. Democratic Leader Harry Reid delivered the following statement at a press conference today following the Senate's vote on Iraq amendments.  
   "Let me tell you the President's strategy in Iraq - no plan and no end in sight. Our troops deserve better. That's why Democrats forced Republicans to admit that "staying the course" is not an option. 
   "As stated in the amendment, the Senate just voted overwhelmingly to change the policy of the United States with regard to Iraq. Republicans admitted what Democrats have been saying all along - the administration's strategy is aimless and rudderless. It's a victory for our troops and the American people. If Democrats hadn't acted, our Republican colleagues would have been fine going along with the administration's "no plan, no end" approach. 
   "The contrast between Democrats and the Bush Administration could not be clearer. Democrats offered a clear way forward and a strategy for success in Iraq. Rather than trying to score political points and mischaracterizing the Democratic amendment with language that isn't even in there, we think the top priority of Republicans should be succeeding in Iraq. 
   "Democrats know that the road to success requires a plan and accountability from the administration. That's all we've asked for, and our troops deserve nothing less."
