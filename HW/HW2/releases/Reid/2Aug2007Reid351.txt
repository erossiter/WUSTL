SEN. REID: SENATE PASSES LANDMARK ETHICS, LOBBYING BILL TO CHANGE HOW WASHINGTON DOES BUSINESS
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made the following statement today after the Senate passed the House Message on S. 1, the Ethics and Lobbying Reform bill: 
   "Democrats today delivered on yet another promise we made to the American people who have for a new direction. In sending the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform in history to the President, we are giving the American people a government as good and honest as the people it represents.
   "This bill will significantly reform the way business gets done in Washington. It prohibits gifts and travel from lobbyists and companies that hire lobbyists, puts an end to pay-to-play schemes like the Republican K Street Project, dramatically increases public disclosure of the activities of lobbyists, slows the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying world, requires transparency in the earmark process, and increases penalties for corrupt politicians and lobbyists. The American people are sick and tired of the corruption that has plagued this city for the past six years, and we look forward to the President enacting this sorely needed reform."
