SEN. REID: CONGRESS MOVES CLOSER TO ENACTING 9/11 COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA MORE SECURE
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made the following statement today following the appointment of conferees on legislation to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations: 
   "After months of stalling, Senate Republicans today agreed to begin conference negotiations between the House and Senate to finally and fully implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. While I am glad that Republicans have finally given up their objections to help us make America more secure, it should not have taken Congress this long. We live in a dangerous world, and we have to remain vigilant against an Al Qaeda that has grown stronger. I look forward to moving through this conference as quickly as possible and on a bipartisan basis so we can enact the provisions of this bill and make America more secure."
