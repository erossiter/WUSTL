SEN. REID: WE NEED NEW DIRECTION ON NORTH KOREA
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid issued the following statement on President Bush's North Korean policy: 
   "Given that President Bush's flawed policies have allowed North Korea's nuclear weapons' capabilities to grow dramatically, it is easy to understand why the Administration is trying to trumpet today's announcement as a big victory. It may ultimately be a positive step forward, but it is clearly not sufficient to produce the goal we all want to achieve - a halt to North Korea's nuclear weapons' activities. Time is not on our side when it comes to North Korea's nuclear weapons' capabilities. It is essential for the President to immediately change course and heed bipartisan calls to appoint a special envoy empowered to jump start the six-party talks and engage in direct bilateral discussions with North Korea."
