SEN. REID ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HENRY PAULSON
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today released the following statement on President Bush's nomination of Henry Paulson to be Secretary of the Treasury.
   "I look forward to the confirmation hearings of Henry M. Paulson Jr. to be the next U.S. Treasury Secretary. Mr. Paulson will face many challenges if he is confirmed in steering our economy towards greater prosperity for all Americans. Working families are struggling under high gas prices, rising health care costs, and skyrocketing college tuition. We need to work together to make middle-class life more affordable. I hope Mr. Paulson will share that goal."
