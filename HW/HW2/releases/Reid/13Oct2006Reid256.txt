SEN. REID HONORS KOREAN WAR VETERAN AT PURPLE HEART PRESENTATION
  Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada honored Korean War Veteran Herbert "Pete" Petersen at a Purple Heart presentation at the Ioannis A. Lougaris VA Medical Center today.  
   "Today we honored Herbert "Pete" Petersen, an American hero," said Reid. "This Purple Heart award is long overdue for this courageous Korean War Veteran. He is a man who has sacrificed so much for our country and our community. He persevered when many would have given up. I am honored to know a Nevadan like him." 
   In 1949 Petersen joined the Marine Corps reserve at age 17 and was shipped off to Korea in October 1950. 
   Petersen, a longtime Northern Nevada resident, was wounded in battle on November 27, 1950, when he was shot in the right leg, shocked by a hand grenade, and lost a toe to frost bite. 
   The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy, and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action. 
   Reid is a strong supporter of veterans. He has backed numerous veteran initiatives, including concurrent receipt, increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and improved veterans health care across Nevada. 
   Nevada is home to the third largest veterans population in the nation. About 250,000 veterans reside in Nevada.
