SEN. REID SECURES $45 MILLION FOR NV RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS, DRASTIC CUT TO YUCCA BUDGET
  Sen. Harry Reid included $45 million for renewable energy projects in Nevada, and cut the Yucca Mountain budget to $577 million, half of what the Department of Energy said it would need to keep the project on track, in this year's Energy and Water Appropriations bill. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and the top Democrat on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Reid writes the bill with his Republican counterpart every year.  
   For Nevada, this means Reid is able to cut the funding for the Yucca Mountain project and delay its opening. It also means hundreds of millions of dollars for energy, homeland security, water and infrastructure projects.
   "Every community in Nevada will benefit from these projects," said Reid, who earlier this week introduced legislation offering tax credits to renewable energy producers. "We have unlimited sun, wind and geothermal energy resources, and the funding for renewable energy development will be especially good for our state." 
   Reid also noted that the budget cuts in the bill will be detrimental to Yucca Mountain. "I don't believe Yucca Mountain will ever open," said Reid. "Every year I cut the budget because it's a project that's fraught with fraud and mismanagement and the more time we have, the more the facts come to light. There is no way to safely open a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain." 
   The funding bill passed the Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee today. Later this week, the bill is expected to pass the full Appropriations Committee with funding for Nevada totaling more than $300 million. In addition to the renewable energy projects, Reid will allocate the money for flood control and environmental improvements throughout the state, as well as increased funding for homeland security training and studies at the Nevada Test Site, UNR, UNLV and DRI. And, Reid will include $25 million for the Rural Nevada Program. 
   Reid is also working to include language in the Energy and Water bill that would release $85 million of previously approved funding for agriculture and water projects in the Walker River Basin. Sen. Reid, Sen. Ensign and Rep. Gibbons have been working to release the part of the funding that was passed with 2002 Farm Bill when Sen. Reid included $200 million in funding for conservation projects at places like Walker Lake.
