SEN. REID: PROTECTING OUR BORDERS SHOULD NOT INCLUDE DEMONIZING IMMIGRANTS
  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today issued the following statement on the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005" (H.R. 4437):  
   "Tonight, the House passed a mean-spirited, extreme, anti-immigrant bill that is unworkable and un-American. This radical bill has very little to do with securing our borders and instead demonizes and punishes our nation's hardworking immigrant community. It will not fix our nation's broken immigration system. 
   "We need real comprehensive reform that will protect our borders, reunite families, provide for continued American economic growth, protect the rights of American workers, and honor the values of the United States of America as a nation of immigrants. 
   "As Congress finally begins to address this problem, instead of standing up to the right-wing of his party and standing up for what is right, President Bush has chosen to endorse this bill. President Bush is paying lip service to issues that matter to Latinos while at the same time supporting extreme proposals that target their community. 
   "Democrats support strong border security, and reasonable and realistic reforms to create an immigration system that will actually work."
