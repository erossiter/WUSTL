    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         March 15  2007     Press Release        Pryor Calls for Attorney General Gonzales to Resign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senator Mark Pryor today called for the resignation of Attorney General Gonzales  citing the Justice Department s clear intention to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and mislead Senators  as indicated in their emails and testimony before the Judiciary Committee  He also connects the dots on how the Attorney General knew of his Chief of Staff s actions  Pryor was one of six Democrats to vote for his confirmation on February 3  2005  Below are his remarks  which he delivered on the Senate floor       I ve come here today to talk about the political firings of the U S  Attorneys  which I believe are a serious concern of the Administration s encroachment on the Senate s constitutional responsibilities  and now I also believe raise serious concerns over the Attorney General s ability to serve  That is why I come here today to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  resignation        There has been a lot of attention focused on the U S  Attorneys in the last couple of weeks  but this is an issue that I ve been involved with for the last nine months  I first realized a problem existed in July of 2006  On February 6  2007  I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee  I won t repeat that testimony here  Instead I would like to focus on five facts today        First  and these are undisputed facts based on the emails produced by the Department of Justice  this Administration set out to fire or replace U S  Attorneys  some without cause and in some cases for suspicious reasons        Second  this is different from anything done in previous Administrations and includes putting a provision in the Patriot Act to carry out their schemes       Third  it started with the White House        Fourth  it was carried out by the Attorney General        And Fifth  the Attorney General crossed a line by putting politics above the pursuit of justice and has seriously damaged his stature and legacy in the process        The first of these points is proven by emails from the Attorney General s office and White House  The fifth point is evidenced by the Attorney General s statements to me  the Senate Judiciary Committee and his public statements         Immediately after the 2004 elections  the White House began a scheme to replace all U S  Attorneys  The Attorney General joined in that plan in early 2005 but recommended to limit the number of U S  Attorneys that were to be replaced  During this process  the Attorney General identified U S  attorneys to sacrifice to the White House demands  In January 2006  the Attorney General sent a memorandum to the White House detailing obstacles that must be overcome before going forward with the plan  One such obstacle was the United States Senate  So  in March 2006  the Attorney General hatched another scheme to get around Senate confirmation  During the Patriot Act reauthorization  the Attorney General  with the apparent purpose of replacing U S  Attorneys  had a provision slipped in during the Senate and House conference to allow the Attorney General indefinite appointment authority  After this plan came to light  the Attorney General responded by misleading the American people  For example  in press interviews  he said the Clinton Administration had done something similar  That is not true  In an Attorney General memorandum dated January 9  2006  it clearly says        In recent memory during the Reagan and Clinton Administrations  President Reagan and Clinton did not seek to replace U S  Attorneys they had appointed White House four year tenure had expired but instead permitted such U S  Attorneys to serve indefinitely under the holdover provision        His own Chief of Staff has contradicted this public justification  Once those decisions became apparent that they were going to  push out  U S  attorneys  which  by the way  is the term the Attorney General s office uses in the September 17  2006 memo to the White House    they re going to push out U S  attorneys    those began a clear  precise method to obfuscate and delay the confirmation process by lying to home state senators  including me  I know this because I have the e mails that lay out the game plan on how to get around Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas and myself  I have here in my hand a plan to replace certain U S  attorneys dated November 15  2006  This memo gives a five step plan on how to do this and also how to talk about it        Step one has specific talking points  Step two says to call and to contact Republican senators  Now  this is an important point  It says on September 7 that it s very important that senator calls and U S  attorney calls happen simultaneously  Mike battle contacts the following U S  attorneys  So  they do that  They contact Jon Kyl  John Ensign  Pete Domenici  And then it says to call   the California political lead  the Michigan political lead  and the Washington political lead   Please notice there are no Democrats that were contacted about this  not even a courtesy call from the White House or the Justice Department  Only calls made to Republicans  And if there s not a Republican senator in that state  it just says to  call  the state s political lead  Clearly this was a partisan effort on Justice s part  The Attorney General  I feel  crossed a line when they chose to go the partisan route on U S  attorneys        Now the Attorney General states that he was unaware of all the details of their plans that were hatched by his Chief of Staff  I do not believe this for a minute  I know that an e mail written in December 2006 on how to get around Senator Lincoln and myself is exactly what Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said to me in a telephone conversation  In fact  by way of background  I had called the White House and the Attorney General to ask them to please nominate a suitable nominee for U S  attorney in Arkansas  They had canned or pushed out Bud Cummins  They were going to or about to do an interim appointment for Tim Griffin  I asked them to please not do that and please send someone through the confirmation process  And if it was Tim Griffin  send him through  I couldn t say I was going to vote for him  but please send him through  Well  the December 19  2006 memo is very enlightening  It is from Kyle Sampson  Chief of Staff to Alberto Gonzales  It is to Christopher G  Oprisem  apparently at the White House  It says        1  I think we should gum this to death  Ask the senators to give Tim a chance  meet with him  give him some time in office to see how he performs  et cetera  If they ultimately say no  never  and the longer we can forestall that  the better  then we can tell them we ll look for other candidates  Ask them for recommendations  evaluate the recommendations  interview their candidates and otherwise run out the clock         This is an e mail from the Attorney General s Chief of Staff to the White House  All of this should be done in  good faith  of course  Now  when they put good faith in quotes that tells me they re going in bad faith  They re not going in good faith  But they re giving the appearance of good faith in order to try to run out the clock        2  Officially Tim is the U S  attorney and will identify himself as such on pleadings and other official documents  I think it s time for us to refer him as the interim U S  attorney in talking points with this understanding  that by interim U S  attorney  we mean attorney general appointed  as opposed to President appointed and senate confirmed  U S  attorney         3  I think we should take the temperature way down  Our guy is in there so the status quo is good for us  Ask for them to consider him  note that he is qualified and doing a good job whenever asked         Here again  they re telling them to tell us that he s doing a good job whenever asked  He hasn t even been in office but one day  I think  when this thing was written  Again they re setting up a deception on the front end         Pledge to desire a Senate confirmed U S  attorney and otherwise hunker down         4  The only thing really at risk here is a repeal of the Attorney General s appointment authority         You bet your life that is what s at risk here because we re going to have that vote later today or tomorrow or Monday or Tuesday or at some point  and absolutely that is what is at risk here  Because I think the United States Senate should change that law and should take that provision out of the PATRIOT ACT that they snuck in the dark hours in a conference        We intend to have D O J  legislative affairs people on notice to work hard to preserve this  House members won t care about this  All we really need is for one Senator to object to language being added to legislative vehicles that are moving through  There is some risk that we ll lose the authority  But if we don t ever exercise it  then what s the point of having it  I m not 100  sure that Tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority  but now that getting him appointed was important    excuse me    but know that getting him appointed was important to Harriet  Karl  et cetera         I could spend all day talking about this memo  but basically in here they say that the Attorney General is going to tell us    Senator Lincoln and I    about six or seven things  And they did every single one of them  This is the playbook right here  They say  ask the senators to give Tim a chance   and Attorney General Gonzales did ask me that   Meet with him   He asked me to  and I did   Give him some time in office   He asked for that  even though usually people don t get a little test drive before they get appointed   They wanted to delay and just  run out the clock   At one point he said   If I m not happy that  they ll interview other candidates that I m interested in   They also mention for me to consider him and to look at him in a way that he s doing a good job  Well  here again  every single thing in this memo was done  Again  this is the playbook        This is why I feel lied to  And the truth is I was lied to  because I was told that the Attorney General    and he not only said it to me  he said it to the Senate Judiciary Committee and he said it to the world  The Attorney General wanted a Senate confirmed U S  attorney in every slot  That is absolutely not true in Arkansas  based on this e mail from the Justice Department  I assure you when they put good faith in quotes that means they re not proceeding in good faith  They didn t proceed in good faith with me  And that s one of the reasons why I think Attorney General Gonzales should resign immediately  I don t think he has the credibility to run that department anymore       Let me tell you this  I was one of six   I was one of six democratic Senators that supported Attorney General Gonzales  nomination and confirmation  I supported the Patriot Act  Not all Democrats did  I worked closely with this Attorney General  I ve always tried to deal with him and reach out to them and have a constructive  positive relationship  I feel like that s what the people in Arkansas want me to do  And that s exactly what I ve done  But on this issue  Attorney General Gonzales has broken faith with me  He s broken faith with the U S  Senate  And he s broken faith with the people of Arkansas  Because when the Attorney General of this country  who I believe should be held to a higher standard  Not a political standard  but a high standard of integrity because he should be all about justice  not politics  He should be all about justice        When the Attorney General lies to a United States Senator  I think it s time for that Attorney General to go  And again  he not only lied to me as a person  but when he lied to me  he lied to the Senate and he lied to the people I represent  And for that reason  I m asking him and demanding that he resign today  Thank you  Mr  President
