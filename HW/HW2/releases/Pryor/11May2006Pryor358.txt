    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         May 11  2006     Press Release        On Supporting the Tax Reconciliation Tax Package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We can  t allow our economy to be flat lined by ensnaring middle class families with the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  this year  Fixing the AMT permanently is the right thing to do  but for now the Republican Congress insists on patching it one year at a time  Since there is no alternative  I support this compromise   Arkansas working families don  t need to foot higher tax bills on top of escalating gas prices  increasing health insurance premiums and higher tuition costs        I also believe we must encourage investment opportunities and savings for working families  and this bill provides a degree of certainty for those trying to secure their financial future   More and more of the middle class  through savings and investment  are taking advantage of lower capital gains and dividends tax rates   In particular they  re seeking to maximize their earnings in the stock market  mutual funds or retirement plans        Our nation faces a number of financial challenges  ranging from our deficits to financing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  As we address these challenges and get our fiscal house in order  America needs strong  middle class taxpayers to continue building a path of opportunity and keep America strong during these uncertain times
