    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 27  2005     Press Release        On the Withdrawal of Harriet Miers   Nomination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I am disappointed that Harriet Miers has withdrawn her nomination  but not terribly surprised   Today  s news demonstrates that  unfortunately  special interests have too much influence in deciding the makeup of our courts       Because some of these groups could not discern how Harriet Miers was going to vote on certain issues they decided to oppose her nomination without giving her a chance to go through the process  They cared more about finding a judicial activist to further their agenda than finding a good judge       I was still learning about Harriet Miers and did not know how I was going to vote on her nomination  but I believe she deserved the opportunity to defend her legal career and judicial philosophy in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee        It is my hope that as President Bush moves forward he will engage in meaningful consultation with the U S  Senate and pick a consensus nominee with impeccable credentials  the proper judicial temperament and the absolute ability to be fair and impartial
