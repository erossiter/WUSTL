    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         June 7  2007     Press Release        Pryor  The Senate Can Do Better To Fix Our Immigration System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The immigration system we have on the books right now is broken  I am for immigration reform that is tough  fair and realistic  Tough means strengthening border control and enforcement efforts  Fair means fair on taxpayers  Realistic means restoring the rule of law and fixing the immigration system once and for all  Unfortunately  this bill fails this test  I want immigration reform that is good for Arkansas  I believe a comprehensive approach with strong enforcement mechanisms can work  but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this proposal will only reduce annual illegal immigration by 25   We can do better  and I will continue working with my colleagues to do just that   Meanwhile  President Bush can and should immediately step up border enforcement and crack down on companies who employ illegal immigrants  Since he came into office  enforcement of immigration law is down 30 percent
