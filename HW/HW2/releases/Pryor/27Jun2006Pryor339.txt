    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         June 27  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On Flag Desecration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For more than 200 hundred years  our nation has prospered without a flag desecration amendment to the Constitution   Our founding fathers in their infinite wisdom didn  t see a need for one when they drafted the Bill of Rights  and I believe Congress should show similar restraint today   When American soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy  they did it for more than a symbol on cloth  but for an idea and a belief in a free society   Many Americans continue to fight and die to defend our great society and the freedoms on which we were founded  A flag amendment to the Constitution will not change their course  or the ideas and beliefs that live within each of us   However  we can protect the flag without amending our Constitution  and I voted in favor of a federal law that bans flag burning and can stand up to court challenges
