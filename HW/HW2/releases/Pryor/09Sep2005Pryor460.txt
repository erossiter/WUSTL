    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         September 9  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Senator Pryor submitted the following statement on Hurricane Katrina relief efforts into the Congressional Record         Mr  President  I join my Senate colleagues in voicing my unwavering support to help Gulf Coast residents recover and rebuild their communities in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina   The  60 5 billion in funding we have passed is a start toward restoring basic infrastructure and the economy  but we have a long way to go   This recovery will require much more of our time  resources and a comprehensive plan  I stand ready to work with my colleagues to do just that        In the last two weeks  I have witnessed many good and bad things involving Hurricane Katrina  The generosity and compassion shown by families all over the nation have redefined the meaning of good neighbor   In Arkansas  I have watched as countless charities  individuals from the private and public sector and the faith based community joined together to welcome their neighbors with unmatched Southern hospitality           I am very proud of the Arkansas National Guard  Many of these Guard members have spent months in Iraq away from their families this year  but they were eager to join the military operation to help rescue Hurricane victims  secure the streets of New Orleans and maintain order in many of our shelters   I am also pleased that these Guard members have been mobilized under Title 32 so that their time counts for purposes of retirement  health care and other benefits enjoyed by their active duty counterparts         After the initial devastation of Hurricane Katrina  I called my Gulf Coast colleagues to ask how I could help and support their constituents in their time of need   I am working to honor their requests by coordinating logistics for evacuees and helping evacuees in Arkansas resolve problems involving Social Security checks  postal services and FEMA forms   My office is also working to find housing for evacuees  transport them  reunite families and assist with translation   As 60 000 or more of their constituents have traveled to Arkansas  I am working to serve their constituents as well as Arkansans  Evacuees should know that as they get their lives back together  they have a home in Arkansas         Mr  President  while the American people were stepping up to the plate  the government struck out  Our emergency plans failed to meet expectations  I want to focus on helping distressed families now  but in the not too distant future  we need to take a hard look at the failures that occurred in responding to this disaster         Under Senate rules  Senators Collins and Lieberman are tasked with leading government oversight as the ranking members of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee   As a member of this committee  I can attest to their strong  bipartisan and tested leadership  The intelligence restructuring bill drafted in this Committee  passed by this body and signed into law by President Bush last year is a fitting example   This same committee ought to pursue its oversight responsibilities on the government  s slow rescue and response efforts  I believe very adamantly that part of any investigation  and subsequent legislation  must begin with fixing the chain of command and bureaucratic breakdowns that occurred before and after the hurricane  If the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee is not tapped for this undertaking  then I believe the families of the Gulf Coast  and the rest of the nation  deserve a thorough review of the mistakes that occurred in a setting where politics will not play a role       A primary reason for the creation of the Department of Homeland Security  following 9 11  was to allow for a smooth and immediate rescue and recovery operation when disaster strikes    whether naturally occurring or manmade  But instead of a smooth operation  states and federal agencies again ran into red tape and confusion   A terrorist attack and a hurricane are  of course  two completely different disasters  but the response efforts are just as critical and necessary  and they translate into saving lives         We have put enormous resources into a national emergency preparedness and response system nearly 4 years after 9 11  and I am concerned and dismayed that our response to a significant disaster has not been improved exponentially   The government  s failure to respond effectively shows weaknesses in our emergency preparedness not just to Americans  but also to terrorists who seek havoc in our country         We must find and fix the discrepancies in the system  look for accountability  and make sure these mistakes are never repeated in the United States again   We owe this to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and  quite frankly  we owe it to the victims of 9 11         I believe the problems that occurred before  during and after the hurricane have unveiled something else about America   They have opened up eyes in Washington  D C  and across the country about the abject poverty some families live in   Those left stranded on their rooftops or in the Superdome painted a very vivid picture about the inequities that exist in our country today  and they speak volumes about the transportation  housing and health care available in this country       If anything at all comes from this tragedy  I hope it will be a new focus on our priorities in this body   Before the hurricane hit  the Senate was expected to return from its August recess to vote on cutting health care services for our poorest Americans   Hurricane Katrina showed that we  as a nation  are failing to care of our poor  our sick and our elderly   Government must do better  and that leadership must start with the President  the Senate and the House of Representatives        We can start with a number of proposals that have been put forth by both Republicans and Democrats to help the South recover from Hurricane Katrina   These initiatives range from financial assistance to host states for evacuee care  tax incentives for employers to hire evacuees  and health care  housing and nutritional assistance for evacuees  I stand ready to help and lead in these efforts          Senator Landrieu delivered an impassioned speech on the floor yesterday  and I end with her words    We must learn from this experience   If we do not  we will fail again
