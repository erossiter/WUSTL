    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         April 27  2006     Press Release        Op ed by Senator Mark Pryor On Skyrocketing Gas Prices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              In the last few days  many in Congress and even the President have realized what Arkansans have known for sometime  the high price gasoline is hurting the American family and threatening our way of life   This epidemic is especially damaging to our farmers  the middle class  small businesses  and individuals on fixed incomes         In fact  today  my Mobile Office is open in small towns in rural Arkansas and the price of gasoline remains the number one concern of constituents  Arkansans have been filling up their cars and trucks while paying record highs for gasoline  and then opening their newspaper and reading about oil companies making record profits  I believe consumers have long had a legitimate concern that something is not right in the oil industry         That is why on September 13  2005  I offered an amendment to the Commerce  Justice  State Appropriations Bill that directed the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to conduct a thorough investigation into nationwide gasoline prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina   This investigation is not only looking at what happened immediately after the hurricanes  but it should also provide transparency into the procedures oil companies use in pricing gasoline throughout the supply chain   The Senate unanimously passed my amendment  the President signed the bill into law two months later  and the results are expected to be released in late May         Some of my colleagues on the other side of the isle are now calling for additional investigations and interrogations of the big oil companies   I look upon my colleagues recent call for action as a signal that they are ready to deal with this problem   I am also pleased to now see the President  who signed my measure into law just months ago  publicly calling upon the FTC to investigate oil companies         My measure requires the FTC to conduct an immediate investigation to determine if and where gas price gouging is occurring throughout the supply chain and distribution markets   Additionally  the investigation includes            A comparison and reasons for changes in profit levels in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina for companies involved in the production  distribution  or sale of petroleum products            The effects of price gouging on interstate commerce            A summary of tax breaks for companies involved in the oil industry             The overall cost of price gouging to the economy  including the impact on consumers   purchasing power in both declared and non declared national emergency areas  and           Recommendations to Congress on legislative action to protect consumers from price gouging        There is much more to be done and my measure is just a start   The Senate last year passed an Energy bill that would have increased the fuel economy in our cars and trucks and provided more funding for the development of alternative fuels   Unfortunately  the House of Representatives watered down those measures  and the final bill was not as strong as it could have been         I also want to say that I believe the free market approach is healthy for our economy  But what is possibly occurring in the oil industry now could boil down to a monopoly controlling the lifeblood of our economy   And it  s not a free market when output is restricted in order to drive up prices  Given the number of tax breaks the oil industry receives  it  s fair to expect ethical behavior in return  but that  s simply not what we  re seeing  That is also why I support a   gas tax holiday    that would ease federal taxes per gallon at the pumps   This will provide a little short term relief to working families  school districts  and farmers   I will do this without taking resources from our infrastructure programs       It is easy to let the high price of fuel get you down  but I believe there are some long term solutions that are being pursued in Arkansas that will provide a light at the end of the tunnel   For example  in Arkansas  there are many who are venturing into alternative fuels like Patriot BioFuels Inc   the Potlatch Corporation  and Eastman Chemical  Inc   They see a future in home grown fuels that put our farmers to work and provide less dependence on foreign oils  and so do I   In the last five years our importation of foreign oil has gone from 58 2 percent in 2000 to 66 percent today   We have to change course and the potential for us to open the energy market to our farmers are limitless  But we have to make this a national priority and fund it   Families in Arkansas and across America deserve for us to tackle this challenge  and I know together we can          I am looking forward to the FTC  s findings next month  and I join my colleagues on the Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee  who have called for an immediate hearing once the results are made public   I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in giving serious consideration to the report and acting on the FTC  s findings and recommendations
