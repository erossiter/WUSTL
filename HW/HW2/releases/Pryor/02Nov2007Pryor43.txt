D C   Senators Mark Pryor  D AR   Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin  D IL   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Bob Menendez  D NJ   Bill Nelson  D FL   and Chuck Schumer  D NJ  today said they would stop the dozens of industry sponsored trips taken by certain consumer product safety commissioners  The Washington Post today reported industry paid  60 000 in airfare  hotel and meal expenses for travel to destinations that include China  Spain  New Orleans and San Francisco  It further reports some of those trips were paid for by industry representatives linked to hazardous products   In a letter to the acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  Nancy Nord  the senators expressed concern about the disturbingly cozy relationship between industry groups and her agency  which is charged with protecting our nations children and consumers from dangerous products  They informed the Chairman of their intentions to strengthen the CPSC Reform Act of 2007 when it comes to the Senate floor by including a ban on travel sponsored by manufacturers  trade associations or lobbying groups  They also requested the CPSC undertake immediate steps to modify its travel policy to avert any real or perceived conflict of interest between industry and their mission    Earlier this week  the Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation by Senator Pryor that includes sweeping reforms to prevent dangerous products from ending up on store shelves and in childrens toy chests  The CPSC Reform Act of 2007 will help the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  meet the challenges of todays economy by authorizing additional funding for the agency to increase staff levels  improving antiquated testing facilities and increasing CPSC agents at U S  ports of entry  Additionally  the legislation proposes an increase in civil and criminal penalties  third party safety certification on all childrens products  a ban on all childrens products that contain lead  a more expedient recall process and whistleblower protections for manufacturers and importers employees    A copy of the letter is below    November 2  2007    The Honorable Nancy A  Nord Acting Chairman  Consumer Product Safety Commission 4330 East West Highway Bethesda  MD 20814  Dear Chairman Nord   Todays Washington Post article highlighting Commission trips funded by companies or interest groups regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  greatly concerns us all These trips raise very serious concerns that certain segments of industry may be exerting undue influence over the decision making process at the CPSC We are particularly concerned about reports of a trip you took to New Orleans earlier this year to make a presentation to the Defense Research Institute  an organization defending companies involved in product liability cases    As you are aware  we have been working diligently to reform the CPSC and provide solutions to systemic problems at the agency  including additional authority to protect children from lead in toys and additional funding to protect consumers from dangerous imported products We have appreciated your input during this process However  we believe these industry funded trips require Congressional consideration and additional public scrutiny For these reasons  when the CPSC Reform Act of 2007 is considered on the Senate floor  we will seek legislative changes to the bill to ban travel paid for by companies or industries regulated by the CPSC   Many agencies  including the Securities and Exchange Commission  Food and Drug Administration  the Federal Communications Commission  and the Federal Trade Commission have similar rules restricting industry sponsored travel As Congress considers the best solutions to fix and bolster the CPSC  we believe we should free the CPSC from any appearance of impropriety or undue influence from regulated industries Leaving the Commission vulnerable to such charges is unacceptable    In the meantime  we would request that your agency conduct a full internal review of CPSC travel and make appropriate administrative changes in anticipation of legislation   Thank you for this opportunity to express our concerns As always  we are willing to discuss these issues further with you and welcome constructive feedback    Sincerely
