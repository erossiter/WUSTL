    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         November 7  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor on Budget Priorities for the Delta                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I believe the Senate last week missed a golden opportunity to help families in the Delta  and I voted against the budget measure because of its misplaced priorities that will shortchange our most vulnerable children and families   This bill deals the hardest blow at low income families who lack affordable access to health care and to farmers struggling to make a living following a long drought and significant storm damage   I have serious concerns that once the Senate budget measure is reconciled with the House of Representatives   version  the final bill will be even more detrimental to individuals who rely on critical services  such as Medicare  Medicaid  student aid  agriculture supports and nutrition programs         Instead  we need to make important investments to lift up families in our most distressed areas   That  s why I  m working to build cooperation and commitment for the Delta region on a national level   The  330 million we secured in the highway bill will allow for significant progress on I 69  but it  s just a start for revitalization in the Delta   I am also working to keep the  12 million slated for the Delta Regional Authority intact as the appropriations process moves forward   Delta communities will also benefit from the Rural Renaissance Act  a bill I introduced to provide an infusion of tax exempt bonds for rural development projects  such as water and wastewater systems  broadband expansion and housing          If we combine the ingenuity and values of the Delta community with adequate resources  the quiet potential that lies in the region could be realized   I share the vision of the Delta Grassroots Caucus to do just that  and I look forward to our work together in fighting poverty and building opportunity in the Delta
