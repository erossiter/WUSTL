    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 14  2005     Press Release        Pryor Offers Solutions to Combat Natural Gas Price Hikes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Mark Pryor today outlined his plans to address increasing natural gas prices that threaten to cause financial hardships for families and businesses across the country       Pryor laid out several practical policy solutions that he will turn into legislation and work to enact during the current session of Congress  The Senator  s areas of interest include         Allowing States to Pursue Off Shore Gas Exploration    Increasing Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance    Tax Incentives to Encourage the Weatherization of Residential Homes    Promoting Alternative Fuels  Conservation and Efficiency    Keeping the Natural Gas Market Free from Manipulation and Gouging        While the recently passed energy bill will go a long way toward meeting our future needs it does little to solve our short term problems  The policy proposals I support can be accomplished sooner rather than later     Pryor said    This is a practical and realistic way to address a very complex problem  My provisions span a broad spectrum because I do not believe there is a one size fits all solution to fixing our energy problems          According to recent Department of Energy forecasts  heating bills will be 33  to 50  higher for Americans this year with the sharpest increases expected for natural gas users  This could mean a  350 increase in home heating for families or more depending on how cold it gets this winter  Pryor said that he was concerned that many Arkansas families would feel a household budget squeeze  and some would simply not be able to afford the drastic increases        Pryor noted that the increase in natural gas prices permeate the entire economy  While more than half of all U S  households are heated with natural gas  it is also the life line of many power plants and manufacturing facilities  Pryor said that natural gas is vital for the production of every day products ranging from plastics to fertilizers to pharmaceuticals          We need to look at the big picture  Escalating natural gas costs have the ability to cut down on consumer spending and stunt economic growth     Pryor said    Businesses that are squeezed by the cost of natural gas won  t be able to expand or worse will be forced to curtail their operations    costing this country even more jobs  From the way we heat our homes to the way we manufacture goods  natural gas prices directly or indirectly affect us all          Pryor said that he was poised to submit legislation in the coming weeks and was hopeful that a few of his proposals could be considered by the Senate before the end of the year          It  s time to put natural gas on the front burner     Pryor said    We can  t wait for natural gas prices to drop on their own  so we must be proactive  As the Appropriations process moves forward I plan to offer my legislation to increase LIHEAP funding  Likewise I plan on attaching my weatherization provision to the next tax bill we consider          Pryor plans to work with his colleagues to offer a bill on natural gas exploration this session          30           NATURAL GAS    PRACTICAL POLICY SOLUTIONS       Allowing States to Opt Out of the Federal Moratorium on Off Shore Exploration      According to the Department of Energy there will be a 40  increase in natural gas demand by 2025  Senator Pryor believes we need to find ways to increase our supply       Pryor will offer legislation that allows states to opt out of a federal moratorium on offshore gas exploration  Under the proposal  states would be able to explore within 125 miles of their coastline        Decisions to opt out of the moratorium would be made by the state  s Governor and legislature  If states   decide to opt out of the moratorium they will be given a limited period of time to explore       In deference to contiguous coastal states that do not wish to opt of the current moratorium  Pryor  s proposal prohibits exploration within 50 miles of those state  s coastlines          Increasing LIHEAP Funding For All Regions of the Country      Senator Pryor  while a strong supporter of LIHEAP  does not believe the program is funded to an adequate level       Pryor is prepared to offer legislation that would raise LIHEAP funding by  3 1 billion dollars  The funding would be distributed to states on a formulaic basis and not at the discretion of HHS        This is important because Pryor believes that when left to its own discretion HHS largely ignores southern states and gives most LIHEAP funding to the northeast  Additionally  Pryor believes that HHS in the past has given preference to states whose homeowners heat their residences with oil  leaving natural gas users with less assistance       Pryor  s legislation would allow low income families in southern states to receive the heating and cooling assistance they need and protects the interests of natural gas users         The Utility Weatherization Partnership Incentive Act      Weatherization programs have enabled millions of low income families to permanently reduce their energy bills and make their homes more efficient  On average  weatherization reduces heating bills by 31  and overall energy bills by  274 a year      However  the DOE estimates that only 5 2 million of the 30 million homes eligible for weatherization have underwent the process and the South has a far lower percentage of weatherized homes than other regions of the country  Pryor believes this is due to a lack of state resources to adequately fund and promote weatherization programs        Pryor plans on offering the Utility Weatherization Partnership Incentive Act  which provides a 20  tax credits for local utilities to establish or expand programs that fund local and state weatherization programs        Pryor  s proposal will encourage more utilities to offer weatherization services for low income families in turn helping them to lower their bills          Promoting Alternative Fuels  Conservation and Efficiency      Senator Pryor believes that we must continue to find ways to diversify our energy supply  This is why he has pushed for increased biodiesel production and has promoted the use of new fuels such as hythane  While he will continue to champion this issue in the Senate  he is also looking at ways to strengthen the public private partnership as it pertains to alternative fuel production  conservation and efficiency        Senator Pryor has recently been named as Chairman of the Alliance to Save Energy  The alliance is a non profit coalition of business  government  environmental  and consumer leaders who promote the efficient and clean use of energy worldwide to benefit the environment  the economy and national security       Pryor looks forward to working with the alliance to find new and innovative solutions to our energy dilemmas          Keeping the Natural Gas Market Free from Manipulation and Gouging      While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reasons for the increase in natural gas prices  it should be noted that prices were already trending upwards  Even before the hurricanes hit  the DOE was forecasting big increases in natural gas prices for the winter        While consumers are suffering  third quarter earnings are expected to be huge for energy companies        Just as he is doing with gasoline prices  Senator Pryor will keep a watchful eye on the natural gas market to ensure consumers and businesses are not getting gouged
