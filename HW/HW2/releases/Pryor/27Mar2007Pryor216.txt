    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         March 27  2007     Press Release        Statement by Senator Pryor On Cochran Amendment to the Iraq War Supplemental                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I supported Senator Cochran s amendment to eliminate public timetables out of the Iraq War Supplemental because I believe that it is a mistake to publicly announce timetables   However  I do not agree with President Bush that America should have an open ended commitment to this war with no end in sight        That is why I support a plan that would force the Administration to create a classified campaign plan for Iraq  including strategic and operational benchmarks and classified redeployment dates   I believe this route provides the necessary direction to the Administration and keeps our troops safe   It is in the best interest of our country to achieve a level of stability in the region and to get our men and women home as soon as possible
