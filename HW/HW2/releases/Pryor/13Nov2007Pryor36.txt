AR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON D C   Senator Mark Pryor today said legislation headed to President Bush to sign into law contains  6 million to help advance prototypes for cutting edge medical units needed on the battlefield  The funding passed as part of the FY2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Act   Pryor has secured more than  17 million to modernize mobile medical units that provide medics with a more immediate and sterile environment in which to treat wounded soldiers  These prototypes will replace outdated medical shelter tents and will be chemically and biologically protected for use on the battlefield  Should the Army adopt the units manufactured by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company  EADS  North America  the assembly  testing and maintenance will take place in Russellville  AR    When a soldier is wounded on the battlefield  every second could mean the difference between life and death  The flexibility of these shelters allows us to provide the very best medical care to wounded soldiers even in the most challenging environments  said Pryor  EADS commitment to build these units in Russellville reconfirms that Arkansas offers a qualified workforce dedicated to finding innovative ways to make our troops safer and more effective   Senator Pryor has demonstrated tremendous leadership and dedication that has lead to an additional  6 million in funding for the Future Medical Shelter System that is being developed here in the Arkansas River Valley  said Jeff Pipkin  executive director for the Arkansas Valley Alliance for Economic Development  We look forward to continuing to work with Senator Pryor and other members of the state delegation to encourage the military to place a higher priority on replacing the outdated MASH style medical shelters that many military doctors privately complain about  It would be an honor for the River Valley to serve an essential role in manufacturing those replacements  which would provide much needed chemical and biological protections that our troops deserve to have   Russellville Mayor Tyrone Williamson stated  As a former city council member and now as mayor  I have been thoroughly impressed by Senator Pryors attention to the medical needs of our men and woman in uniform and his commitment to help the River Valley become a leader in building state of the art mobile medical combat care units  It is critically important to the well being of the River Valley for us to have a diverse economy and this project will serve a valuable role by adding a new industry vertical    I applaud Senator Pryors dedication to improving combat causality care  added Pope County Judge Jim Ed Gibson  The River Valley has hundreds of men and women serving in the military that I am sure will be grateful knowing that Senator Pryor is prodding our military to replace the decades old tent operating rooms with modern chemical and biological resistant hard shell units  I personally think it is misguided for the Bush Administration to provide funding to construct new hospitals in Iraq while ignoring the fact that our troops are still using tents designed during an era when I listened to music on 8 track tapes    Our entire congressional delegation  led by Senator Pryor  is doing an excellent job at attending to our economic needs  said Brad Wear  Yell County Judge  Our economy if fairly concentrated around agricultural products and the service industry  so adding a major defense manufacturing facility would be a tremendous accomplishment for the River Valley and the entire state   Conway County Judge Jimmy Hart stated  The success of this project is directly attributable to Senator Pryors thorough knowledge of military matters  his position on the Senate Armed Services Committee and commitment to ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the best possible care while they serve our country in combat  With his continued dedication  I am hopeful that he will be able to convince the military to replace the outdated tents that our military doctors are currently using before this becomes another Walter Reed style debacle    The FY2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Act also includes a 3 5  pay raise for military personnel  an additional  70 million to better meet the medical needs of wounded service members   11 6 billion for body armor and mine resistant vehicles   980 million to equip the National Guard and Reserve forces and  2 6 billion to provide military families with the immediate need for more counselors  teachers and child care providers
