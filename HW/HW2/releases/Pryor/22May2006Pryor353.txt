    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         May 22  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On the FTC  s Investigation of Gas Price Gouging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The FTC  s recommendation to drive less is unacceptable following today  s conclusion that price gouging exists at multiple levels within the oil industry   This investigation  which I ordered last September  confirms my suspicion that consumers are being ripped off at the pump  I am dismayed that the FTC proceeds to justify this behavior with excuses  and then recommends that Congress should have no role in ensuring Americans have access to affordable gas       If Congress had a federal law on the books to make price gouging illegal  several retailers  refineries and wholesalers would be punished instead of lining their pockets  People in Arkansas and across the nation know we need protections in place to defend them from the greed and profiteering in the oil marketplace  and I plan to address these issues as we move forward
