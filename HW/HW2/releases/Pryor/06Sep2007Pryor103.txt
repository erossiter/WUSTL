airfield to repair deteriorated runway and shoulder pavements  remove or eliminate airfield obstructions  replace runway lighting  and reorganize instrument guidance and navigation systems  This

to keep it that way and will continue to improve the resources and equipment available to those who train and work at the base  Pryor said  These airfield upgrades are expensive  but necessary to our missions around the globe   For the safety and security of our citizens and our homeland  we must continue to invest in our nations military installments and strategic operations  Lincoln said  The men and women of the Little Rock Air Force Base and Camp Robinson play critical roles in our national defense and are a source of pride for our state as they carry on Arkansass long military tradition
