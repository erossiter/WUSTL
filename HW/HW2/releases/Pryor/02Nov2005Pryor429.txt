    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         November 2  2005     Press Release        Floor Statement by Senator Mark Pryor   on Opposition to the Grassley Amendment on Payment Limits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mr  President  I rise in opposition to the Grassley Amendment on further payment limits       The 2002 Farm Bill is a contract that we made with America  s farm families and the promises we have made to them  and which their bankers have relied upon  should not be broken and changed midstream  To not break our promise to these farm families should be enough  but for my colleagues who need more guidance  I would ask them to read USDA  s bipartisan payment limit commission  The findings of this commission said the same thing  don  t change the rules midstream  If you change the terms of a contract  you wait until the contract has expired        I think this reconciliation effort is misguided  Mr  President  But I will also say that the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee worked overtime to make sure that no one was singled out to carry a disproportionate burden that all farmers were treated fairly  I thank him for that effort        In fact  because of the WTO ruling in the Brazil cotton case  cotton has actually borne a larger burden than other crops because it has shared in the other cuts  but it has also lost an important program known as Cotton Step II   Now the authors of this amendment seek to add yet another burden for cotton producers  along with rice producers  peanut producers  and other higher cost production crops grown in the South       Perhaps the worst thing about this amendment  Mr  President  is the timing  it couldn  t be worse   LA  AR  MS  AL  TX all are reeling from hurricanes  In Arkansas alone  hurricane damage to crops is estimated at  900 million by the University of Arkansas Extension Service       If the Senate passes this amendment  we will be delivering another blow to regions already economically devastated by hurricanes  Right now  prices are low  Cost of production is at an all time high  Our farmers are dealing with these low prices along with record energy prices  threats of merit less WTO challenges  and storm damage coming on the heels of the worst drought my state has seen in over 50 years  Passing this amendment will be adding insult to injury       There have been a lot of myths perpetuated on the subject of payment limits and this Farm Bill over the past five years  way too many to refute in the time I have here   One of the best examples I can think of is where the Environmental Working Group accuses a guy named Riceland in my home state of Arkansas of taking boatloads of money under the Farm Bill   What they don  t tell you is that Riceland is a 9 000 member plus farmer owned cooperative  All of them share in this assistance  I would like to remind my colleagues of some good advice from long ago  A lie makes it halfway around the world before the truth even gets its shoes laced        I promise my colleagues we will get the truth out they are based on facts and numbers  and we will get those facts out  The facts show that our farmers are the best in the world  They work hard to supply this country with a stable  abundant  safe  and affordable food supply that is domestically produced  That is important Mr  President  because I think all of my colleagues would agree that we never want to be in the situation with our food supply that we are with our energy supply dependent on foreign sources  It is much too important  and I consider it a matter of national security        If we pass this amendment  If we begin to take away support and stability from our farmers who produce enough food to feed this country  then we are saying we do not value domestic agriculture production in this country       It is a small price to pay  Mr  President  for the return on investment we get  One half of 1  of the entire federal budget is devoted to support for our farmers  That is the price we pay to be able to go to the store and buy a bag of rice at the same price today that we did yesterday  It is indeed a small price and one we should pay       Educating folks on this issue is a lot tougher than spreading falsehoods  but I will spend my time educating my colleagues on this issue  It is too important to my state and this country        Advocates of this approach outside the Senate do not support the Farm Bill it is merely a divide and conquer tactic to pit farmer against farmer  rural against urban  Don  t let that happen  This is important to all Americans  both rural and urban       I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment
