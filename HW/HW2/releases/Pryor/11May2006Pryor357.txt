    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         May 11  2006     Press Release        On Small Business Health Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Small businesses all over Arkansas are struggling to pay increasing health care premiums  which is why I had hoped the Senate this week would approve legislation to allow employees of small business owners and the self employed to be pooled together in order to obtain quality  affordable health care coverage     Unfortunately  the bill proposed by Senator Mike Enzi offered the wrong prescription  By not including reasonable federal protections and exempting insurers from laws that have been enacted by states to protect patients  Arkansans would risk losing guaranteed coverage for emergency services  hospice care  mental health  mammography screenings  and diabetic supplies  These protections are necessary to ensure patients receive the care they deserve because insurance companies are more often concerned about their bottom line than a patient  s health  This bill also was opposed by over 40 state Attorneys General   This bill could have been improved through the amendment process  however  the Senate Majority Leader prevented any amendments from being given serious consideration     I commend Senator Blanche Lincoln for introducing a more sensible bill  which I co sponsored  that allows small businesses to band together without compromising state protection laws  I will continue to press the Senate leadership to return to this matter  particularly to Senator Lincoln  s bill  so that employers can provide affordable health coverage without breaking the bank
