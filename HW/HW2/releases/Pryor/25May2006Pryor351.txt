                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Says Identity Theft Protections Must Become a Priority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WASHINGTON D C     Senator Mark Pryor today said the personal information of 26 5 million veterans should never have been compromised  and he urged his Senate colleagues to move ahead with his   security freeze    legislation that would protect individuals when such security breaches do occur       During a joint hearing by the Senate  s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Veterans Committee  Pryor criticized the Veterans Administration  VA  for its lax security that has now led to a missing disk full of veterans   names  social security numbers and dates of birth  Pryor said he was also alarmed the VA waited three weeks before informing the public about the theft  the largest unauthorized disclosure ever of Social Security data       Veterans affected by the security breach  primarily those discharged after 1975 and some of their spouses  can call a toll free hotline 800 333 4636  to learn more information         Identity theft is a serious concern  costing consumers time and money to fix  The fact that millions of veterans are now at risk because of a government mistake makes this breach all the more troubling  It  s critical the VA and law enforcement take immediate steps to mitigate any further anxiety or damage created by this incident     Pryor said      Pryor added that while there have not been reports of identity theft resulting from the stolen disk  veterans should have a better way to protect themselves instead of having to collect credit reports and keep a careful eye on their credit in the future   He asked Senate leadership to expedite plans for the full Senate to consider S 1408  the Identity Theft Protection Act  A major component of this legislation is Pryor  s   security freeze    initiative  which would allow any individual the option to place a freeze on their credit records thereby preventing businesses and potential thieves from looking at their credit files and opening up new accounts in their victim  s names  If the consumer applies for credit  he or she may lift the freeze temporarily so the application can be processed   S 1408 was passed by the Commerce Committee on December 8  2005  and has since been awaiting consideration by the full Senate        This latest security breach by the VA is an example of why consumers should have control over their own personal financial information  and why Congress must pass meaningful identity theft protections     Pryor said     If these veterans had the ability to fully protect themselves with a   security freeze     we could all rest a lot easier             30       Senator Pryor submitted his full opening statement into the hearing record      Chairman Collins and Chairman Craig  Ranking Lieberman and Ranking Member Akaka  I would like to thank you for holding this very important hearing on the data breach of personal information at the Department of Veteran  s Affairs     On May 3rd  as many as 26 5 million veterans   names  birth dates  and social security numbers were stolen from the home of a Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  employee  This represents the largest unauthorized disclosure ever of Social Security data    I find it very disturbing that the personal information of this large number of American veterans has been potentially compromised  I find it even more disturbing  and frankly alarming  that the VA waited over three weeks to notify the public of this very large breach     For years the VA Inspector General has criticized the department for its lax information security  and for years nothing has been done to fix the problem   It is incumbent on the VA  other government agencies  and the business community to do everything they can to guard that personal information from those who would use it for ill will  Clearly  this is not happening      In 2005 alone there were 151 breach incidents affecting 57 7 million Americans  So far in 2006  there have been nearly 80 large breaches   Nationwide  27 3 million Americans over the past five years have been victims of identity theft  costing them over  5 billion at an average of  5 686   Similarly  the cost to businesses and financial institutions has been in excess of  48 billion  In my home state of Arkansas  there was a 15  increase in identity theft cases in 2005 a record total of over 1 600 Arkansans had their identity stolen      Since businesses and government agencies have not always acted responsibly  the Congress has a responsibility to put a stop to security breaches and ID Theft  To say this is a problem that needs to be addressed by the United States Congress is a gross understatement  it is an epidemic that must be confronted with a strong response     Identity theft should not be a cost of doing business for American companies and American consumers should not have to constantly worry that someone will open new credit in their name  It is my hope that Congress will act swiftly  Last year I introduced S  1336  legislation that would provide consumers with the option of placing a   security freeze    on their credit account to prevent thieves from opening new credit accounts in their victims   names   The security freeze is voluntary and different than a Fraud Alert  and consumers would have the option of thawing the freeze in advance of applying for new credit  This concept was included in legislation the Commerce Committee approved last July  S  1408  the Identity Theft Protection Act    This latest incident should serve as a reminder to my colleagues that we need to pass meaningful identity theft legislation this year   I encourage my colleagues to support that effort  and I call on Senator Frist and Senator Reid to schedule floor time for this important legislation  American consumers cannot wait for another large breach of their information
