    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         April 14  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs On Homeland Security Grant Funding   Senator Mark Pryor submitted the following statement during a Senate hearing on revising the funding formula for how first responder grants are distributed  During the hearing  Pryor argued that rural states  like Arkansas  should not take a back seat to states with higher populations         In the end  the Committee approved compromise legislation where each state would receive a minimum of 0 55 percent of homeland security grant funding   This is in contrast to a proposal by President Bush and the House of Representatives that would cut funding to a minimum of 0 25 percent  Pryor said he is hopeful the House of Representatives and the President will accept the Senate  s formula  which enables first responders in all states to be better prepared for the next attack  not the last        I would like to begin by commending the leadership of Senators Susan Collins and Joseph Lieberman in writing this legislation  I understand that there has been pressure from both the Administration and the House of Representatives to turn to a more   risk based system    of awarding homeland security grants       I applaud my Senate colleagues for their ability to seek common ground and find a compromise that addresses some of the concerns of the Administration and House while not turning their backs on the needs of small states       Personally  I would have liked to seen the funding formula for homeland security grants reflect a  75 percent minimum per state  but I know that Senators Collins and Lieberman worked very hard to be fair and so I stand with them on this legislation        I know just as there are others like myself who wish the funding formula would reflect a  75 percent minimum  there are others in Congress who believe that the funding formula for homeland security grants should solely reflect perceived threat and risk  While I understand their concerns  I respectfully disagree with my colleagues on the merits of their argument         Conventional wisdom might suggest that another terrorist attack will involve a target rich environment    a big bustling city with sky scrapers and millions of people   Conventional wisdom suggests that terrorists might strike at a location or symbol that personifies America  I say however to adopt this conventional mindset  that to only rely on conventional wisdom  to only rely on conventional assumptions sets us up for unforeseen but certain tragedy       I ask my colleagues  Four years ago could we have fathomed 19 terrorists hijacking American airliners with box cutters no less  Could we have fathomed  these hijackers using those airliners to conduct suicide missions  Could we have fathomed watching as two airplanes struck the World Trade Center and yet another crashing into the Pentagon       Just one month after that  as America was pulling itself out of the ashes  still recovering from the horrific acts of September 11th 2001  did anyone foresee an envelope being sent to Senator Tom Daschle  s office that would cause the largest biological attack on American soil and effectively shut down the Senate Hart Building for several months       We look back at these events now in hindsight and I think we have learned a lot about our enemy and what it will take for us to both win the war on terror and defend our homeland    But let us remember  we must be prepared for the next terrorist attack  not the last  And that terrorist attack could come in many shapes and sizes        I think it is arrogant to believe terrorists would never strike at our heartland  That they would not attempt to attack our food supply or our nuclear and chemical plants located in both large and small states  It  s arrogant to think that the next attack will be similar to the first  and to prepare with such narrow vision           I do not hold myself up as an expert on terrorism  but I do understand one thing  The goal of terrorism is to disrupt our lives  to make us fearful  It doesn  t take an attack on a major city for terrorists to achieve this goal        I dare say that an attack in Little Rock has the ability to deliver the same impact to our psyche  financial security and overall ability to function as a country as would an attack in Los Angeles or New York   In order for America to be protected from terrorism  we need all parts of the country to be prepared   The minute we turn our attention and resources away from a large part of our country based on a hunch  we will surely be inviting trouble         Local and state entities and first responders across the nation have worked doggedly to make our nation safer  and they have   They must be able to respond to whatever may confront them in the future  But how can they properly respond when they are not given adequate resources        With the legislation offered by Senator Collins and Lieberman  state homeland security will be based on the essential capabilities necessary to prepare for potential terrorist attacks  major disasters  and other emergencies    no matter where they might occur   No one can know where the terrorists will attack  but with the National Preparedness Goal all of us know what essential capabilities are needed to respond   We need to know that we have the capability to respond as a Nation  and not just the best guess communities       September 11th made us acutely aware that there are vulnerabilities in our homeland but it also made us acutely aware of the need of genuine partnerships that involve all segments of our communities and all levels of government    we all have a role in keeping our community safe       So I submit that part of the job of the federal government must be to ensure that local governments are given the resources to protect their citizenry and that we all share the responsibilities for homeland security wisely and fairly        I ask that my colleagues on this committee and in the U S  Senate consider my observations and my questions because this is not the last time we will have this conversation  However  my fear is that we will continue to look at homeland security grants as a small state  large state issue instead of a United States issue
