    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         November 10  2005     Press Release        A Congressional Floor Speech by Senator Mark Pryor to Commemorate Veterans Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As Veterans Day approaches  we pay homage to the soldiers who once stormed the beaches of Normandy  reclaimed the mountains of Korea and crossed the sands of Kuwait  We pay homage to our veterans   sacrifice and courage  and also to the brave men and women who now follow their example in places like Iraq and Afghanistan        In paying respect  we must also follow through on our nation  s commitment  s to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they earned and deserve       Arkansas has a long and distinguished record of service  one that my state is proud of  and one that we will continue to build upon   In addition to honorable service by our active duty soldiers  marines  seamen and airmen  the Arkansas National Guard has mobilized more than 8 000 of its Guardsmen since Sept  11  2001   In fact  this Veterans Day is an especially poignant one for families in Rogers  AR where 180 Guardsmen have just been deployed to serve in Iraq        Arkansas is not alone in its commitment to military service   Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  there are 393 000 new veterans to care for  including 103 000 who are currently seeking health care from VA hospitals         We can never truly repay our veterans for their service to our nation  but we can care for them just as they cared for us  In honor of these men and women  Senator Norm Coleman and I have introduced the Veterans Benefits Outreach Act to help ensure that all veterans collect the benefits they have earned but for whatever reason are not receiving         Nearly 600 000 veterans nationwide are not receiving the benefits they are entitled to  often due to a simple lack of knowledge that they are eligible          Instead of veterans having to cut through bureaucracy to learn about and receive the various benefits they earn  our bill seeks to bring this information to them  It requires the VA to prepare a plan to identify veterans who are not enrolled in programs they are eligible for and an action plan to enroll them       This measure represents an opportunity to help our current veterans and meet the challenges we foresee instead of waiting until benefit problems escalate for a new generation of veterans   I hope this Veterans Day will add the necessary momentum for the full Senate to consider and pass this measure       We owe this to veterans like Chaplain  Colonel  David McLemore    a soldier  s soldier who has dedicated a career of providing outreach to servicemen and women in the field        Chaplain McLemore is a native Arkansan and has served as a chaplain in the Arkansas Army National Guard for 21 years   During that time he has served soldiers at the company  battery  battalion  and brigade level   He has personally answered the call to duty in two wars  Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom II         In both of these conflicts  Chaplain McLemore served on the front lines with combat units  where he ministered to soldiers conducting the day to day fight with the enemy   Chaplain McLemore always chose to be up front providing a   Ministry of Presence    to those in the greatest place of danger       Those who served in combat with Chaplain McLemore knew that he would always be there with a listening ear  an open heart  and a guiding hand   His mere presence gave courage and inspiration to those who knew that they could lose their lives at any minute         As any chaplain  Chaplain McLemore did not carry a weapon as he faced the perils of combat  but the soldiers he served with knew that he carried more firepower than any of them  the grace and word of God  and they always wanted Chaplain McLemore and that firepower with them          They knew that he risked his life every day for one mission  to serve them   In the simple but strong bond of combat  it was clear that Chaplain McLemore loved his fellow soldiers and they loved him       Two months after his return from Operation Iraqi Freedom II  Chaplain McLemore was involved in a motorcycle accident where he sustained severe injuries   Today  he fights to recover from those injuries in the Veterans Administration Hospital in North Little Rock  Arkansas         As he does  he has the prayers  respect  and encouragement from us and all of his fellow soldiers   We honor him today for his commitment and selfless service to God  his country  and his fellow soldiers   Thank you Chaplain David McLemore   God Bless and God speed       We owe all our veterans not only our gratitude  but also our freedoms and American way of life   Our military has kept us safe for a long time  We cannot thank them enough  but we can begin to repay their sacrifices by providing them with the resources they need in the field and the support they have earned when they return home
