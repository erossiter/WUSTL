                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator Mark Pryor  D AR  today submitted the following statement into the Congressional Record regarding the House passage of consumer protection legislation   Mr  President  I rise today to speak on an issue that is extremely important to families all across the countryconsumer product safety  I have spent the past year working with several of my colleagues to reform and reinvigorate the agency charged with protecting consumers from unsafe products  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   These efforts have resulted in good progress  We have restored the Commissions ability to conduct business without a quorum  we have provided historic increases in CPSCs funding  and we have passed pool safety legislation to protect children from drain entrapment  Earlier this fall  I introduced legislation  S  2045  the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act of 2007  to ensure the CPSC has the authority and tools they need to protect families from dangerous imported products  We have all seen enough evidence in the press and on our retailers shelves to know that reform is needed  Senators Inouye  Durbin  Klobuchar  Bill Nelson  Brown  Schumer  Menendez  Casey  and Harkin have all joined me in this historic effort  and their contributions to the bill have been enormous  The Senate Commerce Committee reported S  2045 in October by voice vote  Since that time  we have been working in a bipartisan fashion to move our legislation out of the Senate and to provide these protections for the American public    As many of you are aware  the House of Representatives is scheduled to consider their version of CPSC reform today  I applaud the House for getting involved in this very important issue and was pleased to see that many of the ideas we developed in S  2045 were incorporated into the House bill  I believe this effort is a very important first step to reauthorize this agency and provide it with some of the tools necessary to work more diligently on behalf of the American consumer  This is a goal that I share with all cosponsors of my bill  many of my colleagues in the Senate  and my counterparts in the House  While the House bill is a good step  I believe S  2045 contains many additional reforms critical to improving our consumer product safety laws  I also believe the Senate now stands poised to build upon the actions of the House and provide even greater assurances to the American public   Though I would have preferred to accomplish this task this year  and we have worked very hard to make this a reality  it seems the timing of the rest of the week simply makes this task nearly impossible  I would say to my colleagues in the Senate that we are very close to achieving bipartisan compromise to allow this bill to go forward early next year  I have expressed to the Majority Leader my desire to continue to move forward with S  2045  and I hope to secure time for floor consideration at the earliest possible time when Congress returns in January  Consumer product safety is too important to the American people to not give them our very best effort  and I believe the Senate needs time to consider this legislation on the Senate floor    I would like to take a moment to highlight some areas of concern that I have with the House legislation where the Senate legislation provides greater protection  areas that I hope to improve upon when Congress returns next year  To begin  S  2045 provides greater reauthorization levels for a longer length of time than H R  4040  While the House seeks to reauthorize the CPSC for three years  S  2045 reauthorizes the CPSC for seven years  S  2045 provides over  526 million more in authorized funding than H R  4040  Our legislation takes a long term approach to reauthorize the agency  which I believe brings stability to the agency in addition to their enforcement efforts  The last time the CPSC was reauthorized was in 1990 for only a two year period  During the seventeen years between the last authorization and now  the CPSC has withered on the vine  a victim of underfunding and understaffing  I believe the systemic problems that have surfaced over these seventeen years demonstrate the need for looking forward to the future as we debate reauthorization    The Senate bill also gives greater authority to state Attorneys General to assist the CPSC in their consumer product enforcement efforts  While H R  4040 only provides state Attorneys General with a very limited role in protecting consumers  S  2045 ensures that these officials can act as real cops on the beat  looking out for consumers and restoring confidence in the marketplace by enforcing the provisions of the entire Consumer Product Safety Act  not limited sections   S  2045 also furthers the mission of the CPSC by placing more information about dangerous products in the hands of families when the dangers become known instead of allowing manufacturers to bog down the disclosure of information through lengthy court battles  S  2045 will allow parents to make educated and cautious decisions about the products they are placing in their homes  While the House bill only seeks to clarify the existing statute in this respect  the Senate bill can actually place real and timely information in the hands of consumers  I believe such a result can only enhance the security and well being of our fellow Americans   One very important difference between the House and Senate version of this legislation is the standards set for testing childrens toys  H R  4040 asks the CPSC to decide if current voluntary standards are feasible for manufacturers testing procedures and whether they should be adopted  Its very obvious to me  as well as millions of moms  dads and grandparents around the country that testing requirements must be elevated  S  2045 would make these voluntary standards mandatory for testing and safety   Furthermore  S  2045 adds real teeth to the enforcement capabilities of the CPSC  Though I applaud the House for increasing civil penalties to which a violator may be subject to  10 million  I do not believe this level is sufficient to deter bad actors  Placing dangerous products in the hands of American consumers must not be the cost of doing business  S  2045 increases the cap in civil penalties to  100 million and strengthens criminal penalties for those aggravated violators that seemingly show a disregard to the health and safety of consumers and the laws enacted by this body  H R  4040 does not remove the requirement that the CPSC notify violators of noncompliance prior to seeking criminal penalties  This may seem minor  but this provision of the Consumer Product Safety Act has hamstrung the CPSCs ability to pursue egregious violators to the point where only one such violator has been pursued  Even the Presidents Import Safety Working Group has recommended this change    Last  S  2045 provides important protections for employees who stand up for public safety by blowing the whistle on unsafe products or practices  These whistleblower protections are extremely important to catching unsafe products before they enter the stream of commerce  Employees are often on the front lines of consumer product safety  and I believe they deserve protection from retribution if they report activities they believe to be in violation of the law  H R  4040 does not provide whistleblower protections    There are many other areas I could highlight where S  2045 can provide more meaningful reform than H R  4040  but I believe these to be some of the most important  I would like my colleagues to know of my commitment for this body to consider and pass meaningful consumer product safety reform next year  I will continue to work tirelessly on this legislation over the holiday recess  and I will continue to work with my colleagues across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation  I thank them for their hard work during this process and am encouraged with the progress we have made in just the past few days    Finally  Id like to thank the co sponsors of this legislation for their leadership and persistence on consumer product safety  This has certainly been a team effort  and I look forward to continuing to work with them to resolve this matter when we return
