drivers and trucking companies  The full text of Pryor s letter is below           The Honorable Mary Peters  Secretary  U S  Department of Transportation  400 Seventh Street S W   Washington  D C  20590        Dear Secretary Peters          I am writing to express my concerns with the recently announced Department of Transportation s  DOT  pilot program to allow 100 Mexican domiciled trucking companies to operate beyond the current 25 mile commercial zone   I also want to express my disappointment with the Department and FMCSA s lack of communication in  informing me and other members of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation prior to DOT s public announcement on February 23  2007       As you may recall  during your confirmation hearing on September 9  2006  I expressed my interest and concern about a rumored pilot program that would allow Mexican domiciled trucks to operate beyond their current scope of authority   During my questioning  you clearly stated that you questioned staff at DOT about the pilot program and were told that there was no immediate plan to implement such a program   You also stated that you would get down to the bottom of the  so called  rumors surrounding the issue   I concluded my questioning by stating that I would very much appreciate having a dialogue with your department and the agencies that may be developing this program   Unfortunately  I ve yet to hear from you or FMCSA regarding this pilot program       Since your public announcement of this pilot program  I have conducted a brief overview of the proposed pilot program   As you can imagine  I still have many questions regarding this program and am most concerned about potential safety and security risks that may come with its implementation   Specifically  I m very concerned with the ability of the Department of Transportation and other homeland security agencies to ensure 100  compliance to all safety  insurance  and emission standards as well as fees and taxes currently required for domestic trucks  drivers and trucking companies         The Department s failure to communicate the plan to rollout this program has frustrated me   I believe there are other members on the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Technology and in the Senate that share my concerns   I m hopeful that the Senate will soon examine the Department s proposal and the lack of communication between the Department and Members of Congress   Please know that I continue to maintain an interest in this issue and wish to work with you  but this must include constructive dialogues with interested parties  as well as Members of Congress   I would appreciate you keeping me and other interested members informed of any future developments on this pilot program and any other plans to expand operation authority to foreign domiciled trucks         In addition  I would appreciate an update on a trucking security amendment that I offered during debate of the Port Security bill that became Public Law  P L  109 347  on October 13  2006    My trucking security amendment became Section 703 of the law  Section 703 provided three directives for DOT   The first was for DOT to issue regulations to verify legal status of all licensed commercial drivers   The second was for DOT to develop commercial driver s license antifraud programs   The third and final directive was for DOT to issue guidelines for Federal  State and local law enforcement personnel on how to identify noncompliance with Federal laws uniquely applicable to commercial motor vehicle and commercial motor vehicle drivers engaged in cross border traffic   These directives are to be completed within an 18 month time frame       Thank you for considering my request   I look forward to working with you on this issue in the future   Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance       Sincerely       Mark Pryor      Cc   Administrator John Hill  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrator
