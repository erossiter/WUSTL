                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON  D C   Eight Senators  four Democrats and four Republicans  today introduced legislation that would make the Iraq Study Group recommendations the basis for future U S  strategy in Iraq    Senators Salazar and Alexander were joined by a bipartisan coalition of their colleagues  including Senators Bob Bennett  R UT   Mark Pryor  D AR   Judd Gregg  R NH   Robert Casey  D PA   John Sununu  R NH  and Blanche Lincoln  D AR   in introducing the   We are gaining momentum on our bipartisan effort to implement the recommendationsdeveloped by some of Americas most thoughtful and experienced leaders on our future strategy in Iraq  said Salazar  I am proud to sponsor this legislation with my Republican and Democratic colleagues  The American people expect us to find a solution to the situation in Iraq  this legislation sets us on the right track diplomatically  economically and militarily to doso   For the sake of U S  troops fighting in Iraq and their families  Washington needs to put aside partisan sniping and reach across party lines to agree on a way forward in Iraq  said Alexander  The Iraq Study Group report is a strategy for tomorrow  It offers a reasonable solution for getting out of the combat business in Iraq and into the support  equipping and training business in a prompt and honorable way   The legislation we are offering will give the president and Congress new opportunities to work together to find solutions for a more stable Iraq  The Iraq Study Group performed a thorough analysis of the situation in Iraq  and this bill reflects the bipartisan support for their recommendations  said Bennett  I am honored to join with my friends on both sides of the aisle as we work toward progress in Iraq   Every day our troops work as a team in the field to achieve their mission  Congress and the President must do the same  Pryor said  This strategy helps stabilize the region  holds the Iraqis accountable for progress  and turns over responsibility to the Iraqis so American troops can come home   The Iraq Study Group Implementation Act of 2007 helps chart a responsible path forward and it does so in a way that prizes serious  thoughtful policy over partisan rhetoric  said Gregg The report lays out a comprehensive plan that was forged out of consensus and one that can change the political climate here in Congress    A majority of the Congress have made clear their desire to change course in Iraq  I supported the provisions to transition the mission in Iraq contained in the supplemental spending bill vetoed by the President  said Casey  Yet  unless we achieve more bipartisan consensus in the Congress that a change is necessary  an impasse will continue  It is for that reason that I believe the Iraq Study Groups prescribed course of action represents our best hope for a new way forward in Iraq   This legislation focuses on improving the security situation in Iraq while moving toward the withdrawal of combat forces  said Senator John Sununu  a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Guided by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group Report  which I endorsed upon its release last year  the bill provides a realistic approach to achieving reconciliation and stability within the Iraqi government  maintaining sovereign Iraqi borders  and ending sectarian violence  No American serviceman or woman should remain in Iraq a day longer than is absolutely necessary  This legislation takes an important step toward improving conditions so that a stable  democratic  and prosperous Iraq may emerge   Americans are exhausted by continuous accounts of violence and frustrated by news that the Iraqi government has failed to take more responsibility for its own future  Lincoln said  It is clear that our open ended commitment in Iraq is not working  and the Iraq Study Groups report offers critical guidance for a much needed new direction   Former Secretary of State James A  Baker III and former Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Lee H  Hamilton co chaired the December report that seeks to bring a responsible conclusion tothe Iraq War  Both Mr  Baker and Mr  Hamilton have confirmed that the legislation accurately reflects the recommendations of the ISG report    Salazar and Alexanders bill sets a new way forward by establishing as United States policy   A new diplomatic offensive in the region that includes the creation of the Iraq International Support Group   Giving the highest priority to training  equipping and advising the Iraqi military and security forces    Assessing the full budgetary and personnel impact of the war in Iraq on the U  S  military   Accelerating and increasing oil production and accountability including equitable distribution of oil revenuesin Iraq   Implementingand conducting oversight ofeconomic reconstruction programs in Iraq with the creation of a new Senior Advisor for Economic Reconstruction   Ensuring that the President includes the cost of the war in his annual budget request  and  Setting conditions that could lead to redeployment of U S  combat brigades not needed for force protection as early as the first quarter of 2008 if diplomatic  infrastructure and security benchmarks are met   In the House  a companion bill will be introduced by Rep  Mark Udall  D CO  and co sponsored by Rep  Frank Wolf  R VA   Mike McCaul  R TX  and Dan Lipinski  D IL    President Bush  while speaking at the
