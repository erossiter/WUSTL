    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         April 20  2005     Press Release        Congressional Record Statement by Senator Mark Pryor In Support of C 130J Funding in the Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator Pryor made the following floor statement in support of his amendment to the Iraq Afghanistan Emergency Supplemental Bill that would prevent the Bush Administration and Members of Congress from terminating current C 130J contracts this year   Pryor joined Senators Saxby Chambliss  R GA  and John Isakson  R GA  in introducing the amendment        I stand with Senator Saxby Chambliss  and strongly support his amendment to ensure the C 130J contracts continue without interruption this year         The C 130J has quickly been adapted to play vital and unique roles in our national defense efforts   Today  both U S  and Allied C 130Js are performing operational missions in CENTCOM with a mission capable rate of over 90 percent   The J performs missions in Iraq in one day that requires the C 130E or H model two days  It is equally critical for relief operations like the Tsunami effort in Asia  where lives were spared due to the C 130J  s quick capabilities       I have made several visits to the Little Rock Air Force Base  the premier training facility for the C 130J  and I have seen first hand the J model  s new features and capabilities   The C 130Js climb higher and faster  flies at higher cruise speeds  takes off and lands in a shorter distance  and is easier  safer and cheaper to operate than its predecessor        The military officials and troops who I  ve talked with want to continue using C 130Js and they depend on the model  s new features on the ground  Cutting production of the C 130Js would not only deny our soldiers the cutting edge technology they need on today  s battlefield  but it would leave the Air Force and Marine Corps with an aging and far less capable tactical airlift         As I am sure my colleagues are aware  the Air Force recently grounded or severely restricted the flying of 90 C 130s due to old age   Eighty four of these carriers are assigned to the active duty Air Force  By further terminating the contracts for C 130Js  we would be leaving the Air Force unable to meet its future tactical requirements   The Air Force will be 116 aircraft short of requirement and the Marine Corps will be short 18 aircraft       Terminating the C 130J contracts is short sighted from a tactical standpoint  but it is also foolish from a financial standpoint   Terminating the current contracts could cost taxpayers more than the cost of building new carriers   Liability fees for ending the C 130J multiyear contracts are estimated at  1 3 billion for the Air Force and  0 3 billion for the Marine Corps for a total of  1 6 billion  This estimate does not include the increased costs of maintaining aging planes   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help ensure our military has the equipment it needs to effectively and safely carry out their missions  now and in the future
