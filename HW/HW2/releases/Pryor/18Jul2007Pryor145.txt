    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         July 18  2007     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On the Levin Reed Iraq Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I have serious concerns that a public timetable will incite Iraqi insurgents  put our troops in danger and undercut flexibility for commanders on the ground  For this reason  I oppose even the arbitrary timetable set forth by the Levin Reed amendment  This amendment  while calling for withdrawal of troops  leaves an ambiguous limited presence behind for force protection  training and equipping Iraqi Security Forces  No one can define if this limited presence is a significant reduction in forces or a slight reduction of what we have on the ground now    President Bush has failed to provide our troops with a plan to turn over responsibility to the Iraqi people and bring them home  Therefore  Republicans and Democrats must step in and stop trying to outmaneuver one another to score political points so that the Senate can be part of a solution  Thats why I favor an up or down vote on this amendment  The Senate must move past this stalemate and return to work on the Defense Authorization bill  Part of this debate should include a vote on a bipartisan amendment I support to implement the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  This comprehensive plan provides a more responsible alternative to get the U S  out of the combat business and into the support  training and equipping business
