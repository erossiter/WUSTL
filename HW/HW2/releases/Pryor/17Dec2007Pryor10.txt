                                                                                                                                         Requires More Vigorous Process in Vetting Project Bidders  Developers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON  U S Senators Mark Pryor  D Arkansas  and Saxby Chambliss  R Georgia  both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today introduced legislation to enhance oversight of military housing privatization projects  The legislation is also cosponsored by U S  Senator Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas   I look forward to hearing from the Air Force and Department of Defense regarding how they will change their oversight and management for these projects  said Chambliss  I believe that this process can work  but in certain cases it didnt work  and we need assurances that it will not happen again  The Air Force is the pro active agent in this process and needs to ensure that the proper oversight and management procedures are in place and adhered to    In Little Rock  we have rows of cement floors  unfinished housing and unpaid bills to subcontractors when we should have brand new  affordable housing in place for our Air Force families  Pryor said  Our bill helps the Pentagon establish better oversight and accountability procedures before  during and after doling out millions of dollars in taxpayer money   Specifically  the bill  titled The Military Housing Privatization Initiative Oversight and Accountability Act of 2007    Mandates that the Department of Defense  DoD  establish and adhere to a robust  effective oversight plan to successfully manage and maintain project performance and schedule   Ensures more effective oversight of funding and that any payments are consistent with the amount of work performed on a project  Requires a more vigorous process in vetting project bidders and developers before selecting awardees and approving transactions   Mandates increased communication between bondholders and DoD to ensure that the bondholders act more rapidly when project performance is inadequate   Requires DoD to ensure bidders guaranteed maximum price proposals are reasonable   Requires a higher level of bonding to protect the rights of subcontractors and ensure they can re coup expenses in the event of project default   Ensures that developers or project owners that create LLCs to execute specific projects receive unsatisfactory performance ratings if the LLC itself fails to perform according to standards   Requires DoD to certify that project owners or developers who are awarded projects have the construction experience commensurate with executing the project  For project owners or developers awarded a project who have previously declared bankruptcy  requires DoD to specify the extent to which issues related to the bankruptcy impact their ability to execute the project in question     Last week Pryor and Chambliss led a bipartisan group of senators in sending a letter to Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne criticizing the Air Forces oversight of housing privatization projects in Arkansas  Georgia  Florida  and Massachusetts and urged the Air Force to explain how they plan to quickly restore the current failing projects as well as how they will change their privatized housing oversight and management processes  The letter was also signed by U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln  D Arkansas  Johnny Isakson  R Georgia  Bill Nelson  D Florida  Mel Martinez  R Florida  Edward Kennedy  D Massachusetts and John Kerry  D Massachusetts  and is in response to failing privatized housing projects at Little Rock  Moody  Patrick  and Hanscom Air Force Bases in the lawmakers home states    Background  American Eagle Communities  LLC  created under the parent company Carabetta  was awarded a  127 million contract to build 468 new homes and remodel 732 homes by 2011 for the Little Rock Air Force Base  Only 25 homes were completed and occupied  and an estimated 70 concrete slabs were poured before the company stopped construction in May due to unpaid bills  As a result of the companys financial problems  at least 25 Arkansas subcontractors and suppliers have not been paid and the housing project is now stalled    The Moody project in Georgia was initiated in March 2004  Carabetta  the Property Manager  created Moody Family Housing  LLC  to be the developer and project owner  400 new homes were to be constructed and 206 homes were to be remodeled as stated by the terms in the project  To date  only two homes have been completed  The estimated cost of the project has exceeded available funding by  25 million  and the project lenders stopped funding in March 2007 to prevent all funds from being expended
