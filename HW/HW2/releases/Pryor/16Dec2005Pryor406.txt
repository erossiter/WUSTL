    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         December 16  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor  in Opposition to the PATRIOT Act Conference Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr  President  I would like to state for the record that I am disappointed we were not able to pass a version of the Patriot Act today  My vote against cloture should not be viewed as a vote against the Patriot Act  It should be seen as a vote for balance           I think most Americans want legislation that keeps us safer from the threat of terrorism  but they also want their civil liberties protected  The version of the Patriot Act  which passed the Senate earlier this year with my support  struck that balance  Unfortunately  the conference report we have before us today does not  This conference report is invasive and vague  It takes focus off of preventing terrorism instead permitting government fishing expeditions that invade the privacy of all Americans           Mr  President  my vote against cloture should not be seen as a parliamentary move to kill this bill  I am voting today to allow conferees more time to get it right  I join my colleagues in a bipartisan push to extend the current Patriot Act three months so that the problems that brought this bill down can be resolved  It is my hope that the distinguished Majority Leader allows us to move forward with a vote on this extension
