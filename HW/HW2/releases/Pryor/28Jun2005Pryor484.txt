Bill Includes Senator  s Measures to Promote Alternative Fuels and Address Global Warming Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON D C     Senator Mark Pryor said the comprehensive energy legislation passed by the Senate today is a step forward in advancing a cleaner  more diverse energy policy in the United States and reducing our dependence on foreign oil  He added that two of his amendments were accepted by the Senate  including a measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and an amendment that would promote the alternative fuels biodiesel and hythane          This energy bill calls for innovation and practical solutions to move our country away from foreign oil and toward cleaner  healthier energy sources produced right here at home     Pryor said     It is not perfect  but it is a good step in the right direction and will help strengthen our economy  environment and national security          Pryor said the climate change amendment  he introduced along with Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   was the only measure passed by the Senate targeted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address global warming concerns   The bipartisan amendment authorizes the federal government to make commitments for research and development and technology through tax credits  direct loans and other forms of financial assistance  It establishes a Climate Coordinating Committee and Climate Credit Board to assess and fund projects  and directs the Secretary of Energy to lead an inter agency process to implement a national climate change strategy        In addition  the amendment would direct the Secretary of State and U S  Trade Representative to use their resources and influence to encourage developing countries to adopt U S  technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions         There are many different opinions on how to best address global warming  but the Senate has never been able to agree on legislation  I worked closely with my colleagues to reach common ground and succeeded in passing an innovative incentive based approach to climate change     Pryor said    I am hopeful this amendment will serve as a catalyst to produce environmentally friendly technology and help lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions           Pryor also received Senate support for his amendment to promote the commercialization of biodiesel and hythane   His measure requires the Department of Energy  in conjunction with universities throughout the country  to prepare two reports that would evaluate how to best deploy biodiesel and hythane and create an infrastructure to support their enormous potential       Pryor said biodiesel can substitute directly for petroleum based diesel fuel with generally no engine modification  and offers a number of health and environmental benefits  including a reduction of greenhouse gas  but that it only currently accounts for less than 0 1  of diesel fuel consumption in the U S  He added that as an agricultural based feedstock it can be produced anew every year  unlike fossil fuels which have declining reserves   Additionally  in Arkansas and other agricultural states  the robust commercializing of biodiesel could mean an economic boon to our soybean farmers       The Senator said hythane    a mixture of hydrogen and methane is not currently used in the United States  but reduces nitrogen oxides emissions by 95  relative to diesel fuel  and makes significant reductions in carbon dioxide  He said Arkansas   landfills and chemical plants could capture the methane they emit into the atmosphere and sell it to hythane manufacturers         In order to revolutionize how our country produces and uses oil  it  s critical to start thinking outside the box and consider long term solutions     Pryor said    Hythane and biodiesel offer two very viable options to a cleaner  diverse energy supply  and I am pleased the Senate agreed to further study their benefits and potential           The differences between the Senate and House passed energy bills will now be negotiated during a conference committee  Pryor said he was concerned that the House version of the energy bill relied too heavily on the use of fossil fuels such as oil and coal  but was hopeful that the final bill would more reflect the Senate  s diverse approach to energy independence           30
