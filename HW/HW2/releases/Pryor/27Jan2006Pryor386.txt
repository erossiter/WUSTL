    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         January 27  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On Judge Alito  s Confirmation to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When I ran for the Senate  I said there would be times when I agreed with the President and times when I would not  but that I would always vote in the best interest of Arkansas   There is no doubt in my mind that Judge Alito is a credentialed jurist for this position  and carries with him the proper judicial temperament to sit on our Nation  s highest court   However  intellect alone is not sufficient to fill this lifetime appointment            I believe a Supreme Court Justice must also exhibit a consistent ability to be fair and impartial   While trying to give deference to the President  I cannot ignore that Judge Alito  s record demonstrates his tendency to legislate from the bench  In my mind  this unmet criterion disqualifies Judge Alito from receiving my vote            Finally  while I personally cannot support Judge Alito  s confirmation on the Supreme Court  there is not a smoking gun in his past that would warrant   extraordinary circumstances    and subsequently a filibuster against his nomination   I have faith in the thirteen other members who forged the   Gang of 14     In exchange for preserving the minority party  s right to filibuster a judge  we all agreed a higher threshold must be met before this action is taken           Our agreement also called on President Bush to seek meaningful consultation with the Senate before nominating a judge   I believe the Administration worked with the Senate  as a co equal branch of government  to find a consensus nominee in Chief Justice John Roberts   I was proud to vote for Chief Justice Roberts  and I believe he will conduct himself as a man of the court  not as a man of politics   In addition to Justice Roberts  I have also supported 116 judges nominated by President Bush   But I simply do not have this same degree of confidence in Judge Alito
