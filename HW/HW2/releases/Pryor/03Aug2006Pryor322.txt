    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         August 3  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor On the Minimum Wage Estate Tax Package                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I have voted a number of times to increase the minimum wage and will continue to back stand alone legislation that makes a hard day of work count   I also believe our tax laws should be modernized to shield small business owners and family farmers from the estate tax in a fiscally responsible manner  However  the estate tax package before the Senate goes far beyond what our nation can afford  I cannot ignore our  300 billion deficit  and the ongoing costs to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and reconstruction in the Gulf Coast  There is an alternative   I have been working with Senators on both sides of the aisle on legislation that provides a  5 million exemption at significantly less cost  This proposal would cover virtually every small business owner and farmer in Arkansas  I believe there is strong support for an affordable solution  and I will continue to press for meaningful estate tax reform
