    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 7  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Pryor on the Nomination of Julie Myers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Today the Homeland Security Committee is voting  on the nomination of Julie Myers to be Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement          Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for detaining and removing  illegal aliens  investigating alien smuggling  illegal arms imports  money laundering and many more important activities   It has a  4 billion budget and 20 000 employees   Its next leader will face considerable challenges         Ms  Myers has clearly had an impressive career   She spent two years as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before coming to the Administration in 2000   She has had stints in Commerce  Treasury   and Justice  where she briefly served as chief of staff to Michael Chertoff   As Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement she supervised a staff of 170 and a  25 million budget  I believe she has been a talented administrator in these roles       However I am concerned that her experience is not sufficient for someone to be confirmed as Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement   This is a vital position  So vital that Congress took the unusual step of inserting a statutory requirement that nominees must have a minimum of five years of experience in both management and law enforcement   The next assistant secretary will be largely responsible for protecting the nation against terrorists once they have succeeded in infiltrating our borders  The next assistant secretary needs to have experience in immigration or customs or both  more experience than I see on Ms  Myers   resume         Ms  Myers may be able to grow into the job  but the nation needs someone who can step in and lead ICE from the first day   For these reasons I cannot support her nomination
