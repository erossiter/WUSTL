                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON D C   Senator Mark Pryor today applauded final passage of a defense policy bill that will provide additional RR time for active duty soldiers and investigate the housing privatization problems at the Little Rock Air Force Base  In addition  Pryor succeeded in his effort to preserve the Army Air Force partnership for the Joint Cargo Aircraft program in order to prevent production delays  The provisions passed as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Authorization Act   Pryor announced that  upon enactment of this bill  soldiers will receive additional leave time to match the longer tours of duty they are now serving in Iraq and other combat zones  Defense Secretary Gates extended the length of tours for active duty soldiers without providing them with additional Rest  Recuperation  RR  time  Active duty Army troops are now required to serve 15 month tours instead of 12 months with the same amount of RR leave time  The Senators amendment provides them with an additional 5 days of leave for a total of 20 days off   The extended tours affect more than 100 000 active duty soldiers  including a woman residing in Fayetteville  Arkansas who originated the idea for equitable days off  Her husband served as an Infantryman with a Stryker Brigade Combat Team in Iraq  Pryor said he is pleased the policy will take effect in time to help members of Arkansass 39th Infantry Brigade  which is preparing for another tour of duty in Iraq    Extended tours of duty can place a lot of stress on soldiers and families  especially around the holidays  said Pryor  Even though we cant match the sacrifice our troops make on a daily basis  we can try to make fair policies  Extending our soldiers RR time is not just a matter of fairness  it will also improve morale and readiness    Second  Pryor said the bill contains his measure to require an investigation into multi million contracts to build housing at various Air Force bases  including the Little Rock Air Force Base  LRAFB   The report by the Comptroller General will provide a list of projects in default or behind schedule as well as the reasons  bidding process  financing  contracts and local entities affected  In addition  the report will propose remedies available to subcontractors and the Federal Government as well as recommendations to ensure the projects are completed to the original schedule and budget   Pryor said American Eagle Communities LLC was awarded a multi million contract to build 468 new homes and remodel 732 homes by 2011  Only 25 homes were completed and occupied  and an estimated 70 concrete slabs were poured before the company stopped construction on May 7th due to unpaid bills  As a result of the companys financial problems  Pryor said  central Arkansas subcontractors and suppliers have not been paid and the housing project is now stalled and at least 2 years behind schedule  Air Force bases in Georgia  Florida  and Massachusetts are experiencing similar situations    Little Rock Air Force Base families and subcontractors have been left out in the cold as result of a questionable contractor who over promised and under delivered  said Pryor  We need to find out what went wrong  fix it  and ensure our airmen and women live in the affordable and decent housing they deserve   Third  Pryor worked to allow the Army to continue working with the Air Force to advance the Joint Cargo Aircraft  JCA  program  He stopped an attempt to strip the Armys ability to help fund the JCA program or house JCAs at Army installations which would have created major delays to the program  Pryors provision to allow this collaboration opens the door to possibly train personnel and house the Joint Cargo Aircraft at Camp Robinson or Little Rock Air Force Base   The Joint Cargo Aircraft is a small  fixed wing aircraft with improved airlift capabilities inside small combat theaters and shorter landing strips  These aircrafts are more responsive to troop needs and allow the modern warfighter to quickly and safely supply and transport army equipment and soldiers for the last tactical mile  JCA Guard units may also be assigned to assist in emergency management and homeland security missions  The need for this aircraft program was readily apparent in the recovery and relief efforts of Hurricane Katrina   Numerous officials in the Army  Air Force and the Joint Staff have attested to the need for safe and swift transportation of time sensitive personnel and supplies  The JCA offers the best fit to meet this demand  which is why I fought to ensure the joint nature of and funding for this program stays intact and on time  Pryor said  In the near future  I plan to sit down with Army officials and discuss the possibility of housing the JCAs in Arkansas
