                                                                                                                                             A change in the Patriot Act reauthorization allows Attorney General to appoint interim U S  Attorneys for indefinite terms when vacancies arise without confirmation  Feinstein Leahy Pryor measure would restore the interim appointment process to District Courts  ensure continuity of Senate confirmation process                                                                                             Washington  DC    U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Patrick Leahy  D Vt    and Mark Pryor  D Ark   today introduced legislation to prevent circumvention of the Senate  s constitutional prerogative to confirm U S  Attorneys        It has come to our attention that the Bush Administration is pushing out U S  Attorneys from across the country under the cloak of secrecy and then appointing indefinite replacements without Senate confirmation   We know that this is not an isolated occurrence  but we don  t know how many U S  Attorneys have been asked to resign    it could be two  it could be ten  it could be more   No one knows     Senator Feinstein said         And  we have no idea why this is happening   The Attorney General could have legitimate reasons for asking for specific resignations  or this could be motivated by political concerns or worse  derailing on going investigations  Again  we just don  t know       We believe that this use of expanded executive authority to appoint interim replacements indefinitely undermines essential constitutional checks and balances  It creates unnecessary instability in these offices and has dramatic implications for important cases currently underway  Given all that is going on with this country and the message from the American people this past election  I am surprised that the Administration would pursue a strategy to circumvent the Senate confirmation process and unsettle these important positions        U S  Attorneys around the country are working on public corruption cases  terrorism cases  narcotics and drug trafficking  fighting gangs and violent crime   Which of these cases are impacted by the Attorney General  s actions has yet to be determined     Senator Feinstein continued        The bottom line is this  U S  Attorneys are handling major cases that need continuity and leadership  The bill we are introducing today would restore temporary appointment authority to the District Court in which a vacancy arises until a new nominee can be sent to the Senate for confirmation          U S  Attorneys are the key federal law enforcement officers of their states and hold enormous responsibility for implementing anti terrorism efforts  prosecuting important and often complex cases  and leading the fight against public corruption     said Senator Leahy  a former prosecutor    Political gerrymandering of these important posts is wrong and an affront to our criminal justice system  It is vital that those holding these critical positions be free from any inappropriate influence and subject to the check and balance of the confirmation process           Arkansas has learned first hand the unintended consequence of a little known provision in the Patriot Act     Senator Pryor said     Unfortunately  the spirit and intent in which this provision was constructed has been abused and needs to be corrected   It appears that the Administration has chosen to use this provision  which was intended to help protect our nation  to circumvent the transparent Constitutional Senate confirmation process to reward political allies        In a little noticed provision included in the Patriot Act reauthorization last year  the Administration  s authority to appoint interim U S  Attorneys was greatly expanded  The law was changed so that if a vacancy arises the Attorney General may appoint a replacement for an indefinite period of time    thus completely avoiding the Senate confirmation process      The authority to fill U S  Attorney vacancies on an interim basis was first given to the Attorney General in 1986  but the interim position was valid for a period of only 120 days   And prior to 1986  District Courts had the authority to appoint interim U S  Attorneys when positions became vacant      Senators Feinstein  Leahy  and Pryor have learned that the Department of Justice has asked several U S  Attorneys from around the country to resign their positions prior to the end of their terms without cause    The number of U S  Attorneys  currently or historically  who have been asked to resign their positions without cause is still unknown      The measure introduced by Senators Feinstein  Leahy  and Pryor would amend the current statute and restore appointment authority to the District Court within which the vacancy arises
