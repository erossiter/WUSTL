    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         April 4  2006     Press Release        Disaster Relief for Farmers Passes Senate Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON D C     The Senate Appropriations Committee today passed long awaited disaster relief for farmers as part of the Fiscal Year 2006 emergency supplemental bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Gulf Coast hurricane relief   Pryor and Lincoln urged Senate appropriators in a letter this morning to include emergency disaster assistance to our farmers during today  s consideration of the emergency supplemental bill           This emergency disaster assistance is not just necessary  it is long overdue  While the relief provided under this bill is not ideal  it will give many of our farmers a chance to keep their doors open     Pryor said     Senator Lincoln and I have worked hard to build a broad coalition of support in the Senate for disaster relief  and I am hopeful President Bush will lend his support as well so our farmers can get the relief they desperately need right now            I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the need to include this much needed disaster assistance package today because last year producers across the country were forced to endure one of the most expensive crop years in recent memory   Lincoln said   While this is a positive step forward  obstacles remain to final passage of agriculture disaster assistance in Congress  I plan to continue to do everything I can to see that this package remains a priority as we move forward        Pryor and Lincoln said drought  hurricane damage  and high energy prices have escalated irrigation and other input costs on the agricultural community  Unlike other industries  farmers are largely unable to pass on higher costs to consumers  which means higher energy costs directly hurts farm income and the local economy  To address the higher input costs  the agriculture disaster relief includes a payment of 30 percent of the direct payment for farmers enrolled in the farm program for the 2005 crop as well as USDA grants to states to provide agricultural market and economic assistance  The amendment also provides crop production loss assistance in a manner similar to previous disaster programs  including a payment rate of 50 percent of the established price of the crop if a farmer suffered a yield loss of at least 35 percent       Pryor and Lincoln introduced a disaster assistance bill in September to provide farmers with a 100 percent direct payment  but said the 30 percent direct payment compromise was necessary to provide more timely assistance   They helped forge the compromise language last week with 23 other farm state Senators        The Senators said they expect the full Senate to pass the emergency supplemental package in early May  and are pressuring the White House and the House of Representatives to include the disaster relief provisions in the final package
