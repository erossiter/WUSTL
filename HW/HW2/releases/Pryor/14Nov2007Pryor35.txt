Researchers and Students                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Amendments Would Create a More Vibrant Rural America                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON D C   Senator Mark Pryor today said the Farm Bill represents a careful balance that provides a safety net for farmers and allows them to continue providing a stable  safe and affordable food supply  He plans to strengthen the bill during Senate floor consideration through amendments that would advance investment in cellulosic biofuel  improve quality control standards for university and private sector research and enrich low income students in rural America through technology    Pryor said rural America may hold the key to our nations energy challenges but farmers need the resources and infrastructure in place before switching markets  He said Arkansas has tremendous potential for cellulosic ethanol    where farmers could turn switch grass  cornstarch  miscanthus and woodchips into the next generation of biofuel    but it needs companies willing to invest and commercialize the fuel    The Senator plans to offer an amendment to the Farm Bill that would require the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to conduct a state by state analysis of growth potential for cellulosic feedstock and provide a rating of each states potential for contributing to the cellulosic energy marketplace  In addition  the 18 month study would identify for each state the range of potential feedstock that can be grown for cellulosic ethanol  the available acreage for growing cellulosic feedstock  the quantity of energy per acre for each feedstock and the development potential for cellulosic feedstock   Arkansas has tremendous energy potential that exists in our fields and forests  My measure will identify this potential  help drive investment to our state and move cellulosic energy to the next level  Pryor said  Commercializing this type of biofuel is a win win opportunity for our farmers  rural communities  conservationists and our overall energy security    Second  Pryor said he wants to improve standards for quality control and management in research between the private sector and universities in order to prevent another major disruption in the U S  rice industry  In 2006  an unapproved genetically engineered rice strain disrupted rice exports to Europe  Asia and the Middle East and reduced the value of the long grain rice crop by almost  200 million  Pryor said the USDA spent a year investigating the cause and then offered several recommendations to prevent related problems in the future  His amendment will require the USDA to turn those recommendations into regulations  including policies to enhance the quality of records  retain representative samples  maintain identity and control in the event of an unauthorized release  develop corrective actions and protocols for conducting molecular forensics  provide clarity in contractual agreements  develop standards for quality management systems and use electronic permits to store documents    In Arkansas and around the country  some of the strongest research has been conducted by partnerships between universities and the private sector  Pryor said  The USDA has provided sound recommendations that can and should be implemented to improve research capabilities and ensure the safety of our food and the viability of U S  markets  This is a smart policy for producers  universities and consumers  and it should be in place sooner rather than later     Finally  Pryor seeks to expand broadband deployment in rural areas through a pilot federal state partnership aimed at improving digital demand in the nations rural counties  Under the partnership  states could use a flexible combination of broadband support for low income households with children  Pryor believes that this investment will help drive broadband deployment in counties that are being left out of the modern  digital economy  Specifically  the Pryor amendment would establish a pilot program within the USDA for a 50 50 federal state match for 10 grants per fiscal year for a three year trial period  Grants can support broadband subscriptions  in home computers and software  internet education and training to low income  rural households with students in 6 10th grade    According to a recent Pew Internet and American Life Project report  31  of rural households have access to a broadband internet connection  while 49  of their suburban counterparts and 52  of their urban counterparts have access to broadband    Internet access plays an important role in todays economy and way of life  but there are unique challenges that stand in the way for students and their families in rural communities  Pryor said  This pilot program provides incentives for both consumers and providers to expand broadband access  which I believe will go a long way to help create a more vibrant rural America
