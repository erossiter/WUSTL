Dependence on Foreign Oil and Benefit Environment   WASHINGTON D C     Senators Mark Pryor  D AR  and Trent Lott  R MS  today introduced bipartisan legislation to improve the fuel efficiency of cars  which they believe is part of a long term solution toward helping reduce our nation  s dependence on foreign oil  lowering the price consumers pay at the gas pump and protecting the environment      Pryor said the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 calls on the Secretary of Transportation to begin the process of raising and reforming current fuel economy standards for passenger cars within 60 days  His legislation establishes guidelines to ensure environmental and passenger safety needs are met  as well as national security goals to reduce our dependence on foreign oil   Additionally  the legislation allows fines  paid by automakers that are in noncompliance with new standards  to be used for research and development into fuel efficient technologies and to support rulemaking activities by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration      Pryor added that fuel efficiency technologies have greatly improved over the last 20 years  but the fuel economy of the nation  s passenger fleet has not because consensus among various interests for a new mandated standard has failed year after year       Consumers can no longer afford the delay on stricter CAFE standards as Congress waits for environmentalists and car manufacturers  Republicans and Democrats to agree  Senator Lott and I have come up with a sensible  middle of the road proposal that improves fuel efficiency which in turn will ultimately reduce our dependency on foreign oil  lower the price consumers pay at the pump and better protect the environment  Our bill avoids extremes in order to make much needed progress on this issue  and eventually help our country out of the oil crisis we are in     Pryor said       In the past  some in Congress have played politics with CAF    offering bills that try to set unrealistically high or arbitrary CAF   standards  while others have opposed any action at all  resulting in a stalemate     Lott said     We need to get tougher standards in place as soon as we can   Senator Pryor and I are committed to improving the fuel economy of our vehicles without reducing safety and reliability  or losing jobs        Pryor said Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards were first enacted in 1975 and requires automobile manufacturers to meet specific fuel economy standards with respect to passenger cars and light trucks   For cars  the standards incrementally increased the average mile per gallon from between 13 and 14 in 1975 up to 27 5 miles per gallon in 1985  where it remains today        30      Senator Pryor submitted the following statement into the Congressional Record as an introduction to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006     Mr  President  I rise today with my good friend and colleague from Mississippi  Senator Lott to introduce legislation to reform and raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard for the first time since its inception over thirty years ago       In 1975 this body passed  as a part of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act  the very first fuel economy standards for our passenger car fleet  setting a standard that all manufacturers must achieve 27 5 miles per gallon  This was done in response to the first oil embargo and the energy crisis of the early 1970  s   Americans realized for the first time that we as a nation must set and achieve attainable goals for energy conservation  not only for our economic security  but also for our national security      At that time  the fuel economy of passenger cars averaged around 14 miles per gallon  Ten years after CAFE was enacted  the fuel economy of passenger cars had almost doubled  saving an estimated 2 8 million barrels of oil a day  There can be no doubts as to the benefits of the original CAFE standard  Still  twenty years after reaching this peak around 1985  the fuel economy of the nation  s passenger car fleet has stagnated  Some have even argued the fleet of vehicles entering the marketplace today gets less fuel economy than those models in 1985  While fuel efficient technology has improved over the years  the fuel economy of the nation  s passenger fleet has not  Also today  our dependence on oil is greater than ever before  This dependence has complicated decisions we make as a country  such as foreign policy decisions  and as individuals  such as whether or not to fill up your gas tank or buy groceries      Mr  President  I believe we must do better for families in Arkansas and around the nation  We must protect our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and uncomplicating our foreign policy decision making in oil rich regions  We must protect the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions  We must reduce the cost of transportation for consumers  We must begin implementing more stringent CAFE standards now before these problems worsen  Gasoline is over 70 cents higher than this time last year  and the number of miles driven by every American over the age of 16 has risen over 60 percent since 1970  and is continuing to climb at a rapid pace      This is why I have joined my colleague and worked in a bipartisan manner to introduce comprehensive CAFE reform  For over thirty years the original CAFE standard has remained in place while a rapidly advancing marketplace and rapidly advancing technology have left it behind  Each time fuel economy standards have been debated in this body  they have been mired in partisan politics resulting in nothing but stalemate      Senator Lott and I are choosing progress over politics with our common sense legislation  the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006  The bill will help accomplish our national security and energy conservation goals while preserving motor vehicle safety  American manufacturing jobs  and consumer choice for vehicles      Specifically  it will clarify the Secretary of Transportation  s authority to raise and reform CAFE standards  It requires the Secretary to begin the reform process within 60 days in addition to requiring the Secretary to complete an expedited rulemaking to immediately amend the current CAFE standard before a reformed standard takes effect      For the first time  it will require the Secretary to consider greenhouse gas emissions when promulgating a CAFE standard as well as require the Secretary to obtain comments from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on the impact of any new rule on the environment      Our legislation also gives automobile manufacturers more flexibility in the way they can apply CAFE credits in order to help them preserve American jobs  It preserves the 18 month lead time required before the Secretary can issue more stringent CAFE standards   It also allows the Secretary to use the fines collected for violations of the CAFE standard for research and development of fuel saving technologies and to conduct CAFE rulemakings  Finally  our bill provides a backstop fuel economy average which no manufacturer can go below  regardless of their fleet mix        Mr  President  there is no silver bullet in accomplishing our national security and energy goals  and we must seek short term alternatives in addition to long term solutions  CAFE reform is one part of a long term solution to reduce our dependence on oil  but it is one that can have lasting impact  Still  I believe for the long term security of our country  this is a good a place as any to start  We must start now      I would like to thank my colleague from the Commerce Committee  Senator Lott  for his hard work on this bipartisan legislation  I look forward to working with him and the rest of my colleagues to ensure that this reform becomes law
