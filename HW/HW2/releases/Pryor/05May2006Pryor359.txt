    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         May 5  2006     Press Release        Op ed by Senator Mark Pryor On the Importance of Pool Safety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As the swimming season approaches  it  s time to think about keeping our kids safe in and around the pool   Swimming pools and hot tubs pose the second leading cause of accidental injury related deaths to children under the age of 14  Only car accidents account for more       I recently co chaired a Senate hearing on improving pool safety and integrating pool safety technologies  A small but significant cause of injuries and deaths in pools is related to the mechanics of filtration systems and pool architecture  For example  entrapment occurs when a child becomes stuck on a drain and is unable to escape to the high velocity of the water being sucked into the drain  During the hearing  it was difficult to listen to Nancy Baker describe the drowning of her 7 year old daughter as a result of this design   Another scenario occurs when certain body parts get pulled on to the drain or when long hair or some type of jewelry gets sucked into the drain  making it difficult for a child to pull free   Like most parents  I have always assumed there were safety technologies already built into pools to prevent these occurrences  but guidelines for pool manufacturers are voluntary so many pools remain a hazard      In the coming weeks  I will be taking a close look at steps Congress can take to increase the safety of swimming pools and spas  For now  it  s incumbent upon parents to take the proper precautions  First and foremost  the key in preventing accidental drowning is close supervision  but most parents need to take additional steps   The Consumer Product Safety Commission suggests installing a four sided barrier with self latching and self closing gates  installing multiple drains  lessening the suction force for each drain  installing anti entanglement anti entrapment drain covers  and installing a gravity flow or a Safety Vacuum Release System        Research suggests parents   confidence in their children  s safety while swimming may be higher than their children  s abilities in the swimming pool   I would encourage parents to use National Safe Kids Week  lasting from May 6 13  as an opportunity to reduce any safety risks in your home  As Nancy Baker testified    whatever the cost in dollars and cents  it cannot possibly compare with the cost of losing that most precious and treasured person in our lives  our children
