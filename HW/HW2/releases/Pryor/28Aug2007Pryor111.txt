                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thank you for joining me this morning to examine the state of broadband in Arkansas  We have come a long way  in a short time In little more than a decade  broadband technology has evolved from its roots as a hobby for computer enthusiasts  into a broadly used platform that is the foundation of communications and commerce in an information age   Today  broadband technology is driving innovation in fields like telemedicine  helping to provide quality health care to remote parts of our nation It is transforming education  allowing our children to access to ideas and information far beyond what the shelves of any school or public library might hold  And  it is transforming our workforce  increasing productivity and creating new economic opportunities for consumers and businesses alike   Yet  with such promise  there is still some cause for concern Over the past seven years  the United States has dropped from 4th to 15th in world broadband rankings Closer to home  I am particularly troubled by some statistics ranking Arkansas as 47th out of the 50 states in broadband penetration We continue to move forward  but other countries and other states are leapfrogging ahead of us   We are making progress But in Arkansas  and in many other parts of our nation  we must go further  faster  if we are to ensure that all Americans can reap the benefits of robust and affordable broadband technology   I know that many of the people in this room are working hard on this problem  and I hope that todays hearing will help us to clarify the issues and to work together toward our common aim  namely  our goal of making Arkansas a leader in broadband deployment and of spreading the benefits of this technology to all of her citizens   It is my honor to introduce our two distinguished guests  Federal Communications Commission Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein   Commissioner Copps is a leader in seeking deployment of affordable broadband throughout America He was one of the first to call for a national broadband strategy In addition  most of you know him as a champion for consumers  Commissioner Copps has a very impressive public service career He has served at the FCC since 2001  Under the Clinton Administration  Commissioner Copps served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development at the U S  Department of Commerce and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Basic Industries  The Commissioner came to Washington in 1970  joining the staff of Senator Ernest Hollings  D SC  and serving for over a dozen years as Chief of Staff    Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein is an old friend of the Pryor family Jonathan worked for my dad on the Senate Aging Committee  Because he was born and raised in South Dakota  I know that Jonathan is acutely aware of the particular challenges that rural providers face in extending affordable broadband services in remote areas   He was  as a member of the FCC on December 3  2002  and  for a new five year term on December 6  2004  Before joining the FCC  he served for fifteen years in the United States Senate  He advised Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle on telecommunications  financial services  transportation and other key issues In addition to working for Senator David Pryor  Commissioner Adelstein also staffed Leader Harry Reid and Senator Donald W  Riegle   Panel II represents Arkansans who are making a difference with the deployment and use of broadband for economic development  education  telemedicine to name a few  They are working to close the digital divide for poor and rural areas   Panel III  During the last legislative session  the Arkansas legislature enacted Act 602    legislation to create and operate a Connect Arkansas nonprofit organization   Sponsored by Senator John Paul Capps  D Searcy   the bill created a public private partnership aimed at increasing the broadband coverage for health  industry  education  and general economic development   Panel IV  We also have students here from Ashdown  Mineral Springs  and Saratoga High Schools  These students are representing their work in EAST East is an educational initiative that allows students to tackle real problems facing their communities    These students are involved in the EAST Rural Broadband Project  a collaborative effort between the EAST Initiative and the that is engaging students and communities in the ArkLaTex and Delta regions of Arkansas to address issues related to entrepreneurial development of broadband  high speed internet in rural areas of the state     Panel V  Our business panel represents companies across the state that are investing and deploying broadband in our communities I know that well hear some good news about broadband adoption rates in Arkansas I want to mention at this time that I understand that investment dollars are critical to making broadband services available in our remote  underserved rural areas  and that some of these areas need a public private partnership   I support the use of Universal Service Fund money for targeted broadband deployment to unserved areas I am also looking hard at possible new programming or reforms that might enhance tax incentives  the utilization of Rural Utilities Service loans  and provide low income household support  I am committed to ensuring that the rich and poor  urban and rural are all on equal footing in this new era
