                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON D C     Senator Mark Pryor today applauded final passage of the 2005 Emergency Supplemental Bill  which includes  75 9 billion for troops and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan and  907 million for tsunami related expenses   The President is expected to sign the bill in the next few days       Several of Pryor  s amendments were also included in the final bill  including directions for the Department of Agriculture to help farmers combat the spread of Asian Soybean Rust  a land exchange agreement for Camp Robinson  and a provision to ensure the C 130J contracts continue without interruption this year         Soybean Rust      Pryor said he successfully inserted language into the emergency spending package that directs the Department of Agriculture to initiate   an immediate and strong response    to meet the threat of Asian Soybean Rust   The language urges   the Secretary to utilize funding from available sources  including contingency and CCC resources  to concentrate research  outreach  and regulatory activities in those areas where Asian Soybean Rust has been identified and where the greatest risk for disease expansion is evident              Pryor is concerned Asian Soybean Rust  a windborne fungus  will return to Arkansas during the current planting season  and is seeking  715 000 in emergency funds for the University of Arkansas   Division of Agriculture to use for immediate detection  training and education efforts in the state   He said the Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service now estimates that at least 50  of our state  s acreage will be sprayed twice if the fungus is found in the state in May or June  which could run well over  100 million if all of Arkansas   producers participate         This particularly dangerous fungus has the ability to infect our state  s entire crop in a matter of days  If left untreated  it could infect the rest of the nation  s soybean crop within a single season     Pryor said     The language inserted in this bill is only half the battle for our farmers  but it provides much needed leverage in getting the USDA to be more aggressive in fighting this disease and assisting our farmers  Senator Thad Cochran worked with me to get this measure passed  and I am appreciative of his support and assistance            Camp Robinson      Congress also passed Pryor  s amendment authorizing Camp Robinson and a private developer to swap land allowing Camp Robinson the property it needs to construct an aviation support facility and maintain a clear and safe flight path for landing   In return  the landowner would receive 325 acres east of Camp Robinson that is of no military value   Pryor said the landowner agreed to exchange his land for other lands on the east side of Camp Robinson four years ago  but a 1950 statute specific to Camp Robinson blocked the transaction  stating that land no longer needed for military purposes reverts to federal ownership  Pryor  s amendment releases the 325 acres in question and allows the land swap to move forward           Moving forward with this land exchange is a safety  security and readiness issue     Pryor said    I  m pleased Congress understood the immediacy of this land exchange to Camp Robinson  the community and to national security and approved my amendment without delay           C 130J      Pryor said Congress also adopted a provision he and Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA  introduced to ensure contracts for the C 130J continue without interruption this year   Pryor said he has strongly opposed efforts by the Bush Administration to terminate the C 130J program because of the vital role they play in our national defense  He added that the C 130Js are critical for the Air Force to meet its future tactical requirements and complete missions safely and successfully   Pryor commended the Little Rock Air Force Base  the premiere training facility for the J model  for its superior efforts training soldiers from across the nation about the vast capabilities of the C 130J          Halting production of the C130J model would not only deny our soldiers the cutting edge technology they need on today  s battlefield  but it would leave the Air Force and Marine Corps with an aging and far less capable tactical airlift     Pryor said    Our amendment gives the President at least one year to reconsider the impact his decision would have on our military operations and readiness               30
