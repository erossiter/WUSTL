    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         May 16  2005     Press Release        Pryor Urges More Action on Soybean Rust  Says USDA Funding is a Start  but Pledges to Seek More                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WASHINGTON D C     Sen  Mark Pryor voiced his support today for Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns  s decision to steer  1 2 million toward addressing the problem of Asian Soybean Rust disease  but he stressed that much more funding is needed to adequately address the threat to Arkansas agriculture       After Pryor successfully inserted language into the Iraq Afghanistan Emergency Supplemental Bill to direct Secretary Johanns to initiate   an immediate and strong response    to Soybean Rust  the Department of Agriculture  USDA  indicated that it would dedicate  1 2 million to help monitor  report and manage soybean rust during the 2005 growing season   The USDA says it will implement its prevention and management actions in 35 states and in Puerto Rico   Currently  Asian Soybean Rust has been detected in nine states  including Arkansas          I am happy that Secretary Johanns is taking action on the urgent problem of Soybean Rust because this is a major threat to Arkansas agriculture     Pryor said     However  the money that has been allocated is not nearly enough to address the scope of the issue          Pryor explained that the Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service has indicated to him that at least 50  of the state  s soybean acreage would need to be sprayed twice if the fungus is found in the state in May or June   The cost could run well over  100 million if all of Arkansas   producers participate         Pryor originally attempted to earmark  715 000 in the recent War Supplemental Bill for the University of Arkansas to implement a detection and training program  but he was unable to include it because it was not related to the war effort   Pryor finally succeeded in putting language into the same bill that prompted the Secretary of Agriculture to act  but no level of funding was specified         Pryor cautioned that if current efforts fall short of preventing the spread of Asian Soybean Rust  the fungus has the capability of infecting the state  s entire crop within one season           Considering the importance of soybeans to our state  s economy and the threat posed by the windborne nature of this disease  we don  t have the luxury to gamble on half measures     Pryor said     Now a total of 35 states and a U S  territory have to rely on  1 3 million to be divided among them all   This just simply is not enough to address this threat  so I will continue to push for more federal action that will adequately address Soybean Rust           Arkansas ranks eight nationally in soybean production   Soybeans are grown in more than 50 Arkansas counties  but acreage is concentrated in eastern Arkansas          30
