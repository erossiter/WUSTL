    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         November 20  2006     Press Release        Op ed by Senator Mark Pryor On Bipartisanship and Progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Americans sent a very clear message to the President and to Congress on Election Day  For too long  Washington has let politics cloud progress on legislation that could make a big difference in our daily lives  Access to affordable health care has become limited  Consumers have been paying record prices at the pump while big oil has posted record profits  And our troops and their families have been stretched thin      The call for change is finally resonating in the halls of Congress  and many lawmakers are listening for the first time in a long time   As a result  I believe we  re going to see the progress  accountability and transparency people deserve from their government  Cooperation and bipartisanship will be at the root of this new direction  In Arkansas  we know that talking to one another is more effective than talking at one another   We also know that no political party has a monopoly on good ideas  it  s more important to take the best ideas from all sides and turn those proposals into law  This is a well tested philosophy that I have used to pass laws that benefit our veterans  seniors  children  taxpayers and farmers and bring more infrastructure dollars to our state       That  s why I  m helping to foster better relationships among my colleagues in the Senate   Last week  I helped lead Senate orientation to familiarize newly elected Senators with the Senate  s rules  history and life in Washington  On day one  I used this opportunity to change the partisan environment for new Senators   Throughout orientation  I integrated sessions on bridging the political divide where old and new members could share how to build working relationships and friendships across the aisle  I discussed how working together the bipartisan   Gang of 14     which I am a member of  allowed the Senate to get back to business and pass major energy  highway and other bills   By the end of the week  it was evident that Senators    Republicans and Democrats alike    wanted to put behind a bitter campaign season and govern together in order to move forward positive legislation for their own state and the nation   In the coming weeks  my Chief of Staff will lead a similar orientation for incoming senior level staff  He will try to cultivate bipartisanship in much the same way we did        There are a number of great challenges facing our country today  We must put progress ahead of partisanship  I will continue to build on the Senate orientation and bring Senators together through bipartisan coalitions and even the Senate Prayer Breakfast I co host each week  I am optimistic the 110th Congress will have a different tone and will result in fair and productive governing to move our nation in a better direction
