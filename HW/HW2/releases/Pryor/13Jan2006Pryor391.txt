    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         January 13  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Pryor Commemorating Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dr  King was a light for America   At times  he was a searching  probing light in the dark  seeking to find the truth and expose it to all humanity   He spoke plainly and eloquently of the great injustices that were occurring during his time   He focused his spotlight on places like Selma  Atlanta  Birmingham  and Little Rock  places that were in such need of healing at that time   And he was often a stark  blinding light for many in this country who were unwilling to come to terms with the great evil represented in segregation  discrimination  and humiliation  all of which were fueled by hatred and ignorance         For so many people of his generation  Dr  King was the first light of the morning  awakening them from their na    ve slumber to confront great moral questions   He and all the champions of the civil rights movement are responsible for forcing America to look inward and recognize the sickness that plagued our nation  s soul   Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once said that   sunlight is the best disinfectant      Dr  King fully recognized the meaning of these words as he exposed our culture  s illness to the light of day  eventually helping America begin to heal        He was also a guiding light  navigating the civil rights movement through largely uncharted waters  and helping a great many minority Americans come to the realization that they were all in the same boat   They were no longer alone in their struggle against oppression   Indeed  there were many at the time who cautioned against   rocking the boat    too much   But King  s leadership proved to a weary and discouraged people that there was a great Promised Land at the end of their journey   The path he illuminated required the strongest of wills  and for that guiding light  we are all thankful       Since Dr  King  s time  the American people have made great strides toward racial equality and the elimination of poverty  yet there still remains much to be accomplished   And in the spirit of Dr  King  s life  our nation must continue to turn the light inward and expose injustice   Dr  King  s purpose in life did not end in his death  nor did it end in the court cases and legislation that have further expanded freedom and opportunity in America since that time   Dr  Martin Luther King  s legacy is an undying light that serves as a constant reminder of the noblest cause to protect and promote liberty that our nation began with its founding   His undying light also calls on us never to forget our humanity   Even a country founded on the highest moral principles can retreat into oppression and injustice in periods of darkness   For helping lead us out of the darkness  we honor Dr  King on this day  and we pledge to always remember the struggle that marches on
