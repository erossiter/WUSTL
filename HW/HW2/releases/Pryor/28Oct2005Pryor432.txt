    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 28  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor  on the Indictment of I  Lewis Libby Jr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             While it is very important to note that an indictment is not a conviction  today  s news is very troubling  These are grave charges  and if they are true  it would mean that at least one senior member of this Administration willingly obstructed a criminal investigation and intentionally lied to federal officials and a grand jury about his role in a national security breach        I believe in the judicial process and it is my hope that there will be a deliberative and fair trial where all of the facts will come out and the truth will be known  I hope that all the parties involved will cooperate with this ongoing case and that justice is served  free of politics
