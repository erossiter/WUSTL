    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 3  2005     Press Release        Statement on the Nomination of Harriet Miers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I believe that a Supreme Court justice should embody impeccable credentials  proper judicial temperament and the absolute ability to be fair and impartial   It is my hope that we find these qualities in the nomination of Harriet Miers   In the past  I have found her to be cooperative and forthcoming  and I plan to give her nomination the diligence it deserves   During this process  I hope she will share pertinent information regarding her legal career and judicial philosophy to enable the Senate and the nation to make a well informed decision   In the meantime  I will reserve my decision until after the Judiciary Committee hearings are completed       As a lawyer and White House counsel  Harriet Miers offers a different and valuable perspective  which has served the Bush Administration well  If confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court  however  she will be an arbiter of justice for all Americans   I look forward to sitting down and discussing this with her
