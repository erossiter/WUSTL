54 to override the Presidents veto of legislation that will fund 18 vitally important water resource priorities in Arkansas  members of the congressional delegation announced today  The U S  Senate is expected to follow suit with its override measure later this week  The bill  which originally received overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses  will then become law over the Presidents veto   The six members of the Arkansas congressional delegation who fought for Arkansass water resource priorities include U S  Senators Blanche Lincoln  D  and Mark Pryor  D  and Representatives Marion Berry  D 1st   Vic Snyder  D 2nd   John Boozman  R 3rd   and Mike Ross  D 4th   The Water Resources Development Act of 2007  WRDA  authorizes more than  23 billion for U S  Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works programs to design  construct  operate and maintain water resource projects across the nation  WRDA has traditionally been used to authorize projects such as dredging  flood control  stream bank erosion  and dam safety  This legislation provides critical funding to assess flood safety  rehabilitate levees  stabilize river banks and channels  and study additional navigation options on our waterways  Lincoln said  Despite the Presidents opposition to these priorities  we in Arkansas know that they are vital to the security of our infrastructure and thus the safety of our communities   President Bush is wrong to shortchange critical infrastructure projects in Arkansas and around the nation  Im pleased there are enough votes to move past partisan politics and override this misguided veto  As a result  our farmers and conservationists will significantly benefit from these investments that protect lives  create economic opportunities and improve overall quality of life  said Pryor   For job growth and economic development to continue in Arkansas  we must ensure our infrastructure is safe and well maintained  said Berry  This bill will authorize funding for projects to prevent flood damage  ensure adequate water supplies for our farmers  and enhance our waterways to promote economic development through increased capacity at our ports and on our waterways

Snyder  Opportunity for Arkansas families will be enhanced by the passage of this bill   WRDA maintains our waterways as a viable means of transportation  and allows our products to compete in a global economy  It also protects our homes and businesses from floods  while enhancing our quality of life by restoring aquatic ecosystems  This bill is an investment in America which has earned wide bipartisan support  and this is why I respectfully disagree with the President and voted to override his veto  Boozman said  I am proud to join with my colleagues in the House to override the President s veto of this vital legislation which will invest needed funds into our nation s infrastructure  Ross said  These projects are vital to the economic well being of numerous communities and
