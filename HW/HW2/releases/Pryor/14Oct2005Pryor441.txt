    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 14  2005     Press Release        A Joint Statement by Senator Mark Pryor and Congressman Marion Berry on the Little Rock Farm Bill Listening Session                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Arkansas farmers are among the most efficient and productive in the world  and they deserve a farm policy that provides stability in an unstable marketplace  The 2002 Farm Bill was written to accomplish that goal  to provide our farmers a safety net when times are tough so they know that the American people are committed to producing a domestic food supply that is safe and affordable        Our farmers need us now more than ever  Arkansas farmers have farmed through drought all summer  excessive rains due to Hurricane Rita  rising diesel prices  rising fertilizer prices  and increased health care costs  As input prices have increased  profit margins have decreased  At this time when Arkansas farmers need our help more than ever  the Administration has proposed to slash the safety net by over  9 billion  including imposing further payment limits that will dramatically hurt family farms  This is wrong  What have Arkansas farmers done to deserve this assault on their brand of agriculture  Our farmers need a Department of Agriculture that fights for them and not against them        Every time this Administration has needed to find revenue  whether to pay for the war in Iraq  cut the deficit  or provide relief from Hurricane Katrina  agriculture has been first on the chopping block  Our farmers know they must do their fair share  but they are currently doing much more than that  It is wrong to continue to ask our farmers to sacrifice when their sacrifice is being used to bolster the security of other countries while reducing our own by driving domestic food production overseas        Most recently  the United States Trade Representative has proposed a 60  cut in domestic farm support in return for increased market access  Others are using this as a smokescreen to dismantle domestic farm programs before the first trade agreement has been signed  It is wrong to dangle more open markets in front of our farmers with one hand and pull the rug out from underneath them at home with the other  We must have policy consistent with our trade obligations that still protects producers at home  American agriculture will not unilaterally disarm          We had hoped that these listening sessions would prove to be just that a chance for everyday producers to weigh in on how Washington policy affects their everyday life  But it seems like the Administration and USDA have already decided how they want to write the next Farm Bill  and we have a hard time believing that Washington bureaucrats know what is best for Arkansas producers        We encourage Secretary Johanns and the Administration to not only to listen to the needs of Arkansas farmers  but also challenge them to address those needs in a comprehensive manner  This country cannot afford to create another relationship that mirrors the one we currently have with oil producing nations  We must not put ourselves in a situation of having to import our food   American families will not be able to balance their budgets if they cannot depend on the stability that our current Farm Bill programs provide  We ask Secretary Johanns to imagine a situation in American where consumers go to the grocery store each week not knowing how much they re going to have to spend to feed their families   Already  consumers go to the gas station asking    What is gas going to cost today       Our country expects more from us  and we believe that this is not the time to reduce our investment in rural America and our farmers  Instead  we should be increasing our support for them we will fight to make sure our farmers are given the tools they need to continue to provide the best food and fiber in the world  We ask that the Administration join us in that task
