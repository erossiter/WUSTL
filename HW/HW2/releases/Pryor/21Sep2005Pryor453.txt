                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON D C     The Senate unanimously approved Senator Mark Pryor  s amendment to stop a plan by the United States Department of Agriculture to close 665 Farm Service Agency offices  including 20 out of 64 offices in Arkansas         Pryor teamed up with Senator Jim Talent  R MO  in offering an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Bill that would prohibit the USDA from implementing its plan until they conduct a full analysis to determine if the planned closures would be cost effective and would enhance services to farmers   He said FSA offices have proven to be a critical partner in helping farmers receive farm program services  including emergency assistance  farm ownership and operating loans  and conservation and environmental assistance            We can have the best farm programs in the world  but without the infrastructure in place to deliver those program benefits  farmers will suffer     Pryor said    I  m glad my Senate colleagues agree with me  and we  re going to fight the USDA on this plan unless they can show us that it will improve services to farmers  not negate them             Pryor said many Arkansas producers are facing one of the worst droughts in recent history  which has only been compounded in the Delta by Hurricane Katrina and the resulting disruptions in Mississippi River traffic           I spend a lot of time with our farmers  and one thing they tell me is that they know and trust the on the ground services provided by local FSA offices     Pryor said      Now  when farmers need help the most  is not the time to propose office closures and remove customer service     Pryor said        There are 64 FSA offices in Arkansas  including in Dewitt  Hamburg  Mountain Home  Bentonville  Harrison  Warren  Berryville  Lake Village  Arkadelphia  Piggott  Heber Springs

into the Congressional Record   Mr  President  I rise today to speak on an amendment offered by myself and the Senator from Missouri  Senator Talent on the Department of Agriculture  s plan to eliminate up to 665 local Farm Service Agency offices around the country  One third of the offices in my home state of Arkansas would be closed under this plan        Our amendment would prohibit the implementation of this plan until a full analysis is conducted by USDA to determine if the planned closure would be cost effective and would enhance program delivery to farmers       Mr  President  I spend a lot of time with our farmers  and one thing they tell me when I  m home is that you can have the best farm programs but without the infrastructure in place to deliver those program benefits  farmers still suffer  This is a pivotal time for American agriculture  and our farmers need us now more than ever  Just this year many of our producers are facing one of the worst droughts in recent history  In addition  many crops in the Delta region were devastated by Hurricane Katrina and the resulting disruptions in Mississippi River traffic        The safety net we put in place in the 2002 Farm Bill has been effective but only to the extent that those programs are delivered to producers on a timely basis  Now  just when our farmers need us most  is not the time to propose wholesale office closures and remove invaluable customer service from our producers        Good policy needs great people to implement that policy  and local Farm Service Agencies are on the front lines of implementing that policy  Without their hard work and sacrifice  many family farms would not have the resources necessary to make a living and provide America with the world  s safest  cheapest  and most abundant food supply        Mr  President  I have a hard time believing that bureaucrats in Washington know what is best for producers in Arkansas  My constituents tell me that that their local FSA offices are indispensable  Often  county employees work late nights and weekends to get program benefits to farmers  They know that a week in delays can mean the difference between a producer clearing a great crop or losing their farm  They know firsthand the many hardships our producers face        I applaud the Department if their intent is to find ways to better and more efficiently serve our producers  We should always be looking for ways to get our producers the assistance they need as quickly as possible  But that effort should not come at the expense of current service  FSA county employees are already overworked and stretched too thin  Now is not the time to exacerbate that problem  and I believe the current USDA plan does just that        I would like to thank the Senator from Missouri  Mr  Talent  for his hard work and leadership on this issue  I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment  and I urge them to talk to their local FSA offices as well as producers  I believe that if they do  they will understand how important these offices are to our producers and American agriculture  Thank you  Mr  President  I yield the floor
