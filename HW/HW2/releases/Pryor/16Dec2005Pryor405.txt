    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         December 16  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor  on the Iraqi Parliamentary Elections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Yesterday  the citizens of Iraq went to the polls to democratically elect a new parliament   This is a truly historic event for a country that has seen so much tyranny and devastation over the years   By most every account  the vast majority of eligible Iraqi voters proudly cast their ballots for the candidates of their choosing   This is a tremendous step forward in the establishment of a democratic  unified Iraq   In addition to the bravery of countless Iraqi citizens that have rejected the hatred and terror of the insurgents in favor of a free and peaceful future  this event was very much a result of the valor of our men and women in uniform   I join all Americans in expressing my gratitude for the work they have done and the sacrifices they have made         It was also very encouraging to see an indication that the Iraqis are taking control of their own security  as shown by the countless Iraqi troops guarding polling stations throughout the country  protecting the liberty of their fellow countrymen   I am hopeful that yesterday  s events will mark a turning point for the future of Iraq   There is certainly a lot of ground to cover  but I will be rooting for the success of the Iraqi people as they seek to form a unified  sovereign government  which respects human rights
