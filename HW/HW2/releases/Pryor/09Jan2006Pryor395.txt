    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         January 9  2006     Press Release        Arkansas Delegation Calls on CMS to Fix Operational Problems of new Medicare Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC     After receiving numerous complaints from pharmacists and Medicare beneficiaries throughout Arkansas  Senators Blanche Lincoln  and Mark Pryor  along with U S  Representatives Marion Berry  AR 01   Vic Snyder  AR 02   Mike Ross  AR 04   and John Boozman  AR 03   sent a letter to Mark McClellan  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   requesting his immediate attention to a number of operational problems with the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit  These setbacks make it difficult for pharmacies to provide continuous drug coverage and prevent many patients from receiving necessary prescriptions       The operational problems began on January 1  2006  when pharmacists tried to use the CMS database to deliver prescriptions to Medicare recipients  Pharmacists struggled to find patient information in the overwhelmed and incomplete database  which is lacking information on some individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid  and does not recognize low income subsidy patients  As pharmacists are unable to locate a patient s plan  they are either turning people away or providing prescription drugs at no charge         Some Prescription Drug Plans  PDPs  are adding to the confusion by refusing to fill prescriptions for dual eligible enrollees whose drugs are not covered under plan formularies  This is a direct violation of the CMS regulations which require private plans to provide continuous drug coverage during this transition       The Arkansas Delegation is also calling on CMS to clarify language that may conflict with Arkansas state law by allowing Long Term Care facilities to contract with a single Long Term Care pharmacy on behalf of all its residents  However  Arkansas state law protects a nursing home patient s right to choose their own pharmacy        A copy of the letter is provided below       January 9  2006         Mark McClellan  M D   Ph D   Administrator  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  314G Hubert H  Humphrey Building  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20201       Dear Dr  McClellan       We are writing on behalf of our constituents to express our concern with the implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit   We believe that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  should immediately address serious operational problems which are leaving many Medicare beneficiaries without necessary prescriptions        Those most severely affected are the dual eligible population  people with both Medicare and Medicaid   We are concerned that the safety net created by CMS to ensure all dual eligibles were able to receive their medications has fallen short   Specifically      1  The electronic database has in many cases been unable to handle queries from pharmacists trying to find out which plan dually eligible beneficiaries are enrolled in       2  Pharmacists are often unable to process prescriptions for dual eligibles who switched from their original plan   Patient information is not being updated in such cases  and pharmacists are unable to locate the new plan or receive reimbursement        3  Some Prescription Drug Plans  PDPs  have refused to fill initial prescriptions for new enrollees that are not covered under their formularies   However  all plans were required by CMS to have policies to transition new enrollees and ensure continuous drug coverage   PDPs are unaware or are ignoring this requirement  leaving pharmacists with the dilemma of turning away beneficiaries or giving away medicines for free       4  The database is also failing to recognize eligibility for the Low Income Subsidy  LIS  program  meaning that enrollees in this group are charged substantially more than they are supposed to pay for drugs   Clearly there needs to be accurate classification of the various beneficiaries served under the new program         In addition  we request that CMS immediately address a problem unique to our constituents in Arkansas   A Long Term Care  LTC  guidance document issued by CMS on March 16th  2005  states    We expect that each LTC facility will select one or possibly more than one eligible NLTCP to provide Medicare drug benefits to its residents   A facility can continue to contract exclusively if it chooses  however  the features to promote competition       will likely give each facility access to a broader range of potential LTC pharmacies than is the case today      We believe this guidance to be inadequate and ask CMS to promptly clarify the intent on a patient s right to choose a pharmacy when such a right exists under state law       We thank you for your attention to these matters and look forward to your prompt response            Sincerely        Blanche Lincoln       Mark Pryor      Marion Berry       Vic Snyder      Mike Ross      John Boozman
