                                                                                                                                      Top Legislative Priorities focus on Arkansas Families  the Military  and Consumer Affairs   WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Mark Pryor today announced he is looking forward to a busy and productive 110th Congress   He plans to focus on issues that will impact Arkansas families  the military  and consumer affairs   Those initiatives are as follows        Veterans Education and Training Act    This act will expand benefits under the G I  Bill to help veterans enter high growth industries  including trucking  construction  hospitality and energy           Tax Relief for Americans in Combat Act  TRAC Act     Senator Pryor will fight to ensure the TRAC Act is made permanent   The TRAC Act allows soldiers to collect combat pay and take advantage of other tax benefits  such as the Child Tax Credit   Currently  the TRAC Act has been singed into law by the President  however  it has not been made permanent            Estate Tax Reform    Senator Pryor will continue to work on a bipartisan compromise that would ease the estate tax burden for all families and most likely erase it entirely for virtually every small business owner and family farmer in Arkansas           Rural Renaissance Act    This act will increase capital for small communities to add and or improve needed infrastructure   The act would pay for the investment by allowing non profits to issue tax credit bonds  the proceeds of which would be used to make grants and low interest loans to rural communities   Bond proceeds could be used to leverage a much larger investment than otherwise possible            Farm Bill    Congress will begin work on a new farm bill this year   Senator Pryor will fight for a bill that protects the food safety net and supports Arkansas farmers while continuing to keep the price of food low and the food supply safe   The new bill should also consider permanent agriculture disaster assistance as well as strengthened crop insurance and biofuel energy provisions            Corporate Average Fuel Economy Reform Act  CAFE     This act requires the Secretary of Transportation to raise and reform fuel economy standards  The result is to increase the miles per gallon of passenger vehicles  reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and reduce our dependence on foreign oil            Consumer Identity Protection and Security Act    This act  also known as the   Credit Freeze Act     will allow individuals to shield their credit files from third parties unless permission has been granted           Cyber Safety for Kids Act    This act would establish a domain for inappropriate material as part of a growing responsible solution to the upsurge of Internet pornography  This bill will allow parents to easily block inappropriate material from their children           Consumer Phone Security Act    This act would ban any person from obtaining or selling another person  s private phone information           Do Not Call Registry    Senator Pryor will work to reauthorize the national Do Not Call Registry to continue providing needed protection at home from unwanted telemarketing calls            Timber Tax    Senator Pryor will continue the fight to create a fair tax code for our timber producers   Currently  the tax code penalizes some timber owners while exempting others            Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act    This act keeps ammonium nitrate    used in both bomb making and fertilizer    out of the wrong hands while allowing farmers access           The Child Safe Viewing Act    This act will allow parents to use new video editing technology to decide what their children see and hear on television and movies   By merging video editing software with TV sets  DVD and VCR players  cable boxes  and satellite receiver boxes  inappropriate scenes and language can be cut or muted              Gasoline Price Gouging Act    This act will make gasoline price gouging during an emergency punishable under federal law   Currently  there are a number of states that have a gasoline price gouging law including Arkansas           Drug Re importation Act    This is an effort long supported by Senator Pryor  and he will continue to fight for access to lower cost and safe prescription drugs            Childcare Tax Credit Extension Act    This act would extend the childcare tax credit for working families and single parents beyond the current  3 000 limit            Reequipping the Military    Senator Pryor plans to use his influence on the Senate Armed Services Committee to ensure that there is a renewed effort to reequip our military            RANGER Act    This act will help balance the demand for natural gas by allowing coastal states to opt out of a current moratorium on offshore drilling              The Democratic Controlled 110th Congress will focus on meaningful legislation that will improve people  s lives   said Pryor    I am very pleased that the Senate Democratic Leadership has committed to the principles of bipartisanship  transparency  and getting things done         Also during the 110th Congress  Pryor will work in a bipartisan way to address many more issues including  Iraq  ethics reform  raising the minimum wage  improving Medicare Part D  tackling the high cost of healthcare for small business and the working uninsured  enacting more of the September 11th Commission recommendations  making college more accessible and affordable  reinstating pay go  and starting to reequip our military           Senator Pryor will be one of only a handful of Senators assigned to serve on six committees   These include  Commerce  Science  and Transportation  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Rules and Administration  and Ethics   Pryor also expects to chair a subcommittee on both the Commerce and Homeland Security Committees        In addition  Pryor has been reassigned to the Senate Armed Services Committee    He recently traveled to Iraq in October 2006  with a small bipartisan group of Senators and said that he wants to ensure that our service men and women have the very best training and equipment in order to effectively get their job done   Pryor plans to also use his influence on the committee to ensure that the war in Iraq receives proper congressional oversight and that there is a renewed effort to reequip our military          The 110th Congress was sworn in today  January 4  2007
