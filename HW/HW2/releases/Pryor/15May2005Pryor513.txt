Pine Bluff  but Pledges to Fight Closures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON D C     Senator Mark Pryor today said the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  announcement by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld is a mixed bag for Arkansas military installations  and vowed to continue promoting the necessary role they each play in our nation  s overall defense strategy as the BRAC process moves forward       Pryor said he was very excited the Department of Defense  DOD  has recognized the critical role the Little Rock Air Force Base plays in our overall national defense strategy and has opted to bolster that role  but he expressed disappointment that the DOD did not see the value and potential of some of Arkansas   other military installations  especially as it pertains to Fort Smith and the Red River and Lone Star Army Depots       Pryor stressed that Rumsfeld  s recommendations are only one step in the BRAC process  The BRAC Commission has until October to revise the list and the President will not certify it until November  He pledged to play an active role in protecting Arkansas   military installations throughout the BRAC process          I will continue to work with community leaders and fellow delegation members to promote and protect our military bases    in particular I will be submitting testimony to the BRAC Commission in the upcoming weeks and I have set up a delegation meeting with BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi this week               Little Rock Air Force Base      Pryor said the Little Rock Air Force Base is a big winner in the BRAC process gaining 3 898 personnel and 74 C 130 aircraft   There are currently an estimated 7 156 civilian and military personnel at the base   Pryor said he was proud of the base  s strong showing  and pleased even more personnel will benefit from the base  s new C 130J training facility  intelligence communications equipment  and child development center that he helped secure through the appropriations process        Pryor added that Rumsfeld  s decision to honor pending C 130 J contracts adds to the fortunes of the LRAFB  For several months  Pryor worked with Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA  to convince the Pentagon of the importance of the C 130 J             Today  s recommendation means that the LRAFB will remain this country  s premier C 130 training facility  and Central Arkansas will receive a tremendous economic boost     Pryor said     This victory is a testament to the dedication and skill of the individuals at the base and to the community as a whole          Pine Bluff Arsenal      Pryor said he is also pleased with the DOD  s recommendation to sustain production at the Pine Bluff Arsenal  and he commended Arsenal officials for receiving a designation as a multi functional Munitions Center of Excellence  The Arsenal already stores 12 percent of the nation  s chemical weapons stockpile and maintains an important mission in destroying dangerous chemical weapons no longer used by the military         Pryor said the delegation has made the Arsenal stronger over the past two years with a  1 87 million appropriation to modernize its processing equipment and  24 3 million for its white phosphorous facility    the only one of its kind in the nation        Pryor noted that the Stone United States Army Reserve Center in Pine Bluff will be moved to the Arsenal  which will require a federal investment of  8 9 million to build a new Armed Forces Reserve Center          The Pine Bluff Arsenal remains a strong installation that plays a critical role in our overall national defense strategy  The entire Pine Bluff community knows this  but we can all sleep a little easier knowing that the Pentagon agrees with us     Pryor said          Fort Smith Air Guard      Pryor said he was disappointed with Secretary Rumsfeld  s decision to realign the Fort Smith Air Guard  which involves relocating seven F 16s  retiring eight more and moving the fire fighter positions to Tulsa  OK and the Home Station Training Site to Savannah  GA   Pryor expressed his strong desire to prevent the realignment by working with the delegation to keep the F 16s and helping the 188th find a new  long term mission  if necessary   Pryor said the  6 million Aerospace and Maintenance Complex he secured last year provides a valuable asset that he hopes will not go unnoticed by the BRAC committee            I am disappointed and frankly a bit puzzled that the Secretary would make a decision to realign the 188th  especially at this time   These aircrafts and their pilots right now are proving their combat worthiness by being deployed to Afghanistan     Pryor said     I will continue to work with the delegation to make sure the BRAC Commission understands the value and potential of Fort Smith             Lone Star Army Depot   Red River Army Depot       Pryor said he is disappointed the BRAC recommendation calls for the closure of the Lone Star Army Depot  It would move the Depot  s storage and demilitarization functions to McAlester  IL  the mines and detonators  relays  and delays functions to Iowa  IA  the demolition charges functions to Crane Army Ammunition  IN  artillery and mortar functions to Milan  TN   He said 229 employees would lose their jobs          Pryor said Rumsfeld s plan would to close the Red River Army Depot would have a significant adverse economic impact  costing the community 4 176 jobs            Red River provides depot maintenance for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle  Multiple Launch Rocket System  and Combat Tactical Wheeled Vehicles  Its electronics repair facility supports the Bradley  Multiple Launch Rocket System  and a variety of missile support and aircraft armament subsystems  The depot is also the worldwide center for Patriot and Hawk missile re certification  It also has an ammunition storage mission  intern training center  civilian training  and rubber production facilities         I am disappointed that Secretary Rumsfeld has not seen the obvious value and potential of the Red River and Lone Star Army Depot  They both provide support and maintenance for some of our most critical weapons systems and vehicles including the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Multiple Launch Rocket System  both of which have been critical to our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq     Pryor said         Camp Pike  North Little Rock      Pryor said he will also fight the recommendation to close Camp Pike  which serves as the headquarters for an Army Reserve regional command  He said 177 positions could be lost from this closing         30
