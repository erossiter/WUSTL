    Senator Mark Pryor Press Releases                                                         October 31  2005     Press Release        Statement by Senator Mark Pryor on the Nomination of Samuel A  Alito to the U S  Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I look forward to learning more about Samuel A  Alito as this process goes forward  While I know that he has impeccable credentials it is equally important that he possess the proper judicial temperament and the ability to be fair and impartial  This criterion is essential to me  as I do not believe in placing activist judges on the federal court          I believe the collective goal should be to nominate and confirm justices that will bring this country together   Judge Alito may very well turn out to be an excellent selection  but I am disappointed that President Bush did not take the time to consult with the Senate on his nomination  It is my hope however  that now this process is underway the White House will do a better job of cooperating with the Senate to make sure we have all the information needed to make an informed decision on this nomination         I believe Judge Alito  s confirmation hearing should be rigorous  but fair and I am eager to personally sit down with him to discuss his judicial record and philosophy
