                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Remarks by Senator Murray to the Committee for Education Funding   Annual Legislative Conference  09 29 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Remarks by Senator Murray to the Committee for Education Funding   Annual Legislative Conference  After the Storm   What Hurricane Katrina Revealed About America s Schools    And What We Must Do About It     For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 29  2005    Thank you  Mary  Kusler  CEF President   for that kind introduction  and thank you all for that warm welcome   As some of you may know  I ve been a pre school teacher  a PTA member  and a school board president  so I know first hand about some of the challenges you re facing in your schools         And I have never been more proud of America s schools and colleges than I ve been in the past few weeks    watching you open your hearts and your classrooms to all of the students who ve been displaced by Hurricane Katrina          In the face of so much devastation and turmoil    our public schools have really been a bright light    reflecting the best of our country s values and giving children an anchor in turbulent times   The images of students going to school in Texas and Michigan and my home state of Washington were a strong and very welcome counterpoint to the horrible images we saw in those first dark days        It s estimated that more than 370 000 students were displaced   And in spite of the normal burdens our schools endure    like overcrowded classrooms and not enough student aid    you found a way to stretch even further and make room for children who needed a place in school  and I want to say thank you       Lessons From Hurricane Katrina    I believe that Hurricane Katrina has revealed some lessons about American education that we must follow if we want our country to be strong   I want to talk about those lessons today  and I want to discuss some of the drastic changes that are being proposed in response to the Hurricane    everything from vouchers  to waivers  to funding cuts       My Bottom Line    My bottom line is this   While it s important to do things fast  it s more important to do them right   And Congress needs to hear from you if it s going to make the right choices in the weeks to come   We should be rewarding our public schools for doing the right thing   We should be empowering them and funding them so they can help every child reach his or her full potential   I don t see that happening today   I see a government that is ready to pursue the wrong priorities  and it s up to us to stand up for our students                                                             Welcome    Now before I turn to specifics  I do want to welcome all of you Washington  D C  for this conference  I know what it s like to try and persuade elected officials to treat education as a priority   That s why I m so grateful for the work all of you do  both at your local schools around the country and together through the Committee for Education Funding        I especially want to welcome those of you who have traveled a long way to be with us including some of my friends from back home in Washington state    Rod Grimm and Shirley McCune from the state Superintendent s office       We Need You Here    Now as much as I like having all of you here in Washington  D C   the truth is we need you here to get Congress and the White House to do the right thing for America s students   In the coming weeks  Congress will be making decisions about how to help students affected by Hurricane Katrina   It is urgent work   But those decisions will reach far beyond schools in the Gulf Coast  They will impact schools in every community for years to come   Congress will also be making funding decisions that will affect every student in America   I want to help you understand what s at stake for our students  and I want to make sure you have a strong voice in those debates        Before I do that  I know many of you may not know me  so I want you to understand why I care so much about public education   Some very personal experiences led me to seek a seat in the United States Senate and positions on the committees that set education policy and set the funding levels for our public schools       My Story    I grew up in a large family in a small town in Washington   When I was growing up  we didn t have much  but we survived because we took good care of each other    But when I was 15 years old  my family was truly shaken to the core    Life changed dramatically when my dad was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis   As his disease got worse  my father used a cane and eventually became wheelchair bound and had to quit work         My mom  after 16 years of staying home  had to go to work to support our family    She had a hard time finding a job that would pay enough to support seven children and a husband with growing medical bills   To get a better paying job  my mom needed more training   Through a government program  she got a degree in accounting at a vocational technical college and eventually got a better job   My twin sister  my older brother and I were able to stay in college through Pell grants and student loans   And we survived on Social Security disability checks   As a family    through no fault of our own we had fallen on hard times          But we got the support we needed   Whether it was food  training for a better job  or help paying for college and eventually because of the support and backing our family got    all seven of us graduated from college   Because we got the support we needed  today those seven kids are  a firefighter  a lawyer  a computer programmer  a sportswriter  a homemaker  a junior high school teacher  and a United States Senator  In my book  that was a great investment        Education Was the Key for My Family    I have never forgotten that education was the key for my family   Our public school system reflects the best values of our country   Everyday it proves that no matter where you come from  no matter who your parents are  no matter if you re rich or poor  education empowers you to rise above your circumstances and reach your full potential   So I ve been proud to fight for public education    starting when my husband and I had our own two children       My Own Start in Education    When my kids were little  I participated in a parent education program in Washington state   One day in the early 80 s  the Washington State Legislature announced it was going to close down this program   The legislators in Olympia told me that it could not be saved   But I didn  t listen   Instead  I organized a grassroots campaign   We brought together thousands of parents from across the state   We wrote letters   We held rallies  and together  we saved that pre school program        Later  I ran for the local school board  served in the Washington State Senate  and then I decided to run for the United States Senate   A lot of people told me that I could not become a United States Senator because I didn  t have the right background   They told me I didn  t have enough experience  They told me I couldn  t raise the money   They even told me I was too short   In turns out that when I got elected to the Senate in 1993  I became the fourth tallest woman in the United States Senate       I Learned It All Teaching Pre School    And the experts were wrong in saying I didn  t have enough experience to be a senator   The truth is that I learned everything I needed to know about the United States Senate by teaching pre school   I learned to treat others as you  d like to be treated  to make sure everyone has a chance to speak  and to never let the bullies win       Today  Key Supports Are Threatened    Today  many of the things that helped me and my family rise above our circumstances are being threatened   Pell Grants  vocational education  and keeping taxpayer dollars in our public schools where they serve all students   And I m concerned that some in Washington  D C  see an opening after Katrina to push ideological experiments on America s schoolchildren          Well you need to know  I m not going to sit back and let politicians make choices that will undermine our public schools for years to come  and I know you won t sit back either        I think it s worth looking at three lessons this hurricane has revealed about American education        Katrina Revealed How Flexible Our Schools Are in Responding to Changing Needs        First is how incredibly flexible our schools and colleges have been in accommodating so many displaced students   The flexibility we ve seen in the past few weeks is a reflection of a much larger truth about public schools   Whenever there are changes in our society  it s our public schools that are often the first to have to deal with them   Today  our schools are expected to be an educator  a parent  a disciplinarian  a social worker  and more    and to do it all with more accountability and less funding   If we expect our schools to keep handling new burdens and new challenges  we need to provide funding at the federal level        New demands    without new funding    is a recipe for disaster  and that s one of the lessons of the No Child Left Behind Act   It is the greatest  bait and switch  ever perpetrated on our public schools   Schools were promised that in exchange for greater accountability they would get great funding   Congress sure handed them the first part  but Congress has never delivered on the second part  and our students are paying a price   The lesson I draw is that our schools are flexible    but as we ask them to do more    we have to provide the funding that enables them to do more       Katrina Revealed How Much We Depend on Our Public Schools    Second  Hurricane Katrina drove home how central schools are to our communities and to normal  everyday life   Our schools are the backbone of local neighborhoods    They are also key to helping students get back to normal   I m told that when children arrived in shelters  one of the first questions they asked  When can I go back to school    For students  school is such a critical part of their identity and experience that getting them back in school is a key part of getting of helping them get back to normal          Friends  those are the positive lessons    our schools are flexible  and they are essential   But the federal response to Hurricane Katrina has also revealed some bad things about how the federal government treats public education       Katrina Revealed the Priorities Are Still Wrong    The third lesson is this   In Washington  D C  the folks in charge still have the wrong priorities   For years  this Administration pushed through budgets that say tax cuts for a few at the top are more important than investments in the public schools and colleges that serve all children   We saw that again this year in February when the President presented his budget  which for the first time in history would actually cut funding for education   We saw it again in April when the Republicans pushed through a budget resolution that would force deep cuts in education   I voted against that budget  and I would do so again       Where Were Legislators on the Budget Resolution       In your meetings on the Hill this afternoon  members of Congress are going to tell you    of course education is important   and  of course  they wouldn t vote to cut education          But the real test came months ago   Did they vote for the budget resolution    for the budget blueprint that locked in the cuts we re now seeing   If they voted for a bad budget outline back then  they can t tell you today that they re on your side   Holding them accountable for their votes is the only way to force change       Their Pattern  Tax Cuts First   Fund Schools Last    Putting tax cuts first and public schools and college students last is a pattern we ve seen time and again from those in charge    and it even continues today in the response to Hurricane Katrina        The president has said we ll spend whatever it takes    but we can t touch the tax cuts   Those who are well off will be protected    and those who suffered in the hurricane will be made whole only by cutting other programs they depend on       The House Proposal Is Dangerous    In the House of Representatives  the Republican leadership has announced how it would like to pay for the disaster recovery    not by easing tax cuts for those doing well  but by cutting services for those who need the most help   Let me give you a few examples   Under the House Republican plan  the recovery would be paid for by         eliminating Even Start    a family literacy program        by eliminating funding for Safe and Drug Free Schools        by eliminating LEAP grants    which help students go to and pay for college        and by making fewer children eligible for free lunch        To me  that s just crazy   You don t fund recovery on the backs of people who already need more help than they re getting        After Katrina  the need for literacy has not fallen  but they want to eliminate Even Start   After Katrina  the need for counseling to help children avoid violence  drugs and alcohol has not diminished  but they re ready to pull the plug on Safe and Drug Free Schools   After Katrina  the number of students who need help going to college hasn t fallen  but they re ready to drop LEAP assistance   And after Katrina  the number of children who rely on the government to be able to eat lunch in school so they can learn instead of sitting there hungry has not gone down  but they want to make fewer students eligible for free and reduced lunch   That s wrong      Vouchers   Broad Waiver Authority    I m also very concerned about some of the things the Bush Administration is pushing Congress to do under the guise of Katrina    The President wants public taxpayer dollars to go to private schools through vouchers    I believe there are ways to help affected private schools without going on political ideology          The Administration is also demanding broad waiver authority    Obviously our schools  at all levels  need flexibility in certain areas  but we need to be cautious about protecting our schools and students        So I m very troubled by three things            The continued focus on the wrong priorities    such as choosing to cut education and other programs to pay for recovery      I m troubled by the rush to adopt ideological experiments    through private school vouchers       And I m troubled by this attempt to overreach and throw out the protections that serve out students well       We Can Do Better    We can do better  and in the Senate we have a bipartisan proposal that is based on the right priorities   I am working to help pass S  1715  a bill written by Senator Mike Enzi and Senator Ted Kennedy  to help our nation s elementary  secondary schools and colleges respond to the disaster   Let me share with you some of the key provisions       Our Bipartisan Recovery Bill    The bill provides funding and increased flexibility for the Child Care Development Block Grant and Head Start to address the early childhood education needs of children displaced by Katrina        For elementary and secondary schools  the bill provides flexibility and funding for both schools impacted by Katrina and those school districts that are have accepted displaced students   The bill also provides funding for schools to provide early intervention services to special education students who have relocated as a result of Katrina    It helps students who need extra help to succeed in school and students who have individual education plans        For higher education  the bill also makes progress   It gives students flexibility so they don  t have to repay grant aid they received or make loan payments for a year   It allows institutions to hold onto undisbursed aid so they can rebuild their colleges   It s a good  balanced bill  and I d like to encourage you to mention it when you talk with your Senators and Representatives this afternoon       FY 2006 Funding    Now as you well know  legislation to help with the recovery is not the only thing Congress is dealing with   We re also working on the 2006 funding bill and the Higher Education Act        As I look at the funding for the next fiscal year  I know that our hands are tied by the Budget Resolutions that Republicans passed months ago        As you may recall  the Republican budget resolution followed the President s budget proposal   It eliminated 48 education programs    ranging from family literacy to career and tech education to the TRIO and GEAR UP programs   In March  I used my seat on the Senate Budge Committee to try and fix that budget plan   I offered an amendment to restore nearly  5 billion in funding   Unfortunately  my amendment was defeated on a party line vote        So we ve got a budget that cuts funding for the Department of Education for the first time in a decade    at a time when our schools need more help    not less   We all know the requirements of NCLB and costs of attending college are not decreasing   It shouldn  t be a victory for a program to be level funded  and not eliminated       Bright Spot    Pell Grants    Now there is one bright spot on education funding for the coming year  and it concerns higher education   We have improved funding for Pell Grants through the Higher Education Act   We started a program called ProGAP  which will give more money for students who receive Pell Grants   The bill authorizes and appropriates  5 5 billion  4 5 billion in additional grant assistance to all Pell eligible students and  1 billion in new grant assistance to Pell eligible students studying math  science  technology  engineering or certain foreign languages   ProGAP would provide enough funding to increase the maximum Pell grant by  300 in FY2006    I think that shows that Congress is capable of getting its priorities straight  but it requires everyone in the education community to speak up and speak out until we get results        Fixing Our High Schools    Obviously  I believe the federal government can and must do better for our schools and students   One area in education about which I am personally concerned today is our nation  s high school   So before I close I want to mention a bill I could use your help to pass   Here in Washington  D C   we talk a lot about global competitiveness   We know that education will be the core of how economically competitive we are as a nation           However  we are losing too many kids at the high school level   Many of those students who do graduate do not have the academic skills to succeed fully in post secondary education or careers without remediation   Currently  states and localities shoulder funding for our nation  s high school   I believe it is time for the federal government to play a role both with policy and funding          I have a bill called the Pathways for All Students to Succeed or the PASS Act  which targets four specific problems in our high schools   It targets academic preparedness through an increased focus on math and literacy skills   It provides for academic counselors so that all students have the information they need to succeed in post secondary education and careers  It assists schools in knowing who is and who is not graduating from high school so they target resources appropriately   And it provides increased funding for innovative programs in schools determined to be in need of improvement        Conclusion    Friends  the PASS Act is the type of legislation that sets the right priorities   It recognizes the value of public education and makes the right investments   The only way to get Congress to pass that type of solution is to make sure every Member of Congress hears from you and understands what s at stake          They need to know that whether they re voting a budget resolution  on an amendment to boost education funding  or a bill like the PASS Act    they are either voting for    or voting against    America s students   And they need to know that you will hold them accountable for their vote        So in closing  looking back on the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina  it s clear our government has many lessons to learn about preparation  coordination and communication   But it also has lessons to learn about education    about the flexibility of our schools  the role they play in our society  and the value they return when we invest in them   It is my highest hope that together we can make sure Congress learns the right lessons in the coming months   And by doing that    we can make sure that the opportunities that helped me rise from a family that was facing real challenges to a member of the United States Senate are still available for every child in America
