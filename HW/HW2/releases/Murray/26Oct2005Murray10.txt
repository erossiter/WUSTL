                                                           News Release          Murray Offers FDA Amendment to Investigate Mismanagement at the FDA    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 26  2005       WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   a champion for a strong and independent FDA  today introduced an amendment to the Labor  Health and Human Services  LHHS  Appropriations bill that would help support an investigation into possible mismanagement at the Food and Drug Administration        Senator Murray  s amendment  H R  3010  would shift  3 million from the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services  HHS  to the Office of the Inspector General at HHS in order to conduct an investigation into potential mismanagement at the FDA       Senator Murray  s remarks on her amendment H R  3010 follow           M  President I rise this evening to offer an amendment that should not need to be offered          In fact  each time I come to the floor to talk about Plan B and the FDA  I hope that it will be the last time   I continue to hope that the FDA or HHS will just do the right thing and finally put science  safety and efficacy over politics         Unfortunately  M  President  over the course of the past several years  I    along with millions of Americans    have been disappointed time and time again          M  President  I have always supported a strong and independent Food and Drug Administration  It is the only way in which the FDA can truly operate effectively and with the confidence of American consumers and health care providers         Americans must have faith that when they walk into their local grocery store or pharmacy that the products they purchase are safe and effective and that their approval has been based on sound science    not political pressure or pandering to interest groups         And that is why the application process for Plan B emergency contraceptives has been so troubling         Back in December of 2003    almost two years ago    the FDA  s own scientific advisory board overwhelmingly recommended approval of Plan B  s over the counter application by a vote of 23 4  but the FDA has not adhered to its own guidelines for drug approval and continues to drag its heels         In fact  Alastair Wood  a member of the advisory panel  said that           What  s disturbing is that the science was overwhelming here  and the FDA is supposed to make decisions on science           M  President  it is obvious to me    to many of my colleagues    and to millions of American women    that something other than science is going on at the FDA        And  M  President  it is far past time to get to the bottom if it         That is why I am offering this amendment tonight to shift  3 million from the Office of the Secretary to the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services    This funding will help the Inspector General  s office to investigate potential mismanagement at the FDA        This investigation will be separate from ongoing investigations of the former Commissioner    Lester Crawford    and will include  but not be limited to  the over the counter application for Plan B           M  President  let me be clear  the men and women of the FDA work hard   They adhere to the principles of science   They do a job that all Americans can be proud of          But  M  President  their hard work is being undermined and overshadowed by the Agency  s own leadership        If the leadership at the FDA and HHS refuses to take steps to restore the confidence of American consumers in the FDA  s ability to promote safe and effective treatments  then Congress must step in         M  President  the health and well being of the American people should not blow with the political winds         Caring for our residents is an American issue and part of that goal is ensuring that our residents have access to safe  effective medicines in a timely fashion         Time and time again  I    along with my colleague Senator Clinton of NY    and others    have asked for a decision on Plan B   We have not dictated that we want a   yes    or a   no       just that we want a decision    This continued foot dragging is unusual  unwarranted and unprofessional        This continued delay goes against everything the FDA  s own advisory panel found nearly two years ago  that Plan B is safe and effective and should be available over the counter         There is no credible scientific reason to continue to deny increased access to this safe health care option    but there is even less reason to deny an answer         M  President this is not the last word on this issue  The problem with politics subverting the FDA  s adherence to science and its integrity is so profound and so urgent that I intend to use every tool available to me as a Senator to make sure that this discussion about our priorities and our future is not lost
