                                                                      News Release          Senator Murray s Remarks Introducing the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  November 15  2005                       Today  Senator Collins and I are introducing an innovative  bipartisan plan to make America safer  Four years ago  terrorists used our own transportation infrastructure to attack our people and our economy   Four years later  we ve made some progress  but we are still vulnerable       Biggest Danger   Security experts both inside and outside our government have concluded that one of the biggest dangers is our cargo container system   The 9 11 Commission said that opportunities to hurt our nation are  as great or greater  in areas like maritime transportation as there  are in aviation       Every year  millions of containers move cargo from factories overseas to America s seaports     But too often  we don t know what s in these cargo containers   We don t know who s handled them  We don  t know if what s written on the manifest actually matches what s inside the container  And we don t know which containers need extra scrutiny        Smuggling in Terrorists   What we do know  however  is disturbing   We know that for years  smugglers have tried to use cargo containers to smuggle people into the United States   We also know of at least one incident in which a suspected terrorist hid inside a cargo container   Four years ago  at a port in Italy  a suspected terrorist was found inside a cargo container bound from Egypt to Canada   According to press reports  he had a laptop computer  mobile and satellite phones  airport security passes  and a mechanic s certificate for four airports in the United States      Containers as Weapons   We also know that terrorists could use a cargo container as a weapon itself   Terrorists could fill a container with a biological  chemical or nuclear weapon  wait until it reaches American shores  and then detonate it   If terrorists launched an attack on    or through    America s seaports  it would inflict two levels of damage      Loss of Lives   First  we d experience a significant American loss of lives   Since many ports are located in large cities  the human toll of an attack could be devastating   One study found that a nuclear device detonated at a major seaport could kill from 50 000 to 1 million people       Economic Damage   Second  an attack would inflict untold damage to our nation s economy   After September 11th  the government shut down commercial aviation   After a seaport attack  our ports would be closed as well   While the airports were shut for about 4 days  a similar shutdown of our ports could last up to 4 months  according to the former U S  Maritime Administrator   One port security study found that a 12 day shutdown of America s ports would cost our economy  58 billion   U S  companies    who rely on  just in time  delivery    would struggle without the inventory or supplies they need   One of the big problems is that today we don t have a system in place to resume trade after an incident   If an attack happened tomorrow  we d have to invent a system on the spot      Current Programs Are Inadequate   The vulnerability is clear and the possible damage is overwhelming  but today  our current cargo security efforts are falling short   Recent investigations by the Government Accountability Office have confirmed major weaknesses in existing programs   It s clear that we need a new  comprehensive plan to protect the American people and the American economy   That is what Senator Collins and I are offering      Our Bill   Together  we have worked with security experts and stakeholders to develop an innovative new approach called the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act   Our bill reflects the need to make America safer while still keeping our cargo container system efficient        How It Works   Here s how it works   First  we re going to raise cargo security standards for everyone   To do that            We empower the Department of Homeland Security to issue new rules and regulations       We provide the needed funding         We create one office to coordinate cargo security policy       We create Joint Operations Centers to help resume the flow of commerce after an incident or during a heightened national security threat level       We authorize and improve existing programs like the Port Security Grant Program  the Container Security Initiative and the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism      The GreenLane   Second  we create the GreenLane program   It s a voluntary  enhanced security system   It will allow our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats  and it will provide real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures   The GreenLane will use technology and information to track packages from factories overseas throughout the supply chain  We ll know what is in each container  who s handled it  if it s been tampered with and if it needs more scrutiny       If importers agree to join the GreenLane program  they will receive certain benefits   For example  their bonding requirements will be reduced or eliminated   Instead of paying customs duties on every shipment  they could be billed monthly or quarterly  Their cargo will be subject to fewer searches and will be released faster upon entering the United States  They ll lose less cargo to theft  and they ll have the stability that comes from having one uniform standard to plan around       The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act will protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   Our bill will protect our people and our economy from attack   It provides layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient   And finally it will push the borders out and reduce the haystack so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo   Our bill addresses the lessons learned from the 9 11 Commission and acts on the recommendations made by the GAO       I want to thank the many security and industry leaders who ve worked with us to shape an effective bill  and I want to thank Senator Collins for her partnership and leadership   We are standing together offering a real  bipartisan solution to a serious danger  and we welcome the support of everyone who cares about protecting our people and our economy
