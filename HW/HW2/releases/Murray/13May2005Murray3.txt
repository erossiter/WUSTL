Patty Murray today commended a recommendation by the Pentagon that all of Washington state  s military bases should remain operational   Murray  who is a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee  has been a strong and consistent advocate for Washington state bases throughout her service in the Senate   Senator Murray helped secure over  1 3 billion in funding for Washington s military bases in fiscal years 1998 2005          Overall  today  s recommendation by the Department of Defense to protect bases across Washington state is a tribute to the strength of our installations and the commitment of our communities   I am proud that our state    from local businesses to our state government and Congressional delegation stood united and spoke with one voice in support of our military bases          The BRAC recommendation list reflects what those of us in Washington state have known all along    all of our bases are strategically important to our nation  s security and our ability to project force worldwide   Our bases work together like a family    supporting each other and helping each other carry out their missions   They are all interconnected          Our soldiers at Fort Lewis rely on the airplanes at McChord to get overseas   Our planes at McChord rely on the tankers at Fairchild for refueling   Our air assets at Whidbey support the missions at Everett and Bangor and all of our bases depend on the force projection that comes from our carriers in the Puget Sound        Today  s list also includes reorganization recommendations that will impact our state   We will work together to minimize the effect on our military  local communities and businesses        We will also work to ensure that the future use of these military assets will benefit the communities that have supported them for so long        Today  s recommendations paint a positive picture of the military partnership with our state  one which will bring new assets and additional missions well into the future   But this process isn  t over   We can  t declare victory today        Over the next several months we must continue to work together to ensure that the BRAC Commission agrees with the Pentagon  s assessment of our bases          We have all worked together  year after year  to keep our facilities modern and to ensure that our soldiers have all the resources and support they need   Now we must redouble our efforts to support and advocate for our bases which mean so much to our national defense and the strength and growth of our communities         I applaud the initiative of our state legislature  led by Governor Gregoire  to make critical investments in our bases and bolster them well into the future   I will continue to work on the federal level to provide our bases and soldiers with the support they need to prepare for their critical missions        On land  in the air and at sea  Washington state  s military operations are contributing to the strength and defense of our nation   Today  s recommendations prove that our state has the assets and geography to provide the best possible home and training environment for our Armed Forces well into the future           Timeline of Senator Murray  s work to support and modernize our bases follows
