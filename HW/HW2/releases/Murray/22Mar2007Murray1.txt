Veterans and Returning Iraq and Afghanistan Service Members  1 76 billion for veterans and  2 5 billion for DOD care included in Supplemental Appropriations bill     Murray says   The days of ignoring our troops as a cost of this war are over      For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 22  2007         This supplemental funding passed the full Senate on 3 29 07         Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  voted to include over  4 billion for the care of veterans and active duty service members in the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill  The funding includes  1 76 billion for veterans programs and  2 5 billion for the Department of Defense  DoD  which will go toward the care of returning Iraq and Afghanistan service members  Senator Murray voted for the funding as part of the Supplemental Appropriations bill which was passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee today  The bill will now go to the full Senate          For the last four years the Bush administration has conducted this war with little regard for the tremendous strains it is placing on the VA  our veterans and their families   Today  we put an end to their neglect   said Senator Murray   The days of ignoring our troops as a cost of this war are over         In addition to being a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Murray is the fourth ranking Democrat in the Senate leadership and a senior member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee  Last year  Senator Murray fought to amend the Fiscal Year 2006 Supplemental Appropriations bill to included  430 million in funding for veterans  Unfortunately  that funding was eliminated during negotiations between the House and Senate        The Supplemental Appropriations bill passed today includes funding for the two government agencies responsible for the care or returning soldiers   The Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran s Affairs  Senator Murray has been working for a system that provides not only quality care at both agencies but also a seamless transition between the two         This bill ensures that the lessons of Walter Reed are not forgotten   Murray said   When our troops get back from oversees we need to guarantee that they are given first class care         1 76 Billion for Veterans   The Supplemental Appropriations bill that was passed today includes  1 76 billion that will go towards veterans programs  The president included no funding for veterans care in his Supplemental Appropriations bill request         The priorities that funding will go toward include          82 8 million for VA polytrauma centers TBI treatment   This funding will be utilized to treat the influx of TBI patients at VA facilities throughout the country  TBI has emerged as the signature wound of the Iraq conflict in large part due to service member s exposure to IED explosions  TBI can often be an unseen wound and the VA has struggled to properly diagnose and treat the increasing number of TBI cases         150 million for Mental Health Substance Abuse Readjustment Counseling   A large portion of this funding   100 million  will go toward targeting areas where VA mental health care is lacking  Additional funding will go toward building capacity at inpatient and outpatient substance abuse programs and opening new VA Vet Centers        201 million for Iraq and Afghanistan Vets   This funding will be specifically targeted to care for Iraq and Afghanistan vets whose numbers have been underestimated by the VA        845 million to the Veterans Health Administration   This funding will ensure efficient management and medical facilities for VA healthcare system  This funding is particularly necessary given the recent internal VA audit that cited 1 100 VA facility issues including leaky roofs  deteriorating walls  and mold           46 million for the Veterans Benefits Administration   This funding is badly needed to hire and train up to 400 new VA claims processors to address the growing backlog of benefits claims         355 9 million for minor construction projects        30 million for medical and prosthetic research       36 1 million for information technology                  2 5 Billion for Department of Defense Health Programs    The Supplemental Appropriations bill also includes  2 5 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for the care of returning Iraq and Afghanistan service members  That total is  1 3 billion over the President s request        The priorities the DoD funding will go toward include          740 million in uncovered and unbudgeted fees       500 million to eliminate  efficiency wedge  savings and reinvest in military hospitals         20 million to repair facilities at Walter Reed       100 million for TBI and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  treatment and research
