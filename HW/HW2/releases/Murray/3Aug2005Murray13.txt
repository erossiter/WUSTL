Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing    Coming Home from Combat   Are Veterans Getting the Help They Need      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  August 3  2005    Good morning  I call this hearing of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee to order  I want to welcome all of you  and thank you for coming   By being here today  you are sending a strong message that we care about everyone who serves our nation   Every day  in ways large and small  Washington state military personnel are making us proud  They are facing challenges overseas  and their families are making sacrifices here at home  They are doing what our country asked        Now  as they come home  we must do what our country promised  heal their wounds  meet their needs  and ease their return to family  to work  and to our community  I ve called this hearing to explore one question  Are today s veterans getting the help they need as they come home from combat  To answer that question  we will hear testimony today from military leaders  service providers  and veterans themselves  In the audience today  we have many people who have answered our country s call to service in times of war and peace   We have an obligation to you  and I am honored to serve on the Senate s Veterans Affairs Committee so I can be a voice for you and the 670 000 veterans throughout our state  I grew up understanding the sacrifices that veterans have made        During World War II  my dad was one of the first G I   s to land on Okinawa   He was injured  sent to a hospital in Hawaii  and then immediately sent back to Okinawa   Like many in our audience today  he was awarded the Purple Heart    When I was in college at WSU  I asked to do my internship at the VA hospital in Seattle   I moved from Pullman to Seattle for the semester  rented a room  and spent my days in the psychiatric ward  working with veterans coming back from Vietnam   Today  I am the first woman to serve on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  and I don t hesitate to speak out when our veterans need help        I m holding this hearing in Washington state  because sometimes I can t get straight answers in Washington  D C  In Washington  D C   they ll tell you that everything is fine   For months  the Administration and the VA were telling me they had all the money they needed   They said   Don t worry  Patty   But I did worry  because every time I came home and talked with veterans here  I heard a much different story   I heard about the VA s hiring freeze  I heard about veterans waiting months just to get an appointment  and I heard about veterans who had to drive for hours to see a doctor because the clinics they were promised still weren t built          So in March  I proposed increasing veterans spending by three percent   It s a small amount  but it would have lifted the hiring freeze  reduced delays  and allowed the VA to open new clinics in our state  It s hard to believe  but my proposal was defeated  not just once  but three times  In Washington  D C   people told me   Everything s fine   Well six weeks ago  we learned the truth  and things were not fine        The VA admitted that it was at least one billion dollars short of what it needed to care for veterans this year   That means many veterans faced delays or did not get the care they deserved and that is wrong  So  I went back out to the Senate floor and offered my amendment again  This time  people finally saw the light  and last week the full Senate approved an additional  1 5 billion for veterans healthcare  I m pleased that we got the money in the end  but it shouldn t have taken that long   Every day that was wasted over politics was a day our veterans were not treated right  That whole episode showed me that if I ask people in Washington  D C   they will tell me that everything s fine  If I ask you here in Washington state  I ll learn the truth and that s the only way we can make sure we re taking care of the people who are taking care of us        Today I want to hear about the challenges veterans and their families are facing as they return home   For two years  I ve been meeting with military personnel at every stage   In January 2004  I met with members of the 81st Brigade before they shipped out   This March  I traveled to Iraq and Kuwait to meet with members of our armed services from Washington state   I saw their courage in the face of difficult and dangerous missions   And since then  I ve met with Guard members who have returned home to Everett  Spokane and Port Orchard   On Monday  I met with family members at Camp Murray   Yesterday  I sat down with returning veterans in the Tri Cities  and on Thursday  I ll hear from more veterans in Longview  I m holding these meetings so I can build a record of what we need to do   So when people in Washington  D C  say  everything s fine   I can show them what s really going on and push them to do the right thing  This hearing will be an important part of the record I am assembling        For this hearing to be legitimate  we must follow the same procedures that are used at hearings in Washington  D C  That means testimony is limited to the invited witnesses  there are strict time limits  which these timing lights will indicate  and we have a court reporter here to create a formal record of our proceedings         Unfortunately  that means we are not allowed to take questions or comments from the audience   But I want to make sure you have an opportunity to share your views   We have a comment form that you can fill out   We also have a sign up sheet  so you can get updates from me as I continue this work back in the United States Senate   In addition  I  ve created a section on my website  where veterans from throughout our state can share their stories with me   The address is murray senate gov veterans and you  ll see a section called   Share Your Story           Let me explain how the hearing will work   Today  we will hear from three panels of witnesses  The first panel will include officials from the Washington State Guard  the federal VA  and the state Department of Veterans Affairs   They will give us a bird s eye view of what s happening throughout the state and will set the stage for our discussion  Then  on the second panel  we will hear directly from veterans   I especially want to thank them and their families for having the courage to come here today and talk in public about some very personal challenges   But  I know there are more challenges we won t have time to raise today   So if you have a concern that we don t cover  I want you to write it down and give it to my staff   Our third panel includes people who work directly with veterans as they return from Iraq and Afghanistan   They have seen what a wide range of veterans are facing and can give us a first hand view from ground level        When I call on our first panel  each witness will have up to 3 minutes to present their testimony  and then I will ask them questions   Of course  your full written statements will be entered into the Committee record  When we  re done with each witness on the first panel  I  ll call the second and third panels        Before we turn to our first panel  I want you to know that hearings like this can truly make a difference  Two summers ago  the VA tried to close down three VA hospitals in our state   I worked with veterans throughout our state to make sure the VA understood that we need these hospitals to stay open   Within a day  we were able to persuade the VA secretary to keep one hospital open  Months later  we persuaded the CARES Commission to keep a save a second hospital   That left one hospital in jeopardy  the Wainwright Medical Center in Walla Walla          I knew the Senate needed to hear from the people in the local community  who would have a harder time getting healthcare if their hospital was closed   So in April last year  I held a Veterans Hearing just like this one in Walla Walla   We built a record of the need at that hearing and I used that record in Washington  D C  to help protect the hospital   And with the support of veterans in Walla Walla and throughout our state  we won        So I know that a hearing like this one can make a real difference by giving the people in Washington  D C  a dose of reality about what our local veterans are facing   The witnesses here today will help us build an accurate record  and I thank them  and all of you        I know we have many veterans in the audience today   If you need help from the VA  we have representatives here on site today who can help you file a claim   You can meet with officials from the VA Regional office  TRICARE  and the VA hospital in a room nearby  If you need help with an existing claim  members of my staff are here   They may be able to help you resolve a claim with the VA   Because of federal privacy rules  we do need a signed letter giving us permission to investigate your case before we can do anything  so I invite you to talk with my staff if you need assistance   Let  s begin with our first panel
