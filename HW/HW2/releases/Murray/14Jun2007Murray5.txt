Spend  1 600 Less On Utilities And Gasoline  Bolster Case For Senate Energy Bill Joint Economic Committee Report Shows Improving Efficiency Could Save the Average Family an Estimated  750 a Year in Household Energy Costs and  875 a Year on Gasoline Costs     Increased Efficiency Would Also Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and U S  Dependence on Foreign Sources of Energy                                                                                                         For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 14  2007    Washington  DC  Today  the Senate Democratic leadership team released  for American families that embrace energy efficiency  Senators Harry Reid  NV   Chuck Schumer  NY   Dick Durbin  IL   and Patty Murray  WA  of the Senate leadership will be joined by Senators Bob Casey  PA  and Amy Klobuchar  MN   The Joint Economic Committee  JEC  report entitled  Energy Efficiency Is a Bright Idea  shows that families that take advantage of energy efficient practices  appliances and vehicles could save an estimated  1 600 each year in energy costs  while reducing greenhouse gas emissions  pollution  and our nations dependence on foreign sources of energy  As the energy bill is debated on the Senate floor  Schumer  who chairs the JEC  initiated the report to shed light on the benefits of increasing energy and fuel efficiency to American families and the environment     Reid stated  This report shows clearly the benefits of energy efficiency for all Americans  including savings every year in household energy and gasoline costs  Democrats are moving forward with energy legislation that will lower energy costs  strengthen our national security by reducing our dependence on oil and protect our environment by reducing global warming emissions  Unfortunately  while Democrats fight for national and economic security  this Administration continues to be more interested in giving tax breaks to oil and gas companies even as prices have doubled and oil company profits have soared    Schumer said  You dont have to be Thomas Edison to know that better energy efficiency is a win win win for American families  Families will save up to  1 600 on their annual energy costs  reduce U S  dependence on foreign energy sources  and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that harm our environment    A responsible national energy strategy must ensure that we do three things    reduce our dependence on foreign oil and non renewable resources  turn toward more environmentally responsible energy options and provide more efficiency so that American consumers and their families save money  Durbin said    This report shows that the average American consumer will pay lower household energy costs and contribute less pollution and greenhouse gases by being informed and taking simple steps to conserve energy around their homes  Reducing energy costs while ensuring that our children and grandchildren having clean airnow thats a good deal  Murray said     Casey said  Energy efficiency is the gift that keeps on giving  to consumers through annual cost savings  to the environment because of reduced emissions  and to our security by lowering our dependence on foreign oil     Klobuchar said  Today were pushing for lights out on old  outdated  and wasteful energy products  Energy efficient technologies will lead the way to the future  They save consumers money  help the environment  and create competition to develop the best possible products    The estimates that the average energy efficient household spends approximately 40 percent less on the energy it uses than the average household that is not energy efficient  Using data from the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy  ACEEE   a leading provider of energy efficiency data and analysis  the report highlights significant savings from using more efficient heating and cooling systems  ENERGY STAR household appliances  lighting  and fuel efficient vehicles     Reducing household energy consumption also results in a decrease in emissions and reduces U S  dependence on foreign oil  The Department of Energy estimates that the average American home emits twice as many greenhouses gases as the average car  and heating and cooling homes alone emits 150 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  According to ACEEE  energy efficient households can emit nearly 9 000 fewer pounds of CO2 into the air each year     Household Energy Costs Reduced with Efficiency Increases The average family spends nearly  1 900 each year on utility bills and this number will only increase as energy prices rise  According to the U S  Department of Energy  total residential spending on energy in 2005 was approximately  215 billion  Some examples of how energy efficient households can cut their energy costs    Heating and Cooling  Home heating currently accounts for approximately 30 percent  or about  610  of the average households energy costs   270 for cooling costs   Improving efficiency in heating and cooling can save families over  500 a year in utility costs         Home Appliances account for about 30 percent of total household energy use  which currently amounts to approximately  550 per year  A refrigerator bought in the 1970s uses 75  more energy than those on the market today  families could save about  100 a year on electricity by switching to an ENERGY STAR refrigerator and washing machine    Lighting currently accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of total energy use in the average American household  or  50 to  150 in electricity costs per year  Replacing just five 60 watt incandescent light bulbs with 13 watt ENERGY STAR compact fluorescent light bulbs  CFLs  can save households about  30 a year in lighting expenses  assuming the lights are in use for four hours a day        Gasoline Costs Reduced with Fuel Efficient Vehicles   Transportation is the single largest sector of consumer spending on energy  representing  475 billion in total spending in 2005 and represents 68 percent of our nations oil usage     A household that operates vehicles with an average fuel efficiency of 35 0 miles per gallon  mpg  can expect to spend 27 percent less on fuel than a household that operates vehicles with an average fuel efficiency of the U S  fleet average of 25 4 mpg  Using the Department of Energys gas price forecast  the average family with two vehicles driving each 14 600 miles per year a family will spend around  3 200 this year on gasoline if they drive vehicles with the fleet average of 25 4 mpg  But a family that drives just as much  but with more efficient 35 0 mpg vehicles  would spend approximately  880 less on gasoline
