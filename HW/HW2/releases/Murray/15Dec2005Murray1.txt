                                                                                                 News Release          Senator Murray Warns an Across the Board Budget Cut Will Hurt Aviation Safety  Transportation and Housing    For Immediate Release  Thursday  December 15  2005     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  warned that a proposed across the board budget cut will weaken airline safety  impose new transportation costs on American businesses  cost 34 000 U S  construction jobs  and deny housing to 35 000 vulnerable families        In a Senate floor speech  Senator Murray said a Republican plan to cut several spending bills for Fiscal Year 2006 reflects the wrong priorities for our country         We are now being told that if we want to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina  we have to cut every federal program across the board  no matter how much those cuts will hurt our welfare  our economy or our security   Murray said   That is the wrong message  it is the wrong priority  and America can do better         Murray focused on how the proposed cut would affect public housing  transportation and aviation safety   She noted that many airlines have moved their maintenance work in foreign countries  but that the FAA now has 290 fewer safety personnel   Murray also warned that a cut will reverse efforts to hire an adequate number of air traffic controllers       Senator Murray s remarks follow    Being Strong at Home    Mr  President  as I ve traveled throughout my home state of Washington over the past month  people have told me time and again that they want our country to be strong again   To be strong  we need to invest right here at home    in our people  in our infrastructure  and in our communities        But today  the Republican leadership is trying to push us in the wrong direction by cutting critical investments   Republicans are trying to impose an across the board spending cut that will hurt our families  hurt local communities  and even jeopardize the housing and safety of the American people        I m speaking out today to explain how these misguided cuts will affect housing for vulnerable families and the safety of every American who plans to fly this holiday season   I really want to thank Senator Byrd for his leadership and for standing up and fighting this misguided Republican plan          As the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development  the Judiciary  and Related Agencies  I can tell my colleagues that an additional one or two percent cut across the board will not be harmless   It will chip away at the federal safety net that protects our vulnerable neighbors  and it will undermine the safety of our commercial aviation system       These Cuts Reflect the Wrong Priorities    Before I turn to those details  I want to make a broader point about priorities   There is something very wrong with the idea behind these across the board cuts   Here is what the Republican leadership is saying with these cuts   When we need to rebuild Iraq  we ll pay for it out of the treasury   But when we need to rebuild American cities like New Orleans and Biloxi  we can only do it on the backs of vulnerable Americans   We can only do it by cutting other priorities here at home        Mr  President  that is the wrong message  it is the wrong priority  and America can do better   That Republican idea should offend every American taxpayer who believes that the first and greatest responsibility of our Federal Government should be the well being of our own people   Nonetheless  that is the position of the Republican leadership in this Congress          So  as a result  we are now being told that if we want to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina    we have to cut every federal program across the board no matter how much those cuts will hurt our welfare  our economy or our security         Some Senators may try to suggest that a small cut will not have a big impact   Well I can tell you    as a member of the Appropriations Committee    that is not the case   Let me to turn some of the specific ways these cuts will undermine American families in areas like transportation  housing and aviation   I know these areas well because I ve worked on them as Ranking Member on the Transportation Treasury HUD bill       Cuts Mean More Highway Congestion  Loss of Jobs    First  these cuts will mean less progress reducing highway congestion    something Senator Byrd has referenced   We ll lose more than  720 million in highway construction funds    and with it more than 34 000 good paying jobs   Americans will waste more time in traffic  businesses will lose productivity  and our economy will suffer       Cuts Will Eliminate Housing Support for 35 000 Families      Second  the Republican cuts will make life harder for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and for vulnerable families throughout the country   Hurricane Katrina revealed the harsh truth about poverty in America in 2005   Many people lost what little they had   There are still thousands of victims of that hurricane that are without adequate housing   Some of them are living in tents   Some are still in hotels  wondering when they will be thrown out   Others are doubled up with relatives   Still others have been disbursed all over the country  wondering how they will pay for housing when they are earning no income   Neither FEMA nor HUD have done an adequate job addressing the critical housing needs of these citizens          So here we are    trying to address these needs with a supplemental appropriations bill   And the Republican leadership is saying    if you want to help Katrina victims  you have to cut housing assistance for other vulnerable families        Mr  President  I think it s wrong to say the only way we ll help the victims of Hurricane Katrina is by taking housing away from other needy families   These cuts could mean no more 35 000 families will lose the help with housing that they get today through HUD s tenant based rental housing assistance program   These cuts also threaten to eliminate transitional housing for 1 200 homeless citizens  Think about it    cutting housing for the homeless    taking help away from 35 000 vulnerable families    that doesn t reflect my values  that doesn t reflect my priorities         Mr  President  in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  Public Housing Agencies across America opened up their doors and sought to make emergency housing available to the citizens that had to evacuate New Orleans          Most of those housing agencies already had long waiting lists of low income families waiting for a unit or a voucher   By accommodating the Hurricane Katrina victims  these housing agencies effectively pushed their own local citizens further down the waiting list          We should not make it worse by eliminating vouchers for 35 000 families in order to pay for additional aid for the Katrina victims          We must not come to the aid of victims of the Hurricane Katrina by creating still other victims around the country through these misguided cuts       Cuts Will Jeopardize Aviation Safety    So Mr  President  these cuts will hurt jobs and transportation   They will hurt the homeless and other families who are living on the brink  and these cuts will also affect the safety of air travel in this country          I addressed the Senate on this issue of aviation safety back on October 6th   Earlier speech  http   murray senate gov news cfm id 247009   I did so because I thought it was critical that all Senators understood the relationship between the funding levels we provide to the FAA and the ability of that agency to ensure that the American people are safe when they board an aircraft        Mr  President  the holidays are upon us  and thousands of Americans will board planes shortly to gather with their families across America   When they do  they have the right to expect that we in Congress are doing all in our power to ensure that they will continue to benefit from the safest aviation system in the world          Yet  the reality is that the FAA is facing unprecedented budget challenges in adequately staffing its air traffic control facilities with fully trained professionals   The agency is also challenged when it comes to deploying an adequate number of fully trained aviation safety inspectors to oversee the safety practices at our nation  s airlines         Financial Pressure on Airlines    Mr  President  as I explained back on October 6th  over the last few years  our national aviation enterprise    our airlines  our airports and the FAA    have been under an unprecedented amount of financial pressure   We now have no fewer than six airlines in bankruptcy  and that number could still grow          In the interest of cutting costs  airlines have been cutting back on staff  renouncing their pension plans  and outsourcing an increasing percentage of their aircraft maintenance    I know that many other Senators who  like me  travel home almost every weekend  have noticed the changes in the service the airlines offer   Staffing is leaner than ever  and flight delays and mechanical problems are on the rise        Airlines Are Outsourcing Maintenance    Airlines are contracting out their aircraft maintenance work to third parties    including many overseas vendors known as foreign repair stations   In the past  airlines maintained their planes with experienced  veteran  unionized mechanics   Today  they outsource more than 50 percent of their maintenance work to independent operators          Airlines such as Northwest send some of their aircraft as far as Singapore and Hong Kong for heavy maintenance   We have one major carrier  JetBlue  that sends a large portion of its all Airbus fleet to be maintained in El Salvador  Central America   America West Airlines  now merged with US Airways  does the same thing          This outsourced work needs adequate oversight and inspection if the American people are going to be safe        How has the FAA responded to this growing threat to aviation safety         Fewer FAA Safety Personnel    Because of across the board cuts in prior appropriations bills  the FAA has actually downsized its safety workforce by more than 300 personnel    including more than 230 inspectors   That  s right   We have gotten rid of more than 230 inspectors    the very professionals that are charged with ensuring that maintenance operations are meeting adequate safety standards          That was not the intent of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in either the House or the Senate   Indeed  just last year  the Transportation Appropriations bill provided every penny that the President requested for the FAA  s safety office   But the FAA still had to drop the number of inspectors because of the across the board cut that was imposed by the Republican leadership   It also resulted from the fact that the Congress granted all civilian federal employees a higher pay raise than the Bush Administration sought  but none of the Appropriations subcommittees were given adequate funding allocations to fully fund those pay raises        We know that the FAA s inspection efforts are falling short   We have troubling reports from the Department of Transportation s Inspector General  the Government Accountability Office  and the National Transportation Safety Board   Yet despite the dangers  the FAA had to go ahead and decrease the number of FAA safety inspectors dramatically last year because of across the board cuts   No one can stand up today and say that an across the board cut has no impact       Air Safety This Year    Let  s fast forward to this year   I am proud to say that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have worked to address this safety vulnerability   Both Committees provided increased funds    over and above the levels requested by the Bush Administration    to bring the number of safety inspectors back up to reasonable levels          In the FY 2006 Transportation Treasury HUD Appropriations bill that the President signed just a few weeks ago  we provided  8 million to boost employment in the FAA  s safety office by 119 inspectors   It will not restore all of the safety inspectors that we lost last year  but it will move staffing in this critical function in the right direction          But if Congress enacts an across the board cut  it will completely eliminate all of the progress that we just made in ensuring safety in our skies   The across the board cut that is threatened to be included in the final Appropriations bill this year could cut the FAA  s operations account by over  160 million and put the FAA  s budgetary situation right back where it was   That will require downsizing of the FAA Inspector workforce while the critical workload continues to grow       Air Traffic Controllers    The situation is almost identical when it comes to the FAA  s efforts to avoid the continued attrition in the ranks of the air traffic controllers   It is estimated that 73 percent of the FAA  s air traffic controllers will be eligible to retire over the next decade          In the FY 2006 Transportation Appropriations bill just signed into law  we provided almost  25 million to hire an additional 1 250 air traffic controllers   This funding is essential in order to replace the over 650 air traffic controllers who are expected to retire over the course of the next year and to build up the workforce so we can handle retirements in future years   Another across the board cut will completely nullify our efforts to hire an adequate number of air traffic controllers   Such a cut will put America  s flying public at risk          So  as I said  Mr  President  these across the board cuts have a meaningful impact  and they recklessly eliminate initiatives that are critically important to the safety of American citizens    If Senators don  t want to take my word for it  they should listen to the words of George Bush  s FAA Administrator    Marion Blakey   I have had two discussions with her about just this topic in the last few weeks   She recently sent me a letter that says  and I quote           Over the past two years we experienced a net loss of a thousand controllers and 231 safety inspectors   I don  t believe Congress intended that to happen  but that has been the impact of unfunded pay raises and rescissions   I am concerned it is going to happen again if Congress adopts an across the board reduction in the final bill             Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I received from FAA Administrator Marion Blakey be included in the record at this point                      So  in conclusion  Mr  President  I implore my colleagues to heed to warnings of this Senator and the FAA Administrator   We must reject this absurd and reckless policy   If we can declare an emergency under the Budget Act and provide the funding necessary to rebuild Iraq without offsets  then surely we can do the same when it comes to rebuilding Mississippi and Louisiana   We certainly should not be cutting essential services to Americans across the country  especially low income Americans  for the purpose of funding the needs of the victims of Hurricane Katrina   These cuts just create another wave of victims  and they put the well being of all Americans at risk
