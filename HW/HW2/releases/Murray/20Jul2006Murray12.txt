                                                                                       News Release          VETERANS  Murray Gets New Details from VA Secretary on Walla Walla and NW Washington VA Clinics    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 20  2006    Listen to Senator Murray s                   WASHINGTON  D C      Under questioning from U S  Senator Patty Murray today  Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson revealed new details about his plans for new VA facilities in   Walla Walla and Northwest Washington and committed to working with Senator Murray and the local community           At today s hearing  the Secretary gave me his commitment that the Walla Walla community will have a direct and official role in determining the future of the Wainwright campus   I appreciate his commitment  and I m going to hold him to it   Murray said   I m pleased that he s agreed to sit down with me so we can talk about what services will be provided at the new facility   I made it clear that mental healthcare  rehab and nursing home care are not adequately available in communities around Walla Walla  and we need to see how he ll provide that care to veterans under his proposal         Two weeks ago during a trip to Washington state  the Secretary announced the two new facilities  but a lack of details led Murray and many veterans to wonder just what the Secretary had promised   On July 13th  Murray wrote to Nicholson with a series of questions      The Secretary s July 19th reply did not provide adequate answers        Today  Murray questioned Nicholson directly at a hearing of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee         Walla Walla    On Walla Walla  the Secretary committed to Senator Murray that he will follow the CARES process and submit his plan to Local Advisory Panel    This is the first time that the Secretary has provided details on how the process will move forward and specifically how the local community will be involved        Secretary Nicholson also committed to meeting with Senator Murray to discuss his plan for Walla Walla       Excerpts from today s hearing     MURRAY   I want to return to the question about your trip to Walla Walla because as you know  I have a community that cares deeply about this   They have followed the process very  very closely  and they want to have a real voice in the process   I specifically wanted to ask you about the plan to involve the local community   They have followed the CARES process very  very closely   They expect that the VA will follow it too and that means sending a plan to the local advisory committee for review   Can you commit to us that you will follow the CARES process and work with that Local Advisory Panel     NICHOLSON   Yes  I can Senator Murray   We have followed it  and we have been through the first two stages and our analysis  is  based on that   You know I make those decisions  and I made a decision on Walla Walla that we would keep that campus open   And that was the purpose of my visit there was to tell them    the community  the patients and the staff    all of whom had anxiety whether or not we were going to close this    for the benefit of the others    a very small VA hospital complex   And I made a decision to keep it open and that was the purpose of going there   Now we are going to go into the third stage  which is    being justifiable to keep it open    what will it look like   And as you know when I went there I assured them that we were going to have a new ambulatory outpatient clinic facility there   We have other issues that we deal with and will be engaging the    you know    Local Advisory Panel on that such as long term care  inpatient medicine  and inpatient mental   We have those capabilities there  but as you know  the populations are very small   For example the average daily census in the nursing home is 22  in the mental health it s 18  and  in  medicine it s 10     MURRAY   But you will follow the LAP process so the plan will go to the LAP committee and they will have their        NICHOLSON  Yes     MURRAY     responsibility to have a response back     NICHOLSON   Yes we will     MURRAY   Because the questions that are raised are really    I mean we have been dealing with this for a long time    that there aren  t any facilities in the local communities to outsource this to   There  s a lot   Maybe more to the point  as you know  your announcement came as a surprise because many of us have been working very  very closely on this for a number of years now with the community and didn  t know that you coming out there   I  m glad that you have taken the first step to do that and now the second step to continue the LAP process and send the plan   But could I get your commitment to come in and talk with me  bring your staff  so that I can talk with you about the proposal and learn about where we re gonna go from here     NICHOLSON  Yes  indeed   Sure   We will do that                                    Unofficial transcript prepared by Senator Murray s office   7 20 06      Northwest Washington VA Clinic    Senator Murray also asked the Secretary to clarify what he said at a political event in Bellingham two weeks ago   News reports indicated that the Secretary announced a new clinic  but the Department of Veterans Affairs has been unable to provide Senator Murray with details over the past two weeks        Under Murray s questioning  the Secretary today confirmed that he has decided to build a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Northwest Washington   He said the location has not been selected  but that it will be somewhere between Seattle and the Canadian border   The Secretary said he hopes to pick a location before the end year and that it then usually takes 6 months for a clinic to open        He also committed to discussing the Northwest Washington clinic with the Senator at an upcoming meeting      Excerpts from today s hearing     MURRAY  I also wanted to ask you about Bellingham because when you were there  we were told that you committed to bringing a VA clinic to Northwest Washington  and that some kind of announcement would be coming within the week   I  ve been unable to get any clarification from your staff  and I wanted to find out from you  here  can you tell me  what you said in Bellingham about the new clinic so that we all are on the same page     NICHOLSON   I can   What I said to the veterans there with whom I met  that we  d made a decision in the CBOC business plan analysis that we would put a new Community Based  Outpatient Clinic  CBOC  in Northwest Washington somewhere between Seattle and the Canadian border  but I did not specify where it would be located  and I  d be happy to    when we have our meeting to discuss that with you but we haven  t made a decision as to where to site it     MURRAY   But the decision has been made to site one there   Is there a time on that    a time commitment     NICHOLSON   Yeah  we hope to make the decision about where to put it before the end of the year and then  you know  usually takes us six months or so then to open one                                    Unofficial transcript prepared by Senator Murray s office   7 20 06        In a separate move  Senator Murray also bolstered the case for the Northwest Washington clinic by inserting language into the FY 2007 Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill saying   T he Committee encourages the VA to move forward establishing clinics in Bellingham and Centralia  Washington  Alpena  Michigan  and rural Colorado    The bill  with Murray s language  was approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee today       In other Veterans News today  Senator Murray      Applauded a 12 percent increase in Veterans Healthcare for Next Year        Secured  38 million to Build New Veterans Nursing Home in Tacoma to and Replace Unsafe  Earthquake Damaged Facility
