and nearly one year after MINER Act signed into law   Murray examines whether the Bush administration is protecting America s mine workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  May 22  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing to examine the implementation of safety measures established under the MINER Act  The MINER Act is the landmark legislation which established guidelines for mine emergency response plans  training  post accident communications and safety inspections  The legislation  which was signed into law on June 15th  2006  came in response to the tragic mine catastrophes at Sago and Aracoma mines in West Virginia  Senator Murray joined Senators Robert Byrd  D WV   Edward Kennedy  D WA   Jay Rockefeller  D WV   Mike Enzi  R WY  and Johnny Isakson  R GA  to craft the MINER Act  Since the Act went into law  there have been serious questions about the Bush administration s effort to implement several of its requirements          Since our law was signed  it has been up to the Bush Administration    and specifically the Mine Safety and Health Administration    to aggressively implement the law   said Senator Murray   So far  I m concerned that the slow pace of reform is leaving America s miners at risk  The MINER Act is an important tool to protect workers  but it needs to be enforced if we re going to make real progress        Among other requirements  the MINER Act    stipulates that the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  must ensure that mines have emergency response plans  make technical improvements  provide reliable communications  install refuge chambers  and provide oxygen supplies  At the hearing  Murray expressed her frustration with the pace of change and highlighted the urgency of the problem          A rescue team that doesn t exist  an emergency plan that s incomplete  a radio that doesn t work  an oxygen supply that s not available and a shelter that hasn t been built won t help protect miners when the next disaster strikes   Murray said   We can t wait for that next disaster   We need those safety components in place today       At today s hearing Murray also vowed to continue to work to improve mine safety through new legislation          We re going to hold MSHA and mine owners accountable  and we are not stopping with the MINER Act   Murray said   That s why I m working with Senators Kennedy  Byrd  and Rockefeller to draft new legislation to further improve mine safety with advances like proximity detectors  improved record keeping  and updated asbestos standards for mines      The following are Senator Murray s Opening Remarks at today s hearing       Senator Murray s Opening Remarks       As a country  we have a responsibility to protect the health and safety of Americans on the job   Last year  after the horrible mine accidents in West Virginia  Congress stepped forward and passed the MINER Act  the most comprehensive mine safety reforms in a generation          I was pleased to help draft that bill with Senators Kennedy  Byrd  Rockefeller  Enzi and Isakson   We held hearings  we heard from the experts  and we created a comprehensive system to address glaring holes in the safety net that miners rely on          The MINER Act mandates comprehensive emergency response plans  evacuation plans  post accident communications  breathing air  training  and coordination with local emergency responders   The MINER Act also requires flame resistant lifelines  state of the art two way wireless communication  electronic tracking systems  more training for miners and safety inspectors  and higher penalties for safety violations        Since our law was signed  it has been up to the Bush Administration    and specifically the Mine Safety and Health Administration    to aggressively implement the law   Things did not get off to a promising start   Instead of nominating a safety leader to run MSHA  the Bush Administration chose a status quo mining official   In the weeks before  we passed the MINER Act  Richard E  Stickler told me that he could not name a single reform that was needed   Congress   and the rest of the country   saw things differently   I voted against Mr  Stickler s confirmation  Read  because his background and his answers did not demonstrate to me that he recognized the urgent need to fully and aggressively implement the MINER Act        Today  as we approach the first anniversary of passage of the MINER Act  this subcommittee is doing its job of oversight   The question is   Is MSHA doing its job to protect America s miners          So far  I m concerned that the slow pace of reform is leaving America s miners at risk   We ve made progress  but MSHA has not moved aggressively to implement all of the provisions of the MINER Act   Let me share a few examples        We required more rescue teams   Today  we don t have them   We required mines to have emergency response plans   Most mines have yet to finish them  We called for new technical improvements  reliable communications  and refuge chambers   Those improvements are still sitting on the drawing board   We required mines to install oxygen supplies   In some cases  MSHA told mine owners they re in compliance just for ordering the equipment  but MSHA has not pushed to have those oxygen supplies installed        A rescue team that doesn t exist  an emergency plan that s incomplete  a radio that doesn t work  an oxygen supply that s not available and a shelter that hasn t been built won t help protect miners when the next disaster strikes   We can t wait for that next disaster   We need those safety components in place today        With the MINER Act  Congress gave the Bush Administration the tools to keep America s miners safe  Nearly one year later  the Bush Administration has done too little and moved too slowly   I am unwilling to let the situation continue   We re going to hold MSHA and mine owners accountable  and we are not stopping with the MINER Act   That s why I m working with Senators Kennedy  Byrd  and Rockefeller to draft new legislation to further improve mine safety with advances like proximity detectors  improved record keeping  and updated asbestos standards for mines        The MINER Act is an important tool to protect workers  but it needs to be enforced if we re going to make real progress   As we examine what other countries  such as Australia and Canada have done to protect their miners  there is certainly room for real improvements in the health and safety protections for American workers   We must build on the MINER Act promises and speed its implementation        We know that research   like the research being conducted by the NIOSH Spokane Research Laboratory in my home State of Washington   is identifying new ways for us to understand the risks of mining and how to better protect workers        I remain committed to giving America s miners a workplace that is safe  and I want to thank our witnesses for sharing their expertise   This morning  we will hear from Dr  Jeffrey Kohler with NIOSH  Mr  Dennis O Dell from the United Mine Workers of America  Mr  Steve Bessenger from the San Juan Coal Company  and Bruce Watzman from the National Mining Association          of today s hearing witnesses
