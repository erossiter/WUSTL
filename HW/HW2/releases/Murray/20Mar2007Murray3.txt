                                                                     News Release          Senator Murray Works to Restore the Senate s Role in Confirming U S Attorneys    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 20  2007     Washington  D C     In a speech today on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  addressed the scandal surrounding the firing of eight U S  Attorneys by the Bush Administration   Murray spoke in favor of a bill to restore the Senate s role in confirming U S  Attorneys  The bill  the United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007  S 214   will be voted on today       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  every American needs to have confidence in our system of justice  but in the past few weeks that confidence has been deeply shaken   Each day  we get new evidence that the Bush Administration injected partisan politics into a process that requires independence   And each day we get more proof that this Administration has not been telling us the truth        I m on the floor to support this bill to restore the Senate s constitutional advice and consent role in confirming nominees to serve as U S  Attorneys   I m deeply troubled by the many ways the Bush Administration has politicized the administration of justice because it threatens all Americans         Washington State Impact    Recently  we learned that the Administration s political meddling reached into my own home state of Washington and led to the firing of a U S  Attorney who had received an excellent job performance review only months before he was fired   When I sought answers  the Justice Department told me things that were not true   Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty assured me that the firing of John McKay was  performance related    I did not believe it at the time  and unfortunately  these past weeks have only confirmed my suspicions       The Bush Administration s Shifting Story    As the facts come out  the Administration s untruths are coming to light   First we were told that the White House had no role in the firing   Now we learn that this whole scheme originated in the White House   At first  we were told that all the firings were  performance related    Now documents have disclosed that the Justice Department was evaluating U S  Attorneys based on their loyalty to the Administration   We were also told that a significant change in the Patriot Act was needed for national security and would not be abused   That was also not true       Reaches to the Highest Levels    Every day this story gets worse and worse and climbs higher up the political ladder   We ve learned that senior officials in the White House  including the president s former counsel  Harriet Miers  and his top political advisor  Karl Rove  were also key players in these firings       Why It Matters    Why should folks at home care if the White House and Justice Department are politicizing the office of U S  Attorney   It matters for two reasons         First  any American can become the subject of a civil or criminal investigation by a U S  Attorney   an investigation that could upend their lives  ruin their reputation  destroy their business and ultimately cause the government to take their life or their liberty   That is a tremendous amount of power  and we need to make sure that the people who wield that power are launching investigations based on the facts and the law   not based on political pressure          Second  after all the ways the Bush Administration has undermined the rights and liberties of our citizens  we need to vigorously stand up and fight back whenever new abuses come to light       The Attorney General s Conflicting Statements    I believe we could have gotten the facts sooner if we d gotten straight answers from the Attorney General from the start   Unfortunately  Mr  Gonzales can t seem to get his story straight   At a press conference last week  he said that he didn t know about it  but he s responsible for it  He said mistakes were made  but that the firings were appropriate   He said he believes that U S  Attorneys should be independent  but they can be fired for any reason        Mr  President  two years ago I voted against confirming Alberto Gonzales as the nation s top law enforcement officer       As I said in February of 2005  he  lacks the independence and honesty to be attorney general    I also said that his troubling record would not ensure public confidence in the fair administration of justice   I take no joy in saying that my fears have been borne out       The Administration Sought  Then Exploited a Change in Law    So how did we get here   Last year  when Congress updated the Patriot Act  a change was inserted at the White House s request  This change was not debated  and it was made without the knowledge of many here in the Senate        Today  we know that this change to the Patriot Act played an important role in this entire scheme   It significantly lowered the difficulty of removing any U S  Attorney and replacing him or her without consulting anybody         We Must Pass the United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007    Mr  President  we need to end these abuses   I support this bill because it will restore the Senate s role in confirming U S  Attorneys   It will also restore a critical check on the Administration s power          Traditionally  when there s been a vacancy for a U S Attorney  the White House has sent a nomination to the Senate   Last year  the White House changed that procedure by slipping a change into the Patriot Act reauthorization   With that change  the White House was then able to install interim U S  Attorneys indefinitely without going through the normal Senate approval process          This bill restores the Senate s role in confirming interim nominees   This legislation would force the White House to work with the Senate and home state senators   This bill is an important step to protecting the U S  Attorneys office from the politicization it has suffered under this Administration   I urge my colleagues to take a step forward for justice and pass this critical reform
