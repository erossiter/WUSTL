                                                                                     News Release          Senator Murray Joins Richland Residents to Celebrate Transportation   Quality of Life Project Remarks by Senator Patty Murray at Dedication of SR 240 Soundwall    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  August 2  2005     Richland  WA     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray joined more than a dozen neighbors and local leaders to celebrate the completion of a soundwall along SR 240 between Hanford and the Tri Cities   Murray helped secure  2 million in the Senate to fund this quality of life improvement   After a brief speaking program  Richland Mayor Rob Welch  Mayor Pro Tempor Carol Moser  Senator Murray and others applied paint to the soundwall and broke ground on the next phase of the project        Senator Murray s remarks follow    Thank you  Mayor Welch   And thanks to everyone who s here today to celebrate the completion of this great project  I  d particularly like to thank Congressman Doc Hastings for joining us today and being a part of this   Over the years Doc and I have worked together on many projects and fought for this community  and you have a great advocate in him  I am delighted to share this stage with him today as we celebrate this great project      We re here today to recognize the hard work and community effort that went into making this sound wall project a reality   More than five years ago  community leaders identified expanding State Route 240 as a priority in meeting the growing needs of this region   They knew improving SR 240 and I 182 were critical to regional transportation in the Tri Cities  and they wanted to make sure it got done   But  there was a crucial element of these projects that was missing and that was the quality of life the people who lived here that needed to be restored         So  today  we are here to celebrate the restoration of the community s quality of life   To me  that s just as important as the increased efficiency and economic growth the area has already begun to see as a result of the expansion of SR 240 and I 182   Some of you know that I got involved in transportation 16 years ago now when I was elected to the Washington State Senate  At the time  I ran for office because I had been involved in education and was on the Shoreline School Board   But when I got to Olympia I realized that transportation was becoming an increasingly important issue for our state  So I asked to serve on the Transportation committee  Now  up until that time  no woman had served in history of our country on the Transportation Committee  So you know  I get the old  so you know how to play golf   questions  And I got past all of that because I knew how important it was to be on that committee  And I have been involved in transportation policy ever since  Now  here I am sixteen year later as the top ranking Democrat on the Transportation Appropriations Committee that funds all of the transportation and infrastructure not only for our state and our region but for our entire country  So  it was a good decision many years ago and I still don t have time to play golf        I have been very proud to have the opportunity to work here especially with local community leaders in the Tri Cities  I am particularly proud of working together in this area to improve State Route 240  which is a vital link between Richland and the entire Tri Cities region   I  ve been working back in Washington  DC with Congressman Hastings  to support your many efforts  and I want you to know that I will continue to do so   In fact  in 2003 and 2004  we worked together to secure  3 million for improvements to the interchange at I 182 and SR 240  and  2 million for I 182 from Queensgate to SR 240         That cooperation has allowed me to keep track of the progress of transportation and has allowed me to stay informed here with all of you about your emerging needs  So  when people along SR 240 noticed increased noise after widening was completed in 2001  I was so impressed by the City of Richland s rapid response that they put together to get WSDOT to do a review and then persevere to make sure that this important project became a reality   And  today  I m so proud of this community s work in getting this soundwall built despite many of the initial obstacles   You recognized the need  The neighbors came together that are here  You didn t give up   And that hard work and innovative thinking has resulted in being here today  and I am very proud of all of you        I know the expansions completed here in 2001 and all of the projects that are still ongoing are a huge benefit to this community  and this region  Like all investments in transportation  these projects mean safer  less congested roads   And they mean this stretch of highway will be a great place for businesses and economic development in the future  This project  in particular  I am proud of because it speak directly to quality of life  which we often forget about when we talk about transportation policy  The people who live next door to these projects deserve to be recognized and their needs need to be heard  That s why I m so delighted to be here today with all of you      While I am here  I want to share some really great news   On Friday  Congressman Hastings and I participated in the vote to finally pass the transportation authorization bill  I wanted you to know that I was able to get  2 75 million for construction of the new highway interchange and grade separated railroad crossing at the intersection of SR 240 and Van Giesen Street  So  I want you to know that today is a great day  It s what transportation is all about   It s neighbors who smile along with the community leaders for projects that bring about economic development  safety  and quality of life  and I m very proud to be here with all of you today
