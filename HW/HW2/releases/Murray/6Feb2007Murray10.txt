                                                                                                        News Release          IRAQ   Senator Murray Speaks Out Against the Surge and Urges Republicans to Stop Blocking Debate on the Iraq War    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 6  2007       Washington  D C     Today in a passionate        speech on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  called on Republicans to stop blocking debate on the President s misguided plan to escalate the War in Iraq   Murray said she will vote for a bipartisan resolution expressing opposition to the President s surge as the first step in changing direction in Iraq     Murray spoke of the tremendous sacrifices Washington state families have made during the war     Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  war is the most serious and most consequential issue we can debate here in the United States Senate    American lives  American security and America s future are all on the line when our country decides questions of war and peace   For years  we have been denied a real opportunity to fully debate the War in Iraq   a war that has claimed more than 3 000 American lives with no end in sight       In November  voters sent us a message   They want a new direction   But the President wants more of the same   In fact  he wants to escalate the war by putting up to 48 000 more Americans in the middle of a deadly civil war   Those are two completely different approaches  On one side  we have the American people  the Iraq Study Group  generals who have spoken out  and a bipartisan majority of Congress   And on the other side  we have the President and his supporters         In a democracy  we resolve those differences through debate   We in the Senate are ready for that debate   We are ready to move in a new direction  and it starts by putting this Senate on record as opposing the President s plan to escalate the war in Iraq      Republicans are Blocking a Critical Debate      I ve been looking forward to finally having this debate here in the Senate  but some Republicans have a different strategy   They don t want to have a real debate   They don t want us to consider the resolutions that have been offered   I m not going to comment on their motives  but I will point out the consequences   Every day they block a debate  they send a message that Congress supports escalation  Every day they block a debate  they deny our citizens a voice in a war that has cost us dearly in dollars and lives  And every day they block a debate  they are blocking the will of the American public       I m on the floor today because I know this debate is long overdue   And I m not going to let anyone silence me  the troops I speak for  or the constituents I represent       We ve Been Denied a Voice       Ever since the start of combat operations in March 2003  I ve been frustrated that we have been denied a chance to hold hearings  a chance to ask the critical questions  to demand answers  to hold those in charge accountable  and to give the American people a voice in a war that is costing us terribly   And I can tell you one thing   We are going to have that debate whether some in this body like it or not         The 2002 Resolution   Today      Four years ago  I came here to the Senate floor to discuss the original resolution that gave the President the authority to wage war in Iraq   At that time  I asked a series of questions  including            What is the mission         What will it require         Who s with us in the fight          What happens after our troops go in       How will it impact the Middle East          How will it affect the broader War on Terror          And are we being honest with the American people about the costs of war        After exploring those questions        I cannot support sending our men and women into harm s way on an ill defined  solo mission with so many critical questions unanswered       Today  four years   379 billion  and more than 3 000 American lives later   the President wants to send more Americans into the middle of a civil war   against the wishes of a majority of the public and of Congress   As I look at the President s proposed escalation  I m left with the exact same conclusion I reached 4 years ago   I cannot support sending more of our men and women into harm s way on an ill defined  solo mission with so many critical questions unanswered       No  Then   No  Now      Today  President Bush wants to send Americans into battle without a clear mission  without equipment  without an endgame  and without explaining the cost   When he tried it four years ago  I stood up  I spoke out  and I voted no   And again today   President Bush wants to send more Americans into battle without a clear mission  without equipment  without an endgame and without explaining the cost   And once again  I say   not on my watch         We need a new direction  Mr  President   not more Americans in the middle of a civil war   I will vote for a bipartisan resolution to send a clear message that we oppose the surge   It is the first   step in demanding a new direction in Iraq       Proud of Our Troops      No debate on Iraq can begin without first recognizing our men and women in uniform  who risk their lives   and all too often must give their lives   to keep us safe   Whenever our country calls  they answer  no matter the cost to them and their families   They are our best  our brightest  our bravest  and I hope to give them a voice in this debate   While most Americans are going about life as normal  our troops and their families are quietly making tremendous sacrifices   The burdens of this war have not been shared equally  and we owe so much to those who shoulder those heavy burdens         I had a chance to visit service members from my home state on the ground in Kuwait and Baghdad   Every one of them makes me proud   I ve sat down with service members and their families at Camp Murray  McChord Air Force Base and Fairchild Air Force Base in my home state   I talked with returning service members in every corner of my state and have worked to help them the get the healthcare  benefits and transition support they deserve        Washington State Sacrifices      My home state of Washington has made tremendous sacrifices to help us fight and win the War on Terror   To date  more than 59 000 service members with a Washington state connection have served in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom   Currently  nearly 10 000 people with a Washington state connection are serving in OEF and OIF         According to the Department of Defense as of January 20th for O E F  and O I F   702 service members whose  Home of Record  is Washington state have been injured  That s 702 injured           In addition  66 service members whose  Home of Record  is Washington state have made the ultimate sacrifice  The number is even higher when you include those who have a  connection  to Washington state       Each one of those brave American s is someone s mother or father  sister or brother  daughter or son   Their families will never be the same   Their communities will never be the same  and I offer my prayers for those who have sacrificed for our country   We owe them a debt that can never be fully repaid      Everyone Wants a New Direction  Except the President      After nearly four years of losses and misrepresentations and miscalculations  the American people have said they want a new direction in Iraq  Generals have spoken out calling for a new direction   The Iraq Study Group called for a new direction   And yet President Bush has ignored everyone and is pushing to send even more American troops into the middle of a civil war   He is wrong  and a bipartisan resolution is the first step in forging a new direction       But now Republicans in the Senate are denying us a chance to vote for that new direction   In fact  they are preventing us from even debating the merits of that new direction   They may have stopped us from moving forward last night  but they cannot stop this debate forever   the American people simply won t allow it        The Surge      Mr  President  if the Republicans stop their obstruction and start allowing us to debate this misguided surge proposal  there are plenty of questions we have to ask   What would the impact of a surge be   How would it affect our men and women in uniform   Will it put more of them into the crossfire and cause more deaths and injuries      Surge s Impact on Fort Lewis       My home state is home to Fort Lewis and two of the Army s Stryker Brigades   How will a surge affect them  Will some members see their current deployment extended  Will others see their deployment date moved up  Will all of them have the equipment they need when they re over there   Those are the first questions we must ask      Surge s Impact on Veterans      How will a surge affect our ability to care for our returning veterans   We re having trouble meeting their needs today   how are we going to do the job in an escalated war      A Better Way Forward      In listening to the debate today  I ve heard several Senators on the other side demand ideas from Democrats   My first response is simple   to discuss ideas  shouldn t we first discuss the President s ideas   He is  after all  the commander in chief   That is the point of these resolutions   to foster a debate on the President s plan for the future of Iraq   But the Senate Republicans won t allow it           The Republican s obstruction and the President s decisions so far have left us with few options   I am looking at every resolution and every proposal   And I m looking forward to having hearings  getting the facts  and moving forward in a bipartisan way       Personally  I believe that the way forward should include at least three steps   First  we should strategically redeploy our troops   Second  we should work with Iraq s neighbors and other countries in the area to build a regional framework   Third  we need the Iraqi s to take ownership of their own country and their own future   We can send troops for decades and never have a peaceful  stable Iraq until the Iraqi people are willing to work together for a purpose that is larger than their own tribe  sect or self      We Must Refocus on the War on Terror      I believe that we need to refocus our efforts on the War on Terror   on fighting Al Qaeda and on addressing the other challenges that threaten our security   For example  I m concerned by reports that Afghanistan is sliding backwards and becoming more unstable   So those are some of the steps I would take to improve our security  and that is the debate we need to be having   Before I conclude  I want to address two other concerns      What Supporting Our Troops Means      First  some people have suggested that if you question the President s policies you re somehow hurting our troops   Well  as the Vice President likes to say   Hogwash   Supporting our troops means giving them a clear mission  making sure they have the equipment and support they need  and making sure we have a clear endgame   If any of those critical ingredients are missing  it is our  duty to question the policy until we provide our troops with what they need         Sending more Americans into the middle of a civil war   without a clear mission  without equipment  without support  and without an endgame   is endangering our troops   not supporting them         I don t shrink from war   I voted for the war in Afghanistan   My father served in World War II and was injured in combat   I know war is sometimes necessary  but I also know that if we don t answer the critical questions  our troops pay the price  And for too long partisans have claimed to be speaking for troops  but have blocked the discussions that could truly protect them   I say   no more       This is the First Step      Finally  some people say that a non binding resolution is not enough  and I agree   And that s why this is the first step   We can t take the other steps until this Congress goes on record   in a bi partisan voice   telling the President that his surge is wrong   Once we ve done that  the ball is in the President s court   But Senate Republicans are preventing us from even getting into the game   If he still won t change course  we ll look at other tools before us   Senators have discussed a whole series of steps we could take  and I m going to review all of them   We re also holding hearings to find out what options we can take   So this is the first step  and if the President doesn t hear us  we ll take the next step  and the next step  and the one after that       We re Doing More in 5 Weeks than in 3 Years      Now I understand that many Americans are frustrated that our troops are in the middle of a civil war   I m frustrated too  and I wish we d been allowed to start this process   these hearings  debates  and votes    a long time ago   But we are moving aggressively now   Democrats have been in charge for 5 weeks   and already we re having more debates  more hearings  and more progress than we ve had in the past three years   And I can promise you   this is only the beginning       But we can t have those debates if Republicans keep blocking an open discussion on the war   Republicans need to stop denying a real debate here in the Senate  so that together we can move our country in a new direction      A Bipartisan Vote Will Send A Strong Message      I believe that for us to really have an impact  Congress has to speak with a clear  bipartisan voice   We could vote on hundreds of resolutions that make us feel better   but that won t really help us change the direction   Instead  it s a strong bipartisan message from Congress to the Executive Branch   and to the country   that has the power to make progress   I m willing to take the time to do this right and to build the support we need  so that at the end of the day we can have a real impact      Conclusion     Mr  President  in conclusion  I strongly oppose the surge  Escalation is the wrong direction   I will vote to put this Senate on record opposing the surge  if the Republicans will end their filibuster   And I will continue to fight for a new direction in Iraq   For too long  the voices of our troops and our citizens have been blocked  and today Senate Republicans are trying to continue that obstruction   I say   no longer   The debate must begin    our country will be the better for it
