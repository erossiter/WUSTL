                                                           News Release          Murray Sounds Alarm Over Critical Shortage of FAA Safety Inspectors At Senate Hearing  Murray Says FAA Must Address Shortage of Safety Inspectors and Air Traffic Controllers and Must Better Manage Major Procurements    For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 4  2006     Washington  D C      Today at a Senate hearing with Federal Aviation Administrator Marion Blakey  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  raised concerns about the FAA s budget and the Bush Administration s leadership on aviation issues           The hearing was held before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  and Housing and Urban Development  of which Senator Murray is the top Democrat      Senator Murray s opening statement follows    Importance of Commercial Aviation    Commercial aviation is a critical part of our national economy and our future   In 2004  the U S  civil aviation sector generated  1 37 trillion of output  supported 12 3 million jobs  and created  418 billion in personal earnings  That represents almost 9 percent of overall employment in this country  and    in my state    that percentage is even higher        Having a strong aviation sector requires a strong FAA that guarantees safety for all users  The FAA must ensure the safety of every flight  of every airplane part  and of the system overall  That requires a well trained and fully staffed workforce of safety inspectors and air traffic controllers and modern equipment       Bush Administration s Proposed Cuts    As I review the current status of the FAA and the agency s financial needs  I am sorry to say that this department deserves a much better budget   It also needs strong leadership and closer attention from this Congress          The Bush Administration is seeking to cut the FAA by more than  560 million    almost 4 percent in direct appropriations  When you include all of the proposed funding rescissions in the President s budget  the cut rises to  937 million or 6 8 percent          The biggest cut proposed by the Administration is a whopping three quarter s of a billion dollar cut in capital investments in our nation s airports  We know that passenger boardings are expected to grow by 60 percent over the next 15 years   That means we should be investing more  But instead  the Bush Administration wants to cut our support for America s airports        Mr  Chairman  thanks to your leadership  we have rejected cuts in airport capital investments in the past  but we have not been successful in fending off all cuts within the FAA s budget    such as cuts to modernize our outdate air traffic control system       Air Traffic Control Modernization    This year  the Bush Administration seeks to cut modernization by  50 million   That comes on top of much larger cuts in prior years   If we accept the President s level for air traffic control modernization  we will have cut modernization by  518 million or 17 percent in just the last five years         I must confess to being enormously frustrated with the way this Administration has handled the FAA and its budget needs   My frustration stems in part from the Administration s effort to play a continuing game of  hide the ball  when it comes to the budgetary realities of this agency         Conflicting Answers    For the last several months  I have been seeking very simple answers to some very simple questions  It was not until this Subcommittee actually scheduled hearings with the Transportation Secretary or the FAA Administrator that we have been able to get any answers  And then  the Secretary s answers have contradicted the Administrator s answers        For example  I ve been asking   Of the hundreds of air safety inspectors that are expected to retire this year  how many will the agency be able to hire to fill those vacancies   These safety inspectors represent some of the most critical air safety positions in the entire agency   We have received numerous reports from the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office that we need more inspectors and better training because more domestic airlines are doing their aircraft maintenance oversees          It is a sad fact of life that  at present  the FAA does not even have the manpower or ability to inspect some of the facilities that are conducting these maintenance activities   When I asked Secretary Mineta about this back on March 16th  he told me the Department was going to be in a position to hire the 238 safety inspectors that we called for in our appropriations bill  But just this past Friday  the Administrator told us to expect about 30 percent fewer inspectors to be hired  So with all the requirements placed on our flight safety inspectors  their number will still be well below the level the agency had back in 2003          Similarly  for months I have been asking how many air traffic controllers the FAA will be able to hire to make up for the hundreds of controllers that are expected to retire this year   Here again  the Secretary gave me one number  and the Administrator gave me another  The Secretary told me he would be funding the 1 249 controllers that were called for last year while the Administrator is now telling me that we should only expect 930         Inadequate Plan for Retirements    These disconnects highlight my concern that the Administration doesn t have a real plan for dealing with the looming retirement crisis both in the inspector and controller workforce  Back in December of 2004  the FAA released this multi year controller staffing plan  At the time  the FAA assured us the plan would be renewed annually and updated for market conditions and actual retirements   We were assured this plan would not be ignored by OMB and would not grow dusty sitting on a shelf   We were told the Administration was committed to updating the plan every year and funding it          Well  it is now May of 2006  the annual update for this plan was due more than six months ago  and we still don t have it  The absence of this plan cannot be blamed on the fact that the FAA and the controllers still do not have a contract   That shouldn t influence this plan          To me  it is simply inexcusable that this critical safety plan is being ignored  The fact that the agency cannot afford to hire enough inspectors or controllers does not come as a complete surprise to me   There are a number of funding shortfalls that undermine the FAA s ability to hire enough staff          A small part of the problem is that Congress approved a larger pay raise than the agency budgeted for   A much larger part of the problem is that  despite my efforts  and the efforts of several other Senators  the Congress imposed a one percent across the board cut on all agencies  including the FAA s operations account         Across the Board Cuts    These across the board cuts have become an annual ritual  They occur because the Republican budget resolutions impose an unrealistic ceiling on agency funding  Last year was no different   Despite the fact that the Transportation  Treasury bill included enough funding to hire enough controllers and inspectors at the level called for by our Subcommittee  the Defense Appropriations bill then cut all accounts by one percent  With the large operating account that the FAA has  that one percent cut had a real impact          I must commend the FAA Administrator for sounding the alarm on this possibility  She sent me and the other managers of this bill a letter expressing her worry about the potential impact of another across the board cut   I was sufficiently concerned that I took to the Senate Floor in December to warn my colleagues against imposing an across the board cut          I specifically cited the potential impact of this cut on the FAA s ability to hire sufficient safety staff   In fact  I put Administrator Blakey s letter into the Record for all my colleagues to see  Unfortunately  my speech and the Administrator s letter were not sufficient to spare the FAA from this across the board cut   Now  we are seeing the results when it comes to critical safety staffing          So Congress is part of the problem here  but not all of the problem   A large share of responsibility lies with the way the FAA has failed to manage major procurement projects       Mismanagement    The FAA has had a long history of wasting millions and sometimes billions of dollars on mismanaged procurements for which the taxpayer and the flying public have gotten very little or inadequate results          Recently  we received an Inspector General s report indicating that this pattern still persists   The report made clear that the FAA s efforts to modernize its telecommunications infrastructure are way behind schedule and over budget   I will discuss this in greater detail later          The IG found that if the FAA had managed these projects effectively  it would have saved  33 million last year in operating funds and more than  100 million this year   Those operating savings would have been more than enough to fully fund the FAA  s controller staffing plan and would have hired enough safety inspectors to get us back to the 2003 level   But because the FAA mismanaged these projects  it never enjoyed the savings  and its critical safety needs are now being shortchanged        So in summary  Mr  Chairman  I believe this agency deserves a better budget  it deserves better leadership from the Secretary on down  it needs better management when it comes to these multi million dollar procurements  and it needs better attention from this Congress   Only then will the flying public know that the system is truly safe   I look forward to working with you to try to achieve all of these objectives
