Education  Healthcare  and Port Security      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  March 21  2007     Washington  D C     In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke in favor of the pending Budget Resolution  S Con Res  21    Murray helped craft the budget as a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I am thrilled that we finally have a budget that reflects the priorities of families across the country   American families want to focus on strengthening our country from within  and that starts with investing here at home    in our schools  our infrastructure  and our communities  That s exactly what this budget does  and it still provides every dollar the President seeks for defense spending over the next five years        Americans want to make investments in our future in a responsible way   Every family knows the importance of fiscal discipline and keeping a balanced budget  and they expect the federal government to share that responsibility          With this budget  we are restoring strong pay as you go rules   That means we re being responsible today   and not burdening our grandchildren with new debt tomorrow   American families also need relief from taxes that are squeezing the middle class    Our budget provides relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax for 2 years  and it avoids any tax increases   In fact  we ve produced a budget that projects a  132 billion surplus without endangering struggling middle class families    With this budget  we re proving that we can invest in our people  our communities and our security without sacrificing our future        Mr  President  this budget reflects a new direction   Last November  the American people demanded a change  and this budget reflects that call   Our budget says  No longer will our veterans be shortchanged on their medical care   No longer will our communities face painful cuts in housing  No longer will our ports having gaping security holes  No longer will our schools be under funded  No longer will community healthcare be undermined at the federal level   And no longer will we keep forcing more debt onto our children and grandchildren without a plan to bring the budget back into balance        We ve said all along that there s a better way  and this budget proves it   Now I recognize that we couldn t fund everything that everyone wants  No budget could   But this budget finally moves us in the right direction in a responsible way  and that s a dramatic new start for this Senate   Last year  we were struggling just to protect critical needs   This year  we are investing in them proudly   Mr  President  I just want to highlight some of the national priorities that this budget addresses       Veterans    Mr  President  the Bush Administration has not adequately funded veterans healthcare   As we begin the fifth year of this war  that becomes more and more evident   Whether its veterans struggling to get mental healthcare or facing lengthy waits for initial benefits claims  or a lack of focus on TBI care  we are seeing what happens when veterans care is shortchanged         Our budget increases support for veterans by  3 5 billion over the President s proposal   In fact  the total  43 1 billion we are now investing in veterans care represents a full 98 percent of the Independent Budget that is devised by several of the Veterans Service Organizations that represent the real needs of our nation s veterans        Our budget also rejects the President s proposal to impose new fees and higher drug co payments on certain veterans   The President s fees would force more than 100 000 veterans to leave the VA health care system   that s just wrong   I have seen the detrimental effect of under funding veterans care  and I have fought hard in the past to fix administration funding blunders  including a  3 billion shortfall in veterans care in 2005 and 2006         By increasing funding for veterans  our budget finally does what the administration has long failed to do   recognize the service and sacrifice of our veterans as a cost of this war      Education    Mr  President  a strong future also starts with a budget that invests here at home in our schools   After years of painful cuts  we have finally produced a budget that addresses the needs of American families who worry about finding and affording educational opportunities for their children         Our budget provides the largest increase in funding for elementary and secondary education programs in five years   That will make a real difference for students across the country        Our budget increases funding for the Department of Education by  6 1 billion above the President s budget  and our budget restores all of Presidents Bush s education cuts  Among the programs that will see increased funding are Perkins Grants  Pell Grants  Head Start  No Child Left Behind  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act         As a parent and a former educator  I know the importance of having the full partnership of the federal government in supporting students  I am so glad that our budget strengthens that partnership and eliminates harmful cuts        Health Care  SCHIP    Another area our budget addresses is providing health care to our nation s most vulnerable children         Our budget provides up to  50 billion for SCHIP over the next five years   These additional SCHIP funds will expand health coverage to an estimated six million eligible children who are not enrolled in either SCHIP or Medicaid  while maintaining coverage for all currently enrolled children   This is a critical step toward finally  closing the gap  so that no child in America is left without medical coverage       Port Security    Mr  President  our budget also invests in critical ports security needs    Last year I worked closely with other Senators to pass the Safe Ports Act   But unfortunately  the President did not adequately fund this vital program in his budget          In our budget  we have increased funding for the SAFE Ports Act and provided  400 million for the Port Security Grants Program  This funding means more radiation detectors  more partners in safe trade  and more customs officials to facilitate trade   Our budget takes real steps to improve port security while also maintaining and improving trade efficiency         Finally  I would like to thank Senator Conrad for his tireless work in leading the fight on this budget  It has been a privilege to stand at his side in the Budget Committee and to work with him to right our fiscal ship         This budget once again invests in the true priorities of the American people  while keeping the needs and aspirations of future generations in mind  I look forward to passing this budget so that we can move forward with the new direction the American people have demanded
