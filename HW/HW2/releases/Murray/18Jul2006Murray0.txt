                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Senator Murray s Statement on the TTHUD Subcommittee Bill  07 18 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray s Statement on the TTHUD Subcommittee Bill      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 18  2006    I believe that we are bringing a very good bill to the Subcommittee today   It represents a lot of hard work and compromise between us   I want to thank you  Mr  Chairman  for engaging in a very open and fair process   We have tackled some of the most challenging issues in transportation  housing  community development  and federal financial management        Frankly  the best part about this bill is that it rejects the budget priorities of the Bush Administration   In nearly every case  this bill restores the punitive funding cuts that the President has requested  That s good news for our communities  for our economy  and for our future   Let me share a few highlights       Aviation   The Administration wanted to cut our investment in America s airport infrastructure by over three quarters of a billion dollars   This bill restores every penny to that program   The Administration wanted to eliminate direct appropriations for the Essential Air Service Program  which provides critical air service to some rural communities  We restored the funding to the current level  so these communities can stay connected to air service      CDBG   Mr  Chairman  as you know  I have a special interest in the Community Development Block Grant program   I ve seen the difference it can make for communities and individuals   Last year  the Bush Administration sought severe cuts to CDBG  and last year we restored some    but not all    of those cuts   This year  again  the Bush Administration sought to slash this program by  1 2 billion or 27 percent   I am proud to report that we have restored every penny the President sought to cut   That is great news for communities from coast to coast and I want to thank you  Mr  Chairman  for your leadership on CDBG funding       HUD   I also want to commend you  Mr  Chairman  for your steadfast support for the broader mission and programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development   You worked with the entire Subcommittee to restore punitive cuts   As you know  the President sought to cut housing for the elderly by 26 percent and housing for the disabled by 50 percent   Our bill rejects both of those cuts        Not only have we rejected the President  s proposed cuts for the capital investments in our Nation  s public housing stock  but    for the first time in a long time    we have increased funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund   We were also able to provide a small increase for the Public Housing Operating Fund to address some of the critical shortfalls created by soaring utility costs          As you are aware  Mr  Chairman  there was not enough funding in our allocation to restore all of the cuts in HUD   Fortunately  however  working with the Banking Committee  we have found some legislative savings in the Federal Housing Administration that has provided us with hundreds of millions of dollars to work with  That funding went to restore CDBG and adequately fund the Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds       Alcohol Producer Fees   I m also pleased that we rejected the Treasury Department  s proposal to fund the Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau through user fees   That means that there will be no new taxes imposed on beer producers in Missouri or wine producers in Washington State   I don  t know why the Treasury Department keeps sending up this proposal  they should just look at the roster of this Subcommittee and give up        Other Provisions   Members should be aware that there are a number of permanent changes in law included in this bill   As I already mentioned  some of these changes in the HUD area actually freed up funding for us to invest in restoring funding to critical HUD programs   There is a carefully negotiated compromise regarding the fate of air service into Dallas Love Field   There is also a provision that requires the FAA to raise the mandatory retirement age for commercial pilots to age 65   All of these provisions will be subject to Rule XVI when the bill reaches the Floor  so Members   rights will be protected if they wish to strike these provisions on a point of order   I have to admit that I am reserving judgment on the pilot retirement rule until I can talk to the safety experts about it        Amtrak   Finally  I want to take a moment to talk about the funding level and policy established in this bill for Amtrak   For the Nation  s passenger railroad  this bill includes  1 4 billion  which is precisely the amount recommended by the DOT Inspector General as necessary to maintain all current services of the railroad   It is  however  some  200 million less than the Amtrak Board of Directors requested   There is no question that Amtrak can use considerably more capital funding to deal with its aging infrastructure          I do not have a complaint with the funding level for Amtrak  but as you know  Mr  Chairman  I have a big complaint with certain language that you have included in the bill that tries to insert this Subcommittee into the collective bargaining process with Amtrak  s trade unions   You and I discussed this yesterday  and we agreed to disagree on this matter   As such  I will be offering an amendment to strike the language from the bill   I will have more to say on my reasons for striking this language when I offer my amendment   I believe that we will have another amendment on Amtrak labor policy as well from Senator Byrd   That amendment will prohibit Amtrak from outsourcing any jobs overseas   I know that I and many of my colleagues want to enthusiastically support this bill   I know that I will be more enthusiastic about this bill if these Amtrak policy amendments can be adopted          In general  Mr  Chairman  this bill is a dramatic improvement over the funding recommendations included in the President  s budget   It deserves the support of all Members   I want to thank you and your staff for all the time and effort you ve put into this bill
