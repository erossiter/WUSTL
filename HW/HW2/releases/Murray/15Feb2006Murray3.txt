                                 News Release          Senator Murray Discusses Tribal Education Murray Calls No Child Act  The Greatest Bait and Switch   Senator Warns that the President s Budget Offers Inadequate Support for Tribal Schools    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 15  2006     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  outlined her priorities for tribal education at a conference hosted by the National Indian Education Association in the U S  Capitol          Senator Murray  a long time advocate for public education and for Indian Country  explained that the President s budget proposals will not meet the needs facing our schools         To receive future Tribal Updates from Senator Murray  see      Senator Murray s remarks follow     Thank you so much for that warm welcome   It s great to have all of you here in Washington  D C  You re very lucky to have Ryan Wilson as your president   We re so proud of him back in Washington state   Ryan helped start the first urban Native American Boys   Girls Club in the nation in my hometown of Seattle   It just celebrated its second anniversary        I also want to give a special welcome to my friends from Washington   I want to congratulate Evelyn Jefferson who just became the first woman Chair in the history of the Lummi Nation          I know many of you have traveled a long way to be here today  but the truth is we need you here to help pressure Congress to do the right things for our schools and communities   You can help Members of Congress understand what s really happening in tribal schools   You can show them how the No Child Left Behind Act is affecting your communities    And it s a message they need to here        Right now  we re beginning a very big debate about priorities in Congress   Last week  the President sent his budget to Congress  and it outlines his priorities   I have some very serious concerns with the President s approach   Now the House and the Senate are getting ready to outline our priorities   At the end of this process  we will pass a budget plan that will spell out how every federal dollar will be spent this year   So now is the time to get our priorities straight  and that s why we need you here        You know  as I meet with working families  the main concern I hear is that they don t feel secure   They re worried they could lose their job or their pension or their healthcare   They worry they won t be able to put their kids through college   There is a lot of insecurity  and we need to address that        We all want our country to be strong  and the way to do that is to invest here at home    invest in our people  in our infrastructure and in our future   And the best way to invest in our future is to invest in education    to make sure all of our kids are ready to succeed        As you all know  the demands on our schools keep growing   Today  our schools are expected to be an educator  a parent  a disciplinarian  a social worker  and so much more    and to do it all with more accountability and less funding        If we expect our schools to keep handling new burdens and new challenges  we need to provide funding at the federal level   New demands    without new funding    is a recipe for disaster   Congress and the President need to learn that lesson before more kids get hurt        The No Child Left Behind Act is the greatest  bait and switch  I ve ever seen   Schools were promised that in exchange for greater accountability they would get greater funding   Well Congress sure handed them the first part  but Congress has never delivered on the second part  and our students are paying the price  This year again  the President s budget falls short of what we need        Under the President  s FY 2007 budget  funding for No Child Left Behind would increase by just 2    That doesn t even keep up with inflation   The President s budget is more than  15 billion below what we promised in the No Child Left Behind Act   We ve already under funded it by  56 billion since it passed   Schools can t handle another year of being shortchanged        I m also very concerned about other parts of the President s budget plan for education   He wants to freeze funding for disadvantaged students under Title I   He wants to keep retreating on our promise to students with disabilities        I m especially concerned about how the president s budget treats early education   As some of you may know  I was pre school teacher  and I know that a small investment in the early years make a big difference   In my classroom  I could tell which kids had come to school prepared to learn and which ones had not   We need to make sure all children can start school ready to learn       That s why it s so disappointing that the President wants to freeze funding for Head Start        And the President  s budget also shortchanges Indian education           He freezes funding for Impact Aid and Title VII       He eliminates the Johnson O  Malley program       And despite a  1 billion backlog for new facilities and critical repairs  he cuts Indian school construction by  50 million        We cannot expect any schools  including tribal schools  to improve without providing appropriate funding   So I m very concerned about the priorities in the President s budget   They don t reflect my priorities   In the coming weeks  I m going to be using my position on the Budget Committee to try and put the investments where they re needed most        All of us here today know that schools throughout the country are struggling to meet the challenges of the No Child Left Behind Act           For Indian Country  one of the real challenges of No Child Left Behind is    How can we improve Indian education while respecting and promoting tribal culture and language           Title VII of the Act lays out one strategy  and the President issued an executive order two years ago to provide some more proposals        But I m very concerned that the way the law is being implemented does not allow for a culturally based education   The key ingredients must be curriculum  teaching  parents and community involvement   Unfortunately  NCLB stifles those roles        I ve got other concerns with NCLB    especially with how this Administration is implementing it   This Administration has focused solely on rigid testing that may not be appropriate for all kids   That rigid test is based on curriculum that ignores programs such as music  art  and language which are not just critical to an Indian child  s education but all children        I m also concerned that children could be blamed if their schools don t perform well   As you know  the law requires schools to look at how all children are doing in a school   However  the law intended schools to use that information to provide support for so called low performing students  not blame those children causing the school to not meet AYP          Children should not be blamed as individuals or as a group for a school  s lack of success under the law   It is also important that we explore ways of looking at students   gains over time as opposed to the snapshot method currently used under NCLB          So we ve got a lot of things to fix    and as you know  we are supposed to reauthorize NCLB in the next Congress   I ve seen your preliminary report on  No Child Left Behind in Indian Country    I think it s an excellent start to educating Congress on the impact of this law   It is critical that you take the time over the next year to not only educate the House and Senate but to also develop specific proposals for reauthorization   Over the next year  the House Education and Workforce Committee and the Senate HELP Committee will be holding hearings on NCLB  and we need to hear from you        So I m thrilled that you re here this week    making the case and building awareness   I ve been working on education policy for many years and I can tell you    before Members of Congress can make education better    they need to be educated themselves about what s really happening in our schools    and you are the right people to lead that charge   So thank you for coming  we need you here  and together we re going to fight to do right by all of our children
