                                                 News Release          Murray Invites Homeland Security Secretary to Tour HAMMER Senator Says Visit to Tri Cities Would Show HAMMER s Value as a Training Center for the Region s First Responders     Murray also raises concerns about Northern Border and Port   Cargo Security    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 20  2005          Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  invited the new Homeland Security Secretary  Michael Chertoff  to visit the HAMMER center in Richland  Washington  She also urged his Department to take full advantage of HAMMER s expertise in training first responders        Murray offered the invitation at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee   Murray noted that HAMMER can provide critical training and cost savings for local emergency officials         I know that when you see their capabilities  you will agree that using HAMMER as a designated training center would be a benefit to both the first responder community throughout the Northwest    and DHS itself   Murray said    This is a state of the art  Department of Energy facility with expertise in threats posed by chemical  radiological  and biological agents  hazardous materials  and weapons of mass destruction           Murray noted that first responders in the Northwest now travel long distances to get training in other states  instead of getting training closer to home    and at less expense    at HAMMER         HAMMER specializes in hands on training for first responders  but the Department  of Energy  has not designated this facility a regional training center   Instead  first responders from throughout the Northwest have to use their local budget or DHS funding to travel to facilities around the country for the training they could receive close to home   Murray said        Murray urged Secretary Chertoff to use HAMMER as a resource for homeland security training   Murray noted that the Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized Chertoff to  enter into joint sponsorship arrangements with the Secretary of Energy to use DOE sites to carry out the missions of the Department of Homeland Security         Also at the hearing  Murray raised concerns about inadequate funding for other security efforts and discussed several Washington state security priorities       Inadequate Funding from the Administration    Murray stressed that while both the White House and Congress share the goal of improved security  the White House has failed to request the adequate security funding  and the Department of Homeland Security has not allocated that funding to the most pressing threats         Mr  Secretary  I want to work with you to ensure our budget will actually deliver the security we both seek for our country   But if we are going to work together  we need to be honest about what resources are necessary to do your job and let the Congress worry about budget priorities   Murray said    I  m quite concerned that good intentions are not going to help us establish a rigorous port and cargo security regime  protect our borders  or train our personnel correctly        Northern Border    Murray raised her concerns that more than 200 new Border Patrol agents are being dispatched to the Southern Border         I obviously am concerned about the northern border I know all 200 of those plus  agents  are going to the Southern Border   We know that the Northern Border is a problem   Murray said       Port Security    Murray noted that America s ports have sought  1 billion in funding to improve security  but the Administration has not requested any funding for port security grants this year         From our discussions  I know port security is an important issue for you  You understand it s not only human life  It is economic disaster if we don t secure our ports  but it is disconcerting to me that the Administration does not ask for the dollars for these port security grants   Murray said       Cargo Security    Need for Coordination     Murray also discussed the need to better coordinate disjointed cargo security programs        Murray noted that  at her suggestion last year  the Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to produce a report on ways to coordinated cargo security efforts   The report  which was due to Congress on February 8th  has still not been produced         I ve talked you about this  I ve talked with  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  Commissioner Bonner   I ve talked with a number of folks about it  and all we get is  We re going to study this    How can we help you come up with a coordinated approach to secure our ports  all the cargo that moves through them  and all the people in those areas   Murray asked
