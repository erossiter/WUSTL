                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   IRAQ   Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on Iraq and Veterans  Senate Floor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Murray  IRAQ   Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on Iraq and Veterans  Senate Floor   06 06 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          IRAQ   Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on Iraq and Veterans  Senate Floor     For Immediate Release  Tuesday  June 6  2006          Mr  President  last week  our country celebrated a very important event  Memorial Day   Every member of the Senate went home to services where we heard about the sacrifices of men and women who served in conflicts throughout this nation  s history  most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan where we have now lost close to two thousand  five hundred of our nation  s best and brightest who  ve served us in Iraq and Afghanistan         I listened to those speeches  and I heard about the sacrifices these men and women have made   I heard the rhetoric about making sure that we take care of their families  making sure that we take care of those who are wounded when they come home  making sure that we have the ability to care for those we asked to serve this country so honorably as we celebrated Memorial Day last week          So I went throughout my state  I listened to people wanting to make sure that we did not forget those people who served us   I came back to the Senate last night confident that we should be talking about those issues   Well Mr  President  it is deeply disconcerting to me that we are not talking about the war in Iraq or Afghanistan  we  re not talking about the sacrifices our soldiers have made  we  re not talking about the tremendous responsibility we have as the United States Senate and Congress to make sure that we  ve got the funds for those men and women who  ve served us  both while they  re overseas and when they come home          We are here instead on a completely different priority  and I have to ask the question of this Senate   why are we spending time on political games when we have soldiers in harm  s way who are serving us honorably around the world   Don  t they deserve better than this  Why is the Senate bringing up divisive issues when we need right now  more than ever  to come together as a country and address the challenges that confront us         Well  maybe Mr  President  it  s because those people who are in charge  those people who make a decision about what issues we discuss here just have the wrong priorities   And I see the wrong priorities being debated in the Senate not just this week  but apparently for the coming weeks        You know  last week I traveled through communities in my home state of Washington   Everywhere I went  I heard a growing anger and frustration that American troops are being wounded and dying in Iraq  and my constituents want to know why   They want to know where we  re going  they want to know what we  re doing  they want to know why we  re there  they want to know what will make us successful  and how we can bring our troops home successfully  But here we are in Washington  D C  and the Bush Administration doesn t have a plan they  ve outlined for success   And here we are in Congress  not demanding answers          Mr  President  my constituents are very frustrated  and they have good reason to be so   They  like all of us  are watching what s happening in Iraq on their TVs every night   They see personally what these deployments are doing to their communities at home   Their friends  their neighbors  their co workers being called up not just once  but twice  three times to head to Iraq and come back  They see the terrible consequences for families who are left behind  And they see these veterans when they go to get the treatment they need being told they have to wait in line because we haven  t adequately funded our Veteran  s Administration          And  by the way  many of these same veterans just in the last week being told that because of lack of oversight at the VA twenty six and a half million of these veterans who have served this country honorably have now lost their identities   And we  re not dealing with that  here in the United States Senate right now   How are we going to make sure every one of these veterans get the care that they need  and how are we going to make sure now that twenty six and a half million veterans get the help they need as their identities have been stolen   That  s going to cost money   It is not free   We have a responsibility to help every single one of them   They should not be treated like this as veterans in the United States today          I see what these deployments are doing in our community  just like my constituents do   And they see the challenges these veterans are facing when they come home  and their families while they are deployed   They don t see a plan about how we are going forward in Iraq today   And what they importantly don t see is us  here Congress  on the Senate floor  standing up and talking about what is going on  demanding answers from the Bush Administration and the Pentagon  We can only make good decisions about how we go forward  if we have a discussion  here in the United States Senate  about what is happening on the ground  what the impacts are  what are our choices  how can we help both the Pentagon and the Bush Administration and our constituents make a good decision about whether or not our troops should come home  or whether they should stay  or what  s happening          We need to demand answers  here in the United States Senate  from this administration and the Pentagon  about  what is happening on the ground   That is the discussion that I wish we were having in the United States Senate today   That has meaning to every single one of my constituents at home   They want to know what we  re doing  where we  re going how we  re going to pay for it  and how we can be successful so we can know when our troops are coming home           You know  I  ve watched now for three years as our country went to war in Iraq  and at every possible juncture in this war  the Bush Administration has chosen the wrong path   When they were advised to build a stronger  multi national coalition  they decided to go it alone   When the Army  s Chief of Staff said it would take several hundred thousand troops to stabilize Iraq after the war  they ignored his advice  and they fired him   When sectarian violence started boiling over and undermining the stability of Iraq and the safety of our troops  they pronounced the insurgency was in its  last throes    Well they were wrong          Mr  President  we can  t continue to watch what  s happening in Iraq without answering questions here in the United States Senate   For too long  we have watched decisions be made that have sent us in the wrong direction   And for too long  I say to my colleagues in the United States Senate  we have given them a pass on these monumental failures  and that has to change          Families I represent want Congress to demand accountability and they want us to get to the bottom of this   But that  s not what they  re getting here   Instead  we see the Republican leadership playing politics with debates on gay marriage and flag burning   What are we not doing while we spend our time here   We  re not having hearings on Iraq   We  re not having discussions about what  s happening on the ground   We  re not hearing from the generals so that we can make good decisions about when and how our troops can come home successfully   Instead we  re seeing political distractions that are simply meant to divide our country at a time  Mr  President  when we ought to be together  Republicans and Democrats  having serious discussions about what we can do as leaders of this nation to bring us success  if it  s possible  in Iraq          Back home  people want us to talk about Iraq   They want answers  but here in the Senate the Iraq War is the proverbial elephant in the room   It  s right there  everyone can see it  no one talks about it   No one talks about it here in the United States Senate of America   No one is talking about the Iraq War   Well  I  ll tell you  we  re not going to get better results in Iraq if we ignore it here in Congress          Mr  President  in all the time I have served in the United States Senate  I believe that this is the weakest oversight I have ever seen from a Congress during a military conflict   We were not sent here to just rubber stamp this administration or any administration  and I served under the Clinton administration during the war in Bosnia  When we required generals to come up here almost on a daily basis to demand answers from them about what was happening on the ground  how we were proceeding forward  what we needed to do   And yes at the time there were calls to bring our troops home  no boots on the ground  all the different things that we  re hearing today  But we at least had generals in front of us so we could ask questions and go home and respond to our constituents and feel confident in whatever decision we made about how we needed to move forward          Mr  President we were sent here as United States senators to develop policies to help our country move forward  And in this time  in this place  this war  I can  t think of a more important time Mr  President  that as Republicans and Democrats we should sit down together and put our cards on the table and say how should we move forward and how can we do it safely and how can we do it effectively        Yet  here we are in the Senate talking about gay marriage and flag burning  We  re not talking about a conflict that has consumed our nation  that has sent our youngest  best  and brightest to a war  where we have almost 2 500 military families who have suffered the loss of a loved one  Where we have thousands and thousands of young men and women who  ve lost limbs  have head injuries  and are now being served in our veterans hospitals for years to come  and yet we haven  t talked about how we  re are going to pay for that          Mr  President there is a huge disconnect between the families at home and what  s happening here on the Senate floor   No surprise that they are frustrated and angry and demanding answers   They are surprised and shocked that we are talking about gay marriage and flag burning   Because the discussions they have at their dinner tables when they are home at night is what  s happening in our world   How can we protect our children   How can we make sure that our families are safe   How can we make sure that our loved ones who are serving us overseas are protected while they are there   How can we make sure that we win a war in Iraq if that  s possible   How can we make sure that when those people we send to service overseas when they come home have the services they need         You know Mr  President  I was shocked to see an article in the Psychiatric News just a few weeks ago that says that our veterans are not getting the help they need for mental health care and substance abuse        I want to quote Mr  President  Frances Murphy  M D   Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at our Department of Veterans Affairs  who said that  the growing numbers of veterans seeking mental health care has put emphasis on areas in which improvement is needed   And she noted that some VA clinics do not provide mental health or substance abuse care  or if they do   waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible      Mr  President  our soldiers who are serving in a 24 7 war in Iraq deserve to have mental health care when they come home   They are not getting it today  and this Senate is not dealing with that issue   Mr  President  I think we can do a lot better than this
