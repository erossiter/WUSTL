                               News Release          Murray Stands Up for Stem Cell Research Senator says President s veto threat is wrong and short sighted    veto would jeopardize cures  lives  and innovation    For Immediate Release  Monday  July 17  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  took to the Senate floor tonight to support the expansion of stem cell research and the hope it brings for millions of Americans and their families   In light of recent veto threats from the Administration  Murray also called on President Bush to stand with Congress in support of science  hope and the opportunity the expansion of this critical research brings          Families around the country are holding out hope that we will allow science to move forward and deliver on the promise of stem cell research   That s exactly what we should be doing   But today  the hands of American scientists are tied by political restrictions   Senator Murray said    I believe we can expand stem cell research while still maintaining strict ethical safeguards   That s why I support passing H R  810         In 2001  the Bush Administration promised that upwards of 60 stem cell lines could be available for research  To date  only 15 lines may be available   And it appears that all of these lines have contamination problems         The president s restrictions have held back American science and stalled promising research   It s time to correct that mistake and allow our country to make progress   Murray said    In nearly 6 full years in office  President Bush has never once vetoed a bill   It s amazing to me that he would choose this bill   one offering basic hope and opportunity to so many Americans   for his first veto   The President is wrong on this issue  and his threatened veto is wrong          The full transcript of Senator Murray s remarks on the floor follow      Mr  President  I rise in support of expanding stem cell research   This innovative research offers the chance to save lives          Families around the country are holding out hope that we will allow science to move forward and deliver on the promise of stem cell research   That s exactly what we should be doing   But today  the hands of American scientists are tied by political restrictions   I believe we can expand stem cell research while still maintaining strict ethical safeguards   That s why I support passing H R  810        In 2001  President Bush imposed restrictions on promising stem cell research   Since that time  we ve learned that there aren t as many useful stem cell lines as the President suggested   The Bush Administration promised that 60 lines would be available for research  To date  only 15 lines may be available   It appears that all of these lines have contamination problems          The president s restrictions have held back American science and stalled promising research   It s time to correct that mistake and allow our country to make progress          Stem cell research is about improving medicine and saving lives   For patients with diseases like Parkinson s  Alzheimer s  diabetes  and Multiple Sclerosis  stem cell research holds promising potential to provide the tools to understand  treat  and someday cure these devastating illnesses         I understand the challenges and frustration these diseases cause   When I was 15 years old  my dad was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis   In a few short years  his illness got so bad that he couldn t work any more   For almost all of my life  my father was confined to a wheelchair   My dad  s illness had a profound impact on our entire family   My mom  who had stayed home to raise the family  had to take care of him    But she also needed to get a job so she could support our family   She got a job  but it wasn t enough to support seven kids and a husband with growing medical bills         I can only imagine how our lives might have been different if there had been a cure for M S   Back then  we didn t have the tools to find a cure   Today we do  but those tools are blocked by an ideological policy that puts politics over science   We can do better          My dad  s challenges are similar to the struggles that millions of Americans and their families face every day   They deserve a chance   They deserve hope   That s why we cannot let the current restrictions stand        A short time ago  I received a letter from a constituent in Mercer Island  Washington   He wrote    My 17 year old son was recently involved in an automobile accident and is now paralyzed from the upper chest down   Stem Cell Research looks to be our brightest hope by far   Please help give him a chance to ride a bike  go for a hike and run with his friends again   Please  support Stem Cell Research         Mr  President  as that father points out   this is about people   It is also about keeping our country on the cutting edge of science and research   I m proud to represent a state that has a strong reputation for scientific research         For our country to remain a leader in this promising field  our scientists and researchers need the support of our government   America should never take a backseat to other countries in the search for promising new cures   Unfortunately  the President  s stem cell research policy is tying the hands of science by limiting the number of lines eligible for federal funding    We can do better          In fact  the majority of this Congress has been trying to correct the President s mistake for over a year now   HR 810 passed the House of Representatives thirteen months ago   Since that day  we ve been fighting to bring the issue of stem cell research to the Senate floor   We wrote letters   We pleaded on this floor   And we asked the Republican leader numerous times for even a few hours to debate and pass this bipartisan bill   Our efforts to promote research and offer hope were denied at every turn          But now our day has finally come   After more than a year of obstruction  we finally have a chance to offer hope to millions of patients and their families   On a bipartisan basis  I believe this bill will pass          But of course that s not the whole story   Shortly after we received word that this bill would finally come to the floor  I was dismayed to see headlines announcing that Karl Rove  President Bush s chief political advisor  guaranteed a veto of this important bill   In nearly 6 full years in office  President Bush has never once vetoed a bill   It s amazing to me that he would choose this bill   one offering basic hope and opportunity to so many Americans   for his first veto   The President is wrong on this issue  and his threatened veto is wrong        I m here today first to pledge my support to this bill and call on my colleagues to support it   But next  I must call on them to ask the president   in no uncertain terms   to stand with us in support of hope and opportunity   Stand with us in support of medical research   Stand with us    and more importantly    with the millions of American waiting on a cure  in support of stem cell research          Far too often in this administration  ideology has trumped research   Politics has been more important than science   With this bill  President Bush has a chance to change course and put people ahead of personal political ideology   I urge him to do the right thing   For our patients  their families  and the future of our nation  s research leadership  it is time for the U S  Senate to pass HR 810 and for the President to sign it   Let s take the handcuffs off our scientists and let them find the cures that will save lives
