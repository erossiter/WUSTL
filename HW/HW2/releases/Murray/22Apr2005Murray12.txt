                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Statement of Senator Patty Murray on Earth Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Murray  Statement of Senator Patty Murray on Earth Day  04 22 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement of Senator Patty Murray on Earth Day    For Immediate Release  Friday  April 22  2005      Today marks the 35th anniversary of Earth Day  a commitment one generation made to another to preserve the natural beauty of our environment   Earth Day was born out of an urgent sense that we needed to stop the degradation of our surroundings and improve our environment   Today  we feel that same sense of urgency as the Bush Administration continues to assault our landmark protection laws        I am very proud of the work we have done in Washington state to keep environmental conservation a top priority  We have balanced economic growth and environmental protection  Passionate individuals and organizations are dedicated to protecting our unique natural resources  highlighting the difference that each and every one of us can make        Since Earth Day  s inception  our country has made tremendous progress in improving air and water quality   Despite population growth and industrialization  air pollutant levels have been cut by over 50    More than one billion pounds of toxic chemicals are removed from wastewater every year  and wetland losses have slowed to nearly a quarter of what they were in 1970          But there is a lot of progress left to be made   Every year thousands of Americans are hospitalized from respiratory problems associated with polluted air   Industrial smog is now a common blight on our urban landscapes  And the EPA estimates that nearly one half of U S  streams and lakes still do not meet federal water quality standards        The Bush Administration is working to systematically dismantle critical regulations that safeguard public health and safety   Proposals like   Clear Skies    and the mercury emissions rule would roll back decades of progress in environmental protection   Rather than relax federal standards  we need aggressive plans to improve our air and water quality        Record high fuel prices remind us of the pressing need to implement a comprehensive national energy policy   We need a long term plan that reduces our dependence on foreign oil and encourages alternative energy development and conservation  The Administration continues to push a flawed proposal that does not achieve any of these goals          Today and every day  we must reaffirm our commitment to preserve our natural environment for generations to come
