Stryker Brigades  Traumatic Brain Injury and Veterans Mental Healthcare      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 27  2007    Lewis  screening for Traumatic Brain Injury  and the availability of mental healthcare for America s veterans        At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing  Murray asked for assurances from the nation s top military leaders that the Stryker Brigades from Fort Lewis  Washington will have everything they need during their deployments   Murray raised the question because one brigade is deploying earlier than planned and the other is remaining in Iraq longer than planned        General Pace  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  told Murray  Yes  ma am   All of our troops   Stryker brigades  infantry brigades  regardless of how they re going over   will have the proper equipment   They will be properly trained   They will be properly manned   They will be properly equipped  before they get sent into a combat zone         Murray also asked Defense Secretary Gates to improve tracking of service members who are involved IED incidents that could put them at risk for a Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    Further  Murray urged the Secretary to release data from the Defense and Veteran s Brain Injury Center  which could help improve treatment and funding for veterans with TBI   Secretary Gates promised Murray a response within one week       MULTIMEDIA      Watch the exchange    Requires Real Player        Audio      An unofficial transcript of Senator Murray s questioning follows    Witnesses  Defense Secretary Robert Gates and General Peter Pace  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff       SENATOR MURRAY   Mr  Chairman  thank you  and thank you to our panelists  You know we ve heard a lot about  support our troops  in debates around here   I just have to say that I m one of those who voted against the war in Iraq because I felt there were too many unanswered questions   And today  watching all of the reports about what s happening  both within our VA system  and  of course  within the last few weeks here  it seems to me that who s really paid the price of this war is our troops  as they went into Iraq without the proper equipment and supplies  They ve come back and been left in limbo and really deplorable conditions at Walter Reed  as Senator Mikulski talked about   They get in the VA  and they get stuck in long waiting lines to get health care benefits  and to see a doctor   I just think that is really a crime  and I think it s unbelievable to me  looking at this supplemental request and this pie chart  that we re not asking in the supplemental for the additional dollars we need to take care of these troops  It s not just a matter of putting a little more paint on the wall  though I really commend you  Secretary Gates  for what you ve done in looking at this  but it is really asking the question  Are we doing everything we can whether they re still in DoD  or they ve been separated into VA  and how much is this going to cost  and do we have the resources to do it        Traumatic Brain Injury   SENATOR MURRAY   Case in point is the issue of Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    Really  I think we re going to see that more and more as the signature injury of this war   Some are estimating that 10  of our returning Iraqi and Afghani veterans have suffered from traumatic brain injury   One of the really big problems is that it s an unseen wound  and it s often misdiagnosed  And in many cases unless the service member involved in an IED incident is bleeding  they re not documented as having been involved in an explosion  So  as a result of that  the actual number of Iraq and Afghani veterans with TBI could be even higher than many of the statistics indicate that we ve seen so far   It s pretty clear to me that our system is not catching all the TBI patients in this war   Secretary Gates  I wanted to ask you this afternoon  would you support a policy to require the Pentagon to keep track of where and when a service member is exposed to an IED incident so we can improve screening and treatment for TBI  for traumatic brain injury       SECRETARY GATES   I don t know about the specific implications of it  but certainly in principle I would be supportive of that       SENATOR MURRAY   Well  I would like to know if you would follow up on that and put that in place   It s my understanding that the Defense and Veteran s Brain Injury Center today is refusing to give us any data on how many soldiers have actually suffered from brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan   They ve been saying that they don t want to disclose the results because it would put the lives of those fighting at risk  which I found pretty preposterous   This information was collected at taxpayer expense and could really help us get a handle on this problem and know how much we need and how we can best treat it   I would like to get a commitment from you today to release that critical information  so we know that we are treating those men and women  that they don t go home not knowing that they have had traumatic brain injury and that we can provide the dollars we need within the supplemental otherwise to make sure these individuals are taken care of and tracked of          Can you tell me that you will release this information       SECRETARY GATES   Well  again I don t know the reasons why  uh  it hasn t been released or the specifics   This is the first I ve heard of it   But I certainly will look into it  and if there s no compelling reason  absolutely       SENATOR MURRAY   When can I get an answer from you on that       SECRETARY GATES   Certainly within a week       SENATOR MURRAY   It s absolutely critical that we know what those numbers are   As I said  TBI is the signature issue of this war  many people are beginning to predict   And when we re sending those soldiers home without knowing that they ve been injured or without us providing the resources they need I think we re not doing our job to support the troops   So I look forward to hearing from you on that  as soon as possible on that  I appreciate that         Mental Health Care   SENATOR MURRAY   I also wanted to ask about a report that was released Sunday  titled  The Psychological Needs of U S  Military Service Members and their Families    These are members who are still in the DOD system  not in the VA system   And it really highlighted the need for mental health services for our troops and for our families   And it was really a long list of needs          I m not sure if you ve seen it or not  but it was very discouraging to me   There was no well disseminated approach to providing mental health care to service members and their families   There s no coordinated approach to providing care and service members transition from military health system into the VA  and about 40  of the slots for psychologies in the Army and Navy are vacant   This is a huge issue         Fort Lewis   SENATOR MURRAY   I was out at Fort Lewis last week and  my home state  Secretary Gates  you know it well   I got an update on some of the programs you re doing there   I ve learned about a new program for spouses of deployed solders  but I would like to find out from you what the Department of Defense is doing for the whole service member  including mental health services for our troops and their families   And are we providing enough dollars for that       SECRETARY GATES   We will get information to you       SENATOR MURRAY   Well  okay  this is a huge issue to me because I have two Stryker brigades  and a third is forming right now   I know those troops well   I ve sat down with them and their families  And under the President s proposed surge that is now occurring the 4 2 is going to deploy a couple of weeks early and the 3 2  which was deployed in June for a year  has now been extended   So these are people in my state  and I am deeply concerned that we are   both my state and across the nation   supporting our troops with real dollars  so I look forward to that   Answer to me very quickly on this   And while I m talking about my Stryker brigades  I am very concerned that as we extend the deployment of the 3 2 and we send the 4 2 over early  do we have the adequate supplies and equipment for those troops  Are we taking   Are they going to be going into battle without what they need       SECRETARY GATES   Let me ask General Pace to answer that question       GENERAL PACE  Senator  first if I may  thank you for your tenacity on all the veterans  benefits  and the way that you track that   There is a lot going on right now on the mental health side  thanks to what you ve already done  and there s more that can be done       SENATOR MURRAY   Well  before you answer this question   the huge problem is that everybody falls into this big crack between DOD and VA and the transition services and we are way far behind   But I d like your answer on the Stryker brigade       GENERAL PACE  Yes  ma am   All of our troops   Stryker brigades  infantry brigades  regardless of how they re going over   will have the proper equipment   They will be properly trained   They will be properly manned   They will be properly equipped  before they get sent into a combat zone       SENATOR MURRAY   Mr  Chairman  my time is up  but I appreciate the responses of Secretary Gates  I look forward to getting your responses on those   Thank you
