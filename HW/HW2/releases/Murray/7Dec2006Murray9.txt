                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Senator Murray Warns that Republicans  Failure to Pass Funding Bills Will Delay Hanford Cleanup and the Fight Against Meth and Gangs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Murray  Senator Murray Warns that Republicans  Failure to Pass Funding Bills Will Delay Hanford Cleanup and the Fight Against Meth and Gangs  12 07 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray Warns that Republicans  Failure to Pass Funding Bills Will Delay Hanford Cleanup and the Fight Against Meth and Gangs Murray also Warns that Airline Safety  Highway Safety  and the Fight Against Terrorism Will be Hurt by Republican Obstruction    For Immediate Release  Thursday  December 7  2006     Washington  D C      In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  stood up for Washington state communities who will be hurt if Republicans continue to block passage of the annual spending bills         The Republican s mismanagement will hurt priorities in my home state of Washington from the fight against drugs and gangs to the cleanup effort at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation   Murray said    When Congress doesn t do its job here in the Capitol  it makes it harder for all Americans to do their jobs    whether it s teaching our children  providing healthcare  improving transportation  or making our communities safer           Murray has secured critical funding for Washington state priorities in a series of Senate appropriations bills  but Republicans want to adjourn the Senate for the year without passing these important bills   The Senate session will end tomorrow   Unless Republicans change course  the Senate will adopt a continuing resolution until February 2007   That resolution will delay the increased funding that Murray has secured and would put Murray s funding at risk next year        Murray noted that all of the bills have ready to move forward since July  but the Republican leadership is still refusing to let them move forward          Never in my fourteen years in the Senate have we started a new fiscal year with so little progress in the Senate in passing the Appropriations bills and funding these critical functions of government   Murray said         Hanford Cleanup    In the Senate Energy and Water bill  which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee  Murray secured critical funding for the Hanford cleanup  including  690 million for the Vit plant   If Republicans continue to refuse to pass a free standing Energy and Water bill for Fiscal Year 2007  Murray s funding will be delayed  hurting progress on this and other projects at the site   It is not yet known how much Hanford would receive if Republicans pass a continuing resolution that would run until February 2007         Our government has an obligation to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland  Washington   Murray said    As I speak  that community is working hard to clean up nuclear waste and protect the community and the environment   Here in the Senate  I ve fought for the funding we need to keep the clean up moving forward   But now Republicans are refusing to move the Energy and Water bill forward   As a result  funding for Hanford will be delayed and that means the cleanup will take longer and cost more money   The Republican leadership is going to have to explain to the people I represent in the Tri Cities and throughout Washington state why Hanford funding is being delayed   Republicans will have to answer for their failure to act on these and other priorities        Methamphetamine Initiative    Murray warned that Republicans  refusal to act will hurt Washington s anti meth efforts         If you sit down with law enforcement officers in my home state  as I have  they will tell you that we are facing a methamphetamine epidemic   Murray said    Meth is destroying families and communities  and law enforcement needs more help to deal with it   Over the past few years  I ve worked to provide funding each year for the Washington State Meth Initiative   It s a coordinated  statewide effort that focuses on cleanup  treatment  prevention and law enforcement   It is also a model for other states  Again  this year in the Senate bill  I got a commitment to support my state s Meth Initiative   But now that funding will be delayed    and put in jeopardy    because Senate Republicans have refused to do their job and pass the Commerce  Justice State spending bill   Because Republican Senators are not doing their job  they re going to make it harder for police in my state to do their jobs  and that s just wrong        Gang Task Force    Yakima    Murray also explained how anti gang efforts in the Yakima Valley will be hurt by Republican inaction         The Republican s failure to act will also delay and put at risk support for an anti gang program in the Yakima Valley   Murray said    On October 16th  I was in Yakima at the police department for a meeting with two dozen local officials  law enforcement and prosecutors   They told me about the challenges they re facing  and the top issues on their list were meth and gangs   I heard their message  and I ve fought for a commitment in the Senate to support a community based gang task force   That funding is needed immediately   Now I have to go back to Yakima and tell those hard working leaders that the funding I got was delayed    and put at risk    because Republicans don  t want to do their jobs and pass the annual spending bills   The people in my state deserve better          Finally  Senator Murray noted that if Republicans push for a continuing resolution for the entire Fiscal Year 2007  it will prevent the FAA from hiring the air traffic controllers and safety inspectors that are needed   It will also hurt efforts to reverse a recent increase in highway fatalities       Senator Murray s full remarks follow     Mr  President  families across the country will be hurt because this Republican Congress has not done its job   We ve heard this session of Congress described as the  Do Nothing  Congress   And it s certainly earned that title  but there is one thing that people should understand          When Congress doesn t do its job here in the Capitol  it makes it harder for all Americans to do their jobs    whether it s teaching our children  providing healthcare  improving transportation  or making our communities safer          This may seem like a debate over the process in the Senate  but it affects you         If you fly on an airplane and are concerned about your safety    it affects you       If you drive on a highway and are concerned about traffic congestion    it affects you        If you want our government to stop the flow of money to terrorist organizations    it affects you       Today I want to share a few examples of how average families will be hurt because the Senate Republican leadership has not done its job          And I want to point out how it will hurt priorities in my home state of Washington from the fight against drugs and gangs to the cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation   The Republican s failure this year will make it harder for us to our jobs next year   And that is a terrible legacy for the Republican Leadership to leave our country       An Annual Responsibility   Mr  President  every year  Congress must pass the annual spending bills that fund our government   We work hard on those bills   We craft them so that they meet the needs that our constituents tell us about on everything from healthcare to transportation to education     Sometimes it takes a while to finish those bills  but we get them done  and the country is able to move forward          But this year has been different   We did our work on the Appropriations Committee  but then the Senate Republican Leadership blocked our progress   I serve on the Appropriations Committee and we did our job  on time  in a bipartisan manner   Back in July    under the leadership of Senators Cochran and Byrd  we completed work on all 11 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate floor   And here s what s really impressive    every single Senator on the committee voted to report each and every bill        But since then  the Senate Republican Leadership blocked our progress   They decided to only let 3 of those 11 bills move forward    Defense  Homeland Security  and Military Construction   Those bills cover extremely important functions of our government  but they are just three of 11  What about the needs of our communities   What about the needs of our schools  our colleges  and our universities   What about our support of health research   Or investing in our infrastructure   Or meeting the needs of our farmers and ranchers   Or the needs of law enforcement   These are critical needs  but the Senate Republican Leadership decided this past summer to put them on the back burner        Never in my fourteen years in the Senate have we started a new fiscal year with so little progress in the Senate in passing the Appropriations bills and funding these critical functions of government   Nine weeks ago  as we entered the new fiscal year     I expressed my disappointment that we were recessing for the elections without at least moving these Appropriations bills to conference   I always thought the Senate Republican Leadership would eventually finish its work this session    But they made a different choice        It is now December 7th   We have not seen one additional funding bill clear the Senate   We are now hearing talk that the Republican Leadership may formally adjourn the Senate by the end of this week    with most of the eleven Appropriations bills never sent to the President          I think it s worth remembering what happened the last time there was a major shift in power back in November of 2002   I was serving at the time as Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee   After the election  the Appropriations process was not yet complete  but Democrats still sought to fulfill our responsibility by moving bills on the Floor and sending them to conference    Unfortunately  Mr  President  we were blocked from completing our job   The Republican Leadership  that was due to come into the majority in January of 2003  prohibited us from moving forward with these bills   They decided that they wanted to complete the Appropriations process when they were in control          This year  Democrats are taking a different approach  We should complete the appropriations process now because it s important to American families and communities   We are already more than two months into the new fiscal year   And the American people are paying a price for these delays    Democrats are willing to complete this process under Republican control because we believe the American people have waited long enough   Unfortunately  the Republican Leadership still hasn t gotten the message   American families are going to pay the price for this negligence       Different from a Continuing Resolution   Some Senators have suggested that if we simply pass a continuing resolution for the entire fiscal year  everything is going to be fine   Some claim that there is no real difference between passing the bills we have worked so hard to put together and just putting our Government on autopilot for a full year   There is a difference          This country is going to pay a price in airline safety  Under a full year CR  we ll only be able to hire half the air traffic controllers we need  And we won t be able to hire the air traffic safety inspectors we need  We are going to pay a price in highway safety because we are not going to be able to reverse the recent increase in traffic fatalities         We are going to pay a price in the fight against terrorism  We are not going to be able to fund the Treasury Department s efforts to stop terrorist financing         We are going to pay a price in educating our kids  improving our communities  and training our workforce    Almost everywhere you look  we are going to pay a price if the Republican leadership fails to do its job       Washington State Impact   The Republican s mismanagement will hurt priorities in my home state of Washington from the fight against drugs and gangs to the cleanup effort at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation       Meth   If you sit down with law enforcement officers in my home state    as I have    they will tell you that we are facing a methamphetamine epidemic   Meth is destroying families and communities  and law enforcement needs more help to deal with it   Over the past few years  I ve worked to provide funding each year for the Washington State Meth Initiative   It s a coordinated  statewide effort that focuses on cleanup  treatment  prevention and law enforcement   It is also a model for other states         Again  this year in the Senate bill  I got a commitment to support my state s Meth Initiative   But now that funding will be delayed    and put in jeopardy    because Senate Republicans have refused to do their job and pass the Commerce  Justice State spending bill   Because Republican Senators are not doing their job  they re going to make it harder for police in my state to do their jobs  and that s just wrong       Fighting Gangs   The Republican s failure to act will also delay    and put at risk    support for an anti gang program in the Yakima Valley   On October 16th  I was in Yakima at the police department for a meeting with two dozen local officials  law enforcement and prosecutors   They told me about the challenges they re facing  and the top issues on their list were meth and gangs   I heard their message  and I ve fought for a commitment in the Senate to support a community based gang task force   That funding is needed immediately  Now I have to go back to Yakima and tell those hard working leaders that the funding I got was delayed    and put at risk    because Republicans don  t want to do their jobs and pass the annual spending bills   The people in my state deserve better        Hanford   Let me offer another example of how the Republicans  failure to do their job is hurting my state    Our government has an obligation to clean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland  Washington   As I speak  that community is working hard to clean up nuclear waste and protect the community and the environment          Here in the Senate  I ve fought for the funding we need to keep the clean up moving forward   But now Republicans are refusing to move the Energy and Water bill forward   As a result  funding for Hanford will be delayed and that means the cleanup will take longer and cost more money   The Republican leadership is going to have to explain to the people I represent in the Tri Cities and throughout Washington state why Hanford funding is being delayed   Republicans will have to answer for their failure to act on these and other priorities       Conclusion   Mr  President  it didn  t have to be this way   Rather than spending the month of July and September debating unrelated bills for political reasons  we could have been debating these appropriations bills that are critically needed for the Nation s safety and security   We could have been fighting for the people we represent  We could have been meeting their basic needs  protecting their livelihoods  and ensuring their safety   But the Republican leadership said no  and now our families are paying a price    I think the Senate deserves better  but more importantly  the people we represent deserve better
