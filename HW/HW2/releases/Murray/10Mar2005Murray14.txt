cuts  caps and shifts in costs    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 10  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today joined Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee in succeeding to put the Committee on the record in opposition to arbitrary cuts and caps to Medicaid   The Senators obtained a bi partisan   sense of the Senate   agreement which puts the Senate a step closer to protecting Medicaid  s commitment to providing health insurance to tens of millions of Americans and renews the focus on the importance of protecting this important program         Senator Murray joined Senators Corzine  D NJ   Wyden  D OR   and Johnson  D SD  in securing the   sense of the Senate   amendment to the 2006 Senate Budget Resolution which states that the budget should not                cap federal Medicaid spending  or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to state or local governments  their taxpayers and health providers  forcing a reduction in access to essential health care services              The Senate Republican Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution calls for almost  15 billion in federal Medicaid cuts over the next five years   The President  s budget proposal called for cuts of  7 6 billion  as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office            At a time when Washington state and others across the country are struggling to meet soaring health care costs  we should not be playing games with a program that helps ensure coverage to our most vulnerable residents     Murray said     The guarantee of health insurance that Medicaid provides is a solemn commitment    I hope today  s action moves us closer to preserving that commitment for years to come   I will continue to fight to protect Medicaid as the budget process moves forward             Last week in a letter  Murray and her Democratic women colleagues urged the Budget Committee leaders not to cut or cap Medicaid in the fiscal year 2006 budget   The program  which provides care to millions of Americans  is especially beneficial to women                Given the importance of providing care to our most vulnerable citizens and the increased economic burden that cuts or caps on Medicaid would put on the states  we urge you to oppose cuts or caps to Medicaid     the Senators wrote         Details of the Sense of the Senate amendment are included below        Democratic Medicaid Amendment to the FY2006 Budget     Amendment by Senators Corzine  Wyden  Murray  and Johnson Purpose  To express the sense of the Senate that any Finance Committee reconciliation bill should not achieve spending reductions that undermine Medicaid  s role in our nation  s health care system  cap federal Medicaid spending  or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to state or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers  or undermine the federal guarantee of health insurance coverage Medicaid provides        SEC  ___  SENSE OF THE SENATE         a  FINDINGS    The Senate makes the following findings          1  The Medicaid program provides essential health care and long term care services to more than 50 000 000 low income children  pregnant women  parents  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens  It is a Federal guarantee that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed medical services         2  Medicaid provides critical access to long term care and other services for the elderly and individuals living with disabilities  and is the single largest provider of long term care services  Medicaid also pays for personal care and other supportive services that are typically not provided by private health insurance or Medicare  but are necessary to enable individuals with spinal cord injuries  developmental disabilities  neurological degenerative diseases  serious and persistent mental illnesses  HIV AIDS  and other chronic conditions to remain in the community  to work  and to maintain independence         3  Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for more than 6 000 000 low income elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries  assisting them with their Medicare premiums and co insurance  wrap around benefits  and the costs of nursing home care that Medicare does not cover  The Medicaid program spent nearly  40 000 000 000 on uncovered Medicare services in 2002         4  Medicaid provides health insurance for more than one quarter of America s children and is the largest purchaser of maternity care  paying for more than one third of all the births in the United States each year  Medicaid also provides critical access to care for children with disabilities  covering more than 70 percent of poor children with disabilities         5  More than 16 million women depend on Medicaid for their health care  Women comprise the majority of seniors  71 percent  on Medicaid  Half of nonelderly women with permanent mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through Medicaid  Medicaid provides treatment for low income women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State         6  Medicaid is the Nation s largest source of payment for mental health services  HIV AIDS care  and care for children with special needs  Much of this care is either not covered by private insurance or limited in scope or duration  Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care for children in foster care and for health services in schools         7  Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all Americans  Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue for the Nation s safety net hospitals  health centers  and nursing homes  and is critical to the ability of these providers to adequately serve all Americans         8  Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the number of Americans without health insurance  approximately 45 000 000 in 2003  is not substantially higher  The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in response to unmet needs  enabling Medicaid to help buffer the drop in private coverage during recessions  More than 4 800 000 Americans lost employer sponsored coverage between 2000 and 2003  during which time Medicaid enrolled an additional 8 400 000 Americans        b  SENSE OF THE SENATE    It is the sense of the Senate that the Finance Committee shall not report a reconciliation bill that achieves spending reductions that would          1  undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a critical component of the health care system of the United States         2  cap federal Medicaid spending  or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to state or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers  forcing a reduction in access to essential health services for low income elderly individuals  individuals with disabilities  and children and families  or        3  undermine the federal guarantee of health insurance coverage Medicaid provides  which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the United States  but the entire health care system
