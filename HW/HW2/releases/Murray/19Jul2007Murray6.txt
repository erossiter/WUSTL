                                                                      News Release          Senator Murray Adds Critical Funding for Washington State Agriculture Research    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 19  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  included funding for a variety of Washington state agricultural research projects in the annual Senate Agriculture spending bill  The funding was included in the Senate Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration Appropriations bill  which passed the full Senate Appropriations Committee today  Senator Murray is a member of the Appropriations Committee     In a tough budget atmosphere  I am pleased to have been able to help invest in the science and technology advances that Washington state farmers rely on to stay competitive  said Senator Murray  This funding will go toward enhancing the health  production  and sustainability of the crops grown in our state  From wheat and potato grower to wine producers  our state s farmers need this funding for the innovations that protect and grow their crops in a challenging economic climate  The bill will now go to the full Senate for consideration  In the bill  Senator Murray added funding for the following Agriculture programs in Washington state  Wine Grape Foundation Block     300 000  It is critical that vineyards are virus free for national and international markets  This research will reduce the likelihood of virus transmission within the industry  Asparagus Technology and Production     200 000  Half of the current asparagus production costs are composed of labor costs associated with the harvesting of the product  These funds will ensure research and development of technologies to reduce the cost of asparagus production  Organic Cropping  WA      300 000  There is a rising demand for organic products  but foreign competitors with lower labor costs are putting organic producers at risk  This funding will provide research  development and dissemination of organic best management practices in the Northwest and other steps to retain the U S  competitive advantage in this marketplace  Competitiveness of Agriculture Products     350 000  Agriculture is increasingly dependent on global markets  and improving the competitiveness of U S  exports in the global marketplace is important to the long term health of the agricultural sector  This research will help better understand the changing global agricultural trade environment  Aegilops Cylindrica Biomass  WA  ID      200 000  Aegilops cylindrical is a grassy plant with potential as an alternative crop and a suitable fuel feedstock for biomass production  and this funding will develop the potential of this feedstock which would require low inputs  to be efficient in water usage  and be resistant to pests and disease  Potato Research     750 000  This research focuses on the development of new potato varieties with better disease resistance  enhanced nutrition  higher yields  and other improvements  PM 10  Study  WA      150 000  Air quality impairments related to agriculture can result in health risks for individuals and economic hardships for producers  This funding will help develop farming systems to reduce the threat of these particles  Cool Season Legume Research  ID  WA  ND      250 000  This research project focuses on the genetic identification of superior characteristics in legumes  nematode  insect  and disease management  soil erosion and water quality  and market and product development  Grass Seed Cropping for a Sustainable Agriculture     150 000  The grass seed industry is based in rural communities and contributes to the economic well being of these communities  but the industry is facing some critical environmental and economic challenges  including  public pressure to phase out open field burning  and alleviation of smoke  dust  and chemical trespass from crop production areas  This research will develop new grass seed cropping systems that meet environmental regulations and are economically viable for farmers  Northwest Center for Small Fruit Research     300 000  The primary goal of the Northwest Center for Small Fruit Research is to enhance the profitability and sustainability of the small fruits industry in the Pacific Northwest and this funding will provide peer reviewed and competitively awarded small fruits research  Senator Murray also restored over  6 5 million in proposed Bush Administration cuts for Agricultural Research Service  ARS  projects in the Northwest  including   Microbial Genomics  WSU Institute of Genomic Research   This research will reduce the loss of cattle  sheep  goats  bison and horses to infectious diseases and safeguard against import export restrictions  Malignant Catarrhal Fever  Research will help provide solutions to the diagnosis and control of this disease  which is carried by sheep bit is highly fatal when transferred to cattle  bison  and other exotic animals in national zoos  Winter Grain Legume Plant Geneticist Position  This position will ensure continued research into winter legume breeding to develop high yielding varieties of dry peas  lentils and chickpeas in the Pacific Northwest  Minor Use Pesticides  IR4   Wapato   This project will increase the available information on pesticides for minor crop growers to enable higher quality crop growth  Potato Research Enhancement  This research will help develop new potato varieties that have improved nutritional value and are resistant to disease  National Germplasm Resources Program  This program will ensure that our agriculture industry has a safe and adequate supply of new seed resources  Potato Breeding  Research on potato breeding will result in new varieties that are of higher yield and quality  and are disease  pest  and stress resistant  Shellfish Genetics  This project will develop technologies to improve the genetic lines of shellfish  which will help keep the Washington state oyster industry competitive  Hops Research  This research will produce new hop varieties that are disease and pest resistant  and ensure the continued success of Washingtons hop industry  Wheat Quality Research  Research will produce genetically improved wheat for end use  which will result in higher quality food products and a safe food supply  Virus Free Fruit Tree Cultivars  This research will test and identify viral diseases in fruit trees so that viruses can be combated  helping to ensure better tree fruit products for consumers  Root Diseases in Wheat and Barley  This project will develop biologically based methods of root disease control in wheat  barely  and biofuels that are sustainable  environmentally friendly  and minimize off farm inputs  Regional Molecular Genotyping  Club Wheat   Research will close the gap between molecular information and applying that information to improve wheat  barley and oats  Air Quality  PM 10   This research will assist in developing farming practices that allow for the control of wind erosion and dust emissions while monitoring and controlling air particulates 10 microns in diameter and smaller  Minor Use Pesticides  Research will ensure safe and effective crop protection for chemicals and biological alternatives for use on specialty crops  Temperate Fruit Flies  This project will develop new methods to manage fruit flies that are pests of temperate fruit tree crops  Wheat Stripe Initiative  Emerging Diseases of Livestock and Crops   Research will help reduce rust diseases  which are air borne pathogens that can case grain yield losses  Viticulture Research  This research will help ensure that wine grape growers have continually updated knowledge of various crop management issues to ensure sustainable grape production systems  Grain Legume Plant Pathologist Position  Pullman  WA  This position will ensure continued research on diseases of pulse crops and help improve varieties of dry peas  lentils and chickpeas  Northwest Small Fruits Research  This program conducts research on variety development and evaluates new varieties to help the Pacific Northwest growers sustain competitive growth in the world market  Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  Research on BSE will assure the success of the current control and eradication programs to protect our food supply and maintain a healthy cattle industry
