C     In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  warned that unless the Senate passes a Joint Funding Resolution  Americans will see painful cuts to housing  highway safety  aviation safety  pipeline safety  and highway construction   Murray quoted U S  Transportation Secretary Mary Peters  who told Murray last week that these cuts would have  drastic consequences         Murray noted that the Federal Aviation Administration would be forced to furlough all air traffic controllers and all air safety inspectors for two weeks unless the Joint Funding Resolution is approved   In addition  critical housing programs for low income families would be cut   leaving hundreds of thousands of vulnerable individuals without housing   Highway safety and construction projects would also face cuts             Murray called on the Senate to pass House Joint Resolution 20  the Joint Funding Resolution  before the current funding bill expires on February 15th   Murray spoke against suggestions by some Senators that instead the Senate should pass a Continuing Resolution that continues funding at last year s levels  which would impose the cuts that Murray warned about        Murray chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development   Related Agencies   On Thursday   at the subcommittee s first hearing of the year         Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise in strong support of House Joint Resolution 20   the Joint Funding Resolution for the current fiscal year   If we don t pass this bipartisan bill  the safety of American citizens could put in danger   Without this bill  air traffic controllers will be furloughed  and air safety inspectors will be furloughed   If we don t pass this bipartisan bill  we will see a decline in our ability to provide railroad inspections  pipeline safety inspections  and truck safety inspections        We will also feel the consequences in the area of housing   If we don t pass this bill  hundreds of thousands of Americans will face a housing crisis         157 000 low income people could lose their housing      70 000 people could lose their housing vouchers      11 500 housing units that are housing the homeless could be lost       Mr  President  those are just of the consequences that Americans will face if this Congress fails to pass the Joint Funding Resolution   But don t take my word for it   On Thursday  I held a hearing with President Bush s very able Secretary of Transportation  Mary Peters   Secretary Peters is not a newcomer to the Transportation field   She has spent her entire career working to ensure safety and execute infrastructure projects  largely in the State of Arizona   She also served as the Federal Highway Administrator       Unless We Pass H R  Res 20  Safety Will be Compromised    Secretary Peters told us in very clear terms how safety would be affected if we fail to pass this Joint Funding Resolution   Let me share her exact words   from just a few days ago  Secretary Peters told the Senate  quote           I f we were funded at the  06 levels       it would have drastic consequences  not only at the FAA  but as you mentioned within other safety programs  such as our rail safety programs  our truck inspection programs and of course the air traffic controllers and inspectors at maintenance facilities for the aviation community        Mr  President  the Bush Administration s transportation secretary is warning us of  drastic consequences  if we fail to pass this bill   Let s talk about those consequences   I asked Secretary Peters what it would mean for safety and hiring if Congress does not pass the Joint Funding Resolution   She said          W e will see a serious decline in the number of safety inspectors  truck safety inspectors  rail safety inspectors  aviation inspectors across the broad range in our program    That s directly from the President s transportation secretary          Does any Senator want to be responsible for voting for a  serious decline  in the number of truck safety inspectors  rail safety inspectors  and aviation safety inspectors   How would you explain to your constituents that you voted to undermine their safety as they travel by car  train or plane   You couldn t say that you didn t know how your vote would hurt safety because we have the very clear warnings from the Transportation Secretary   So the first reason we need to pass this Joint Funding Resolution is to keep critical safety inspectors on the job   protecting the American people as they re doing today       Unless We Pass H J  Res 20  State Highway Construction Will Stall    We also need to pass the Joint Funding Resolution because  without it  states will not be able address their most pressing highway  bridge and road problems   In fact  Secretary Peters warned that some states could miss an entire construction season if Congress does not enact this bill soon   She said that state transportation commissioners need to know how much money will be available to them this year        Secretary Peters said   It is especially important to those states who have a construction season that will be upon us very  very shortly  and if they are not able to know that this funding is coming and be able to let contracts accordingly we could easily miss an entire construction season         So your constituents will feel the impact of your vote in roads that are fixed or roads that remain clogged  congested and unsafe   Those are just a few of the safety consequences if this Congress fails to pass the bipartisan Joint Funding Resolution         Housing  Unless We Pass H J  Res 20  Housing Will Suffer    The failure to pass H  J  Res  20 will also have a painful impact on housing for hundreds of thousands of Americans   In this bipartisan bill  we worked hard to make sure that vulnerable families would not be thrown out on the streets or face out of reach rent increases   We provided some critical support for Section 8  Homeless Assistance Grants  Housing Equity Conversion Loans  HOPE VI  and the Public Housing Operating Fund        For Section 8 project based assistance  this spending resolution provides an increase of  939 million over the FY 2006 level   It provides  300 million over the President s 2007 budget request   This is essential to preserve affordable housing for 157 000 low income households    Without this increase  many of these low income residents will become homeless  will be displaced or will face unaffordable rent increases          For Section 8 tenant based assistance  this spending resolution provides an increase of  502 million  equal to the President s 2007 budget request  to continue to renew expiring vouchers   Without this increase  more than 70 000 housing vouchers will be lost   That means residents may become homeless  displaced  or forced into overcrowded housing        For Homeless Assistance Grants  this funding resolution provides an increase of  115 million to meet expiring contracts for homeless individuals and families   Without this increase  as many as 11 500 units will not be renewed  forcing these homeless individuals and families back onto the street        The joint resolution also helps thousands of seniors to stay in their home by supporting Housing Equity Conversion Loans  HECM    Currently  90 percent of all reverse mortgages for the elderly fall under this guarantee program   Without this language  this popular program with shut down   hurting the ability of thousands of elderly individuals and couples to remain in their homes and pay for other critical living expenses        This Joint Resolution extends the authorization for the HOPE VI program  which is helping us to knock down the most deteriorated public housing units and replace them with new  safe housing units  If this bill is not adopted  not a single dollar will go out for this popular program for the remainder of this year        Finally  this resolution will help housing authorities meet their soaring expenses   This resolution supports the Public Housing Operating Fund   It provides an increase of  300 million over the 2006 level to meet the tremendous shortfalls being face by public housing authorities when it comes to meeting increased energy costs and provide necessary security to prevent crime         Recently  more than 700 public housing authorities have announced layoffs   According to HUD  without this increase  public housing authorities will receive only 76 percent of their true operating needs in FY 2007   So the consequences would be severe for vulnerable families if this Congress does not pass the Joint Funding Resolution       A Bipartisan Bill    Mr  President  I want to step back and share how we developed this bipartisan bill and how we worked to make sure that critical needs are not overlooked   Today  every agency in the Federal Government with the exception of the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security are operating under a continuing resolution that freezes almost every federal program at last year s level   If a program isn t frozen at last year s level  it is operating at a level consistent with the cuts adopted by the House of Representatives last year     So  at present  almost all of our Federal agencies are operating under a funding formula that makes no accommodations for the true needs of our agencies or the true needs of the American people    That means we re not addressing critical education needs  health needs  the needs of our veterans  the needs of law enforcement  transportation  housing  you name it         The current continuing resolution expires on February 15th   The time has now come for the Congress to stand up to its responsibility and implement a spending bill that meets the needs of the American people   That bill is H J  Res 20          The bill passed the House of Representatives by a more than 2 to 1 margin   And the time has come for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility    H J  Res 20 was developed by the both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees on a bipartisan basis    The Joint Funding Resolution  for the most part  freezes programs across the government at their 2006 funding level         Safety Funding    Importantly  however  the bill also makes necessary funding adjustments to deal with critical programs that cannot and should not endure a funding freeze   In the case of the Transportation Department  we were not about to ignore our responsibility to ensure safety in our skies  on our highways and on our railways   The bill provides funding increases totaling more than a quarter billion dollars to ensure that there are adequate numbers of personnel to control air traffic  as well as inspect and enforce safety rules governing commercial airliners  trucks  railroads and pipelines          Without this additional funding  the FAA Administrator told us that she would be required to put every air traffic controller and every aviation inspector on the street for two weeks without pay between now and the end of September         Amtrak   The Joint Funding Resolution currently before the Senate also boosts funding for AMTRAK to  1 3 billion   Under the current Continuing Resolution  AMTRAK s funding would remain  200 million lower than it was last year   That would endanger passenger rail service across the country as well as the annual maintenance expenses that must be made to ensure safe operations in the Northeast Corridor         Highway Funding    Finally the bill pending before the Senate provides an additional  3 75 billion in formula funding for our nation s highway and transit systems   That funding will serve to create almost 160 thousand new jobs  while alleviating congestion   It will be an important infusion of cash to the States to help them address their most pressing bridge replacements  highway widenings  and safety enhancements   When you look at all the highway needs across my State of Washington  the additional  71 million the State will receive is urgently needed and can be put to work right away          Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that a table provided to me by the Federal Highway Administration that displays the highway funding increases that will be enjoyed by each and every state be included in the record at this point         A Continuing Resolution is NOT the Same as the Joint Funding Resolution    Now  some of our Senate colleagues have suggested that we should not adopt the new Joint Funding Resolution   Instead  they have advocated that we extend the existing CR through the remainder of the year    They are saying that we should forgo these desperately needed funds for highways and transit   They are saying that we should allow the FAA to furlough all its safety personnel for two weeks   They are saying that we should allow our aviation  truck  railroad and pipeline inspection workforce to dwindle         We Must Pass this Bill    If we want to keep air traffic controllers on the job  we need to pass this bill   If we want to keep air safety inspectors on the job  we need to pass this bill   If we want to keep highway  pipeline and truck inspections on track  we need to pass this bill   If we want to help our states address their most urgent bridge  road and highway problems  we need to pass this bill   If we want to keep vulnerable families from losing their housing  we need to pass this bill   The consequences are high  and that s why I urge my colleagues to support the Joint Funding Resolution
