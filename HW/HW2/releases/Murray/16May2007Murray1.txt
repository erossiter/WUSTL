Wednesday  May 16  2007      Senator Murray questions Dr  Kussman        Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  questioned Dr  Michael J  Kussman  Acting Undersecretary of Veterans Affairs  VA  for Health  about his role in exaggerated reports of past VA successes  failures to present honest funding needs  and the awarding of controversial bonuses at a time when the VA continues to fail veterans  Murray s questioning comes as the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee considers Kussman s nomination as Undersecretary of Health at the VA          Unfortunately  based on our experiences with VA leadership over the past few years  I have serious doubts about the level of frankness we can expect from a VA that has tried to minimize the cost  both in money and in lives  of this war   said Senator Murray   I am looking to find somebody in this position that we can trust and who will bring about a culture of change  If we are not getting accurate information  if we are being told a happy picture and not getting the reality  we cannot serve our nation s veterans         Murray has worked to provide oversight and funding to VA health programs including helping to lead a historic joint committee hearing on health care transition from the DOD to VA  and increasing the nation s investment in VA care by more than  3 5 billion in the 2008 Senate Budget Resolution and  1 8 billion in the Emergency Supplemental bill that the President vetoed         Senator Murray s opening remarks from today s hearing follow         Senator Murray s opening statement       Thank you very much for holding this important hearing on the nomination of Dr  Kussman to be Under Secretary of Health at the Veterans Health Administration  VHA         This is an Important Job at a Critical Time   It goes without saying that the position for which Dr  Kussman has been nominated is critically important  both  to the millions of veterans who rely on the VA for their healthcare and to the thousands of hard working VA employees who care for our veterans         Dr  Kussman has Experience   If we based this nomination on Dr  Kussman s resume alone  there is a good chance that he would already be confirmed  I don t think many people will argue that Dr  Kussman lacks the experience  or the education  to qualify him for this position  In fact  his nomination  as all of my colleagues know  was vetted by a ten member search commission that consisted of representatives of the VA  DoD  private sector medical groups  and veterans service organizations         But with our nation at war and more than 1 5 million service members who have been deployed overseas  we can t go by resume alone  It is now more important than ever to fill the VA s top health position with someone who  in addition to being eminently qualified  will         provide Congress with honest and candid assessments of the VA s challenges  and       stand up to this Administration  which has placed politics above the needs of our veterans too many times        VA Faces Challenges   Dr  Kussman has been nominated to the top VA health position at a time of great difficulty for the VA  The system is stretched to the limit trying to care for new veterans  while also serving existing veterans  Our Vietnam veterans are getting older  and many of them will be seeking care for age related conditions at the same time that more and more of our newest veterans will be needing care for the wounds they suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan         At the same time the VA struggles to address these issues  it must also         work with DoD to improve the seamless transition process       reduce waiting times for veterans seeking care at VA healthcare facilities       expand access to mental health services  and      address care for patients with TBI        And those are just the healthcare challenges  to say nothing of the benefit backlog and other issues affecting the rest of the VA         This brewing storm will require serious planning and unfiltered honesty from the VA  so that Congress can provide the resources and the oversight necessary to ensure that our veterans receive high quality healthcare in a timely and affordable manner        My Concerns   Unfortunately  based on our experiences with VA leadership over the past few years  I have serious doubts about the level of frankness we can expect from a VA that has tried to minimize the cost  both in money and in lives  of this war         We haven t been able to get straight answers or real numbers out of the VA  The GAO has found   in report after report   that VA has misled Congress  concealed funding problems  and based it s projections on inaccurate models          More recently  we learned from a McClatchy news report that the VA has repeatedly exaggerated the past successes of the VA medical system  This must change        We also haven t been able to get responses to our inquiries in a timely manner  Over the past several years  I have witnessed the VA transform itself into an agency that guards information like a mother bear guarding its young  It recently took the VA three months to respond to questions I submitted at a hearing in February  This must change        Bonuses   With all these challenges  the VA keeps doing things that undermine our confidence in its leadership   Recently  we learned that VA officials received bonuses   while veterans faced backlogs for benefits   Just yesterday  the Associated Press reported that    Nearly two dozen officials who received hefty performance bonuses last year at the Veterans Affairs Department also sat on the boards charged with recommending the payments     That strikes me as a conflict of interest  and I plan to ask Dr  Kussman about it this morning        Mr  Chairman  aside from the VA Secretary himself  there is perhaps no more important position affecting the health and well being of our nation s veterans than the Under Secretary of Health  Decisions made by the Under Secretary affect how long a patient has to wait to receive care  the quality of the care provided  and many other areas   I look forward to hearing from Dr  Kussman regarding these very important issues  and I welcome the testimony from our witnesses on the first panel
