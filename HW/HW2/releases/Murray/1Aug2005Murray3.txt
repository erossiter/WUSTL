                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  In Bremerton  Murray Announces Win for Ferries  08 01 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          In Bremerton  Murray Announces Win for Ferries Additional Funding Will Create Jobs and Invest in Washington s Ferry System    For Immediate Release  Monday  August 1  2005     Bremerton  WA     Today in Bremerton  U S  Senator Patty Murray joined with local leaders to announce that she has doubled the federal funding for ferry systems nationwide over the next five years   The increased funding at the federal level will mean more dollars will be available for states like Washington over the next five years   The funding will be used for capital investments including new vessels  new terminals  and upgraded facilities   The victory follows Murray s two year effort to get the federal government to invest in ferries as it invests in other modes of transportation             This new law makes the federal government a stronger partner in ferry systems from coast to coast   Murray said        With ferry use expected to grow in Washington state by 15 percent in the next 6 years  Murray said the funding is critical to prevent gridlock and boost productivity         An overcrowded ferry system is just like an overcrowded highway system   It creates gridlock  delays  and hurts our productivity   This new investment keeps ferry commuters from being forced onto already overcrowded roads and bridges   Murray said    It ensures that communities that depend on ferries to get people to work continue to be productive        Murray also noted that the funding will create jobs         Boat building is a growing industry in our state  and we hope this new law will help create new manufacturing jobs  jobs in boat yards  jobs at ferry terminals  and jobs staffing the boats themselves   Murray said   We know that every dollar spent on transportation is a dollar spent on job creation and economic growth  and that is certainly true when it comes to ferries         Murray  the ranking member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  boosted federal investment in ferry transportation during the reauthorization of the five year surface transportation bill  known as SAFETEA LU   The law increases annual ferry funding over fiscal years 2005 2009 from  38 million in fiscal year 2005 to  67 million in fiscal year 2009         Murray made the announcement at the Bremerton Ferry Terminal  where she was joined by state Transportation Secretary Doug McDonald  Bremerton Mayor Cary Bozeman  Kitsap Transit Director Dick Hayes  Kitsap County Commissioner Chris Endresen  and others        State Transportation  said   Across the Sound  many of our terminals need major work  and that s one of the major reasons this money is so welcome        t he older boats must be replaced  and that s an important piece of modernizing the fleet so it can serve all these communities  and this money will be very helpful for that          We are just beginning to understand the importance of water transportation in this region    said   And I think what we have today is not anywhere near what we could have and the number of people we could be transporting  and I think Senator Murray sees that  I think she s the first person of high elected office in our community that s ever had that vision         Kitsap  said   We re trying to keep the faith with all parts of Senator Murray s vision  We look forward to working with the Senator and her staff as we go forward  I think we re going to get on the same page with all the efforts and all the investment in faster service and have a very good decade from this point forward         Kitsap  said   We are just thrilled with this new infusion of money and this recognition of how important the ferry system is to Kitsap County   To have representation that understands our way of life and our quality of life and the importance of the ferry system  not only to everyone who lives here  but for moving freight and goods through Kitsap County up to the Olympic Peninsula    we really  really appreciate it         Earlier in the day  Murray attended a similar announcement at Seattle s Colman Dock where she was joined by Rep  Rick Larsen      Senator Murray s remarks in Bremerton follow     We are all here today to announce a victory for ferry riders  for jobs  and for Washington s economy   Here in our state  we are lucky to have a world class ferry system  and now    finally the federal government will fund it like a priority        Just a few days ago  Congress passed my proposal to dramatically increase ferry funding   The President is expected to sign that bill into law  and that will be great news for commuters  for manufacturing jobs  for productivity  and for our economy because we will now have more money to use in the coming years to fund our state s ferry system   That will mean new ferries and new jobs       A Multi Year Effort    I began this effort two years ago  when I saw that our ferry system needed more support to meet the growing demand   As I looked into this  I learned that while the federal government supported investments in roads  highways and bridges  it didn t quite know what to make of ferries        Part of the challenge was getting people in our government to understand that for many Americans a ferry is a critical transportation link    connecting them to work  home and recreation   As I started talking to other Senators  I found that many of them who were not from ferry dependent states didn t understand the critical needs of ferry systems across the country        They didn  t know that ferries affect at least 34 states  provide 113 million passenger trips per year  support good manufacturing jobs in our boat building industry  and help relieve congestion and pollution on our roads and highways   So I had my work cut out for me          But  working with Congressman Larsen in the House  and a bipartisan group of senators in the Senate  we wrote a bill we called the Ferry Transportation Enhancement Act   Last year  our bill passed Congress  but never made it to the White House   But we didn t stop there   We used that momentum and that awareness to keep fighting for ferries   As a result  the transportation bill the President will sign includes a new investment in America s ferries       Our Ferries are Critical to Our State   All of us here today recognize that our ferry system is critical to our region and our state   Ever since the   Mosquito Fleet    of the early 1900s  the ferry system of the Puget Sound has been an important means of transportation and part of our cultural identity   And we have a lot to be proud of    Today  Washington State Ferries and private companies operate the largest passenger ferry system in the country   Our passenger ferries carry 26 million passengers and 11 million vehicles every year   By 2009  that number is projected to grow to 30 million passengers and 13 million vehicles         Increased Funding Will Create Jobs   Boost Our Economy   Productivity    Here in our region  we know that a viable ferry system supports economic growth and creates jobs throughout the Puget Sound region  and that  s why today is a day to celebrate   This new law makes the federal government a stronger partner in ferry systems from coast to coast  Over the next five years nationwide  ferry systems will get  285 million in federal money   We will double annual ferry support from  38 million this year to  67 million five years from now   That will do three things        First  it will help us meet the growing demand   Nationwide  ferry traffic is expected to increase by nearly 14 percent over the next 6 years   In our state  it is expected to grow by more than 15 percent    This money will help us make capital investments    that means new vessels  new terminals  and upgraded facilities   This money can also be used to help the State of Washington keep our ferries in good working order        Second  this investment will create jobs   Boat building is a growing industry in our state  and we hope this new law will help create new manufacturing jobs  jobs in boat yards  jobs at ferry terminals  and jobs staffing the boats themselves  We know that every dollar spent on transportation is a dollar spent on job creation and economic growth  and that is certainly true when it comes to ferries        Third  this investment will help our economy and our productivity   An overcrowded ferry system is just like an overcrowded highway system   It creates gridlock  delays  and hurts our productivity   This new investment keeps ferry commuters from being forced onto already overcrowded roads and bridges   And it ensures that communities that depend on ferries to get people to work continue to be productive       Improvements at Southworth  Bainbridge and Mukilteo Ferry Terminals    I am also happy to announce that I was able to secure  5 million for the Southworth Ferry Terminal within the highway reauthorization bill   That funding partnered with Jay Inslee s  2 5 million for the Bainbridge Island Terminal and Congressman Larsen s nearly  5 million for the Mukilteo Ferry Terminal brings home more than  12 million for our ferry terminals       A Partnership    I want to thank all of the people who have helped us reach this day including Transportation Secretary Doug MacDonald and Washington State Ferries particularly Mike Anderson   I also want to thank Mayor Cary Bozeman  Dick Hayes and Kitsap Transit  Kitsap County Commission  the Bremerton City Council  Port of Bremerton  David Porter and the Kitsap EDC  and all the community members and ferry supporters who are with us
