                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Spokane Airport Tower Groundbreaking  02 21 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Spokane Airport Tower Groundbreaking    For Immediate Release  Monday  February 21  2005    Senator Murray spoke at the groundbreaking today for the new Federal Aviation Administration Tower at Spokane International Airport   As the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  Senator Murray was able to secure  13 million for the state of the art air traffic control tower      Senator Murray s remarks follow       Thank you  John   And thank you all for being part of this groundbreaking         Today  we are taking another step forward to grow the economy here in Spokane  and I m proud to be your partner         We all know that the Spokane International Airport is an engine that drives development and jobs for the entire region   Today we are breaking ground to make that engine even stronger  safer  and more productive    This new tower will help residents  businesses and our military at Fairchild   Thank You  Air Traffic Controllers        First  I want pay tribute to the air traffic controllers and other FAA employees here in Spokane   You certainly deserve this new tower and new technology   Every day you guide passengers and our military personnel in and out of Spokane   You help them do what they need to do safely    whether it s visiting family  taking a business trip  or conducting a military mission           As air travel continues to rebound since September 11th  our air traffic controllers are facing more and more challenges on the job   With this new tower  we re giving you the tools you need to be effective   So I want to ask for a round of applause for everyone whose expertise and judgment help keep Spokane International a safe  dynamic airport         And let me just add    I know that the FAA is considering closing air traffic control operations at this tower between midnight and 5 am   Well  I have big questions about that approach   It could undermine our plans to have this airport realize its full potential as an economic engine for the region   That s why    on Thursday    I talked to the FAA Administrator about it   She assured me that no decisions have been made  and they are still evaluating the policy   I told her that she will have one heck of a job convincing me that Spokane needs anything less than 24 hour coverage          I want to thank the airport leaders  the mayor  the council and commissioners  the business community  the contractor  the employees  and everyone who keeps this airport an engine for economic growth         This groundbreaking is about improving safety and improving the economy   The new tower replaces a building designed for the 1960 s with a building that will meet the needs of today and tomorrow   It s more accessible and provides better views of what s happening on the runways and throughout the airport grounds   It s also being built in a way that will allow for future growth and future improvements    so the airport will be able to adapt to new needs down the road         This new tower will help continue Spokane s economic development   It tells the business community that Spokane is a good investment      that Spokane is a place where and entire community comes together to build for the future           This tower tells residents  visitors  and companies that Spokane is  open for business    It will allow you to expand freight and passenger travel   It provides a huge service to Fairchild    which is a critical part of the region s economy   It provides a great service to general aviation  and to the medical community with emergency flights in and out of this airport serving the entire Inland Northwest         At the federal level  I ve worked to invest in your airport   For this tower project  I ve secured nearly  14 million so far   We ve still got more work to do to finance the tower  and I continue to work on it         I ve also worked with you to fund other critical projects at the airport    like the Taxiway   C   Extension Project   I  ve worked with the airport to ensure the Transportation Security Administration creates an effective security system at Spokane to move both people and baggage more rapidly          Beyond the airport  we ve worked together on other local investments to make sure you have a growing economy    from the University District to the North South freeway   It hasn t always been easy to secure these funds   That s because the Administration hasn t asked Congress for them   But I want the White House to recognize what we all recognize    that to keep Spokane business friendly  we need the infrastructure to grow   And together we re providing it   So congratulations on this groundbreaking    it s a great start for Spokane s future
