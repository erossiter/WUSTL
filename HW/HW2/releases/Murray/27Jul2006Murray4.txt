                                                                                                             News Release          Port Security  Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on the Need to Pass the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  S 2459     For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 27  2006    UPDATE  The Senate Passed Senator Murray  s Bill on 9 14 06      Mr  President  we have wasted day after day in the Senate on political issues when we should be making America more secure          Last week  the Majority Leader mentioned port security in a long list of issues to be debated before the August recess   While Senator Frist continues to pay lip service to this important priority  I remain concerned that with only a week left before the August recess we have no firm schedule or commitment to bring this bill to the floor   Unfortunately  I m worried that the while majority says it wants to act  it refuses to put any action behind that rhetoric          And here s the bottom line    if God forbid there is an incident at one of our ports    the fingers will point to this chamber   And people will want to know            Why did the Senate sit on a bill that passed the full House and passed the Senate Homeland Security Committee         Why didn t we make our ports secure when we had the chance        The only thing keeping the GreenLane bill from protecting us is the Senate s failure to take it up   We have to bring up and pass this bill before it s too late        I m here today because nearly five years after 9 11 our country is still vulnerable to a terrorist attack           Just this week  an article in the Seattle Times showed us that our ports are not secure   A reporter was able to enter two West Coast ports just by hiding in trucks that were entering those ports  The reporter walked around cargo containers in areas that are supposed to be secure   In this case  the security gaps appeared to be on the  land side   but as the article notes    an incident at any port    whether from the land or sea side    could shut down all of our ports   Time is not on our side        Each year  six million cargo containers enter U S  seaports   And that number is expected to quadruple in the next twenty years   These cargo containers carry the building blocks of our economy   But without adequate security  they can also provide an opportunity for terrorists to deliver a deadly one two punch to our country   The first punch would create an untold number of American casualties   The second punch would bring our economy to a halt   Today  we are not doing enough to keep America safe         Standing in this Chamber  it can feel like the dangers at our ports are a distant concern   But given that our ports are connected to our nation  s transportation system and are often close to major population centers  the threat is never far away          Mr  President  a recent example makes this threat crystal clear   On March 21st  a container ship called the Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast of Yemen when an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship   Here is a photo of what happened next   About 90 containers were blown off the side of the ship  creating a debris field 5 miles long   Thankfully there were no fatalities  and the crew was rescued    Fortunately  this incident does not appear to be terrorist related   Here s another picture        Now I want you to imagine this same burning ship sitting just a few feet from our shores    in New York harbor or Puget Sound  off the coast of Los Angeles or Charleston  Miami  Portland  Hampton Roads  the Delaware Bay or the Gulf of Mexico   Now imagine that we re not just dealing with a conventional explosion   We re dealing with a dirty bomb that has exploded on America s shores       After an Incident   Let me walk through what would happen next   First  there would be an immediate loss of life   Many of our ports are located near major cities   If a nuclear device exploded at a major port  up to 1 million people could be killed   If this was a chemical weapon exploding in Seattle  the chemical plume could contaminate the rail system  Interstate 5 and SeaTac Airport  not to mention the entire downtown business and residential district   At the port  there would be tremendous confusion   People would try to contain the fire  but it s unclear who  if anyone  would be in charge        Then when word spreads that it s a dirty bomb  panic would likely set in   There would be chaos as first responders try to react  and residents try to flee         Next  our government would shut down every port in America to make sure there weren t other bombs on other containers in other cities   That shutdown would be the equivalent of driving our economy into a brick wall   It could even spark a global recession   Day by day  we d feel the painful economic impact of the attack   American factories would not be able to get the supplies they need   They would shut their doors and lay off workers   Stores around the country would not be able to get the products they need to stock their shelves   Prices for these goods would spike  as demand began to outweigh the supply   And consumers would not be able afford the items they rely on every day   In 2002  we saw what the closure of a few ports on the West Coast would do   It cost our economy about  1 billion a day   Imagine if we shut down all our ports   One study concluded that if U S  ports were shut down for just 9 days  it would cost our economy  58 billion        Next  we d realize we have no plan for resuming trade after an attack    no protocol for what would be searched  what would be allowed in  and even who would be in charge   There would be a mad scramble to create a new system in a crisis atmosphere          Eventually  we d begin the slow process of manually inspecting all the cargo that s waiting to enter the U S   One report found it could take as long as four months to get them all inspected and moving again        Finally  we d have to set up a new regime for port security   And you can bet that any new  rushed plan would not balance strong security with efficient trade        Unfortunately  the scenario I just outlined is not the stuff of fantasy   Rather  it is a realistic portrayal of events that could happen tomorrow   Nearly five years after September 11th  we still have not closed a major loophole that threatens our lives and our economy   Time is not on our side   We must act  and we must act now       My Approach   I approach this as someone who understands the importance of both improving security and maintaining the flow of commerce   My home state of Washington is the most trade dependent state in the nation   We know what s at stake if there were an incident at one of our ports        That s why I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce to help us find where we re vulnerable and to evaluate the best security practices   It s why I ve worked to boost funding for the Coast Guard and have fought to keep the Port Security Grant program from being eliminated year after year   Right after 9 11  I started talking with security and trade experts to find out what we need to be doing to both improve security and keep commerce flowing          Last year  I sought out Senator Collins as a partner in this effort    I approached Senator Collins because I knew she cared about the issue  I knew she d done a lot of work on it already  and I knew she was someone who could get things done   Since that day  we have worked hand in hand to develop a bill and move it forward   I m also grateful to Senators Lieberman and Coleman for their tremendous work       The Threat   We know we re vulnerable   Terrorists have many opportunities to introduce deadly cargo into a container   It could be tampered with anytime from when it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it arrives at a consolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port   It could be tampered with while it s en route to the U S          And there are several dangers   I outlined what would happen if terrorists exploded a container   But they could just as easily use cargo containers to transport weapons or personnel into the U S  to launch an attack anywhere on American soil        In April  22 Chinese stowaways were found at the Port of Seattle  They had reached the U S  inside a cargo container   In that case  they were stowaways  but they could have been terrorists sneaking into our country       Current Efforts Are Inadequate   The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate   Last year    thanks to the insistence of Senators Collins and Coleman    the Government Accountability Office found that C TPAT was not checking to see if companies were doing what they promised in their security plans   Even when U S  Customs inspectors do find something suspicious at a foreign port  they cannot force a container to be inspected          So we have a clear and deadly threat  and we know that current programs are inadequate   What are we going to do about it   We could manually inspect every container  but that would cripple our economy         The Challenge    Security and Efficiency   The real challenge here is to make trade more secure without slowing it to a crawl   That s why Senators Collins  Coleman  Lieberman and I have been working with stakeholders and experts to strike the right balance   The result is the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act   It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security while keeping trade efficient         At its heart  this challenge is about keeping the good things about trade    speed and efficiency    without being vulnerable to the bad things about trade    the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce         How the Bill Works   The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act does five things   First  it creates tough new standards for all cargo   Today we don t have any standards for cargo security         Second  it creates the GreenLane option  which provides an even higher level of security   Companies have the option to follow the higher standards of the GreenLane   Their cargo will be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a factory floor overseas until it the reaches the U S   We ll know everywhere that cargo has been   We ll know every person who s touched it  and we ll know if it s been tampered with   The GreenLane will push out the borders by conducting inspections overseas before cargo is ever loaded onto a ship bound for the U S   And we ll provide incentives for companies to use the highest standards of the GreenLane        Third  our bill sets up a plan to resume trade quickly and safely to minimize the impact on our economy        Fourth  our bill will secure our ports here at home by funding Port Security grants at  400 million         This funding will help ports and port operators develop and implement security plans   They could use this funding to strengthen perimeter security  which could help prevent a number of security lapses that were highlighted in this week s Seattle Times article         Finally  our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo security   DHS is long overdue in establishing cargo security standards and transportation worker credentials   We need to hold DHS accountable  and our bill provides the infrastructure to ensure accountability and coordination        Many Co Sponsors   I want to thank Senator Collins for her tremendous leadership on this important issue    I also want to thank Senator Coleman for his leadership and work as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   Senator Coleman has helped expose our vulnerabilities and has worked to develop solutions   I also want to thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership and support  and I want to commend our other cosponsors    Senators Feinstein  Snowe  DeWine  Salazar  Santorum  Graham  Cantwell  Durbin  and Byrd        We re also seeing tremendous progress on the House side with the SAFE Port Act  and I want to thank Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harman for their leadership   Finally  I  d like to thank the numerous federal  state and local officials  as well as industry representatives  for their tremendous assistance in crafting this legislation   They truly are at the front lines of securing our nation  s ports  and I ve been proud to work with them all        Today We Have a Choice   Today  we have a choice in how we deal with the cargo security challenges facing us     But if we wait for a disaster  our choices will be starker     Let s make the changes now on our terms before there s a deadly incident   Let s protect America before an image like this is on our TV screens   Let s not wait until a terrorist incident strikes again to protect our people and our economy         Earlier this year  the American people woke up and spoke out when they heard that a foreign  government owned company could be running our ports   That sparked a critical debate         Now we need to set up a security regime that will actually make us safer   Until we do so  none of us should sleep well at night   A terrible image like this one    a burning container ship  with a dirty bomb  in one of America s harbors    could be on our TV screens tomorrow  so this Congress must act today        We ve heard the Majority Leader say that we need to address port security  But words won t protect us from terrorists   Words won t help us find a bomb that s hidden in a cargo container   Words won t help us tell which containers could be holding a group of terrorists trying to sneak into our country   We need more than words  We need to pass the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  and we only have a few days to get this right   Let s bring up and pass the GreenLane Act before it s too late
