                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Remarks on Elimination of Tuition Deduction in Tax Law  05 17 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Remarks on Elimination of Tuition Deduction in Tax Law    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 17  2006         As we stand here today  families across my state and our country are struggling    And the problem is that the President    and his allies in Congress    aren  t listening          Today  the President signs a massive tax cut bill  at the same time that we           Are paying for a war in Iraq off budget        Have mounting deficits       Face skyrocketing costs at the gas pump       Need to rebuild the Gulf Coast       And have a new hurricane season about to begin       Signing a tax bill that benefits those that have the most    is simply the wrong priority   If we want to make America strong again  we need to invest here at home          Today  middle class families throughout Washington state and the country are struggling to pay for the rising costs of college  gas and health care   Instead of helping these hardworking families  this tax plan leaves the middle class behind         We need a tax system that is fiscally responsible  helps business grow and provides maximum relief to the middle class   The legislation the President signs today does none of that   Instead  it takes out a loan against our children  s future and makes it harder for them to achieve the dream of a college degree        Nowhere are the Republican Administration  s wrong priorities reflected more than in how we treat those coming behind us and those we are counting on to build our nation  s future    our students   From Bill Gates to Lou Dobbs we have been told that if we want to compete in a global economy we need to have an educated workforce   But I am sad to say that this commitment to the future of our country is under attack here in Washington  D C        The federal commitment to helping students and families pay for college reflects the best of America   That commitment means that         no matter where you start in life        or who your parents are       or what your financial situation  that you can get the education and skills you need to reach your full potential       Unfortunately  the American dream of a college education is taking a back seat to politics and tax cuts for those that need them least   Not only is this the wrong priority for our country today  but it will cost our nation dearly in the long term         This tax package has the wrong priorities   It takes away the ability of families to deduct tuition costs    which is   in effect    a tuition hike for hundreds of thousands of students across our country            And when you look at the bigger picture  a more disturbing pattern is clear   Last February  Congress cut  12 7 billion from student aid programs in the name of deficit reduction as part of the budget resolution          Now  the bill that the President will sign into law   today   increases the deficit by  30 billion    and passes the cost on to our grandchildren  On top of that  the maximum Pell grant has been frozen at  4 000 for the past three years and the President chose not to request an increase in his FY   07 budget   And    now   today this administration has taken away the ability of families to deduct tuition costs from their taxable income         I personally understand the value of a college education and of having a country at your back           We should be helping to break down the barriers to a college education  not building them up          Over the past several weeks  President Bush has traveled around the country giving commencement addresses   At these commencement ceremonies the President honors parents who have sacrificed to put their children through college          He speaks about how education opens doors   And he highlights the fact that in order to compete globally our students need to have access to higher education and the skills to succeed in an ever expanding marketplace   Well  the President is right   But his actions today don  t match his rhetoric          Today he signs a tax package that does not honor the value of higher education   Instead  this massive bill will make it harder for middle class families to pay for college by taking away a provision with an immediate and measurable impact on their financial bottom line        The elimination of the tuition provision amounts to a tax increase on our working families   We can do better   If Congress can  t change these wrong priorities  then it  s time to change Congress
