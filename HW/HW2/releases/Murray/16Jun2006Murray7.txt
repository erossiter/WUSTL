to Issue Transportation and Port Security Grant Guidance    For Immediate Release  Friday  June 16  2006     WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Susan Collins  R ME   Joseph Lieberman  D CT   Norm Coleman  R MN   and Patty Murray  D WA  are calling on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to issue guidance for port security and other transportation security grants  a necessary step before the grants can actually be awarded  Grant guidance outlines eligibility for grants  the purposes for which grants can be used  and how to implement program priorities   The Senators expressed concern that eight months into the fiscal year  DHS is behind schedule and yet to issue the guidance that port  port authorities  public transportation systems  and other grantees need to apply for grant money         In a letter to Secretary Chertoff  the Senators wrote    The delay in issuing fiscal year 2006 guidance is unacceptable  particularly in light of the security needs facing our ports and public transportation systems      They called on Chertoff to announce a date certain by which the grant guidance would be released and they expressed concern that the Department might limit the number of ports eligible to apply for grant funding       The full text of the letter is as follows     Dear Secretary Chertoff        We are writing today to request a date certain by which the grant guidance for the Department  s transportation and infrastructure security grants will be issued   The delay in issuing the FY 2006 guidance is unacceptable  particularly in light of the security needs facing our ports and public transportation systems   In addition  we are concerned that the Department has decided to further limit the number of ports eligible to apply for port security grant funding        The Dubai Ports World controversy brought much needed attention to the critical issue of port security  an issue of longstanding concern to us   America  s sea ports  large and small  are our partners in keeping our nation safe and our economy moving   The funding needs this year are even more critical   As the Department begins to issue Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  cards to maritime workers  port authorities and facilities face significant additional costs to deploy new biometric access control systems   We expect that deployment of these systems will be priority projects under the port security grant program this year and into the future        The Department  s failure to issue the grant guidance yet this year exacerbates remaining security gaps at our ports and will likely adversely affect the ability of applicants to prepare quality applications in a timely fashion   The Inspector General has now issued two reports criticizing both the quality of the applications under this program and the rigor of the Department  s review process   While improvements have been made in the process  the rush to award this year  s grants may negate the progress that has been made   In addition  we understand that the grant awards must be made before the new fiscal year begins  only 16 weeks from now   The Office of Grants and Training has indicated that processing the award paperwork will take 3 weeks   As such  only 13 weeks remain to issue the grant guidance  develop and submit applications  evaluate the applications and announce awards   The timeline is more pressing for port authorities  given the competitive nature of that grant program        As noted above  we are concerned that the Department is now limiting the number of port areas eligible to apply for funding to 78  as opposed to the 100 expected for FY 2006   We fully support awarding these grants to port entities on the basis of risk and need   At the same time  Congress designated the port security grants program as competitive   As such  port entities should be able to make the case for funding  with the Department reviewing their applications and assessing them based on risk and need   Both the House SAFE Ports Act and our proposed GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act include a provision specifying that all entities subject to Area Maritime Security Plans may apply        We have repeatedly inquired as to the timing of the release of the grant guidance   In April  Deputy Secretary Jackson testified before our Committee saying    I believe that the release of the grant guidance is imminent    It will be very soon      There is no longer time for internal deliberation  it is time for action         Susan M  Collins
