                                                                                  News Release          AEROSPACE  Murray Tells Boeing Machinists    We Cannot Allow Airbus to Subsidize the A350     For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 5  2005     SEATTLE  WA   Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray congratulated 100 Boeing Machinists on their success landing the 787 and warned that the United States government cannot allow European governments to subsidize the A350     Newspaper articles indicate that Airbus has asked for  and European governments are poised to provide   1 7 billion in launch aid for the A350   Murray spoke at lodge meeting at Machinists Hall in Seattle   Murray said she is fighting Airbus on three fronts   Working to end the subsidies that Airbus receives from European governments  Fighting Airbus s attempts to portray itself as an American company and a creator of American jobs  And exposing the many ways Airbus is no friend of the United States   Murray told the Machinists that as they are working in Washington state to build the worlds  best airplanes  Airbus is working overtime in places like Toulouse  Berlin and Washington  D C  to stack the deck against you   What we cannot do  after all your sacrifices  is allow Airbus and the EU to build a new plane with more illegal subsidies  Murray said   If we let Europe subsidize the A350  then all of your sacrifices will have been for nothing  and we will not let that happen   Murray noted her success last month getting Congress to pass a resolution calling for an end to Airbus subsidies       Murray also noted that Airbus has taken out ads in Capitol Hill publications trying to portray itself as an American company   In turn  Murray has rebutted those ads on the Senate floor      I want everyone in Washington  D C  to know that when Airbus comes to them with their hat in their hand looking for contracts from American taxpayers  Airbus cannot be trusted  Murray said   Airbus does not create American jobs   It kills them      Murray also criticized Airbus for trying to sell military weapons to Iran  an enemy of the United States   NBC Nightly News cameras caught Airbus at an air show in Kish  Iran      Airbus is a European company  first  last and always  and Airbus doesn t care about American workers or American security  Murray said   Airbus may not have a problem trading with America s enemies  but we sure do  and we re not going to let them get away with it                 Senator Murray s remarks follow  I know that all of you are fighting everyday to build the world s best airplanes   You re fighting for your jobs  and you re fighting for keeping Washington strong   And the fight you re leading is really over whether America will lead the world in civil aviation for the next hundred years  as we have for the first 100 years   So I know how high the stakes are  and I m very proud of the work you re doing    Airbus is Trying to Stack the Deck Against American Workers But I also know that the playing field is rigged   And I know that while you re working here  Airbus is working overtime in places like Toulouse  Berlin and Washington  D C  to stack the deck against you  Our country has lost 700 000 aerospace jobs in the past 15 years   Those layoffs are not just numbers   They re you re brothers and sisters  friends and neighbors   But Airbus still isn t satisfied   Today they are going after your jobs with a lot of energy and deep pockets  In Washington  D C   I see Airbus and EADS going to new lengths to break the rules  to subsidize their planes  to deceive Members of Congress  to weasel their way into American defense contracts  and ultimately  to finish off the American aerospace industry   And we have got to stop them  Tonight I want to update you on what I m doing in Washington  D C  to fight Airbus s illegal and deceptive actions   With your help  I m attacking Airbus on three fronts   First  we re fighting the subsidies because as I ve said time and again the subsidies must stop   Second  I m fighting Airbus s PR campaign  They re trying to convince U S  lawmakers that Airbus creates American jobs  when Airbus actually destroys them   And they re trying to convince lawmakers that Airbus is an American company   We know Airbus tries to destroy American companies  so I m pushing back   And third  I m showing everyone that Airbus is no friend of the United States when it sells weapons to our enemies  You Sacrificed for the 787   Let me say first that I know that all of you have made a lot of sacrifices to land the 787   Because of your sacrifices  you will build the plane that will redefine aviation   Already  the marketplace is rewarding you with new plane orders that are making Airbus play catch up   While Airbus was going for massive planes  you guys figured out what the customer wanted  and you guys won  You came up with a better product  and now the marketplace is rewarding you with new orders  But I know it wasn t easy and that you gave up a lot to land the 787   When Boeing said it needed more flexibility to work with subcontractors and vendors  you made tremendous sacrifices   When management said it needed a more flexible relationship  you provided that flexibility   When Boeing said it needed productivity gains  you said we ll do it   None of those were easy  all of those agreements came at a heavy price to you and your members  After Your Sacrifices  We Cannot Allow Europe to Subsidize the A350     What we cannot do  after all your sacrifices  is allow Airbus and the EU to build a new plane with more illegal subsidies   If we let Europe subsidize the A350  then all of your sacrifices will have been for nothing  and we will not let that happen    Some may ask why the Europeans must subsidize their new aircraft  but we know the answer   The Europeans understand that without the subsidies  without an unfair advantage  they would have a heck of a time competing head to head with American workers   They would lose   You are the best asset that we have in this fight   But I know that you can t effectively compete when you start billions of dollars behind   Those subsidies are unfair   They re illegal  and I m fighting them    It s our job in Washington D C  to level that playing field  to call a subsidy a subsidy  and to make Europe play by the rules   I m here tonight to tell you that I m committed to this effort   I ll continue to do my job in Washington D C  so that you can continue doing yours back here   Let me update you on what I m doing specifically to fight Airbus in Washington  D C      Fight  1   Stop the Subsidies First  we ve got to stop the subsidies   Airbus has been breaking the rules for years  and their illegal tricks have cost us jobs   We know they rely on a host of subsidies   Airbus cheats with launch aid   Airbus cheats with supplier subsidies   Airbus cheats with RD subsidies   Airbus cheats with facility subsidies   The list goes on and on  I m pushing back on all of them  but the most urgent one to kill right now is launch aid  In July  I called on the U S  to pull out of an outdated treaty that allowed subsidies   And I m pleased that three months later    our government did just that  We have tried to negotiate with the Europeans   I ve worked closely with Amb  Robert Zoellick  who was our U S  Trade Representative until a few months ago  I ve also worked in the Senate to strengthen the hand of our negotiators   Last month  I helped pass a bipartisan resolution in the Senate   It calls on European governments to reject launch aid for Airbus  and it supports the Presidents authority to take any action necessary to protect American aerospace jobs   Our resolution passed 96 0  so Congress is on the record saying the subsidies must end   But from everything I ve seen  the Europeans have never taken our negotiations seriously   Now I think it s time for the U S  to take Europe to the World Trade Organization and file a trade case  We have a new U S  Trade Rep  Robert Portman  who was just confirmed last week   I supported his confirmation  and I look forward to building a strong relationship with him and making sure he understands what we re fighting for  I will work with anyone to get the job done   I usually don t find myself working on the same side of an issue as the Bush Administration  but I ve got to say that on this issue  the Bush Administration has been a strong ally   I ve worked closely with their Commerce Department and USTR  and I will work with anyone  Democrat or Republican  to make sure we keep American aerospace jobs here in the U S   We dont have any time to waste  We have to stop those subsidizes now  because Europe is posed to provide launch aid for the A350   Airbus has applied for    and European governments are prepared to provide     1 7 billion in new launch aid to subsidize the A350   We can t let that happen  so I m working with other Senators and with the U S  government to hold Europe accountable and stop the subsidies   That s the first fight     Fight  2   Show That Airbus Kills American Jobs Second  I m working to expose Airbus s false PR campaign   Airbus is lying about its impact on American jobs   It says it creates them  but we know it kills them   So I ve had a strong dialogue with the Airbus  the Commerce Department  the Defense Department and others to expose Airbus s phony numbers   I ve got whole section about it  and you can read the letters yourself on my website  Just last month  the Commerce Department released an exhaustive study done at the request of this Congress  on the U S  Jet Transport Industry  This 150 page report once again comes to the same conclusion we ve heard time and again   Airbus is not an American company  and Airbus does almost nothing to support the hundreds of thousands of American workers who depend on this important industry  Airbus is Not an American Company I m also working to stop Airbus from portraying itself as an American company   They ve taken out ads in newspapers on Capitol Hill trying to wrap themselves up in the American flag   I ve brought some of those deceptive ads down onto the Senate floor  blew them up on big charts  and explained to the rest of the Senate that they were lies  and part of PR campaign to deceive Members of Congress   So I m working to expose Airbus s false and deceptive PR campaign   I want everyone in Washington  D C  to know that when Airbus comes to them with their hat in their hand looking for contracts from American taxpayers  Airbus cannot be trusted   Airbus does not create American jobs  it kills them  Fight  3   Show That Airbus is No Friend of America The third part of my fight is to show everyone that Airbus is no friend of the United States   When it wants a contract  when it wants to sell planes here  Airbus acts like our best friend   But when Airbus thinks we re not looking  they do outrageous things  Recently  NBC Nightly News went to an air show in Iran   Now we as a country have some big problems with Iran   Iran is trying to destabilize and undermine our interests in the Middle East   Iran is trying to obtain nuclear weapons  and Iran is not a friend of the United States   So NBC goes to this air show in Iran  and guess who s there  Airbus   And guess what they re doing  trying to sell their military helicopters to Iran   And when a reporter confronted the Airbus rep  here is what he said   As a European company  we re not supposed to take into account embargoes from the U S  To me  that says it all   Airbus is a European company  first  last and always  and Airbus doesn t care about American workers or American security   Airbus may not have a problem trading with America s enemies  but we sure do  and we re not going to let them get away with it  I took that NBC News story down to the Senate Floor last month and read it to other Senators  so they d know what Airbus was really up to  My message to Airbus is clear   You can t call yourself a friend of America if you re selling weapons to our enemies    Get Updates on My Website  So I m working on all three fronts in Washington  D C  to force Airbus to play by the rules   If you want to know more about my efforts  I ve got a special section of my website dedicated to aerospace issues   You can watch my floor speeches  read my letters and charts  and get my e mail updates   The address is  I know this is a challenging time   I know that Boeing is going to name a new CEO   I ve talked to Alan Mulally  Lou Platt  and others about it   And I know that Boeing s next CEO will be just as committed to this fight   None of us  not me  not you  not Boeing  are going to let Airbus subsidize the A350   We won t let it happen   So I m proud of the fight you re leading here on the front lines of aviation  and I m proud to be your partner  standing up for you in the United States Senate
