safety  reduce congestion  and improve quality of life    For Immediate Release  Monday  December 12  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today joined Arlington Mayor Margaret Larson  Marysville Mayor Dennis Kendall  U S  Rep  Rick Larsen  and community members to cut a symbolic ribbon and celebrate the completion of the new 172nd St  overpass in Arlington   The overpass will improve traffic safety and efficiency  reduce congestion on local streets  and improve the quality of life for residents of Arlington  Marysville  and surrounding communities          Senator Murray helped secure  3 million for the project in 2003 as the highest ranking Democrat on the Senator Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee         This project helps the people of Arlington and Marysville    and all of north Snohomish County    in so many important ways   Murray said    By creating a more efficient interchange  we ve made it possible for people and goods to move more quickly and safely        Senator Murray s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow     I m so glad to be here today with all of you to celebrate this great project   I m thrilled to see that the new 172nd Street Overpass is now open to traffic and that the project has been completed ahead of schedule        I knew  just over a year ago  when we stood here together to break ground on this project    that we had a great team working to get us to that point and a great team working to complete the project   But  after you ve done this for a while    like I have    you might hear that a project could be completed ahead of schedule  but it hardly ever actually happens   The fact that this project has actually been completed ahead of schedule is a testament to how great a cooperative effort this has been    from start to finish        Today  as we open this new overpass to traffic  I want to give special thanks to those members of the Arlington  Marysville  and surrounding communities who saw a need  and decided they wanted to work to meet that need   It made me so proud then    and it makes me so proud now    that this has truly been a grassroots effort   I m delighted that members of this community are keeping our state s strong tradition of grassroots initiative and cooperation alive         I want to thank all the people and the agencies that have contributed to this project   Specifically  I d like to thank Members of the Transportation Relief Action Plan    or TRAP  the cities of Marysville and Arlington  our state elected officials  the Transportation Improvement Board  and the Washington State Department of Transportation  for working so hard together to make this investment in the future of Arlington  Marysville  and the surrounding communities        And I believe strongly that investing in our transportation and infrastructure really is the smart thing to do   As ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Transportation subcommittee  I ve seen firsthand that these investments    create good jobs  help our economy  and improve our quality of life   That s why I support these kinds of investments throughout our state         And it s why  along with Congressman Rick Larsen  I worked to secure  3 million in 2003 for this project    not only to relieve congestion at this interchange but to spur economic growth for your community   When you add in the more than  6 million in state and local funding for the project  the total contribution to this project is over  9 million   That shows how much we all value transportation projects as a way to keep our state moving    and growing        And the benefits of this project to the local community really are plain to see   By creating a more efficient interchange  we ve made it possible for people and goods to move more efficiently and safely   The use of side streets by vehicles will also be greatly reduced  which means that everybody gets where they re going faster  and more safely        So  this project helps the people of Arlington and Marysville    and all of north Snohomish County    in so many important ways   I m proud to have contributed to this partnership  and I m going to continue to be your partner in the United States Senate  as we work together to make the investments in our infrastructure that our state needs to stay strong well into the future          Thanks so much for your cooperation on these projects  and congratulations on a job that s being very well done
