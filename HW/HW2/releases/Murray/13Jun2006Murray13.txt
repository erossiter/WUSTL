Nomination of Richard Stickler to the Mine Safety and Health Administration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  June 13  2006     Washington  D C      In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged the Senate to reject the nomination of Richard Stickler to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration         We need a leader at the Mine Safety and Health Administration who will not accept the status quo that has cost miners their lives   Murray said    It is wrong to turn the enforcement of our mine safety laws over to a former coal company executive who has no background in miner health and safety          Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise to oppose the nomination of Richard Stickler to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health   That s a long title  but it means one thing   This person will be in charge of the health and safety of every miner in America          That s a serious responsibility  and it requires a serious leader    someone with a strong background in mine safety and a strong commitment to aggressively protect America s mine workers   Mr  Stickler offers neither   The President respectfully should withdraw his nomination and send us a more suitable nominee        Just six months ago  12 miners were killed in the Sago disaster   In the wake of that tragedy  the Senate did the right thing and passed the most comprehensive mine safety update in a generation   I was honored to work on that historic bill with Senators Kennedy  Enzi  Isakson  Rockefeller and Byrd        But we need to do more than just a pass a law   We need to make sure we provide the resources and the leadership to carry it out   That s why it s so disturbing that the Senate Majority Leadership is trying to push this unqualified nominee through          Senator Byrd  who represents the Sago families  has raised very valid concerns about Mr  Stickler s qualifications   Following Senate tradition  those concerns should be heeded   They should give all of us pause   Instead  the Senate Majority Leadership is departing from our usual process and trying to push this nominee through the Senate   That s the wrong course of action when the lives of America s miners are at stake        I m passionate about this issue because I ve worked on mine safety in the HELP Committee  In fact  it was my questioning of the nominee at his confirmation hearing that revealed his  business as usual  approach to miner health and safety   When Richard Stickler testified at his HELP Committee confirmation hearing in January  he told me that he believes current mine safety laws are  adequate    I could not disagree more  and neither could the House and Senate  which recently passed the most significant mine safety improvements in a generation         I was so disappointed in Mr  Stickler s responses at the hearing that I asked him to answer further questions in writing   In his reply  Mr  Stickler could not suggest a single way to improve mine safety   Not one single suggestion        Think about that for a minute   We wouldn t put someone in charge of food safety who has no ideas about how to make consumers safer   We wouldn t put someone in charge of airline safety who has no ideas about how to make air travel safer   And we certainly shouldn t put someone in charge of mine safety who has no ideas about how to make our mines safer          We need a leader at the Mine Safety and Health Administration who will not accept the status quo that has cost miners their lives   It is wrong to turn the enforcement of our mine safety laws over to a former coal company executive who has no background in miner health and safety          Here s how the head of the United Mine Workers of America put it in a letter to President Bush         The nation s miners cannot tolerate having another mine executive running the Agency responsible for protecting their health and safety   For too many years  miners have endured an Agency directed by coal mine executives   Too often these mining executives place a priority on productivity  but fail to focus on miners  health and safety   Too many times MSHA has not done all that it is charged with doing to promote miners  health and safety       Those are the words of Cecil Roberts  international president of the United Mine Workers of America   The AFL CIO also opposes this nomination and with good reason        Mr  President  with America s miners risking their lives everyday and a new law that must be vigorously enforced we cannot entrust mine safety to someone who has not shown the background  passion or desire to fight for the health and safety of America s miners   When it comes to mine safety  we cannot tolerate business as usual  We must reject this nominee and demand a leader who will stand up for America s miners
