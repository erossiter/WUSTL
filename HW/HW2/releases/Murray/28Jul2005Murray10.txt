                   News Release          Victory for Viaduct Funding Sens  Murray and Cantwell  and Reps  Larsen and McDermott succeed in securing  220 million to help rebuild structure in Surface Transportation Bill    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 28  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell and U S  Representatives Rick Larsen and Jim McDermott today declared victory in their efforts to secure federal funding for replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Seawall in Seattle   The delegation secured  220 million for the project in legislation reauthorizing surface transportation spending through 2009         The legislation  Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  TEA LU   sets the funding levels for highways  ferries  and transit programs for the next six years            Our delegation has done an incredible job of standing up for the Viaduct   While the Administration didn  t make investing in transportation a national priority  we stood together and convinced our colleagues of this critical safety and economic need     Murray said     The Viaduct plays a crucial role in the strength of our economy  the movement of our people and goods and the safety of our communities in the Puget Sound   We need to rebuild it  and we have come to this point from a realistic perspective of what the federal government can do with partnerships at the local level            These federal funds will begin to pave the way to a safer viaduct and create more jobs for the Northwest   The viaduct serves as a critical artery for Northwest trade  which is the heart of the region s economy   By working together  the delegation was able to secure these funds for the first time since the earthquake  despite these tight fiscal times   Cantwell said         We needed a major federal commitment to help replace the ailing Viaduct  a critical link in the nation s transportation chain   People told us that in these lean budget years it could not be done  I guess you could say that we did the impossible  We helped create an account that had never existed  Projects of Regional and National Significance  Then we managed to dedicate a hundred million dollars to the Viaduct out of that new fund     Larsen said          Today marks an historic step forward for Seattle and the Northwest   For over two years  we never wavered in our determination to get a significant federal funding commitment to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct  and we wouldn t take no for an answer   Today  we succeeded  We worked with the Republican majority and made the case that the Alaskan Way Viaduct is not a concrete highway  but an economic lifeline of national importance  It s a good day and we are much closer to the best day  when we stand together again to dedicate a new Alaskan Way Viaduct     McDermott said        The Nisqually earthquake battered the aging 2 2 mile Alaskan Way Viaduct  which carries over 100 000 vehicles each day and plays a major role in transportation and economic stability in the Puget Sound region   Murray  Cantwell  Larsen and McDermott have made its rebuilding a top transportation funding priority        Last year the President proposed a  256 billion bill to reauthorize the 1998 surface transportation law   Despite veto threats from the Administration in February 2004  the Senate overwhelmingly passed a  318 billion  six year transportation plan and the House passed a  284 billion bill   In March of this year the Administration warned Congress not to pass a reauthorization bill exceeding the  284 billion bill already passed by the House   The Senate version of the bill  passed this May  totaled  295 billion          At a time when congestion on our nation s highways is getting worse  and when our road  rail  airport and air traffic control infrastructure is deteriorating  the President s proposal effectively froze the transportation budget     Murray said     For those of us in the Puget Sound  this is about jobs  our economy and our productivity   I applaud my colleagues for working to make this investment in the Viaduct to both protect our residents and lay the foundation for future economic growth            It s like winning the Tour de France  There were plenty of stages along the way  and the stakes were high  Today we came across the finish line wearing the leader s yellow jersey for the Viaduct   Larsen said     As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  I have worked over the last few years to win support for Viaduct replacement from House transportation leaders  We showed them that the Washington delegation was standing together in this effort  and we showed them in person just how critical the situation was  Those efforts paid off
