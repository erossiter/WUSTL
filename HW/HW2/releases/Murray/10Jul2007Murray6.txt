                                                                                                                                                                                                           For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 10  2007    With 21 Members  this Subcommittee on Transportation  Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies is the largest subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee  With more than a fifth of the Senate represented on this subcommittee  we may be the largest subcommittee in the entire Senate  We meet today to mark up the appropriations bill for Transportation and Housing for 2008  We had several weeks of hearings with witnesses from the Department of Transportation  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the National Transportation Safety Board  and the general public  I want to thank all the members of this subcommittee who participated in those hearings  I especially want to thank my Ranking Member and partner in this effort  Senator Bond  for all his assistance in conducting our hearings and in putting together this bill  Senator Bond and I have had several conversations and kept in close touch over the recess week to ensure that we put together a bill that could enjoy broad bi partisan support  The Full Committee is scheduled to mark up our bill this coming Thursday at 2 00 pm  I will make a more detailed statement on the bill at that time  But for now  I just want to outline a few of the highlights of the bill that is before you  Overall the bill provides budgetary resources  including appropriations and obligation limitations  totaling  104 6 billion  That amount is  5 3 billion more than the amount enacted for 2007 and roughly  4 4 billion more than the Presidents request  There are a number of simple reasons why this bill is higher than the Presidents requested level  Housing First and foremost the bill before you rejects many of the most punitive cuts in housing and transportation investment programs proposed in the Presidents budget  The President proposed to cut community development efforts in all our states and communities across the Nation by slashing the CDBG program by  735 million or twenty  20   percent  This bill restores every penny of that cut  The Presidents budget proposes to cut housing funding for the disabled by  112 million or almost fifty  50   percent  His budget also sought to cut housing for low income seniors by  160 million or twenty two  22   percent  The bill before you restores every penny of those cuts  The bill also rejects the Presidents proposal to completely eliminate funding for the very successful HOPE VI program  My colleagues  Senators Bond and Mikulski  deserve a great deal of credit for the success of this program  and we have again restored funding for it  AMTRAK   The bill before us also rejects several punitive cuts proposed through the Department of Transportation  The Presidents budget proposes to slash funding for AMTRAK by almost  500 million or forty  40   percent in a single year  The Subcommittee heard testimony in February that a cut of this size would cripple the railroad and push it into certain bankruptcy  That was not just the view of AMTRAK supporters  This was the view of the DOT Inspector General  who audits AMTRAKs books every quarter  So the bill before you provides  1 37 billion for AMTRAK  a very slight increase over the current years level  It also provides a  100 million state matching grant program for passenger rail investments  That was the one area of the Presidents proposal for rail transportation that we could agree with  Essential Air Service The bill before you also rejects the Presidents proposal to cut subsidies for the essential air service and eliminate all flights to dozens of rural and mid sized communities in just about every State represented on this Committee  Air Traffic Control Modernization  Airport Grants The bill before you also restores every penny of the Presidents proposed cut of  765 million from the Airport Grant Program  It also rejects the Presidents proposal to cut investments in the modernization of our Air Traffic Control system  Highway Funding  the Highway Trust Fund When it comes to highway funding  the bill fully funds the authorized level as stipulated in the SAFETEA LU highway law  That funding level represents an increase of  1 1 billion over last year and  631 million over the Presidents budget  I need to sound an important warning  however  about our highway program and the deteriorating status of the Highway Trust Fund  Members will find in the committee report a table indicating that  if we keep pace with the levels authorized in the highway bill  the Trust Fund will find itself bankrupt to the tune of almost  2 billion dollars in 2009  I am told  that when the President releases his mid session review of the budget tomorrow  the status of the Highway Trust Fund may appear to be even more dire than our Committee report indicates  Without some action by the Finance Committee  our subcommittee may be forced to dramatically scale back our investments to alleviate congestion and address deteriorating bridge and road conditions in our states  We discussed this problem with Secretary Peters during our very first hearing this year  and we have been in conversations with the Finance Committee about the urgency of this situation  Senator Bond and I received a letter on this issue from the bi partisan leadership from the Finance Committee earlier this year  That letter states their expectation to address this problem soon  so we can keep pace with the investment levels envisioned in the SAFETEA LU law  I hope all my colleagues will join with me in pushing the tax writing committees to address this shortfall  Tenant Assistance Finally the bill before us includes some select but critically needed funding increases  The Presidents budget proposed an absolute freeze on the amount of money available for tenant housing vouchers for the coming year  completely ignoring inflationary costs  and cost increases associated with the rise in rents  This bill provides a  500 million increase for tenant based rental assistance  That is the amount we estimate will be needed just to ensure that all current federally assisted tenants can stay in their homes  Housing for Veterans Senator Bond and I joined forces to add  75 million for the HUD VASH program  This program was designed to target both housing assistance and supportive services to homeless veterans  including veterans returning from the war in Iraq  We have coordinated this increase in voucher funding with a comparable increase in supportive services funding in the Appropriations bill for the VA and Military Construction  This program hasnt received funding for several years  and I am proud to say that our new initiative will provide critically needed support to at least 7 500 homeless veterans  Transportation Safety The bill has also included small and selective increases to address critical and worsening problems with transportation safety  Small increases above the Presidents budget are provided to hire more air safety inspectors  At present  these inspectors cant inspect all the maintenance facilities they are responsible for  especially those facilities that are overseas  We have provided small increases for rail safety  highway safety and pipeline safety  Our subcommittee had a special hearing just on the rising level of highway fatalities and we have sought to respond the some of the needs cited during that hearing  We have also provided increased funding to enable the Department of Transportation to investigate the growing backlog of customer service complaints by airline passengers  As members know  the staff of each Subcommittee Member was briefed on the contents of this bill just this morning  Members have had just a few hours to review it thoroughly  As such  I would like to ask Members to defer any amendments they may wish to offer to our Full Committee markup  which we will have in just two days  I encourage my Colleagues to review the entirety of the bill and bring any concerns they have to Senator Bond and me to discuss them prior to that mark up
