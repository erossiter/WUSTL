                                                 News Release          Washington Veterans LOSE Healthcare Battle in U S  Senate Republicans Kill Murray s Amendment to Boost VA Healthcare by  2 85 Billion    IMPACT   Veterans Will Face Longer Lines  VA Hiring Freeze  Less Access to Care    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  March 16  2005           to Receive Our Veteran s  E Mail Update         WASHINGTON  D C      The Republican majority in the U S  Senate today turned their backs on the needs of America  s veterans as they voted to defeat an amendment by Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   and Senator Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii  that would have increased funding for veterans   health care by  2 85 billion    just three percent over last year  s funding levels    The Murray Amendment was defeated 47 53 in a setback for new and existing veterans throughout the country            Veterans in Washington state and across the country are waiting for the health care they deserve today     Murray said     But instead of seeing a doctor  they  re seeing long lines  red tape and understaffed hospitals   With new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  these problems are only going to get worse   My amendment would have done the responsible thing and provided our veterans with the care they have earned            Murray s amendment would have eliminated waiting lists  lifted a  hiring freeze  on VA medical staff  and funded new VA clinics and improvements at existing VA facilities            Today  members of the U S  Senate had a choice   They could choose to keep the promise to our nation  s veterans and make them a priority in this budget  or they could turn their backs   I am disappointed to say that the majority party made the wrong choice     Senator Murray said         Murray s Plan Offered Real Help for Veterans     Reject the President  s proposal to cut funding to State veterans   homes     Eliminate the means test for veterans to enroll for VA care       Provide for much needed mental health services       Reject the President  s proposal to drive veterans away from the VA with annual user fees and increased prescription drug costs       New Veterans Coming Home from Iraq   Afghanistan     Murray spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon in support of her healthcare amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution   She cited the increasing demand for veterans services  particularly as new veterans return home from Iraq and Afghanistan  including approximately 4 000 National Guard members from Washington state       Washington Veterans React   Washington veteran leaders expressed frustration at the defeat           Lord knows our veterans need the funding Senator Murray fought for   said Ernie Butler  advocacy director of the Northwest Chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America    It  s just hard to believe that 53 Senators in this day and age voted against the help our veterans need   It  s going to have a painful impact on paralyzed veterans and all veterans   We need shorter waiting lists and more medical staff    not longer lines and overcrowded facilities          What s going on   asked Michael Peterson  junior vice commander of the Department of Washington  Veterans of Foreign Wars   We put our lives on the line for our country  and if we get injured  why should we get substandard care         Peterson said Murray s amendment was badly needed by Washington s 700 000 veterans           We re way behind  We re facing long wait times  It can take up to 60 days just get a routine appointment  and if you need eye care  you re going to wait a year to see a doctor   Peterson said       Who Voted Against Veterans      Murray warned that Senators will have to explain their vote to disappointed veterans             With this vote  we re going to find out who s serious about helping our veterans and who s just talking   With this vote  every Senator will have to announce publicly whether they re making life better for veterans or whether they re making excuses   Murray said on the Senate floor Tuesday night         VFW s Peterson urged veterans across the country to see who voted against them and to take action            We voted them in  We can vote them out   Peterson said       What Message Does the Defeat Send       This sends a terrible message to those who are serving our country today   said Ernie Butler  from the Paralyzed Veterans of America          Twice during the debate  Murray noted that failing to serve today s veterans could hurt America s future security   She displayed a chart with a quote from George Washington  who said in 1789          The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country           George Washington      Veterans Funding Should Be  Mandatory      Murray also reiterated her support for a bill to make veterans funding  mandatory            I ve been convinced for a long time that we need to move VA health care out of the annual budget process   That s why I ve sponsored legislation to make VA healthcare funding  mandatory  so it s always there  no matter what type of budget games are going on   But the Republican majority has blocked that common sense proposal every year    so the fight goes on   Murray said Tuesday night          Senator Murray offered a similar amendment on March 10th in the Senate Budget Committee  but that proposal was defeated on a party line vote of 10 12      Murray Calls Veterans Healthcare a  Personal Issue        My father served in World War II and returned as a disabled veteran   During the Vietnam War  I interned in the Seattle VA hospital   Murray told other Senators    I know first hand the scars and wounds that burden our veterans when they come back home   During the Gulf War  when our soldiers were coming home with Gulf War Syndrome  I brought the VA Secretary out to Washington state so he could hear from the veterans I was hearing from   And over the past two years  when President Bush tried to close the doors at three VA hospitals in Washington state  I worked with veterans and community leaders from across the state to keep those facilities open   I continue to press the VA to open new community clinics in North Central Washington and in Whatcom County    to help serve veterans who today have little access to VA services        Murray s New Committee Appointment Gives Washington Veterans a Bigger Voice     On March 3rd  Senator Murray was appointed to the Senate Subcommittee that funds veterans care  known formally as the Military Construction and Veterans   Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee           Murray also speaks up for Washington s veterans as a senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee         On behalf of Washington state s 33 525 VFW members  Michael Peterson thanked the Senator for leading the fight           Senator Murray has been a staunch supporter of veterans in Washington state                                                                         See how each Senator     A  yea  vote is in favor of increasing veterans funding         A  nay  vote is against the  2 85 billion increase       to Receive Our Veteran s
