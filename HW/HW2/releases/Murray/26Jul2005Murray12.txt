Washington  D C      In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  paid tribute to Brian Harvey  an asbestos victim and advocate  who died on July 22  2005                    A Washington native  Mr  Harvey often joined Senator Murray at press conferences and hearings to support Murray s legislation to ban the use of asbestos                                                                                                            More on    Sign up to receive  from Senator Murray                                                                                                   Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise today to honor Brian Harvey  a loving husband  father  grandfather  teacher  and advocate and a hero in the fight to protect Americans from deadly asbestos         Anyone who s followed the debate over asbestos in Congress will immediately remember Brian for his booming voice  for the way he could capture the attention of every person in a packed Committee hearing room  and for his commitment to save lives and bring victims the justice they deserve        This picture shows Brian doing what he did best  urging Congress to ban asbestos and protect victims  Brian Harvey is my hero  Mr  President  it is my sad duty to report to the Senate that Brian passed away on Friday  July 22nd   I want to extend my condolences to his entire family  including his wife Sue  daughter Valerie  stepchildren Ethan  Anne  and Amy  and his three grandchildren   But mostly  I want to share my thanks that Brian was given more time on this earth than many asbestos victims and that he used that time to help others        I was very lucky to work with Brian over the past three years   We came together at an important time in both our lives and in the history of Congressional action on asbestos   In 2002  Brian was defying the odds in fighting mesothelioma and looking for a way to share his experience and help others   At the same time  I was one year into my effort in the Senate to ban asbestos   I was both surprised and horrified that asbestos was still being put in lots of commonly used consumer products on purpose   In my research  I learned about the deadly toll of asbestos diseases and about the lack of prevention  research  and treatment   I wrote a bill to address those critical needs  and I was proud to have Brian Harvey at my side and at the podium as I introduced that bill in June 2002        Brian Harvey is my hero because he never hesitated to stand up and speak truth to power  Whenever we had a hearing or a press conference  whenever Senators needed to understand the horror of asbestos diseases  whenever my legislation needed a little boost or a powerful push  Brian Harvey was the first person on a plane from Washington state to Washington  D C          Like so many asbestos victims  Brian was exposed to asbestos through no fault of his own  Brian grew up in Shelton  Washington  and like me he attended Washington State University   During his summers in college  Brian worked at a paper products mill in Shelton  Washington  There he was exposed to asbestos fibers   The damage of that exposure would not be revealed until three decades later        In September 1999  Brian experienced shortness of breath and fatigue   He was diagnosed with mesothelioma  and the odds were stacked against him  Most people diagnosed with mesothelioma who do not receive treatment die within eight months  Those who do receive treatment increase their life expectancy to an average of 18 months  Overall  a person  s chance of surviving five years is one in 20  Brian lived six years after being diagnosed   He was truly one in a million        Brian Harvey was lucky in many ways   His disease was diagnosed early   He got experimental treatments at the University of Washington   He had skilled doctors and medical professionals   And  he had the support of family and many friends  Many asbestos victims are not that lucky   Brian recognized that and he used the time he was given to speak up for others whose lives and families have been torn apart by asbestos        Brian Harvey is my hero because he didn t despair about his own personal challenges   Instead  he shared those challenges with all of us  helping us to understand the threat and to inspire change in our public policy  And he did it with an actor s presence and a deeply human and personal touch   Brian used to say that part of the left side of his body was made of Gore Tex and it was  but that didn t explain Brian s toughness or determination  that came solely from his heart        Brian Harvey is my hero because he made a difference   He pushed the Congress to treat victims fairly and to ban asbestos  While that is still a work in progress  Brian s voice and passion echo as loudly today as they did that day three years ago when he stood beside me as we introduced the bill for the first time        Brian Harvey is my hero because in the face of so many challenges that could have drained his energy  he found the strength inside to fight the good fight  Every time I stood up for asbestos victims  Brian Harvey was at my side  He was there on June 28th  2002 when I first introduced my bill  He was by my side in June 2003 when we stood together to call for fairness for asbestos victims  On March 5  2003  Brian testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee   With his passion and power  he called for increased detection and fair compensation for asbestos victims  Three months later  on June 24  2003  the Judiciary Committee included my ban in its reform bill  On March 25th  2004 at a press conference to call for passage of my bill  Brian Harvey was there as well  So Mr  President  it s hard for me to picture the next hearing or press conference without Brian standing by my side  But  I will continue the fight        When Brian and I met three years ago  the odds were against both of us  The medical odds were against Brian  every day was a triumph   And the legislative odds  the chance that we would pass a bill  were against both of us  We have made progress  but we re not there yet  I know that it will be harder without Brian s advocacy  but I also know that he has done so much to bring that goal within reach  I know that eventually we will ban asbestos  we will ensure victims are treated fairly  we will find new treatments for asbestos diseases  and we will protect future generations from this epidemic  And  when that day comes  we will have Brian Harvey to thank        Again  I extend my thoughts and prayers to Brian s loving family and his many friends  Last week  when Brian was in the hospital  I spoke to his wife  Sue  and his daughter  Anne   Brian was not well enough for me to speak with him  but I talked to the nurse who was sitting at his bedside   I asked her to tell Brian something I ve always wanted him to know  you are my hero         Brian Harvey was given extra time on this planet to help other people  and that s exactly what he did  Mr  President  Brian Harvey will always be my hero
