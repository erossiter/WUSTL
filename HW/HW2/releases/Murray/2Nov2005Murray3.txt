                                                         Murray  Don t Let Poor Seniors Fall Through the Cracks    Senator Murray Offers Amendment to Protect America s Most Vulnerable from New Prescription Drug Program  11 02 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Don t Let Poor Seniors Fall Through the Cracks    Senator Murray Offers Amendment to Protect America s Most Vulnerable from New Prescription Drug Program Murray s plan would give 6 4 million low income seniors and the disabled an extra 6 months to transition into problematic drug program     Murray Asks Medicare Office How it  Lost  8 800 Washington Residents    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 2  2005     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged the Senate to ensure that 6 4 million low income and disabled Americans get an extra six months to transition into the new Medicare prescription drug program        Murray s amendment would help  dual elibigles   low income and disabled individuals who today receive healthcare assistance from both state Medicaid programs and the federal Medicare program   The 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug law moves these vulnerable individuals into a new federal Medicare drug program that requires them to pay more money for access to fewer drugs   The law also blocks states from providing extra help to residents who will now face greater barriers in accessing prescription drugs        Murray s amendment would give states and dual eligibles an extra 6 months to transition into the new system   The extra time would ensure no residents fall through the cracks and that each person has time to select the plan that meets their needs   Currently  individuals who do not select a plan by December 31st  2005  will be randomly assigned to a plan that may not meet their needs        In a Senate floor speech  Murray said the new drug law is  a time bomb that is ticking for more than six million Americans  for our communities  and for our health care providers          We cannot let low income seniors and the disabled lose their drug coverage   We cannot leave doctors  hospitals and nursing homes unprepared for the biggest change in decades  and we cannot push hundreds of thousands of people who need care onto our local communities   We cannot wait   We need to fix the problem today  and that s why I m offering this amendment   Murray said          Five other Senators endorsed Murray s amendment   Senator Jay Rockefeller  D WV   Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NV   Senator Hilary Clinton  D NY   Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Senator Frank Lautenberg  D NJ    Murray s amendment would cost  130 million over five years  A vote is expected on Thursday  November 2nd or Friday  November 3rd        Murray also questioned how the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  managed to  lose  more than 8 800 Washingtonians in its most recent mailing   According to the state of Washington  there are more than 95 000 full  dual eligibiles  in Washington state   CMS however  is mailing notices to only 86 169 Washingtonians          Somehow 8 831 vulnerable residents are not being counted   Murray said    They won t get a letter   They won t be signed up for a plan   They ll just be lost in the transition  and on January 1st they ll find out they have no drug coverage  That is exactly why we need more time to make this transition         Last month  Senator Murray held roundtables in Seattle  Lakewood  Yakima  Aberdeen and Olympia where she heard from doctors  pharmacists  senior advocates  and low income and disabled patients who are worried about how the new treats  dual eligibles         Today s amendment is one of the steps Murray has taken to protect vulnerable seniors   On October 28  2005   to give states  2 billion so they could continue to provide care to low income seniors during the transition         In addition  Murray wrote a separate bill called the Medicare HEALS Act  S 1822   which provides special help for the most vulnerable and also gives all seniors a full benefit year to select a drug plan without penalty       Senator Murray s Remarks Follow     Mr  President  I have serious concerns about the budget that s now before us          To make our country strong again  I believe we need to invest here at home  but this budget will cut  35 billion from America s priorities and burden our children with massive debt   I m especially concerned about what will happen to our most vulnerable    in this budget and in the new Medicare prescription drug law        This budget cuts  27 billion from Medicaid    a health care program and a safety net for our country s most vulnerable and sickest   Cutting their healthcare is the wrong thing to do       And as I look ahead to the Medicare prescription drug law  I see a time bomb that is ticking for more than six million Americans  for our communities  and for our health care providers   That fuse is set to detonate on January 1st  2006          We cannot let low income seniors and the disabled lose their drug coverage   We cannot leave doctors  hospitals and nursing homes unprepared for the biggest change in decades  and we cannot push hundreds of thousands of people who need care onto our local communities   We cannot wait   We need to fix the problem today  and that s why I m offering this amendment   I ve been working with Senator Rockefeller  Senator Bingaman and Senator Nelson to address this immediate crisis  and I want to thank them for their leadership          I ve also introduced my own bill to protect our most vulnerable   It s called the Medicare HEALS Act   It is S  1822          Mr  President  I ve been traveling around my home state of Washington meeting with people in Seattle  Lakewood  Yakima  Aberdeen and Olympia   They are angry  confused and worried    and with good reason   Mr  President  here are some of the concerns I heard           One senior told me   Everyone I have talked to is totally confused   my doctor  my pharmacist  even the Medicare number you are supposed to call           Another said   If we can t understand this  the whole plan is going to fail         Everywhere I went people were confused   There were questions I couldn t answer  and when I turned to the doctors sitting next to me  they didn t know the answer   And neither did the pharmacists or the patient advocates          If Senators and doctors and experts don t understand this    how can we expect an 80 year old person with serious medical problems to understand this complicated program   We can t    so we need more time and more resources to make this work          One person I met with said   Please give us more time  give us the chance to understand this so we don t make a mistake when we sign up         Finally  one panelist said   Taking something away from those that need it the most       is not the American way         I couldn t agree more and that s why I m here on the Senate floor offering a solution        Mr  President  I have many concerns with the Medicare Prescription Drug Law   I voted against it in 2003 because I believe seniors deserve better  and America can do better   I m concerned about the complexity  the coverage gap  and whether needed drugs will be covered   I m concerned about retirees losing the good coverage they have today  and I m concerned about the late enrollment penalty that will punish seniors who need more time to pick the right plan   I m working with many other Senators to address all of those concerns        But today the most urgent problem is the way the new law treats our most vulnerable    people with low incomes  the disabled and those facing serious medical challenges like AIDS   This law takes away the critical drug coverage these people have today and puts them into a new program that could charge them more money in exchange for less drug coverage   If they don  t sign up for a plan  they re randomly assigned one          Either way  the prescriptions they need may not be covered   And because these Americans are living on the financial brink  an interruption of their drug coverage    or a new co payment    could keep them from getting the drugs they need to live          The people who are being affected don t know what s going to happen   Their doctors and pharmacists don t understand it either    and this entire mess is going to burst into the open on January 1st   We need to take action now to prevent this catastrophe which is just a few months away   To understand the problem  let s look at how our most vulnerable get prescription drugs today    and how that will change          Today  about 6 4 million Americans with low incomes get help from two programs    Medicare at the federal level and Medicaid at the state level   These individuals are sometimes called  dual eligibles  because they are eligible for assistance from both Medicare and Medicaid   What Medicare doesn  t cover  states usually cover          For example  since the federal program did not cover prescription drugs  the state programs filled in the gap   This state coverage    often called  wrap around coverage     is critical for vulnerable families        As a result  these individuals get the drugs they need    often without co payments or deductibles   But there s a big problem coming on January 1st   The new drug program prohibits states from providing the extra help they provide today   Instead  it moves these individuals into the Medicare program alone    which requires higher out of pocket payments and which may cover fewer drugs          To me  it doesn t make sense to    take away the good coverage vulnerable families have today  force them into a program that might not meet their needs  charge them more money in the process  and then prohibit states from helping out their most vulnerable residents          It doesn  t make sense    but that s exactly what the new drug program will do unless we fix it before January 1st   In fact  the new Medicare prescription drug program changes the coverage for our most vulnerable in five ways         It imposes higher costs  premiums  co pays and deductibles         It covers fewer drugs        It blocks states from providing extra help    as they do today        It provides no transition period to ensure low income residents don t face gaps in coverage        And it penalizes people who more need time to pick the right plan        Mr  President  these are real people we re talking about   Let me introduce you to two of them          Earlier this month in Seattle I met Kathryn Cole    Kathryn is 36 years old  disabled and living on Social Security disability   She fills about 15 prescriptions each month  and her monthly income is  757          She told me   Even if the co pay were only  5  that adds up to  75 a month   I don t have the kind of extra money to squeeze out of my budget    Kathryn asked me   Which week am I not supposed to eat         People like Kathryn are living on the financial edge    they can t afford to pay more for their medication   They need our help          In Olympia  I met William Havens   He s 50 years old and living with HIV AIDS   He takes 43 pills a day   William told me   For the first time I realize I m going to have to make a choice between pills and food    It s outrageous that this new law is going to make life so much harder for people like Kathryn and William           In addition to hurting people  the new drug program will hurt our health care system   It will have a costly impact on nursing homes  doctors  pharmacists and hospitals   Many dual eligible individuals live in nursing homes   Now nursing homes are going have to have to navigate all these new plans          In my home state of Washington  there will be at least 14 new plans    all with different costs and different formularies   Nursing home managers are going to have see which plan a resident has and if the needed drugs are covered        In Olympia  I met with Dr  David Fairbrook   He s in private practice and is also the medical director at two skilled nursing facilities  which care for 150 people   He s very concerned about patients being randomly assigned to plans that don t meet their medical needs   He said patients may be denied needed drugs  they may be forced to change their medications  and they could face a time consuming  stressful appeals process   Dr  Fairbrook predicts there will be  chaos for nursing staff regarding coordination of multiple suppliers  It further duplicates paper work and documentation requirements          Mr  President  that is a tremendous new administrative burden for understaffed and under funded nursing homes and care providers        Unless we act  the new program will make the work of pharmacists so much harder   Pharmacists will literally be on the front lines   They will be forced to deny coverage to seniors   CMS is telling us that pharmacists will be able to look up and see what plan someone was assigned to          Frankly  Mr  President given the errors and mistakes CMS has made so far  I don t have a lot of confidence this will be a flawless transition   And remember  the people that will be hurt have no financial cushion   They re living on fixed incomes and don t have an extra twenty or thirty dollars for co payments or premiums   If they re turned away at the pharmacy counter  they don t have the money to pay for drugs now and get reimbursed later when the paperwork is sorted out        Doctors will also be on the front line   Doctors will have to know which drugs are on the formulary  they may need to help patients appeal any denials  and they ll have to treat patients who have gone with out their medicine        One doctor I met with told me that  Doctors don t have the information they need on this yet   If patients pick the wrong plan and their medicine is not covered  it can have serious medical harm        Hospitals will also be affected   They re going to have to navigate all these new plans   They re also going to have to deal with patients who haven t been able to get their prescriptions   In fact  for many poor families  the only place to get needed medicine will be the emergency room   That s going to increase the cost of healthcare for all of us        In summary  this new drug law will impose an expensive and confusing administrative burden on doctors  pharmacists  hospitals and nursing homes   We can do better   My amendment says  Let s fix this problem before people realize they can t get the prescriptions they need          The Murray Rockefeller Bingaman amendment provides a 6 month transition for low income dual eligible beneficiaries   It does not delay implementation of the Medicare Part D benefit   It simply gives States  CMS and the Social Security Administration 6 more months to ensure that all those who currently have access to prescription drugs through Medicaid    or who are eligible for Medicaid assistance    are not lost in the transition        According to CBO  this amendment could cost  130 million over 5 years  That is a small price to pay when we re talking about the lives of 6 4 million Americans    In this budget  we re being asked to cut  27 billion from healthcare for the poor    I think it s worth spending less than one percent of that amount to make sure our most vulnerable don  t lose their drug coverage        Today we got another example of how easily our most vulnerable could fall through the cracks   Today  CMS announced it will send a mailing to 86 169 dual eligibles in Washington state          But according to the figures I got from officials in my home state  there are actually 95 000 dual eligibles   So somehow 8 831 vulnerable residents are not being counted  They won t get a letter   They won t be signed up for a plan   They ll just be lost in the transition  and on January 1st they ll find out they have no drug coverage  That is exactly why we need more time to make this transition        I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give our most vulnerable a few extra months to make sure they don t get lost in the transition   This is really a life or death issue for so many   Please do not rip away the last remaining safety net for these seniors   We owe them at the very least this one small fix        Mr  President  time is running out   On January 1st  millions of vulnerable Americans will be forced into a new system they don t understand and that does not meet their needs  We can avoid this train wreck   People s lives are hanging in the balance          I urge my colleagues to vote for the Murray Rockefeller Bingaman Amendment
