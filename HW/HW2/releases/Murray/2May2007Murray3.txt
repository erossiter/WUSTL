                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  FDA Reauthorization Floor Speech  05 02 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          FDA Reauthorization Floor Speech    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 2  2007    Mr  President  all of us here in the Senate share the same goal of making sure the Food and Drug Administration remains the gold standard for drug safety and effectiveness  and this legislation moves us closer to that goal          Throughout our country  researchers  scientists and doctors are making 21st century medical advances  and this legislation will ensure that we have a 21st century FDA  It will provide the resources  authority and oversight to ensure safe drugs move from the lab to the medicine cabinet without delay        Like other members of the Senate  I worked on the FDA reforms in the 1990s   Those reforms responded to the challenges we faced then  and this bill responds to the challenges we face today         In recent years  we ve seen problems at the FDA with drug approval and post market surveillance   This bill addresses those challenges and ensures the FDA has the resources and tools to promptly and thoroughly review new drugs and medical devices         This bill       Reauthorizes and improves two pieces of legislation that will be critical in providing a timely review process       Creates a new system to actively monitor drugs after they ve been approved by the FDA        Strengthens science at the FDA and improves transparency       Improves oversight and information about clinical trials         And  works to prevent potential conflicts of interest among advisory committee members       Drug Safety   Mr  President  like many Americans  I was shocked at the recent revelations concerning drugs that posed risks to public safety but remained on the market for far too long  This legislation moves to address those concerns by instituting strong new protections including post market studies that will be publicly available  I believe that this new transparency and vigorous oversight is the right path toward restoring public confidence in the FDA       Medical Care for Children   This bill also takes critical steps to improve medical care for children        The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act included in this bill uses incentives and regulations to put America s children first  It builds upon legislation first enacted in 1997 that ensures pediatric medicine is a priority and that information on pediatric drugs in readily available  It extends and improves a program that has undertaken nearly 800 studies and has helped to provide pediatric labeling information for 119 drugs         The Pediatric Research Improvement Act included in this bill is another critical component of improving pediatric care  It provides needed safety measures through mandatory clinical trials  It will help continue pediatric oversight programs that have required trials for more than 1 000 pediatric drugs since 1998  All too often  doctors are not given guidance on the proper doses of prescription drugs for children   This bill will help eliminate the guesswork so children get the right doses for safer  more effective treatment        This bill also provides help to our nation s children through the Pediatric Medical Devices Safety and Improvement Act  Every year  we see wondrous technological improvements in medical devices  However  sometimes those improvements do not account for the needs of children and the pediatricians who treat them  This means that essential  often life saving devices don t meet the size  scope  and needs of sick children  This bill will push manufacturers to develop and produce devices that are safe and effective for children and infants  Through incentives and investor outreach this bill will ensure that exciting advances in life saving devices are not limited to adults        Mr  President  this legislation delivers greater safety while also providing better access  I believe that it will improve the way we deliver safe  innovative healthcare in America  and it s my hope that it will also begin to restore confidence in the institutions that safeguard the public s health        The American public deserves nothing less than the gold standard of care from the FDA         When a nervous parent or a weary senior visits their corner pharmacy they deserve to know that the products on those shelves have been approved by a thorough and complete process         When a patient begins to take a new drug they deserve a system that is actively tracking that drug and providing the patient with information on potential risks         And everyone   drug companies  researchers  patients  and doctors alike deserve a system that supports an efficient and timely FDA approval process         I m eager to vote in favor of this legislation so that it can begin to deliver what the American people deserve
