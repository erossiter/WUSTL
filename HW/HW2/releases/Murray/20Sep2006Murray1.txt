Report finds that past VA budget planning was based on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation  and insufficient data      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 20  2006          Washington D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today called on Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  Secretary Jim Nicholson to provide Congress with an accurate plan for the health care of America s veterans  a plan based on real numbers and real demands for service  The call comes after the Government Accountability Office  GAO  released a stunning report detailing the VA s failure to provide accurate information for budget needs in fiscal years 2005 and 2006   The report found that the VA used faulty information when planning for overall health care demands and that it estimated health care costs for service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan based on prewar data          Protecting and taking care of our soldiers is the most basic responsibility for those planning and executing a war   said Murray   Unfortunately  this report offers a stunning indictment of this Administration s commitment to our troops when they return home from Iraq and Afghanistan         The GAO report was commissioned to investigate two emergency budget requests made by the President in 2005 for a total of nearly  3 billion  Those Presidential requests came after Senator Murray made a similar request for additional funds based on reports of under funded services for veterans  The GAO looked into why realistic funding levels were not initially requested by the VA and why additional funds were needed  The GAO report found that the additional funding was necessary because the VA prepared their  05 and  06 budgets using  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation  and insufficient data   Specifically  the report found that         The VA failed to report the problems they were experiencing to Congress in a timely manner        The VA underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan because they used budget information that predates the war        The VA used faulty information on when they would see real dollars from proposed cost saving measures        The VA in many cases did not have any actual means of implementing proposed cost saving measures         This is really about the VA being frank with Congress and the American people about its needs   said Murray   When the VA plays politics with their budget  America s veterans get shortchanged          It s time for Secretary Nicholson to explain how the VA is going to put in place a system that will be able to handle the cost of providing mental health care  reducing patient wait times  and providing for an influx of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans   said Murray   I have not seen that plan  and today s report certainly does not lead me to believe such a plan exists           This independent report once again illustrates a VA that is incapable of preparing a real plan for the care of our nation s veterans   said Senator Murray   There was no plan when service members were sent off to Iraq and Afghanistan  there is no plan now  and most tragically  there is no plan in place for when they return home         Senator Murray has consistently called upon Secretary Nicholson to provide Congress with the full scope of the VA s fiscal needs         In March 2005  after hearing reports from various veterans groups citing long lines for care Senator Murray requested  2 85 billion in supplemental spending to meet the increased demand  In the months after Murray s request  the VA continually misled Congress about the existence of a budget shortfall         In April of 2005  Secretary Nicholson wrote that he did not  foresee any challenges  that would preclude the VA from providing  timely  quality service   The Secretary also testified in a June 2005 Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing that the VA had  an adequate level right now  for mental health   However  those on the front lines of the VA s effort to provide care have not echoed the Secretary s confidence in the Department s ability to provide for Veterans  In fact  as recently as earlier this year  Frances Murphy  M D   Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at our Department of Veterans Affairs  noted that some VA clinics could not provide mental health or substance abuse care to veterans  or if they do   waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible          Senator Murray s 2005 request for  2 85 billion in supplemental funding was ultimately denied by the Republican led Senate  Shortly after Murray s effort was thwarted  the President s requests provided the funding for the  3 billion budget shortfall that the VA revealed in June 2005          The  was requested by Senators Daniel Akaka  D HI   Richard Durbin  D IL   Ken Salazar  D CO  and Murray  Senator Murray is a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee
