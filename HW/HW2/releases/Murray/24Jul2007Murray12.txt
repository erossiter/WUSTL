Homeland Security Funding Bill to Secure Ports and Borders and Fund First Responders Murray Says President Bush s Threatened Veto of Homeland Security Funding Bill Runs Counter to Latest Intelligence Warnings and Needs of Local Law Enforcement and First Responders    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 24  2007      Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke on the Senate floor in favor of the FY 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  Murray helped draft the bill as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  From the local firehouse and police department  to our borders  airports and seaports  this bill will make our country more secure and better able to respond to disasters  Murray said  The bill fully funds Port Security Grants for the first time ever and provides  60 million to build Coast Guard interagency operations centers to coordinate maritime security efforts  The bill also reverses cuts that President Bush sought in his budget to critical law enforcement and first responder programs  Senator Murray s remarks follow  Mr  President  we face serious threats here at home  and that s why it s so important that the Senate pass this Homeland Security appropriations bill  It will help us strengthen our security at the federal  state and local levels  This year in his budget  President Bush sought to cut funding for first responders and for emergency planning  and he failed to adequately fund border security and port security  Thankfully  we have a different view  We want to invest in our security here at home  and we ve crafted a bill that reflects the right priorities  Mr  President  I am honored to serve on the Appropriations Committee and on the Homeland Security Subcommittee under our distinguished chairman  Senator Byrd  No one cares more about the American people  and no one has worked harder on this bill  than Senator Byrd  Thanks to the effort of Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran  this bill passed the subcommittee unanimously  and it passed the full Appropriations Committee unanimously  That strong support is critical because the President has threatened to veto our bill  He thinks it spends too much on homeland security  The President is welcome to make that argument  but in these times of terror threats and natural disasters  I think the American people want us to provide more support for homeland security  not less  Our Bill Invests in Homeland Security There are many important investments in this bill  I d like to focus on three that I have a special interest in as a Senator from a border state  a state with some of the country s busiest cargo ports  and as an advocate for local law enforcement  first responders and emergency planners  Border Security This bill will provide more resources for border security  It provides an additional  240 million for new immigration related homeland security costs  These costs are not funded in the President s budget  As we step up enforcement at our borders  we need to provide the resources from the federal level  and our bill does that  Port Security I m especially pleased that this bill boosts our investment in port security  Over the years  I ve worked with all of the stakeholders to make our ports more secure  Last year  the Senate passed the Murray Collins GreenLane bill  now known as the SAFE Ports Act  The President signed it into law  but he did not provide adequate funding to carry out many of its provisions  We ve been working to fix that in the Senate  We started in the Supplemental bill  where we boosted funding for port security grants and hired more customs inspectors  We re continuing our work with this bill by fully funding port security grants for the first time ever  This bill also provides  60 million to create Coast Guard interagency operations centers  These centers will allow the federal government  local  and state authorities to coordinate their efforts on maritime security  First Responders The final part of this bill that I want to mention will be a tremendous help to first responders  emergency planners  and local law enforcement  In his budget  the President cut the State Homeland Security Grant program in half  This bill restores that cut  It will raise these state grants from the President s level of  250 million to the appropriate level of  525 million  Our states and cities have huge security needs  and many of those needs go unmet  I believe the federal government has a role in shouldering this burden  In addition  the Presidents budget drastically cuts the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  LETPP   To me  that is totally out of touch with what local law enforcement leaders tell me when I meet with them  They need more help  not less  I m pleased to report that our bill saves this important program  so it can continue to help local enforcement officials  This grant provides funds for anti terrorism to our first responders in each of our states  This is an area that we need to strengthen  and we do so with this bill  The President Bush s Threatened Veto Given the strong support this bill has gathered in subcommittee and full committee  I am hopeful that we will pass it by a wide margin  Then it will be up to President to decide if the American people will get the security they deserve  As I mentioned earlier  President Bush has threatened to veto this bill because it spends too much on homeland security  Think about that for a minute  Our intelligence agencies just warned us last Tuesday that Al Qaeda is undiminished in its goal of attacking our homeland  But the President wants to cut funding for first responders  The report found that Al Qaeda is rebuilding its capabilities  Its leadership is intact  It continues to plan high impact plots  But the President wants to cut funding for local anti terror efforts  Our intelligence experts judge that Al Qa ida will intensify its efforts to put operatives here on American soil  But the President wants to cut funding to enforce our borders  We have all this evidence that we need to be more secure at home  and the President s budget would make us less secure at home  If he wants to veto this bill  he s going to have explain to the American people   why the police department down the street will be getting less support  why the fire station around the corner will be getting less help  and why their community can t develop a emergency plan so they re prepared for a disaster   If the President really plans to veto this bill  he s going to have to make that case to the American people  I m proud of this bill  I know it will help our communities take the steps they must take to keep us safe  and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for it
