Washington s Infrastructure Senator Says Hurricane Katrina and Tight Budgets Make It More Difficult    And More Necessary    to Fund Critical Investments      Murray Calls for Smarter Federal Approach to Jetty Repair  Hopper Dredges and Maintaining Small Ports    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 13  2005          Vancouver  Washington     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  was named  Legislator of the Year  by the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association    at its annual conference in Vancouver            In her remarks  Murray urged transportation advocates to press Congress to invest in America s infrastructure         To make America strong again  I believe we need to invest here at home    invest in our communities  in our schools  in our people  and in our infrastructure   Murray said        Murray said that Hurricane Katrina and growing budget deficits are making it harder to fund transportation projects in Congress   She noted that all U S  Army Corps of Engineers projects     including critical waterway improvements in Washington state    may face increased scrutiny in Congress          Hurricane Katrina is going to have an affect on the entire country  but it s going to have a particularly strong impact on the projects that are handled by the Army Corps of Engineers   Murray said    The climate has changed  so we have to change if we re going to be effective   You still need to pick one or two priorities and speak with one voice  but what you say needs to reflect this new emphasis on the Corps  traditional missions         Murray called on regional leaders to help the federal government make smarter investments    such as repairing the jetties that protect the Columbia River  lifting restrictions on public hopper dredges  and maintaining Washington s shallow draft ports         Founded in 1934  PNWA represents more than 100 ports  steamship and towboat operators  grain and forest products shippers and other economic development interests and local government interests in Washington  Oregon  Idaho  Alaska  and California         In presenting Murray with the Association s first ever  Legislator of the Year  award  Port of Vancouver Executive Director Larry Paulson praised the Senator for her work increasing transportation and port security funding and for her leadership on improving the Columbia River          She  s a national leader on port issues and transportation  and we  re proud to call her our own friend  advocate and Senator   Paulson said    She knows our work  she fights for our priorities  and she has certainly earned this award         The award recognized Senator Murray s commitment to improving Washington s waterways  railways and highways  including          since 2001  to deepen the Columbia River to make Washington s agricultural exports less expensive       Securing  17 million in the Senate to repair the deteriorating Columbia River jetties       which kept the port from closing and saved hundreds of local jobs       Leading the Senate effort to improve port security       Increasing Coast Guard funding by 10 percent in 2001       Increasing federal funding for Washington state s transportation projects      And improving opportunities for Washington s rural communities  supporting trade and working to strengthen the farm safety net      Senator Murray s remarks follow      Thank you Larry   This is an incredibly diverse group   But whether you re from Washington or Oregon  whether you re from a small town or a major city  whether you represent a port  a producer or a P U D   all of you share a commitment to building a stronger economy   And all of you have taken a position of leadership in your community to stand up for local families and businesses   I want to thank you for your service  and I am honored to be your partner in Washington  D C      To Make America Strong Again  Invest at Home      You know  today many people don t feel secure about their future   They feel like they re one slip away from losing their job  They re worried they won t be able to retire or to pay for a trip to the doctor if their child gets sick         To make America strong again  I believe we need to invest here at home    invest in our communities  in our schools  in our people  and in our infrastructure         For more than 70 years  the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association has been doing just that   You help bring people together to make critical investments in our waterways  our highways  our railways and our ports    and that makes Washington  Oregon and our entire region stronger      Channel Deepening     Now when I think of PNWA  one of the first things that comes to mind is your work on Channel Deepening   It s an issue that affects so many communities    from our port and barge operators  to our farmers and longshoremen  to our trade community   That s a lot of different voices         But your association brought people together behind that one priority  and that s the only way to get things done in Washington  D C     and you helped turn the Administration around       The Secret of Your Success     I think the secret of your success is bringing people together behind the same priorities    and then speaking with one voice   That s really made you a powerhouse in Washington  D C  and given our region a strong voice    and a seat at the table   That s a credit to your members and especially to your leadership    Kristin and Glenn and your Executive Committee and Board of Directors         And that focus is going to be more important than ever in the coming months because the landscape in Washington  D C  has changed dramatically since many of you came to see me in Congress back in March       A Different Environment     Things are different in Washington  D C  for two reasons the budget and Hurricane Katrina      The Budget     Back in 1992  when I first ran for the U S  Senate  Ross Perot was running around the country with his charts screaming about the budget deficit   The deficit was certainly bad then  but it s even worse today   That reality is finally starting to sink in in Washington  D C   If it s not related to defense  it s probably going to be cut   Every non defense program is competing for a slice of a pie that keeps shrinking   So the first challenge is this tight budget environment      Hurricane Katrina     The second challenge deals with Hurricane Katrina   We all saw the horrible pictures of devastation that the hurricane caused   And then we all saw American citizens    like you and I    going for days without food  water and medicine  It was something that I never thought I d see in the United States of America in 2005        The Gulf Coast Needs Help     So it is clear that the Gulf Coast will need our country s help    and a lot of it    for years to come   And we need to be able to provide it   Congress and others are now investigating what went wrong  and it s a critical exercise   No matter where we live    we all need to know that if there s a disaster    our local  state and federal officials are going to be able to protect us   I ve been meeting with our emergency planners throughout the state  and I want to make sure that we learn the lessons from Hurricane Katrina so that all of us will be safe      More Scrutiny for Corps Projects     Hurricane Katrina is going to have an affect on the entire country  but it s going to have a particularly strong impact on the projects that are handled by the Army Corps of Engineers         One of the things I m seeing in Washington  D C  is a higher level of scrutiny for Corps projects     And the priorities are shifting   They re moving down to the Gulf Coast  and they re moving back to the Corps  traditional missions    things like flood control and keeping navigation channels open   That new scrutiny means it s going to be harder to fund projects based on their economic benefits alone       Let me say that again         Because of Hurricane Katrina  all Corps projects are now facing much more scrutiny        Projects that don  t meet the Corps traditional missions are going to have a harder time getting funded         Here s what that means for us in the Pacific Northwest   Many of the projects we re working on support local economies  but that alone may not be enough in this new climate   I would suggest that as you talk about projects with Members of Congress you should acknowledge the tough budget environment and emphasize how your projects support the Corps  traditional work         I would be remiss if I didn t thank the Army Corps of Engineers for all its hard work   We have many Corps leaders with us today  and we appreciate all you do         The climate has changed  so we have to change if we re going to be effective   You still need to pick one or two priorities and speak with one voice  but what you say needs to reflect this new emphasis on the Corps  traditional missions      We Need to Invest More in Our Infrastructure   Now let me just add that I don t buy into the desire in Washington  D C  to cut investments in our critical infrastructure   I ve been saying for a long time that if we want our country to be strong  we need to make investments here at home    It s what I ve fought for and I ll continue to do it      Our Priorities    Where They Stand     In that spirit  I want to update you on where some of our priorities stand in Congress   Right now  Congress is in a recess  but we ll be back in session on Monday  and we ve got a lot of work to do in a short period of time         I m working to support your priorities in three bills           the Transportation bill        the Energy   Water bill        and the Water Resources Development Act      Transportation Bill     The Transportation bill will be the first one we debate when the Senate returns to session on Monday  October 17  2005    As the top Democrat on the transportation funding committee  I helped craft that bill  and I want to make sure that we help move our products to market safely and swiftly   So next week  I ll be down on the Senate floor  fighting for the investments we need to make in our transportation infrastructure      Energy and Water Bill   I m also using my position on the Senate Energy and Water Committee to address many of our other priorities   Right now the Energy and Water bill is in the early stages of negotiation between the House and Senate   Both chambers have passed their own versions  and we re just starting to try and reach agreement on a final version           You ll be happy to know that both versions have funding for Channel Deepening   But only the Senate version has funding for repairing the jetties at the mouth of the Columbia River   I ll have more to say about that in a moment       WRDA     The other bill I m working on is WRDA   Right now that bill is stalled in Congress so I ve taken some of the key pieces and worked to offer them as free standing bills   Last week  the Senate passed a stand alone extension of Section 214  which will help deal with the backlog on permits   I m going to keep working on all of these bills to make sure we make the investments that our communities need        Smarter Investments     Frankly  I see the federal government making some decisions that aren t too bright   Friends  we need to help the federal government make smarter decisions when it comes to our waterways    Let me share three examples            jetties        hopper dredges        and shallow draft ports      Smart Investment  1   Jetties     Making the Columbia River deeper    so it can accommodate today s vessels and lower the cost of trade for our farmers    is the right thing to do         In August  I celebrated with many of you here in Vancouver as we marked the start of construction on the deepening project   It was a great day and a deeper channel is a smart investment   But making the channel deeper  and then ignoring the jetties at the mouth of the river  doesn t make much sense         We know that thousands of feet of the north and south jetties have been lost to storms  and they could fail   According to the Army Corps of Engineers  there is a 20 percent chance of a jetty failing this year  Next year  the odds of failure double to 40 percent  and the year after that  they soar to 60 percent   That is a chance no one us can afford to take   Our investment in the channel will be lost if a jetty breaks  and the mouth of the river is closed          You  re working on it  and I am too   Together  we  ve got to convince the Administration to support us  In the meantime  I worked to secure  17 million in the Senate bill for jetty repair   Now we need to protect that money as the House and Senate reconcile their different versions of the bill      Smart Investment  2   Hopper Dredges     Here s another example of how the federal government needs to make smarter decisions   We should dredge our channels when they need to be dredged  not stop the work because of outdated federal limits         Today  the two public Hopper dredges in our region can only be used less than 200 days a year   That s not smart   The public paid for these dredges   Their job is to keep public channels clear  and we should use them as they re needed   I m working to lift the federal restriction on our region s public Hopper dredges   In the WRDA bill  we have a provision to lift that restriction           I ve taken the extra step of putting that language in the Senate s Energy and Water bill   The House bill just calls for a study   My proposal says   Lift the restrictions       Smart Investment  3   Smaller Ports     Finally  making smart investments means recognizing that all our ports have value   In Washington  D C   they might not think that a small port is all that important in the scheme of things   But tell that to someone whose    Making smart investments means standing up for all our ports    included our smallest   After all  they are often the biggest employers in their community   They need help with maintenance too   The president  s budget did not adequately request funding for these projects   I was able to add  1 million a piece to the Port of Ilwaco and Port of Chinook in the Senate bill  and I will work to maintain that funding          State   Local Investments     Let me just say in closing that just as we have to make smart choices at the federal level  we have to make smart choices at the state level   One of those choices is on the ballot in November   And it poses that same question we re facing at the federal level   Will we invest in our infrastructure  Or will we fail           Only one choice helps our economy   Only one choice creates jobs   Only one choice makes people safer  and only one choice makes our region stronger   I hope we make the right choice         I know what type of Washington I want to live in   It s one where the roads  highways and bridges are safe  where our products can get to market quickly  and where we re helping local businesses and residents   I hope we in Washington state have the courage to make the right choice         So again  I want to thank you for this honor   Let s recognize the new realities facing us in Washington  D C  and update our message for Congress and the White House   And let s also help our country to do the smart things that will pay off both today and tomorrow   Together  we are fighting for the investments that make our region stronger  and I m proud to be your partner
