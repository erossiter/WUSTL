February 21  2006     Seattle  Washington     Tonight  U S  Senator Patty Murray told members of the Seattle Mortgage Bankers Association that while there are positive developments in Washington state housing  there are serious problems beneath the surface that she needs their help to address          We can all be proud that Seattle is a place where businesses want to operate and where families want to live  but I am not satisfied with the status quo   Murray said    Underneath the surface  there are some real challenges brewing   If we don  t address them  the future we all want will be at risk          Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate subcommittee that funds and oversees federal housing and community development programs   In her speech  the Senator outlined three challenges          Getting the federal government to make the right investments in housing  transportation and jobs       Addressing the affordable housing crisis      and improving the secondary mortgage market       Murray also outlined some of her concerns with the President s budget proposal  which he submitted to Congress earlier this month        Overall  the President has proposed increasing spending on programs that promote home ownership  and that s a good thing   But at the same time  he is cutting or eliminating the tools that help people find affordable housing   That can interrupt the pipeline that s so important for moving our state forward   Murray said       Murray said she was going to  upon her return to the Capitol         As I head back to Washington  D C  next week  I ll be fighting for our priorities and for our state  There s a lot on our plate  but if we work together  we can build the type of community we all want to live in   Murray said                Senator Murray s Remarks Follow      Thank you  Joe    Joe Krumbach  president  Seattle Mortgage Bankers Association   I m honored to join all of you this evening         I think from a very young age  I understood how important your work is   I might not have known about all the finances  but I understood the value of good housing   I grew up in Bothell in a loving family that was very big    and in a house that was very small   I have six brothers and sisters   We had dogs  cats  and whatever else my siblings found wandering the streets and brought home    With my parents  we had 9 people living under one roof         9 people and 1 bathroom    Laughter    And let me tell you when you  re running late for school  and you  re 4th in line for the bathroom  you begin to appreciate people who help families move into a bigger house        My Role on Federal Housing   Since then  my perspective on housing has grown and so has my responsibility   When I first entered the U S  Senate  I served on the Banking Committee   Today  I  m the highest ranking Democrat on the committee that funds the Departments of Treasury  Transportation  and Housing and Urban Development   I  m one of four people in the country with a direct role in writing the bill that funds HUD and our government  s housing and community development programs        Today I don  t just advocate for one family looking for a bigger home but for all the communities in our state who are trying to move forward on housing   At the federal level  I m sitting at the table as the law is written  and I use that seat to fight for our state          For the past few months  I  ve been traveling throughout the state meeting with housing leaders in different communities to hear about the challenges on the ground   So I know how important housing is  not just from a personal standpoint  but in terms of making our state and community strong  supporting our economy  and protecting our way of life         As mortgage bankers  you are a critical link in helping people become homeowners and in building the types of communities we call home   You are part of the solution  and frankly you have a lot at stake in the coming months       In Washington  D C   there are a lot of things happening that will affect you  your business  and our community   The new Fed chairman has left the door open for at least another interest rate hike   The President just released his budget  and it proposes drastic changes for housing and community programs   And the Senate Banking Committee is working GSE reform   Tonight  I want to offer you an update on what I see happening  and I want to take a frank look at both the good and the bad that I see around us      Lots to Celebrate   On the positive side  we do have a lot to celebrate tonight   Our economy is growing  home ownership has reached an all time high  housing starts are soaring  and when the new Fed chair speaks we can understand him   Laughter   Closer to home  we can all be proud that Seattle is a place where businesses want to operate and where families want to live        Problems Below the Surface   But I am not satisfied with the status quo   Underneath the surface  there are some real challenges brewing   If we don  t address them  the future we all want will be at risk   For example  it  s great that people want to move here  but if our roads and transit systems can  t support them  our economy    and our quality of life    will suffer    It  s great that the national home ownership rate is approaching 70    but that doesn  t help a family who can  t afford to rent    much less buy    in King County   And it  s great that interest rates are historically low today  but if we keep piling up massive deficits    those rates won  t stay low for long      How Can Work Together for a Stronger Community    We do face some challenges  so tonight I want to explore one question   How can we work together to build a stronger community   I think the answer involves three steps         First  we need to make the right investments    in transportation  jobs and housing   I  m very concerned that the path we  re on today is not going to deliver the vibrant economy we all want       Second  we  ve got to address the affordable housing crisis    especially here in King County       And third  we  ve got to improve the secondary mortgage market   You    and your customers    deserve institutions that are more efficient  more reliable  and more transparent      1   Make the Right Investments   So let me turn to that first step    making the right investments       You know  as I meet with working families  the main concern I hear is that they don t feel secure   They re worried they could lose their job or their pension or their healthcare   They worry they won t be able to put their kids through college  There is a lot of insecurity  and we need to address that       We all want our country to be strong  and the way to do that is to invest here at home    invest in our people  in our infrastructure and in our future   We re spending a lot of money in places like Iraq    and that s appropriate  but I want to make sure we re not ignoring the homefront   In March  I visited with our soldiers in Iraq  and I was so proud of their work   They deserve our support  but they also deserve to come home to an economy that has jobs for them and opportunities for their children        Tight Budget Climate   One of the challenges we face in Washington  D C  is the tight budget environment   In the past  our government had more flexibility to meet the needs in local communities  but that has really changed  Because of the costs of Hurricane Katrina and the war  we re operating under some very tight budget limits   We can t fund everything   To me  that means we have to fund the most important things    the things that will pay back dividends for our economy and our future   That s why I m working to increase funding for education    so that our kids will be able to assume the jobs of the future   It s why I m investing in areas like job training and economic development      Invest in Transportation   One of the most important investments we can make is in transportation   I  ve been an advocate for better roads ever since I served in the Washington State Legislature   Back in the 1980 s  when I was a state Senator in Olympia  I asked for a seat on the transportation committee   Today  in the United States Senate  I m the top Democrat    and former chairman    of the committee that funds transportation projects   I ve worked to make sure the federal government is a strong partner in modernizing our roads and highways   I know that when we invest in transportation    we re investing in our future economic growth    we re making our businesses more productive  and we re helping families enjoy a better quality of life       So the first step to make our community stronger is to make the right investments   It  s a tight budget year and we can  t fund everything  but if we have the right priorities  we can make every dollar count      2   Address Affordable Housing   The second way to make our community strong is to address the affordable housing crisis   Over the past few months  I ve been traveling throughout our state meeting with the stakeholders in housing   I ve seen a wide range of challenges throughout the state   But no matter where I go  affordability is a top priority    especially here in King County   As you know  a family should spend no more than 33 percent of its income on housing   In King County  people are spending between 50 80 percent of their monthly income on housing   That means a few things   First  it means they re not saving   They re not able to put money away so that one day they can afford a down payment   They don t have much money left over to buy the goods and services that employ our neighbors  The high cost of housing can mean people are stuck in substandard housing   And it probably means they re moving further and further away    but still working in the city   That creates all types of pressures on our transportation system   It means more congestion and higher costs for businesses and families       As you all know  the affordable housing crisis certainly affects your business   We want to have a steady progression of people moving from being renters  to savers  to homeowners   If we block that pipeline    if people get trapped with rents they can  t afford    they won  t be able to save  they won  t become homeowners  they won  t come to you for a mortgage  and our region won  t get all benefits that come from having more people own their homes   So it  s important from a business perspective  and it  s important from a civic perspective       Now in Washington state  we are tackling the issue  Non profit groups  public housing agencies  and leaders from your industry work very well together with developers to leverage federal dollars to build affordable housing   These units go to rental and they go for sale   It  s a success story  but we need to do more   And we need a budget that allows us to do more       This month the President presented his budget proposal to us in Congress   I have some real concerns about some of the choices he made about housing   Next month  the HUD Secretary will come before my subcommittee and I m going to raise these issues with him       Overall  the President has proposed increasing spending on programs that promote home ownership  and that s a good thing   But at the same time  he is cutting or eliminating the tools that help people find affordable housing   That can interrupt the pipeline that s so important for moving our state forward      CDBG   For example  the President wants to cut  1 billion from the Community Development Block Grant program   Every mayor in the country uses those dollars to address affordable housing and local needs   One federal dollar leverages  30 in private capital   These dollars are used to build new affordable housing developments and in many cases provide help with down payments and closing costs for first time homebuyers   So it  s not a big investment  but it pays off big      Hope VI   The President  s budget also zeros out the Hope VI program   That program turns massive public housing projects into new mixed use communities   Those federal dollars are helping to transform public housing into new vibrant communities right here in King County         At Highpoint  the Hope VI program is providing new home ownership and affordable rental housing for our neighbors   And at Greenbridge  those dollars are transforming one of the poorest areas of King County into an exciting mixed income  mixed use community   Hope VI is making a difference here in our community   Unfortunately  the President s budget would eliminate that program      Section 8 Vouchers   The President wants to cut Section 8 vouchers  which keep people from having to spend so such a big share of their income on housing   If they can spend less on housing today  they can save to buy a home tomorrow       So I appreciate the work that you and others are doing on affordable housing at the local and state level    I just want to make sure that you re getting the support you need at the federal level      3   Improve the Secondary Mortgage Market   The third way to keep our community strong is to improve the secondary mortgage market   I think everyone here would agree that the U S  mortgage market is the most liquid  efficient  and consumer friendly in the world   That produces some real advantages for individual homeowners  for potential homeowners and for the economy overall   If we want to keep our housing finance system on a steady path  we need access to liquid funds from both American and international sources    As you all know  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have provided the critical link between the capital market and the housing market          The secondary mortgage market is one of the many reasons our whole mortgage system is so successful    But we cannot take this success for granted    We  re all familiar with Fannie and Freddie  s recent accounting scandals   We know how big they are as players in the market    And we know there are questions about their safety and soundness   I think we need a new strong and independent regulator to ensure the success of our secondary mortgage market        We do have GSE reform legislation making its way through Congress  The bill would create a new regulatory structure for Fannie  Freddie and the Federal Home Loan Banks   It would give the regulator new tools to enhance safety  soundness  disclosure  and enforcement       That is the goal  but like everything else in Congress it  s the details that matter   The House has passed one bill   In the Senate  the Banking Committee has passed another    There are some differences between the two bills and it  s not clear right now what the Senate bill will look like when it comes up for a vote   Senator Shelby  the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee  has placed passage of GSE reform legislation at the top of his list of priorities for this year   But a number of issues need to be resolved before anything can get done  including differences on affordable housing requirements  conforming loan limits and portfolio limits        As far as the timing  last week I was hearing that the Banking Committee is dealing with flood insurance reform in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  so the GSE bill could be delayed a bit  but it remains a top priority   I am hopeful that we can work through the differences and pass legislation this year to create a more effective regulatory structure so we can ensure the continued success of our mortgage market       The bottom line is this  we need to make the secondary market more transparent  more sound and more efficient  and that  s one thing I  ll be working on        So as I look at the housing landscape  I see a lot of challenges          a tight budget        a shortage of affordable housing        federal priorities that don t match our local needs        and a secondary mortgage market that we ve got to improve       But I also see good things    especially in the people who are coming together to develop solutions   I m excited about the things we can do together         As mortgage bankers  you play a key role in making housing work for families and for our economy  and I want to thank you   More importantly  I want to work with you   As I head back to Washington  D C  next week  I ll be fighting for our priorities and for our state  There s a lot on our plate  but if we work together  we can build the type of community we all want to live in                                                                 table width  180  align  center  cellpadding
