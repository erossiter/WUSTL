state  s senior Senator urges Roberts to be forthcoming in process    for the good of the country    For Immediate Release  Monday  September 12  2005           WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today joined Sens  Barbara Mikulski  D MD  and Barbara Boxer  D CA  on the floor of the U S  Senate to discuss the importance of the Supreme Court confirmation process for Americans across the country   Murray highlighted the range of issues over which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction and the responsibility of Judge Roberts to be forthcoming about his views with the American public           This is a process that the American public deserves to be involved in   Judge Roberts is being considered for a lifetime appointment and the American people deserve to know where he stands on a number of issues that affect our nation  s future     Senator Murray said            If we are going to fulfill our Constitutional duty to provide meaningful advice and consent on this nomination that consent must be informed and this process must be open    not only to the U S  Senate  but to the American people           In late August  Murray joined six of her Democratic women colleagues to deliver more than 40 000 questions to the Senate Judiciary Committee   The questions were submitted by people from all regions and all walks of life through the   Ask Roberts    Web site  which Murray helped to launch to give Americans an opportunity to submit questions they would like to be asked of Judge John Roberts during his confirmation hearings for the U S  Supreme Court         The project s website address is   or can be reached via  or        A full transcript of Senator Murray  s remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate follow       M  President  today  our country faces many challenges    we look at the suffering along the Gulf Coast  we face ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  and we face the solemn and significant task of not only filling two Court vacancies  but confirming a new Chief Justice           While the confirmation of a new Justice may not be the topic of dinner table conversations across the country tonight  the actions of the next Supreme Court Justice will impact the lives of every American family for generations to come           Last week  this Chamber mourned the passing of Chief Justice Rehnquist who served on our nation s highest court for over three decades           The great range of issues on which the Supreme Court ruled during Justice Rehnquist s tenure   from Roe v  Wade  to capital punishment  to Miranda rights  to the conclusion of a presidential election shows the American public just how closely the Court touches our daily lives           My home state of Washington is 3 000 miles away from the nation  s capital  but the issues that the Supreme Court takes on  whether it be Title IX  Imminent Domain  or a woman  s right to choose    hits home for them as well          In 1991  as a state senator  former school board member  and mother  I watched the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee            For days and days  I sat in frustration   I simply couldn t believe that this nominee was not asked about issues that I cared about   I didn t feel like the Senators in that room were representing me or asking the questions that I wanted answered            So I did something about it   I ran for the Senate   And now  thankfully  I can get my questions answered            But I remain concerned for women and men alike in my state and around the country   Certainly they have issues important to them that will come before the Supreme Court   Certainly they have questions they want answered    Not everyone will run for the Senate  but everyone should be able to have their voice heard            This is a process that the American public deserves to be involved in   Judge Roberts is being considered for a lifetime appointment and the American people deserve to know where he stands on a number of issues that affect our nation  s future          That desire    to give Americans around the country a voice in this process    is what has inspired me and my colleagues to set up a website    AskRoberts com           Through our website  we have collected tens of thousands of questions over the past several months  that have been delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee in hopes that they will be asked of Judge Roberts during his confirmation hearings            This is not an inside the beltway debate   Judge Roberts has been nominated to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land and will influence our path on issues ranging the spectrum            Many Americans must be wondering what this all means to them and how it could affect them  Well  let me make it clear            This debate is about whether we want to protect essential rights and liberties  including the right to privacy           This debate is about whether we want free and open government           This debate is about whether we want a clean  healthy environment and the ability to enforce laws to protect it fairly          And this debate is about preserving equal protection under the law           Judge Roberts has an obligation    not to the United States Senate  but rather to the American people    to make his views on these basic values known   Only then can we make a reasoned judgment on his nomination            That is why I have also joined my colleagues in calling on the Attorney General to fulfill the request made by our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for documents related to 16 key cases on which Judge Roberts played a leadership role during his service as Solicitor General            Not only is there precedent for the disclosure of these documents    similar information was provided to the Senate when it considered the nominations of Justice Rehnquist  but there is also clear imperative            If we are going to fulfill our Constitutional duty to provide meaningful advice and consent on this nomination that consent must be informed and this process must be open    not only to the members of this body  but to the American people          With the questions and concerns of Americans from coast to coast in mind  I will work to ensure that the President s nominee to fill this position will be fair and impartial  even handed in administering justice  and will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans
