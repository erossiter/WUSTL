                                                                        News Release          Murray Secures Senate Commitment to  1 5 billion in Emergency Funds for Veterans By a vote of 95 0  the Senate agrees not to backtrack by yielding to lower House of Representatives   funding level    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 12  2005                    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today led an effort on the floor of the U S  Senate to reaffirm the Senate  s commitment to provide  1 5 billion in emergency spending to fill a shortfall in the VA  s 2005 budget   The amendment passed 95 0        Murray introduced the amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill to clarify the Senate  s position following comments by Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  that the Senate would be willing to accept a lower funding number passed by the House of Representatives   Murray  s amendment to the Homeland Security bill is identical to the amendment she successfully attached to the Interior Appropriations bill at the end of June by a vote of 96 0         Two weeks ago the Senate came together  not as Republicans or Democrats  but as Americans  to do right by our nation  s veterans     Senator Murray said     The Senate agreed that our veterans need  1 5 billion and I offered my amendment today to make sure there is no backtracking and that our veterans get the help they need and deserve   This is a basic American issue that we all can and must support           Shortly following a unanimous vote on Murray  s amendment on June 29th to provide  1 5 billion in emergency spending for the VA  Majority Leader Frist stood on the Senate floor and said that the Senate should yield to the House of Representative  s lower figure of  975 million          The lower House number would uphold the current hiring freeze at the VA and no new specialists would be hired to help veterans dealing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other pressing health care needs   Yielding to the House number would also mean continuing to delay critically needed new clinics around the country    such as those planned for communities in Bellingham and Wenatchee  WA          If we backtrack    if we walk away from the  1 5 billion we promised for this year  veterans will be hurt     Murray said     Now that the Senate is on the record for a second time unanimously supporting this funding  it is time to move forward as quickly as possible to get these dollars to the VA and get our veterans the care they need and deserve           The full text of Senator Murray  s remarks on the floor today follows                                                                                         Remarks by Senator Murray Introducing The Murray Veterans Amendment to the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill      We All Supported  1 5 Billion for Veterans    Two weeks ago the Senate came together    not as Republicans and Democrats  but as Americans    to do what is right for our nation  s veterans        By a vote of 96 to nothing  we agreed to increase veterans   funding by  1 5 billion   We agreed to fill the appalling shortfall that the VA faces this year   It was a clear message that we will be there for the people who have served our country       But Then the Majority Leader Suggested Yielding to Less Support    But shortly following that unanimous vote  the Majority Leader stood on the Senate floor and said that we should yield to the House of Representative  s lower figure of  975 million   That would go against what the full Senate had just agreed to       The Appropriations Committee Supported  1 5 Billion    That proposal by the Majority Leader also went against what the Senate Appropriations Committee had agreed to earlier that same day   On a bipartisan and unanimous basis  the Appropriations committee s members reaffirmed that the Senate should approve the full  1 5 billion in immediate funding for the VA        So the Appropriations Committee and the full Senate unanimously agreed that America s veterans deserve the full  1 5 billion for this fiscal year    Then there was an attempt to accept a lower number        We need to make sure there is no backtracking and that veterans don t get shortchanged in the end       This Amendment Reaffirms Our Commitment at  1 5 billion for FY05    So  to make it clear to our nation  s veterans and to the American public  I am here on the Floor offering an amendment that clears up this confusion   It says that the Senate stands firmly behind our unanimous vote of  1 5 billion in emergency spending for veterans   healthcare       If We Backtrack    Veterans Will Be Hurt    If we backtrack    if we walk away from the  1 5 billion we promised for this year    veterans will be hurt       Hiring Freeze Will Remain    If we yield to House s  975 million  the VA hiring freeze will remain in place   That means no new mental health specialists will be hired to help veterans who are dealing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder       No New Clinics    If we yield to  975 million  the VA will not build any of the new clinics our veterans have been promised   That means more inconvenience and less access to care for the people who have sacrificed for our country       Veterans Need Help Now    This is a critical priority   We have a huge problem right now in Fiscal Year 2005   Secretary Nicholson has made it clear that the VA is at least  1 billion short this year  but we know the problem goes much deeper   Veterans are having to wait 3 years for surgery       Recruitment is Slipping    We Need to Send a Strong Signal of Support    This morning there is an Associated Press report that says the Army National Guard is having trouble recruiting the soldiers it needs        The Army National Guard  missed its recruiting goal for at least the ninth straight month in June and is nearly 19 000 soldiers below its authorized strength  military officials said Monday          The article says the Army Guard  is more than 10 000 soldiers behind its year to date goal of almost 45 000 recruits  and has missed its recruiting target during at least 17 of the last 18 months         Mr  President  many factors affect recruiting    how we care for our veterans is one of them   As George Washington said   The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country          That was George Washington in 1789  and it s still true today   We need to show today s veterans    and those who are considering military service today that we will be there for them          If the Senate retreats from what we agreed to two weeks ago  it will tell potential recruits that the VA will have a hiring freeze  and that the VA won t open any new clinics   That s the wrong message to send       This Amendment Ensures There is No Backtracking    The Senate agreed that our veterans need  1 5 billion  and I m offering this amendment to make sure there is no backtracking and that our veterans get the help they need and deserve    This is a basic American issue that we all can and must support       Your Vote Sends a Message    If you vote for this amendment  you re giving the VA money to lift the hiring freeze  hire the medical staff it needs  and open new clinics  You re telling today s soldiers and tomorrow s recruits that we will be there for them        But if you vote against this amendment  you are voting to keep your local VA hospital overwhelmed and understaffed   You re telling veterans in your state that they won t get the new clinics they were promised        Your vote will send a strong message to today s veterans and tomorrow s recruits   Let s make sure we show them that we will be there for them    as they have been there for us
