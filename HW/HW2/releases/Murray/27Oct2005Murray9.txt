                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray Statement on Harriet Miers   Withdrawal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Murray  Murray Statement on Harriet Miers   Withdrawal  10 27 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Statement on Harriet Miers   Withdrawal    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 27  2005      Today the White House announced the withdrawal of Harriet Miers   nomination to the Supreme Court   I had not taken a position on her nomination and along with my Democratic colleagues was prepared to give her a fair and diligent review  Unfortunately  after first vigorously pushing Ms  Miers  the White House now appears to have caved to right wing political pressure and compromised the nomination process to our nation  s highest court        Today our country is facing many challenges   We are cleaning up from hurricanes that have ravaged the Gulf Coast   We are fighting a war overseas   And we are confronting serious health care  education and economic challenges here at home         Americans are looking to President Bush to make decisions that unite our country   Our nation deserves a Supreme Court nominee who represents mainstream judicial practice and unites the Senate just as Justice O Connor s nomination did two decades ago        It is my hope that the President will give serious time and thought to a nominee who mainstream Americans will view as fair  ethical  independent and qualified   The President needs to take this moment to show that he is a leader for our entire country    not just an extreme few
