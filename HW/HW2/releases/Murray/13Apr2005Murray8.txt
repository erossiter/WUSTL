                                                                               News Release          Floor Remarks of Senator Murray on the Republican Power Grab  Use of the Nuclear Option    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 13  2005    Mr  President  I imagine that recently it s been pretty difficult to wake up each morning to read the newspaper if you re a federal judge   Extremists in and out of Washington  DC have declared war on the judiciary    from demanding retribution for recent decisions that lawmakers disagree with to suggesting impeachment for judges who don t toe the party line   It s discouraging  disheartening  and downright wrong          But what s so concerning about this recent rhetorical assault is that it s being backed by action    action that has nothing to do with judges and everything to do with increasing Republican power at the expense of the Constitution          Republicans are trying to increase their power by ignoring rules dating to our country s founding    They want to push through radical judicial nominees who will serve a lifetime on the bench by eliminating a two hundred year old American rule allowing each of us in the Senate to speak on behalf our constituents and fight for the ideals we hold dear          We had an election this past year  and it s true that Republicans ended up with the majority in this body   But that does not mean that half the country lost its voice   That does not mean that tens of millions of Americans have no say in our democracy   That does not mean that Republicans have carte blanche to pack the courts and ignore the rights of the minority        Mr  President  in reality  this isn  t about judges   This isn t about a Senate procedural change   This is  plain and simply  a power grab and an effort to dismantle the system of checks and balances our Founding Fathers created            Without that system  the U S  Senate would become a rubber stamp for the president          It would allow whichever political party is in power    Republican or Democratic   to have all the say over our nation  s courts      I will not stand for that          This is a basic argument about the future of the Senate and how we will conduct our business   I believe in giving the people a voice  in standing up for those who sent me here  and in protecting the rights of minorities everywhere          One of the first things every child is taught about the American government is the separation of the three braches   This separation  and the checks and balances that come with it  are fundamental to the greatest system of government ever created   This system is worth protecting  and that s exactly what I and so many of my colleagues intend to do           Mr  President  I ve already said this isn t really a debate about judicial nominations    it s about increasing the amount of power wielded by the majority   But we hear a lot about judges on this floor  so let me put that discussion in context          The judges who serve on the federal bench affect the lives and liberties of every American         These are lifetime appointments  This is not just a nomination to a commission or an ambassadorship  This is a lifetime appointment for a federal judge whose rulings over the next thirty    or maybe forty or more years    will have ramifications for every single American         As Senators  we are elected to serve our constituents  We are asked to confirm judges whose decisions can change U S  history and shape the lives of the American people for generations to come         When any citizen    Republican or Democrat  in a Blue state or Red  man or woman  no matter what race  color or creed    comes before a judge  we have a responsibility to ensure that they will get a fair shake   That citizen  no matter who or where they are  must know that our system will work for them          How can we make those assurances if Republicans alone are selecting  considering and confirming them to the courts   Unfortunately  we cannot          In addition  we expect federal judges to provide the proper check in our system of checks and balances outlined in the Constitution  Without it  our system does not function properly         We must ensure each nominee has sufficient experience to sit in judgment of our fellow citizens  will be fair to all those who come before the court  will be even handed in administering justice  and will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans        To determine if a nominee meets those standards  we must explore their record  ask questions  and weigh the responses  This is a tremendous responsibility  and one that I take very seriously         Here in the Senate we have made great progress in confirming the judges that President Bush has nominated  Just look at the figures         The Senate has confirmed 205 judicial nominees of President Bush who have come to the floor         In three years  we have stopped just 10 people whose records raise the highest questions about their abilities to meet the standards of fairness that all Americans expect         Let me repeat that  we have confirmed 205 judicial nominees  That  s a confirmation rate of 95          We  ve confirmed 205 judges    the best confirmation rate since President Reagan         Today  95  of federal judicial seats are filled  This is the lowest number of vacancies in 13 years  There are now more federal judges than ever before         Now I have to point out that while the majority is complaining today about our confirmation rate  it was a different story during the Clinton Administration  Back then  Republicans used many roadblocks to stop block the confirmation of judges who were nominated by President Clinton         During Clinton  s second term  175 of his nominees were confirmed  and 55 were blocked from getting votes  During those years  the majority used the committee process to ensure nominees they disagreed with never came to a vote  55 never received consideration         So I think the Senate has an impressive record of confirming judges  That  s clear in the 95 percent confirmation rate  the 95 percent of federal judicial seats that are filled  and the lowest number of vacancies in 13 years         Next  I  d like to talk about the process that we  ve used in Washington state to confirm judges   We  ve worked out a system to ensure that Washington judges are nominated and confirmed even when different political parties hold Senate seats or control the White House         For many years  I worked with a Republican Senator and a Democratic President to nominate and confirm federal judges  And today with a Republican President  I am working with my Democratic colleague from Washington state on a bipartisan process to recommend judicial candidates         We  ve developed a bi partisan commission process to forward names to the White House  and it has worked  Both sides have equal representation on the commission  The commission interviews and vets the candidates         It worked for Senator Gorton and I when forwarding names to President Clinton  and it is working well for Senator Maria Cantwell and I as we recommend names to President Bush  I  m proud that during President Bush  s first term we worked together to confirm five excellent judges through this bipartisan commission process         We confirmed Ron Leighton  a distinguished trial lawyer in Tacoma  who is now a U S  District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington in Tacoma         We confirmed Lonny Suko as a District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Washington State   He  s a distinguished lawyer and U S  Magistrate Judge  who  s earned the respect of so many in his work on some of Eastern Washington  s most difficult cases         We confirmed Judge Ricardo Martinez for a vacancy on the U S  District Court for the Western District of Washington   He holds the distinction of being the first Latino district judge in the history of Washington state          For over five years  he has served as Magistrate Judge for the U S  District Court in the Western District  Before that he was a Superior Court judge for eight years  He was also a King County prosecutor for ten years         I ll never forget calling Judge Martinez from just off the Senate floor after we completed the vote on his confirmation   I could hear the cheers in the background from a truly overjoyed  deserving family          Also during that first term we confirmed Judges Richard Tallman and James Robart  both of who are now serving their lifetime appointments with dignity          Mr  President  in Washington state  we  re making real bipartisan progress confirming judges  and it  s a process that I believe serves the people of Washington state well         Our record of bi partisanship makes this Republican power grab all the more outrageous          The record proves that this isn t about judges at all    this is about destroying the system of checks and balances our founding fathers created to prevent the abuse of government power and to protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans        Republicans want to destroy the independence of federal judges by rewriting the rules so they can ram through the appointment of federal judges   especially Supreme Court Justices   who will overreach and roll back the rights of the American people          Mr  President  recent comments by advocates on the other side  and even by some elected officials  have left me worried about the future of the independent judiciary   It seems many in this country are intent on running roughshod over the Constitution  bent on misusing their power to destroy fundamental principles of democracy          That s not how America works  It is not what our founding fathers intended  In our democracy  no single person and no single political party may impose extreme views on the nation   The Constitutional system of checks and balances was set up for a reason   It has worked for two centuries   There is no reason to destroy this fundamental principle now          My colleagues and I are standing up to these abuses   We re fighting to protect the historic power of this body to make sure it s not a rubberstamp for sectarian  partisan special interests   And we ll continue to do so
