                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   VA Undersecretary Calls Mental Health Care   Virtually Inaccessible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Murray  VA Undersecretary Calls Mental Health Care   Virtually Inaccessible     05 24 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          VA Undersecretary Calls Mental Health Care   Virtually Inaccessible    Murray asks VA for full accounting of mental health care at the agency    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 24  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash     a key member of the Senate Veterans Affairs  VA  Committee   today sent a letter to VA Secretary Jim Nicholson requesting a full report of the number of veterans seeking mental health services from the VA and how many of those veterans are getting the care they need         Murray  s letter follows an article in the May edition of Psychiatric News in which Frances Murphy  M D   Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at the VA  indicates that mental health and substance abuse care are not accessible at many VA facilities   When the services are available  Dr  Murphy asserts that    waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible             We need real answers from the VA and the Bush Administration     Murray said today      No gimmicks  No games  I asked for a 2007 budget that is based on real numbers and real needs at the VA  We need to know the truth about what it will cost to care of both our aging veterans population as well as those returning from operations abroad   Based on Dr  Murphy  s comments  Congress is being kept in the dark           Dr  Murphy  s comments as reported in Psychiatric News raise concerns about the validity of the VA  s claims that they have the resources needed to care for our veterans and that their fiscal year 2007 budget is based on real need          You have told me time and time again that your agency has the funding necessary to provide care for our veterans   Although I continue to doubt the VA  s ability to adequately budget based on real numbers  you insist that my fears are misplaced     Murray wrote to Nicholson     And you have assured me that veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are getting the services they need   Undersecretary Murphy says the opposite is true          Nearly 1 3 million Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   It is estimated that one third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans face mental health challenges upon their return            Caring for the mental health needs of our nation  s veterans is about American values     Murray said     If we value to strength of our families  the security of our economy and the promises we have made to our troops  then we must provide the mental health services that our veterans need and deserve                                                                    The full text of Senator Murray  s letter to VA Secretary Nicolson follows     May 24  2006       R  James Nicholson  Secretary  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20420       Secretary Nicholson        I recently read an article in Psychiatric News that leads me to believe the Department of Veterans Affairs is unprepared to serve the mental health care needs of our nation  s veterans        The article reads as follows          Frances Murphy  M D   undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   said the growing numbers of veterans seeking mental health care has put emphasis on areas in which improvement is needed  She noted that some VA clinics do not provide mental health or substance abuse care  or if they do    waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible           As you know  access to mental health services is vital to America  s veterans   The VA must ensure that resources are available to them whether facing challenges from PTSD and depression or other ailments   If we fail to provide these men and women with the care they need  we will set our nation up for the future cost and complications of veterans struggling with drug and alcohol addiction  homelessness and other conditions         In addition  with an estimated one third of the 1 3 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan facing mental health challenges upon their return  I am concerned that they are not getting the services they need   It is unacceptable that they are encountering VA waiting lists that render mental health care   virtually inaccessible           You have told me time and time again that your agency has the funding necessary to provide care for our veterans   Although I continue to doubt the VA  s ability to adequately budget based on real numbers  you insist that my fears are misplaced   And you have assured me that veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are getting the services they need   Undersecretary Murphy says the opposite is true           I would like the VA to provide a report of the number of veterans requiring mental health services from the VA and what number of those requests are being filled   Furthermore  I want to know what it will take to eliminate barriers to mental health services for our veterans   Not providing needed mental health services to our veterans is simply unacceptable          Sincerely        Patty Murray  United States Senator
