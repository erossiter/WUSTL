Washington State Law Enforcement Priorities  Bush Threatens Veto    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  October 16  2007      Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  voted to pass the Senate Commerce  Justice  and Science  CJS  Appropriations bill that funds critical law enforcement  justice and commerce programs in Washington state  The bill passed by a vote of 75 19  President Bush has threatened to veto the bill  Senator Murray delivered a speech on the Senate floor today to call for passage of this bill  In her speech  Murray discussed some of the needs of Washington state and how a veto would hurt our residents  This bill helps fund federal law enforcement and justice programs  programs that are absolutely essential if we are going to keep our neighborhoods safe  keep our justice system strong  and make sure our communities are healthy  Murray said in her speech  According to the Administration  the additional funding in this bill is  irresponsible and excessive   That is hard to fathom when this Administration is seeking over  190 billion in emergency appropriations to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  for just one year  The CJS bill contains funding for critical Washington state needs including   Community policing programs Gang violence prevention A new northern border prosecution initiative Meth enforcement and rehabilitation efforts  and Salmon restoration  The bill also contains an amendment that would require the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  to report back to Congress on where they are currently placing there agents  analysts and other personnel  The report is the first step in Senator Murray s effort to increase the federal law enforcement presence in Washington state  A series of reports by the Seattle Post intelligencer have revealed that Washington state currently has a paltry 2 1 FBI agents for every 100 000 residents  which is nearly half the national average  To read more about critical projects

Washington  D C   are more critical to the safety and well being of our communities than the one were considering today  This bill helps fund federal law enforcement and justice programs  programs that are absolutely essential if we are going to keep our neighborhoods safe  keep our justice system strong  and make sure our communities are healthy  At a time when budgets are tight and needs are great  this bill invests in the right priorities  I want to thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for their leadership and their hard work to craft this bill  But as all of us know in this chamber  despite the hard work and leadership of the CJS subcommittee to make a sound investment in the health of our communities  the President has said he will veto this bill  According to the Administration  the additional funding in this bill is irresponsible and excessive  Mr  President  that is hard to fathom when this Administration is seeking over  190 billion in emergency appropriations to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  for just one year  While this President easily spends Americans money overseas  local communities in my home state and around the country are going without the money they need for critical safety programs  The increase we are asking for is just a fraction of what this President spends on the war in one year  The money in this bill will go to revitalize programs that have been overlooked by this Administration  My home state  for example  is experiencing a dangerous shortage of FBI agents  who do essential work to ensure that we prevent another terrorist attack at home and who perform essential law enforcement duties  That shortage is just one of many examples of how this President has mixed up the nations priorities  This bill is a small step toward fixing some of those years of problems  In my home state  the lack of FBI agents for critical law enforcement needs has been a serious concern for some time  But the urgency of this situation was driven home recently in a series of articles by the Seattle Post Intelligencer  The papers first article noted that since 9 11  the White House and the Justice Department have failed to replace at least 2 400 agents transferred from law enforcement to counterterrorism  leaving far fewer agents on the trail of identity thieves  con artists  hatemongers and other criminals  The article also found that Washington state has a mere 2 1 FBI agents for every 100 000 residents  thats nearly half the national average  This past week  I met with police chiefs and sheriffs from across Washington state  They agreed that this shift has had real impacts on state and local law enforcement  One police chief told me that the FBI had virtually disappeared from white collar crime investigations  A sheriff said that local law enforcement now investigates and prosecutes over 90 percent of all bank robberies  even though this has traditionally been an FBI responsibility  And another police chief said that the FBI does not have the law enforcement resources to adequately staff anti gang task forces  even as the gang presence and gang related crime increases in our communities  All of these sheriffs and police chiefs had nothing but praise for the essential work FBI agents perform in their communities  But even as the FBI focuses on counter terrorism  they asked that it not abandon law enforcement  The Seattle FBI field office has remained understaffed  even for counter terrorist agents  This is especially troubling because Washington states industry leading companies  international seaports and important military facilities make it a prime target for terrorist attack  And three years from now  thousands of people will travel through our state to attend the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics  We need to be prepared for the worst  Yet currently  Washington state ranks 35th in per capita FBI agents  Clearly  this makes no sense  I want to thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby for working with me on this issue  specifically on an amendment that would end this disconnect and ensure that we are placing our FBI agents where they can best protect our communities  It also will get the FBI to tell us how it intends to distribute its resources  This amendment is the first step toward ensuring that the FBIs priorities are in sync with our countrys security needs and its own stated priorities  I want to commend Senator Mikulski for her recognition of this need  Her work to include additional funding for the FBI in this bill is a good first step  The next step is to increase funding to hire  train  and place new FBI agents throughout the country  This will help to begin to ease the burden the FBI has had to bear since 9 11 changed its mission  But  as we all know  more funding is needed  Unfortunately  because this President believes that increasing our FBI budget is irresponsible and excessive  and he plans to veto this bill  we wont be able to make the necessary investments today that will make our country more secure tomorrow  Mr  President  while federal agents are critically important to maintaining the security of our country  we all know that our state and local law enforcement are the real guardians for our communities  In the post 9 11 world  we have asked them to place counter terrorism at the top of their priorities  But criminals havent stopped abusing children  robbing stores  or dealing drugs  The local police have been told that they need to do more with less  But we have reached a point where we simply cant ask them to do more without help  A recent FBI crime report showed that after a decade of declines  violent crime is rising for the second straight year  We need to make sure that it doesnt rise again  This bill restores funding for state and local law enforcement to nearly  2 7 billion  filling a major gap after the President cut its budget in half  This will provide  1 4 billion for state and local law enforcement grants  which includes  550 million for COPS grants and over  500 million for Byrne Grants  These funds support anti drug and anti gang task forces around the country  They fund communications equipment that will help police and emergency response teams talk to each other  something that is still desperately needed in all of our communities  These grants also fund critical programs around the country to deal with the spread of methamphetamines  Police chiefs and sheriffs have consistently told me that these grants were absolutely essential to their ability to protect our communities  And they were even more important now that weve demanded local law enforcement to take on more responsibilities  Unfortunately  because this President believes that increasing resources to our local police is irresponsible and excessive we wont be able to make those critical investments  Mr  President  this bill also addresses vital commercial and economic interests across the nation  In my home state  that means helping to ensure a healthy  sustainable salmon population  In Washington state  healthy salmon mean a healthy economy  Thats why Im thankful that this bill includes  90 million in funding for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund  This money will help support our states coordinated effort to restore salmon runs and preserve a way of life in the Pacific Northwest  Mr  President  when I talk with leaders in my home state about the need to restore our salmon populations  they call it critical  When I go home and discuss with law enforcement officials  experts and the media  about the need to increase the number of FBI agents  they say it is an urgent problem  When I talk to local police and sheriffs about the need for COPS and Byrne grants  they say these grants are crucial to the security and safety of our communities  Yet when I return to Washington  D C   Im told by this President that the money that is so desperately needed at home is irresponsible and excessive  It couldnt be clearer that this President is out of step with the priorities of the people of my state and the people of this country  We have presented him with a measured  responsible bill to bolster our security and build our economy  and he has decided to reject it  I want to urge all my colleagues to support this bill and send the President a message from our constituents at home  That he is taking our countrys safety and economic well being in the wrong direction  and that we need to change focus and give our communities what they need to be safe  and sound  and secure
