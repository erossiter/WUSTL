Senator Says Days of Republican Rubber Stamp on Bush s War Policies Are Over                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 28  2007     Washington  D C     In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  rebutted claims by another Senator who said that during wartime Congress s only duty is to support the president   Murray also spoke of the need to screen and treat Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   which is estimated to affect 10 percent of U S  service members from Iraq and Afghanistan       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  since this body recessed 10 days ago  I ve been once again outraged to see report after report detailing this Administration s complete failure to care for our troops and our veterans          What s worse  since we returned on Monday  I ve heard several of my Republican colleagues attempt to question our patriotism and our support for our troops   So I felt compelled to come to the floor to speak up          For more than four years this Administration has failed to plan for the true cost of this war   They ve demanded blind loyalty from Congress  asking for rubber stamps on their  Emergency  budgets  avoiding oversight and pursuing their own strategy in the face of criticism from members of Congress  generals  and the American public          Yesterday  Senator Mel Martinez  R FL   I thought  encapsulated the White House position better than I ever could   He said        SEN  MARTINEZ   AT A TIME OF WAR  THE CONGRESS SHOULD DO ONLY ONE THING  WHICH IS TO SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT  TO TRY TO UNITE BEHIND OUR TROOPS AND UNITE BEHIND OUR EFFORT        I couldn t disagree more   As elected members of congress  and even as mere citizens of this country  we can and we must question the policies implemented by our government   And in no time is that more important than in a time of war  when the lives of our bravest men and women are on the line          But you don t just need to take me at my word   Even General Peter Pace  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  told a Congressional hearing recently that our troops understand the need for debate back home and are sophisticated enough to know that debate doesn t equate to lack of support          But that debate and all oversight was stifled for years   Unfortunately for us all  for the first years of this war  Congress was under Republican control   That control led to a stunning lack of oversight  an outrageous number of rubber stamps  and an impotence from this Congress that shames us all          Well  those days are over          I don t have the time this morning to outline each and every failure by this Administration   I don t have the time to detail the many ways that this Administration has failed our troops   I don t have the time to detail the many ways this Administration has also failed our veterans          So instead  I ve decided to speak as frequently as I must to get this Administration to pay the troops and our veterans the attention they deserve    I and my Democratic colleagues are committed to supporting our troops from the battlefield all the way back to their local VA and everywhere in between   We ve worked hard to ensure they get the care they deserve  the care they ve earned          My worry is that this Administration continues to be slow to react to these problems   and rarely if ever takes proactive measures to stop these many problems before they even begin          From sending our troops to war without critical armor  to housing them in squalor at Walter Reed  to leaving them to fend for themselves when they need mental healthcare  the Bush Administration is utterly failing our service members  our veterans and their families       Traumatic Brain Injury    Nowhere is that failure more apparent than in the handling of what will one day become known as the signature wound of this war   Traumatic Brain Injury   It s estimated that 10 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have suffered Traumatic Brain Injury during their service          One of the biggest problems with TBI is that it is an unseen wound  Often it s misdiagnosed   In many cases  unless a service member involved in an IED incident is bleeding  he or she won t be documented as having been involved in an explosion   As a result  the actual number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with TBI could be even higher than statistics indicate   We owe it to our men and women in uniform on this floor and say we will do everything to help you   We will screen for TBI  we will document TBI  and we will not fail to treat veterans suffering from this injury   It s clear that our system is not catching all of the TBI patients this war is producing         In a special broadcast that I hope each and every one of my colleagues saw last night  ABC news anchor Bob Woodruff detailed his experience with a Traumatic Brain Injury          I was moved by Bob s struggle with his injury  his families unrelenting hope for recovery  and their ongoing work toward triumph over this horrible situation    While Bob has seen a tremendous recovery from this horrendous injury  I fear that the care he received has not been duplicated for thousands of other troops when they returned home   He detailed several cases of soldiers suffering from injuries not unlike his own and the lack of care they received when they left flagship care centers for smaller  local hospitals   While so many of us know that this injury has become the signature wound of this war  I fear that last night s program once again showed that this Administration  and the VA in particular  has not yet stepped up to the plate to handle the crush of troops with brain injuries returning each and every day          What s worse  I m concerned that we do not even know the real number of troops who are suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries   The Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center gathers information on these injuries  but has thus far refused to release it publicly   Collected at tax payer expense  this information could  I hope  provide us with a baseline of how many of our troops have suffered from a Traumatic Brain Injury   an important starting point for dealing with these terrible injuries          What we do know is that while the Department of Defense claims less than 30 000 troops have been injured during this war  205 000 troops have enrolled for care at the VA   By any accounting  those numbers just don t add up          That s why yesterday  I asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to provide us with data compiled by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center on the actual number of TBI victims   While we do not yet have that information  I see no reason that it should not be shared with Congress and the American people          In addition  I was heartened to hear that the Department of Veterans Affairs  in a long overdue step forward  finally announced yesterday that they will begin screening every recent combat veteran for TBI          But we must do more   We cannot simply take Department of Veterans Affairs at their word  as their record of care and openness has left much to be desired   And this cannot be an issue solely for the VA to handle   We must develop a system to address Traumatic Brain Injuries from the battlefield all the way back to a local VA hospital   Screening is important   Pre and post deployment screening must be done   This signature wound must be a top priority at each and every step along the long path to recovery for wounded members of the armed services          Mr  President  the bottom line is that we have not yet offered our brave men and women fighting abroad a real plan to take care of them when they return home   The Department of Defense and the Veterans Affairs must come together to solve the many problems plaguing the system          And I pledge to them  to our fighting men and women and to their families  that this new Democratic Congress will hold them accountable for their inaction and ensure that we finally give these men and women all that they deserve when they return home
