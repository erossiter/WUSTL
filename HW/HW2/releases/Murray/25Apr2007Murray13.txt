Experts    Demand Benchmarks from the Iraqi Government  Refocus the Fight Against Terrorists    and Sign the Supplemental that Funds our Troops and Veterans    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 25  2007        Washington  D C     This morning  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  delivered a major address on the Senate floor laying out a responsible direction forward in Iraq      Senator Murray s Remarks Follow    Mr  President  I am here to speak on the floor today because American lives  American security  and America s future are on the line in Iraq   The American people know it   They sent a clear message in November        The Iraq Study Group told us   They gave us honest assessments and recommendations to move forward in Iraq       The President Is Ignoring Military Experts   Generals have spoken out  General Casey told us in January         The longer we in the U S  Forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq s security  it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias         General Abizaid told us in November         I do not believe that more American troops right now is the solution to the problem         Colin Powell has also talked about it         I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian violence  this civil war  will work         The numbers Mr  President  speak for themselves  More than 3 300 Americans have died in Iraq  and nearly 25 000 have been wounded   A few days ago  nine more US soldiers were killed in a bombing  and twenty more US troops and one Iraqi soldier were injured        Americans have heard the military experts and the Iraq Study Group  and they have seen the sacrifice of our troops and their families and now they are demanding a change in course   But sadly the President still refuses to listen   He is ignoring military experts  the Iraq Study Group and the American people       Now Is the Time   It is clear the Iraqi civil war requires a political solution  not a military solution   Our service members have done everything we ve asked them to   They deserve better than to be stuck in the middle of a civil war   Four years into this war   starting the fifth year    the President is still tossing around heated rhetoric while trying to convince the American people that Democrats don t support the troops   I reject that rhetoric  and I call on him to put politics aside and begin to put our troops first   We can all agree that it s long past time for that         Now is the time to show our troops that we support them with the funds and supplies and armor they need  but that we also support them enough to change direction when the current course simply is not working       Now is the time to show our troops that we respect our military  and we refuse to decimate the world s finest fighting forces through extended deployments  limited time at home  and the destruction of valuable equipment in another country s civil war       Now is the time to show our troops that their lives mean more than an open ended commitment to an Iraqi government that has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and take ownership for their own future       Now is the time to show our troops that we understand that America needs them   not in the middle of the Iraqi civil war   but in places like Afghanistan  where al Qaeda is growing in strength        And now is the time to show our troops that their government is about more than promises and rhetoric   We must stand together to say that we will meet the needs of our injured service members and our veterans who have paid the price for this Administration s failure to plan for the war and its aftermath       Congress is moving forward now to pass a supplemental bill that shows our troops they come first   All the President has to do is sign on the dotted line        Political  not Military Solution   Unfortunately  because the Bush Administration failed to plan and failed to understand centuries old tensions in the region  we now   more than ever   need a political and diplomatic solution in Iraq   As the past two months have brutally revealed  the escalation is not working   The civil war has intensified and our troops are stuck in the middle of sectarian violence and find themselves the target of insurgent attacks   It is hard to argue that the situation on the ground   both for our troops and for Iraqis  has gotten better        Last Wednesday  the New York Times reported that         Bombs ripped through the streets of Baghdad killing at least 171 people in the deadliest day in the capital since the American led security plan for the city took effect two months ago       Two days ago  the Boston Globe noted that         The deaths raised to 85 the number of U S  service members who died in Iraq in April  making it the deadliest month for American troops since December  when 112 died       And according to the Associated Press         Outside the capital  1 504 civilians were killed between Feb  14 and Thursday  April 12 compared with 1 009 deaths during the two previous months         It is time to transition our mission in Iraq from that of policing a civil war   Our troops are trained for combat  not for refereeing warring factions with a long and complex history   It s time to focus on strengthening America s security and bringing our troops home        Transitioning the mission should center on three realistic and achievable goals for our military         Training and equipping Iraqi security forces        Conducting targeted counter terrorism operations        And protecting our remaining U S  forces and interests in Iraq      We Need a Diplomatic and Political Surge   The second part of the equation is a surge in diplomatic and political efforts   This is a necessary task the President has refused to undertake   America alone does not own the keys to Iraq s future   Iraq s neighbors must help as well   They should play a larger role in training Iraqi military and police and in reconstruction   And they should play a larger role in convincing Iraqis they must make compromises and take responsibility for their future   Without a targeted and serious regional effort to stabilize Iraq  the country s future will remain in question       The cause of continued insecurity and destruction has not been our military   but rather the political and policy failures of a President who has hid in his bunker and stubbornly refused to pursue a strategy needed to bring stability to Iraq      Iraqis Must Meet Reasonable Benchmarks   As we all saw vividly in November  the American people have lost patience with the President s go it alone strategy   It is simply wrongheaded to continue on with an open ended commitment to an Iraqi government that has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and take responsibility for their own country        The Supplemental bill that we will send to the White House requires the President to send a report to Congress by July 1 this year certifying whether Iraq is meeting reasonable benchmarks   The American people deserve to know if the sacrifices made by our troops are being met by the Iraqi government       Specifically  the American people deserve to know         If the Iraqi government has given U S  and Iraqi security forces the authority to pursue all extremists    including Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias       If Iraq is making substantial progress in delivering necessary Iraqi Security Forces for Baghdad and protecting those forces from political interference        And we deserve to know if Iraq is intensifying efforts to build balanced security forces throughout Iraq that provide even handed security for all Iraqis        Specifically  we deserve to know if the Iraqi government is making substantial progress in meeting reconciliation initiatives  including          enacting laws to equitably share oil revenue among all Iraqi regions       whether they re adopting laws for provincial and local elections        whether they re reforming laws banning members of the Baath party from public service        and whether they re shouldering the cost of reconstruction through allocation of oil revenue       Mr  President  those are reasonable benchmarks that Americans should require of the Iraq if we are asking our young Americans to put their lives on the line       That is why Congress has agreed to this supplemental request which begins the phased redeployment of our troops no later than October 1 of this year with a goal of removing all combat forces by April 1  2008   with the exception of those who will remain to         train and equip Iraqi security forces       to Continue targeted counter terrorism operations       and to protect our remaining U S  forces       Honor Our Commitment to Our Troops and Veterans   Mr  President  from sending our troops to war without critical armor  to housing them in squalor at Walter Reed  to leaving them to fend for themselves when they need mental healthcare  the Bush Administration has utterly failed our service members  our veterans  and their families   Mr  President  as we rightfully change the mission of our troops in Iraq and prepare to redeploy  we cannot   and we must not   forget about our veterans when they come home        Nowhere is that failure more apparent than in the handling of what will one day become known as the signature wound of this war   Traumatic Brain Injury  It s estimated that 10 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have suffered Traumatic Brain Injury during their service   Now one of the biggest problems with TBI is that it is an unseen wound  And often because of that it it s misdiagnosed  In many cases  unless a service member involved in an IED incident is bleeding  he or she won t be documented as having been involved in an explosion if he was 100 yards away or 200 yards away   As a result  the actual number of OIF and OEF veterans with TBI could be even higher than statistics indicate       Now I know many of us are now familiar with ABC news anchor Bob Woodruff  s experience with Traumatic Brain Injury   I personally was really moved by Bob s struggle with his injury  his family s unrelenting hope for recovery  and their ongoing work toward triumph throughout this horrible situation        While Bob has seen a tremendous recovery from this horrendous injury  I fear that the care he received has not been duplicated for thousands of other troops when they return home   He detailed for us several cases of soldiers suffering from injuries   not unlike his own   and the lack of care they received when they left flagship care centers for our smaller  local hospitals         Mr  President  our wounded warriors and veterans have faced massive budget shortfalls  horribly long waiting lines  and sickening hospital conditions  but this Administration continues to be reactive to the problems to this day   It s time for this posture to end   Taking care of our troops  taking care of our veterans  taking care of their families must be a cost of this war       When it comes to caring for our troops and veterans  this Administration    from the White House  to the Pentagon  to the Department of Veterans Affairs    has consistently waited until conditions reached a critical stage before taking action to remedy them        Our Supplemental Funds our Troops  Armor and Veterans   In the Supplemental Conference Report that we re sending to the President  Congress says enough is enough   We are finally providing more funding for our troops than even the President himself has sought         This bill we re sending includes over  100 billion for the Department of Defense  which is nearly  4 billion more than the President s request for our troops   We provide critical funding for vehicles that will help protect our troops from these horrible IEDs       This military has also been brought to the brink by a President who has time and again extended their tours and called upon our National Guard and Reserve to join active combat brigades in Iraq         This supplemental bill will rebuild our overburdened military and calls for an end to the deployment of non battle ready troops  It provides  1 8 billion for the VA to provide first class health care to our wounded and  2 5 billion for military health care       For the last four years  this Administration has conducted this war with little regard for the tremendous strains it is placing on the VA  on our veterans and their families   Today  we put an end to their neglect  The days of ignoring our wounded warriors as a cost of this war are over      Continue the Fight on Terror   As the President acknowledged in a speech last September  our terrorist enemies are more dangerous than ever   On that point  the President is correct   But unfortunately  he fails to acknowledge that terrorists are rapidly growing and gathering strength outside of Iraq  And he fails to acknowledge that having our forces policing a civil war in Iraq is sapping our ability to combat terrorism across the globe  It s clear that terrorist cells with heavy anti American bents have gained power and continue to grow in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan   If we turn a blind eye to those anti American cells and focus only on Iraq  the consequences for America s future security are dire   By redeploying our forces  we can re concentrate on the war on terror   We can devote our resources toward pursuing those who would do America harm       Meet Our Needs at Home   And as we deal with the situation overseas  we cannot neglect our needs here at home   That s why this supplemental bill provides          1 8 billion for veterans  healthcare          20 million to repair Walter Reed Hospital         6 9 billion to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina         650 million for the SCHIP children s health program to address the shortfall facing children in 14 states        and  2 25 billion to secure the homeland   a vital need    including   port and border security  transit security  screening for explosives at airports  and screening cargo on passenger aircraft          Now somehow the White House is claiming that all these investments are somehow unnecessary   I think most Americans would disagree   I know most Americans want us to take care of our citizens here at home         In recent weeks  we ve heard some false claims about this supplemental that I want to take a moment to correct       First  we are moving this bill to the President at a rapid pace   In fact  we re moving even faster than the Republicans did last year  and the year before that       Second  we are doing our job in meeting the needs here at home   Anyone who thinks domestic needs should be ignored in an emergency supplemental ought to look at the past four supplementals      all written and passed by a Republican Congress  and signed by a Republican President          The emergency supplementals approved by Republican Congresses in 2003  2004  2005 and 2006 included funding for domestic needs   And interestingly  during these years  the President never complained about domestic funding in supplementals        Mr  President  as our government spends billions in Iraq  I believe it s our job to also meet needs here at home       President s Veto Threat   If the President vetoes this bill  he will have to explain to the American people          why he is delaying funding to our troops overseas       why he is blocking funding to care for our injured troops        why he is ignoring the will of military experts  the Iraq Study Group and the American people       he s going to have to explain why he is ignoring the needs of hard hit communities that are struggling to recover        and why he is standing in the way of the security needs here at home at our ports  airports  and borders        Congress has agreed to a supplemental bill that shows our troops that they come first   The President has repeatedly reminded Congress that he is the Commander in Chief  and that he is the one with the authority to make the military and policy decisions that impact not only our troops and veterans  but  the well being of our Gulf Coast  our borders and  indeed  the future of America s security       Mr  President  the President is alone in his bunker        If he truly cares about getting this funding to our troops as soon as possible and providing them with the supplies  health care and direction they deserve  he will quickly sign this bi partisan bill       Mr  President  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is just a short distance from Capitol Hill  but if the President vetoes this sensible legislation to give our troops a successful path forward in Iraq  then he is miles away from the will of the American people  for whom he serves
