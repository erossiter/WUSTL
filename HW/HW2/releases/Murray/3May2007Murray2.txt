                                                     News Release          Housing  Murray Chairs Hearing to Examine HUD Budget for 2008      For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 3  2007     Washington  D C     On Thursday  May 3rd Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation Housing and Urban Development to examine the Fiscal Year 2008 budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson testified at the hearing       The following is Senator Murray s opening statement from the hearing      Housing is one of the most important but least talked about challenges across our country today          People don t want to talk about how close they are to losing their homes or not being able to afford their rent   I think there s something in our society that makes people feel like they ve somehow failed if they can t afford housing   But with housing prices on the rise  it s a challenge facing more and more American families   In fact  housing has become the silent epidemic facing far too many communities across our country        The reach of this epidemic was reinforced for me last month when I convened a roundtable on affordable housing in the Puget Sound region of my state          I brought together realtors  bankers  along with representatives from public housing agencies and transit agencies   Together  we discussed the extraordinary financial pressures being placed on working families in the Puget Sound and how we might address them           As families are forced to move away from their jobs in order to obtain affordable housing  citizens in a great many cities across the nation are spending an inordinate number of hours commuting from their neighborhood to their workplace and back   These are hours that they can t spend with their children and their families   These are hours when parents could be supervising homework or watching a little league game   Instead  they are spent crawling through punishing traffic jams            Swedish Hospital is one of the premier medical centers in downtown Seattle in my home state of Washington   The recruitment director at Swedish Hospital recently told a Seattle newspaper that more than half of the employees don t actually live in Seattle proper and it is typical for their employees to commute for at least a full hour to a home or a rental property they can afford          It is not just young families seeking to own a home that can t find affordable housing   HUD Section 8 voucher recipients also struggle to find affordable rental units and landlords that will take vouchers   This means endless hours  often on public transportation  just to get to and from work        As a result  Seattle continues to rank as one of the most congested cities in the country   And we have a great many cities facing the identical mix of challenges across the country          The congestion problem has gotten so troubling that our Transportation Secretary  Mary Peters  has made funding for a number of new congestion mitigation initiatives the cornerstone of her 2008 budget          However  as I review Secretary Jackson s 2008 budget for HUD  I do not see the same sense of urgency or importance being devoted to the problem of affordable housing   Instead  I see a budget that abdicates responsibility and shortchanges programs serving some of the nation s neediest citizens          Despite the strong support by Republican and Democratic mayors and governors across the country  President Bush s housing budget again proposes to slash the Community Development Block Grant Program   This year  it s a cut of 20 percent  a reduction of almost three quarters of a billion dollars            The President s budget fails to provide even an inflation adjustment for the Section 8 tenant based housing assistance program   That means that  as rents rise  public housing agencies will have to trim the ranks of their Section 8 recipients  potentially throwing some of them into homelessness            HUD s program for housing the elderly is cut by 22 percent   a reduction of  160 million   despite the fact that the number of needy seniors continues to rise   And HUD s program to house citizens with disabilities is slashed by 47 percent  almost in half  a cut of almost  110 million            Funds to ensure that public housing is maintained and brought up to safety codes are slashed by 17 percent  or  415 million   Even programs designed to remove lead paint from low income housing units with children are cut by 23 percent            And the HOPE VI program that has allowed us to tear down some of the most dilapidated public housing and replace it with modern  mixed income units  is proposed for complete elimination            In fact  the President wants this subcommittee to go one step further when it comes to HOPE VI by reopening the Appropriations bill that he already signed for 2007 so that we can also eliminate the funding we provided for HOPE VI for the current fiscal year           The President s budget for HUD is irresponsible and unacceptable on its face   But it is all the more startling considering his investment in housing and infrastructure in Iraq        Over the past four years   the President has asked American taxpayers to spend almost  36 billion to build housing and utilities and other necessary infrastructure in Iraq          Unfortunately  the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has reported to us that a frightening percentage of that  36 billion has been wasted or stolen          Despite these reports  the President has sought   and received   an additional  2 billion to rebuild Iraq in the Supplemental Appropriations bill that he vetoed just two days ago          The President sees no problem in investing up to  38 billion to rebuild the nation of Iraq  but when it comes to rebuilding America s struggling communities through the Community Development Block Grant program  the President is calling for a cut of three quarters of a billion dollars to the program          In fact  the President is unwilling to provide even 10 percent of what we ve invested in Iraq s reconstruction  to rebuild and provide some hope to the run down neighborhoods here at home        The President s budget and supplemental requests are a clear statement of his priorities   Unfortunately  far too frequently  these priorities are out of step with those of the American people           As Chair of this subcommittee  I will work to put our budgets and our priorities back on track         Earlier this year  we held a hearing with Secretary Jackson s Federal Housing Administrator  Brian Montgomery    During that hearing  it became clear that  at a time when we are facing a historic level of foreclosure and a potential crisis in the availability of loan capital for low and middle income home buyers  the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  has become an increasingly irrelevant player in the market          In my home state of Washington  while the FHA covered 80 percent of the home loan activity of the Washington State Housing Finance Commission some ten years ago  it covers only 20 percent today   Nationwide it represents only 3 percent of total mortgage volume          I believe it is essential that we revive the FHA and make it a relevant player in the market again  especially now when we have a great many families facing foreclosure because of the upheaval in the sub prime market          I look forward to discussing with Secretary Jackson this morning how the FHA might develop solutions to keep these families in their homes          I also want to discuss how the FHA can get back to the business of providing access to first time homebuyers who want to live near where they work   who want to spend time with their families rather then time in ever worsening traffic jams          Finally  I would like to examine with the Secretary what HUD is doing to address the housing crisis that faces the communities devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita          For weeks  Americans across the country were glued to their televisions simply overwhelmed by the pictures of tremendous devastation and unfathomable suffering of so many of our fellow Americans   The images were almost too much to bear   watching families without food and water  people who were trapped on their roofs  and people searching for their loved ones        And  although the TV cameras have left the Gulf Coast   for far too many  the suffering continues still         Damage estimates indicate that over 300 000 homes were damaged or destroyed by those hurricanes at a cost of over  67 billion           Mr  Secretary  this is arguably the biggest housing crisis of the modern era        This Committee invested an unprecedented level of resources to rebuild that housing stock and assist the region in their recovery          I would like to hear from you exactly how the resources and legal authorities that we granted HUD are being used to improve the lives and communities of our Gulf Coast residents          I would now like to recognize my Ranking Member  Senator Bond
