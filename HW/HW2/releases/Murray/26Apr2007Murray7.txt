                                                                   News Release          Murray Examines OSHA s Failures Under Bush Administration at Senate Hearing Testimony from experts  WA state healthcare worker highlight OSHA s inaction and inadequate protections under Bush administration    For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 26  2007         Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing of her HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee to examine the shortcomings of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   Today s hearing was the first comprehensive Senate oversight hearing on OSHA under the Bush administration  The hearing featured testimony from an injured Washington state nurse and experts on worker s safety   Senator Murray questioned the administration s enforcement of regulations and their inability to set new standards  She also described the human cost of OSHA s policies         Over the last 6 years  I have grown deeply concerned that OSHA is no longer living up to its mission to  assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women    Murray said quoting the original OSHA goals outlined in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970   Health care  construction  and low wage workers come to my office and tell me that they don t have the protections they deserve  Sixteen people a day and nearly 6 000 people a year are still dying in work related accidents across this country  This is way too many   It is abundantly clear that much more work needs to be done to reform OSHA so we can begin to make OSHA work for working Americans       WA State Worker Knows There Is Work to Be Done   Today s hearing included testimony from   a nurse at Valley Medical Center in Renton  Washington  Ms  Compagna is a labor and delivery nurse  She suffers from shoulder and elbow injuries that prevent her from working almost anywhere else in the hospital  Ms  Compagna spoke about many of the difficulties healthcare workers have in getting adequate protection from OSHA         I am here to tell you what my co workers and I want you to know  our government s safety net to protect workers from health and safety hazards is broken   Ms  Compagna said   In the past decade  hospital workers have eclipsed the injury and illness rates of workers in mining  manufacturing  or even construction   There are no standards to stem the tide of neck  back  and shoulder injuries caused by the manual lifting and transferring of patients  There are no standards to protect workers from tuberculosis  SARS  weapons of mass destruction  pandemic flu  or other airborne biological agents  I call upon this committee to push the federal government to expand standard setting and enforcement to protect workers in the largely neglected fastest growing sectors of the economy       Government Statistics Miss 66 Percent of Workplace Injuries    a research professor and Acting Chairman of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at George Washington University  cited research showing that the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  dramatically undercounts the number of injured workers         Two thirds are simply missed   Dr  Michaels said    The number and cost of preventable work related injuries and illnesses occurring in the United States are unacceptably high   Furthermore  the true incidence of these conditions is far higher than reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics since these data do not include approximately two thirds of occupational injuries and illnesses        Dr  Michaels said that while the BLS says injury rates are falling   most of this decrease can be attributable to changes in OSHA recordkeeping rules       Lax Enforcement from OSHA    director of safety and health at the AFL CIO  testified that OSHA has too few resources  and it s enforcement has been infrequent and weak        In 2007  the promise of a safe job for every American worker is far from being fulfilled   Ms  Seminario testified    Under the Bush Administration  voluntary partnerships and consultations with employers have been favored over setting new standards and industry wide enforcement initiatives   With this approach  OSHA has abandoned its leadership role in safety and health  choosing to work with individual employers  rather than taking bold action to bring about broad and meaningful change in working conditions on an industry wide and national level        Ms  Seminario also noted that OSHA has too few inspectors        At its current staffing and inspection levels  it would take federal OSHA 133 years inspect each workplace under its jurisdiction just once   Ms  Seminario said      Working to Reform OSHA   Senator Murray is a co sponsor of Senator Edward Kennedy s  D MA    which would institute critical OSHA reforms
