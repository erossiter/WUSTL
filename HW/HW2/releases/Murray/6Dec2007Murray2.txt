                                                          News Release          Murray  New VA Secretary Must Fight for Best Interests of Veterans Senator Patty Murray s Opening Statement    For Immediate Release  Thursday  December 6  2007        Chairman Akaka  thank you for holding todays hearing     Mr  Chairman  this is a critical time in the VAs history  With our troops fighting overseas and more veterans being created every day  we are facing unprecedented challenges as we try to provide the level of care all of our heroes have earned  Too many leaders at the VA have done the agency  and our veterans  a disservice  Too many have been apologists for failed Administration policies  rather than strong advocates for our veterans    Our veterans earned the benefits the VA is supposed to provide them  But they have been faced with long waiting times to see a doctor  bureaucratic ineptitude  a VA claims backlog of months and sometimes years  and much  much more  We shouldnt dwell on the mistakes of the past  but we need to learn from those mistakes  We have an opportunity now to do that as we decide who will be the next Secretary of the VA    Whether to confirm General James Peake may be the most important decision we make on veterans issues in the next year  As I often say  no matter how Americans feel about the war in Iraq  they want to make sure we are providing for our veterans and their families  I stand ready and willing to work with any Secretary who is committed to truly fighting for the best interests of veterans  Is Peake the Secretary Veterans Deserve    So  Mr  Chairman  I look forward to hearing from General Peake today    General Peake has had a distinguished career and an impressive history of service to his country  For most of his nearly 40 years in the military  he has been devoted to improving medical care for our wounded servicemen and women  including a stint as Army Surgeon General    He has also held numerous positions within the Army  including commanding general of the Madigan Army Medical Center in my home state of Washington  But a strong resume is not enough     We need a leader at the VA who has the fortitude  the backbone  and the courage to stand up to the Administration  to be honest and upfront about our veterans current and future needs  and to get us on the right course to caring for these heroes who risked their lives for our country  Today  I hope well find that General Peake is the VA Secretary that our veterans deserve    Challenges Facing the VA   Mr  Chairman  our VA system is uniquely positioned to recognize and treat the specialized injuries  medical conditions  and mental health challenges caused by combat and military missions  Our local VA doctors and nurses are some of the most caring and compassionate people around  I know they are dedicated to giving our veterans the best care possible     Before I go any further  I want to show you a button that leaders from our local VA were wearing at a listening session I held last week in Yakima  Washington  But our service members deserve better than what they have been getting from the Administration and VA leadership in Washington  D C   in recent years     Congress has Taken Some Important Steps   Congress has taken some important steps to fix some of the problems  Yet we still have huge challenges  For example  thanks to recent advances in battlefield medicine  our troops are surviving many injuries that would have been fatal in earlier conflicts  Some of those advances were overseen by General Peake  However  many more of our service members are coming home with devastating and debilitating wounds  creating new challenges for the VA    Claims Processing   One of our biggest challenges is to ensure that veterans arent waiting months or even years for compensation  As of earlier this year  the VA had as many as 600 000 disability compensation claims waiting to be answered     I heard from several veterans in my home state last week who say they are at the end of their patience fighting for disability claims  We know the claims system is old and antiquated and needs to be fixed  Both the Dole Shalala Commission and the Veterans Disabilities Benefits Commission have studied the issue and recommended changes     In many ways  their suggestions are similar  but there are key differences  General Peake  if you are confirmed  you will have to work with this Congress to address those differences and reform the benefits system aggressively and fairly    Mental Health   Im also particularly concerned about the challenges we face as we try to meet the mental health needs of our returning service members  According to the VA  a third of all Iraq veterans enrolled in the system have sought treatment for a mental health problem  Thats an astounding statistic  But its also probably too low     Many arent seeking care because of the stigma surrounding treatment or because they fear that a mental health diagnosis will hurt their military or civilian careers  We know that as troops are deployed overseas for their third  fourth  or even fifth tours of duty  the risk of suffering from PTSD and other mental health conditions increases     Just a few weeks ago  CBS News reported on one tragic result of not treating mental health conditions  CBS found that veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide as other Americans     Perhaps most disturbing was that the risk is the highest among 20 to 24 year olds  as high as four times that of non veterans  The VA has taken steps to address this tragic situation  and Congress has taken steps as well  but more needs to be done    The VA  and the Defense Department  must focus their efforts on fighting the stigma of mental health treatment  and improve screening  outreach  and care  Finally  thousands of our service members will suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury  the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  This means many of our veterans will have more subtle injuries that will hurt their ability to work and communicate with their families and friends  Theres still so much we dont know  Its critical that we continue to research how to identify  prevent and treat TBI  so we can better care for our veterans suffering from this devastating injury     Conclusion   Mr  Chairman  General Peake has already answered a number of questions from us  and I look forward to hearing more from him today  We need a secretary who is willing to roll up his sleeves and get to work  We cant wait even another year to target and fix the challenges I talked about today
