                                           News Release          Murray Says DREAM Act Provides Hope and Opportunity After Senate vote fails  Senator urges reconsideration of vital legislation    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 24  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   an original co sponsor of the DREAM Act  today spoke out about the importance of the legislation  Murray urged her colleagues to reconsider their votes and said that Congress should pay more than just lip service to the idea of opportunity for all  In the Senate today we had the chance to pay more than just lip service to the idea of opportunity for all  Unfortunately  a few members of this body didn t think that was an American priority  Senator Murray said  But I still believe in the DREAM Act and its power to not only give hope to many today  but to make our country stronger in the future  The Senate voted on a motion to proceed to consideration of the DREAM Act  a narrowly tailored  bipartisan bill that would give the children of undocumented immigrants who plan do attend college or enter the military a path towards citizenship if they meet certain requirements  The motion to proceed failed 52 44  Sixty votes were needed to move forward  The full text of Senator Murray s floor remarks on the DREAM Act follows  Mr  President  our nation was built on the belief that no matter where we start from in life  we all have a shot at the American dream  I  for one  am proud of this reputation and believe it is one we should continue to promote and maintain  Unfortunately  Mr  President  somewhere along the way  amid politics and rhetoric  the belief that we should now turn our backs on certain children in our communities has gained a voice  Mr  President  I am here today because I still believe that we need to make sure that America remains a country of opportunity for all children   no matter where they come from  no matter what language they speak at home  and no matter what obstacles they have to overcome  In the Senate today we had the chance to pay more than just lip service to the idea of opportunity for all  Unfortunately  a few members of this body didn t think that was an American priority  But I still believe in the DREAM Act and its power to not only give hope to many today  but to make our country stronger in the future  In fact  we can still give hope to many by passing the Development  Relief and Education for Alien Minors  DREAM  Act  The DREAM Act is narrowly tailored  bipartisan legislation that would give a select group of undocumented students the chance to become permanent residents if they   Came to this country as children  Are long term U S  residents  Have good moral character  and Attend college for at least two years or enlist in the military   Mr  President  Senator Durbin previously brought up the DREAM Act as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to address critical manpower shortages that are facing our military forces  Under the DREAM Act  tens of thousands of well qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military service for the first time  These are young people who love our country and are eager to serve in the Armed Forces during a time of war  The DREAM Act would add a very strong incentive to enlist because it provides a path to permanent legal status  The DREAM Act would also make qualified students eligible for temporary legal immigration status upon high school graduation that would lead to permanent residency if they attend college  Mr  President  critics of this amendment would have you believe that this is simply a matter of politics  Well  it s not  This is about real people  and I d like to tell you about one of them  Recently  the Seattle Times  a newspaper in my state  featured the story of a young woman named Maria who has lived in the United States illegally since her parents brought her here at age 5  Maria completed high school in Washington state  She did well and was an active member of the student body  In fact  she was an elected class officer three years in a row  Maria was accepted to the University of Washington  She graduated with a high GPA and honors in her department of study  Mr  President  Maria is now in her second year of law school  and to quote the Seattle Times   By all rights  save one  she should have the world by the tail  But she is dogged by the questions  When she graduates  will she be able to take the bar exam  Will she be able to keep helping low income people as she s done during her internship this summer with a non profit legal aid organization   The DREAM Act is my only hope Maria said in the article  I hope and pray for it  Mr  President  isn t Maria exactly the type of young person we should be investing in  She studied hard  She got good grades  She has served her school and her community  And now she wants to continue to serve her community and our country  the only home she has ever known  It s not Maria s fault that her parents brought her to America when she was five years old  And it s not Maria s fault that Congress has not yet passed the comprehensive immigration reform that we clearly need  But yet it is the thousands of Maria s out there who ARE living the consequences  We need comprehensive immigration reform  But we also need a government that invests in our children and   understands that the face of the American Dream is not just  one class    or one race  or one religion  Our nation is filled with young people who love this country  have beat the odds  and who was should be investing in  We will reap the return we invest  And the reason I know  is from personal experience  Mr  President  this is a real issue touching real communities across our nation  I recently received a letter from the Superintendent of the Lake Chelan School District in North Central Washington  He wrote  and I quote   Each year  I watch students who have worked hard to be successful during high school struggle to continue their education after graduation due to their immigration status  These students are an important part of America s future  and we must give them the opportunity to further their education  contribute to society  and help build the American dream for generations to come  Allowing these young people to flourish is not only fair to them  but also adds value to our country s rich  vibrant  and diverse culture  They deserve that opportunity to succeed regardless of the outcome of the current immigration debate   Mr  President  let s remember that this debate isn t just about immigration  It s about the type of country we want to be  what we stand for  and what type of future we all want to build  It s easy to get caught up in the specifics of one policy or another  but I would encourage my colleagues to not lose sight of the bigger picture because this debate touches nearly every aspect of American life  from our economy to our security  and from our classrooms to our workplaces  And most importantly  it speaks to our values  I recently received a letter from a high school senior named Victor  Victor lives in Walla Walla  a small town on the Washington Oregon border  Victor wrote   I came to the U S  when I was 10 years old  My most difficult and only challenge I have faced since I came to the U S  is education  I came to this country not knowing a single word of English  therefore I had to learn it as fast as I could  I was held back a grade and put into English as a Second Language classes   It took me about a year to learn it well enough to where I was able to be in classes with native speakers   Victor continues   I am currently part of the National Honor Society and I also take part in fall and spring sports  I have been accepted to the University of Washington and three other Washington universitiesMy plans are to go to the University of Washington and get a degree in computer science  Unfortunately  I come from a low income family  making it hard for me to make further plans about my education  Currently the federal government will not help with any financial aid to any non citizen student in the United States  How do you expect us to improve ourselves and succeed in this country   Mr  President  I d like to ask my colleagues how they would answer Victor s question  How do we expect our nation to continue to be one of hope and opportunity  if we close doors to our children s futures rather than handing them the keys to success  All of our children should have the opportunity to become more successful than their parents  and none of them should be punished for their parents  decisions  We have thousands of dedicated  motivated and gifted students who have been forced into the shadows through no fault of their own  Like Victor and Maria they have beaten odds many of us could never even imagine and they want to serve and contribute to America s future  It would be our mistake to say no  I strongly encourage my colleagues to reconsider their votes today and to say  YES  to the DREAM Act and  YES  to a richer  stronger  more vibrant American Dream for all of us for generations to come
