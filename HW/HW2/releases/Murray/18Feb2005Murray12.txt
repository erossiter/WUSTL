                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Murray Sends Letter to Bush on Eve of EU Summit  02 18 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Sends Letter to Bush on Eve of EU Summit Senator urges President to continue to push for end to Airbus subsidies    For Immediate Release  Friday  February 18  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      In advance of the upcoming U S  European Union summit  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today sent a letter to President Bush urging his continued diligence in helping to end unfair European subsidies for Airbus            Europe is blind to the dangerous path Airbus is taking European governments and European industry down   I encourage you to once again open their eyes to the serious nature of U S  complaints about direct subsidies to Airbus   Europe must understand that a renewed Atlantic alliance will not alter our demand that a competitive balance be restored to international trade in large commercial aircraft     the letter states        Just this week  Airbus   parent company  EADS  displayed the lengths they will go to in attempting to secure U S  taxpayer dollars to support European jobs   EADS is disingenuously wooing U S  communities as locations for an   American    EADS plant with the promise of jobs   Unfortunately  these jobs are not guaranteed without the procurement of American military contracts         Murray  the leading Congressional critic of Airbus   many trade distorting actions  has given several major addresses on Airbus   business practices in the United States and abroad   Last July  Sen  Murray called for the United States to withdraw from the 1992 US EU Agreement on Large Commercial Aircraft              While publicly committed to negotiations  Airbus and European leaders    including even the EU  s chief trade negotiator    have indicated that they fully expect billions of dollars in new subsidies to go to Airbus in spite of the U S  threats to file a WTO case   Our willingness to seek a negotiated settlement to the subsidy dispute has been greeted by more arrogant entitlement from Airbus and its European backers     Murray says in the letter       The complete text of Senator Murray  s letter to President Bush follows     President George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  D C   20500    Dear Mr  President        I write regarding your important upcoming trip to Europe for the United States European Union Summit         With new hope for improved cross Atlantic dialogue  I encourage you to again forcefully call upon the European Union to address the competitive imbalance in large commercial aircraft trade that threatens a serious trade breach between the United States and the EU           I commend you for your leadership in standing up to Europe  s efforts to subsidize the U S  commercial aircraft industry out of existence   Thousands of American jobs have been lost in the last decade and thousands more jobs are at risk due to continued direct subsidies to Airbus          In January  the United States and the European Union announced a 90 day period of negotiation to try and settle the subsidy dispute prior to pursuing a case at the World Trade Organization   Unfortunately  over the last month  European actions have spoken loudly about their long term intentions to dominate the global aerospace market through subsidies and other trade distorting practices        While publicly committed to negotiations  Airbus and European leaders    including even the EU  s chief trade negotiator    have indicated that they fully expect billions of dollars in new subsidies to go to Airbus in spite of the U S  threats to file a WTO case   Our willingness to seek a negotiated settlement to the subsidy dispute has been greeted by more arrogant entitlement from Airbus and its European backers           Also in January  Airbus launched the A380 in a lavish ceremony attended by four European heads of state   As you know  the A380 received almost  4 billion in direct subsidies and numerous other supports from European governments   At the A380 ceremony  Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero spoke of Europe  s vision for aerospace stating    What we see here today is Europe cannot be stopped           Europe is blind to the dangerous path Airbus is taking European governments and European industry down   I encourage you to once again open their eyes to the serious nature of U S  complaints about direct subsidies to Airbus   Europe must understand that a renewed Atlantic alliance will not alter our demand that a competitive balance be restored to international trade in large commercial aircraft             Mr  President  I urge your continued leadership in addressing global aerospace trade   The economic and national security consequences of the status quo are very harmful to our national interests         Sincerely        Patty Murray  United States Senator
