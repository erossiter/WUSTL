a commitment from HUD to protect housing options for 5 000 of King County  s most vulnerable residents    For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 14  2005       Get      WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today pressed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson to restore King County Public Housing Authority funds that were improperly cut due to an error on the part of HUD   Murray raised the issue with Jackson at a hearing before the Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations subcommittee  of which she is the highest ranking Democrat        Nearly  800 000 in critical Section 8 funding has been denied to King County as a result of computer errors made by HUD   This loss of funds threatens to deny housing vouchers to nearly five thousand deserving seniors  disabled  single parents and refugees in the Seattle area        Murray  who has been in recent contact with the King County Housing Authority  questioned Jackson about his familiarity with the issue and received a commitment from Jackson that he would follow up on the error with the County and report back with a status update        Partial Transcript            Secretary Jackson  We are resolving that situation and should be resolved immediately with the King County Housing Authority   Senator Murray  And will we be getting a phone call today regarding that   Secretary Jackson Yes  I can  t say today  but Assistant Secretary Liu has been in contact with the Executive Director there   Senator Murray  Well as of last night they had not heard anything   Can we have someone call us today   Secretary Jackson  I surely will if they have not         Murray has been a strong advocate for affordable housing throughout her time in the Senate   Last June she hosted a roundtable discussion to hear from about 50 members of Washington s affordable housing communities as they deal with controversial changes the Bush Administration has made to federal housing programs such as Section 8          It is simply unacceptable that families in King County could be denied housing because of an error on the part of HUD     Murray said today     At a time when residents across the country are struggling to get back on their feet  HUD needs to tear down hurdles to help the most vulnerable  not construct new ones                                                                   Murray  s opening statement from today  s HUD budget hearing  as well as a complete transcript of her questioning of Secretary Jackson  follows     Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I want to welcome Secretary Jackson to the Subcommittee this morning          Mr  Secretary    you have had a distinguished career serving in the public housing field in Dallas  St  Louis  and Washington  D C   Your expertise and your commitment are needed as families throughout the country struggle with the high cost of housing        Unfortunately  Mr  Secretary  you ve been handed a very difficult budget to defend   I ve always said that a budget is a statement of priorities  and looking at this budget it s hard to reach any other conclusion than that housing is not a priority for this Administration   And we re not just talking about numbers   The cuts and problems in this budget will affect the lives of some of our most vulnerable neighbors          I wish the Bush Administration valued them more    and was willing to give us a budget that makes housing a priority   But sadly that is not the case  so we will do our best with the budget the Administration has sent us        But I do want to note that the situation is actually worse than some of the figures we ll hear today   In looking at the budget before us  some might see a 12 percent cut from last year   But when you take a closer look at the numbers    you see that the cuts are actually closer to 20 percent   That s because this budget calls for large number of rescissions     2 65 billion        I know that last year    before HUD came under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee    the Administration sought approval to cut about one billion dollars that were appropriated but never spent        Now the Administration wants to go into the current year s budget and cut an additional  2 65 billion   So when you add in these rescissions    on top of the regular budget cuts    the size of the Administration  s proposed cuts to HUD grows to almost  6 5 billion  or a 20 percent cut from last year   That is a very dark picture for American families and for cities and communities that are trying to develop distressed areas        As I look at these rescissions  what I see is troubling    but what I don t see is even more troubling   I don  t see a detailed explanation specifying where 2 5 billion of the proposed rescission is coming from   It s like the administration is asking us for a sledgehammer and then telling us not to worry about how they ll use it   Well I am worried        Under these proposed rescissions  HUD is granted the blanket authority to take the funding from any program in the agency   That means additional cuts can come from programs serving the homeless  the disabled  or individuals living with HIV AIDS   They can eliminate housing vouchers for the working poor or cut back on locally based meals on wheels programs   All that is in addition to the Administration  s proposal to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant program and the variety of support programs and services it funds        So the Administration is saying not only are we going to cut funding for HUD Programs  but we re asking to open up a previous appropriations act and cut another  2 5 billion however we see fit   That could have a painful impact on many of our neighbors        The only part of the rescission that the Administration has provided any information about concerns the HOPE VI program    so let s take a look at what the Administration proposes   The HOPE VI program has the worthy goal of tearing down old  dilapidated public housing units and replacing them with affordable housing units for mixed income populations   The President plans to eliminate this program next year        But it gets worse   The Administration also wants us to go back and rescind the  143 million that we already appropriated for this program for the current year   So it s not enough to kill it next year    they want to gut it this year and undo Congress s work in this area        Together  these proposals represent the elimination of some  300 million in HOPE VI grants   This idea of unaccountable  undefined blanket rescissions concerns me deeply        I have served on the Appropriations Committee for the great majority of my almost thirteen years in the Senate   I believe we have responsibility when we appropriate taxpayer dollars to know where they are going   By the same measure  when we are asked to take funds away from agencies that have already received them  I want to know precisely what projects  grants or services    that we already funded    will now be cut          So  I hope to use a portion of our hearing this morning to get clear and precise answers from Secretary Jackson as to the likely impacts of this budget proposal and what will result if he is required to cancel more than  4 billion in funding already appropriated to his agency over the course of this year and next          The challenges facing the Department of Housing and Urban Development are daunting   And the Administration s proposed budget cuts make it even worse   I can t make the Administration treat housing like a priority  but I can do everything possible to make sure we don t make things worse          I want to give the Secretary the resources he needs to protect and expand housing opportunities for the poor and community development programs for local communities            Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                               Unofficial Transcript by Senator Murray s Office      Senator Patty Murray   I recently heard from the King County Public Housing Authority   It s one of the largest public housing authorities in my state   They tell me that as a result of a computing error that was executed by HUD in the distribution of Section 8 funds they are enduring a loss of  800 000 this year   I am told that HUD staff admitted to them that this was done in error  but HUD is also telling them they now don t have the money to rectify their error   As a result  this agency is contemplating sending out a letter to all the families on their waiting list explaining that as a result of those losses they are going to be terminating that waiting list since no families on that waiting list will have any hope of getting a housing voucher at any time in the future   There are currently 5 000 seniors  disabled people  single parents and refugees who are on that waiting list and about to get that notice because of an error made by HUD   Are you familiar with this situation      Secretary Alphonso Jackson  Yes     Senator Murray  Well I would appreciate your response then today on what         Secretary Jackson  We are resolving that situation and should be resolved immediately with the King County Housing Authority      Senator Murray  And will we be getting a phone call today regarding that      Secretary Jackson  Yes  I can  t say today  but Assistant Secretary Liu has been in contact with the Executive Director there      Senator Murray  Well as of last night they had not heard anything   Can we have someone call us today      Secretary Jackson  I surely will if they have not      Senator Murray  and let us know when that phone call is going to be made and how that will be rectified      Secretary Jackson  I sure will Senator           Get
