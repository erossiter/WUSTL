                                                                         News Release          Murray Says Republicans  Failure to Act on Appropriations Bills Hurts Our Country    For Immediate Release  Friday  September 29  2006    Mr  President  I rise to join with my leader on the Appropriations Committee  Senator Byrd  to explain how the Republican s failure to act on the annual funding bills will hurt our communities        As Senators  we have a job to do in passing the annual spending bills that fund our government   It s one of our most basic responsibilities  On the Appropriations Committee    under the leadership of Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd   we ve done our job   But here on the Senate floor  the Republican leadership has blocked our progress    and American families are going to pay a price         When I talk with people throughout Washington state  they tell me that they want our country to be strong again   And the way to be strong here at home is to invest here at home   That s what I ve fought to do in my work on the Appropriations Committee   But the Republican Leadership is refusing to allow us to move forward on the investments we ve agreed on   In fact  it s refusing to even let us debate making those investments   That just shows how wrong their priorities are        Some people may suggest that if we pass a Continuing Resolution then everything will be fine   They claim there is no real difference between passing the bill s we ve worked so hard to craft    and just putting our government on autopilot for a few months   Don t believe it   It s not true   There is a real cost to failing to act on the appropriations bills        We re going to pay a price in airline safety   We won t be able to rapidly hire the air traffic controllers or the safety inspectors we need   We re going to pay a price in highway safety   We won t be able to rapidly reverse the increases in traffic fatalities   We re going to pay a price in the fight against terrorism   We won t be able to rapidly fund the Treasury Department s efforts to stop terrorist financing   We re going to pay a price in educating our children  improving our communities  and training our workforce   Almost everywhere you look  we will pay a price if the Republican Leadership succeeds in blocking action on the annual appropriations bills   I want to share some specific examples of how what the Republican Leadership is doing will hurt our country       Hiding Their Wrong Priorities    But first  I want to say a word about WHY this is happening  It s not because of partisan gridlock   It s not because we haven t had enough time to act    all of our bills have been ready to go since August   It s because the Republican leadership does not want to have a public debate about America s priorities just weeks before an election   And I suspect it s because they realize that their priorities are out of step with the American people        And there may be another reason to stall these bills    it hides the true cost of their wrong priorities   When we bring these bills up on the Senate floor  we have a chance to see what s being funded and what s not   We have a chance to offer amendments and have a real debate about priorities that deserve more support   But by blocking that debate  the Republican leadership is hiding the true cost of their policies          Just as they ve used supplemental spending bills to hide the true cost of war  they re failing to act on the annual spending bills to hide the cost of their misplaced priorities        They prefer to mask from the voters the tough funding choices their policies will require   They prefer to deny almost three quarters of the Senate the opportunity to have any input into the Appropriations bills    by sending these bills directly from the Committee to conference   They prefer to set up an end of year train wreck that will require a massive Omnibus Appropriations Bill that will shortchange America  s needs with a minimum of debate       Senators Byrd   Cochran    I want to thank Senator Byrd for taking this time to call this issue to the attention of the entire Senate as well as to the entire nation   I also want to thank our Committee Chairman  Senator Cochran  for his very capable leadership of our Committee   I only wish Senator Cochran was empowered to control the Floor schedule  not just the Committee schedule   Last year  Senator Cochran surprised many of us    and earned the respect of all of us    in doing what seemed impossible   He succeeded in sending eleven individual Appropriations bills to the White House for signature  He showed how it should be done        This year  when it came to the management of our Committee  Senator Cochran actually improved on last year  s record    Last year  the Appropriations Committee reported all but one Appropriations bill to the Senate Floor prior to the August recess   This year  Chairman Cochran saw to it that each and every one of our Appropriations bills was reported to the Senate Floor before the August recess   That involved some very hard work and some very long mark ups   And no one worked harder at this than Chairman Cochran himself        Unfortunately  this year the Senate Republican Leadership does not share Chairman Cochran  s commitment   That is a change from last year   Last year  the Senate Republican Leadership saw to it that all twelve of the Appropriations bills were considered on the Floor prior to adjournment          Today  we find ourselves just hours away from the beginning of a long Fall recess   And yet the Senate Republican Leadership has seen fit to call up only two to the twelve Appropriations bills our Committee reported back in June and July   That record is shameful          The full Senate has only debated two funding bills this year    Defense and Homeland Security   They are certainly very important  but they are just two of the 12 bills we re charged with passing       Neglecting Other Priorities    The others are important as well   They ensure the care of our veterans returning home from Iraq  the education of our children  the housing needs of our citizens  and the healthcare needs of our seniors   They support our efforts to fight crime and drug abuse  provide disaster assistance to struggling family farmers  and invest in our roads  bridges and rail systems   As far as the Republican Leadership appears to be concerned  these issues can just  rot on the vine    According to their plan  these functions of government will be subjected to a continuing resolution that guarantees them only the lowest possible funding level         Worst Progress I ve Seen    Mr  President  I have had the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee for every one of my fourteen years in the Senate   And I am certainly aware that the Congress does not have a great track record when it comes to finishing all of its Appropriations work before the beginning of the fiscal year          But in my fourteen years  I cannot remember a time when the Senate has made so little progress in executing its most basic responsibilities   The new fiscal year starts this coming Sunday   I had my staff go back and check the record   And I can tell my colleagues that  in the last fourteen years  we have never begun a new fiscal year having passed as few as two Appropriations bills out of the Senate   It is a deplorable record        Looking forward  we hear rumors that the other ten Appropriations bills are never coming to the Senate Floor for debate   We hear rumors that we are going to be sent straight to conference with the House of Representatives to concoct a massive omnibus Appropriations bill        Denies Senators a Voice    Mr  President  I hope that is not the case   That approach  frankly  is an insult to the 72 members of the Senate who do not serve on the Appropriations Committee   As a Member of the Committee  I had the opportunity to review each of the bills the Committee reported   I had an opportunity to offer amendments in subcommittee and Full Committee mark ups   But 72 of my Senate colleagues have never had that opportunity   Those 72 Senators were elected by the people of their state to oversee and influence decisions regarding the way their tax dollars are spent   By denying these 72 Senators the opportunity to debate these bills  the Senate Republican leadership is denying these Senators  constituents the right to be heard   This is not the way that the Senate should do business        Mr  President  our country will pay a high price if we fail to act on the appropriations bill   Some may claim that it doesn  t matter when we actually get around to finalizing the Appropriations process   Well  as the Ranking Member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary and HUD  I want to tell my colleagues that it does matter   Let me just give you a few examples       Air Traffic Controllers    Just last month  we experienced a tragic plane crash in Lexington  Kentucky   The NTSB has not yet reported to us on the actual cause of that crash   But it was revealed that the air traffic control tower at Lexington had only one controller on duty  contrary to the FAA  s own policy   When this incident occurred  it was discovered that several other towers were also operating with only one controller          Everyone involved in aviation policy knows that the FAA needs to hire more controllers   They need to fill vacancies and replace a growing number of retirees   There is money in the FAA  s budget to hire more controllers   We put money in the House and Senate Appropriations bill to hire more controllers   But  until the FAA Administrator gets a final budget  she won t know how many controllers she can hire or how quickly she can hire them   This is an issue of basic safety   But it is a safety issue that the Senate Republican Leadership is happy to have wait on the back burner for a few more months        Air Safety Inspectors    A similar situation exists in the hiring of more air traffic safety inspectors   We desperately need more safety inspectors to ensure that financially strapped airlines are operating safely   An increasing amount of airline maintenance for US flag airlines is being conducted overseas   We need inspectors to visit these foreign repair stations to make sure all appropriate procedures are being followed   Just this week  the National Academy of Sciences reported that the FAA needs to modernize its system for determining how many inspectors they need and who to hire   But the FAA can  t address any of these deficiencies until it gets its final budget for the year   This is another safety issue that the Senate Republican Leadership is happy to have wait on the back burner for a few more months        Fighting Terror Financing    The Republican Leadership s failure to act could also hurt our efforts to fight terrorism   The Treasury Department has a critical role in combating terrorist financing   They are on the job morning  noon and night trying to interrupt the cash flow between the terrorists and those who fund them   Ever since 9 11  the Treasury Department has been seeking increased resources from our Subcommittee to fight terrorist finding   Our Subcommittee has provided every dollar that the Treasury department has requested for this function  including the funding for increased personnel and infrastructure for fiscal year 2007          However  this increased funding sought by the Treasury Department will just have to wait for a few months   Why   Because the Senate Republican Leadership does not want us to debate the Transportation Treasury bill before the election         Security for Courts   Judges    Mr  President  one of the issues being discussed in the closing days of this session is the security of our courts and our judges   An effort is being made to provide an authorization for additional court security in the Department of Defense Authorization bill   The brutal murder of the father and mother of a federal judge in Chicago showed the urgent need for better security    The Transportation Treasury Appropriations bills    as passed by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees    include sizeable increases for court security   We are not talking about an authorization here    we are talking about cold hard cash that will go out to better protect our judges   But of course  that money can  t go out until our Appropriations bill is signed into law   And that can  t happen if the Senate Republican Leadership slows the Appropriations process to a crawl        Highway Safety    Finally  Mr  President  I want to talk about the critical need for improved safety on our highways   One month ago  our nation received a wake up call from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration   For many years  our country made steady progress in reducing the overall fatality rate   But last month  the fatality rate on our highways started to move back up   Deaths from motor vehicle crashes jumped up 1 4 percent over the level in 2004   We had 43 443 deaths on America  s highways in 2005   Mr  President  that is the highest number of highway deaths since 1990          We have also begun to see the number of road fatalities involving large trucks head back up   We made progress between 1998 and 2002  but since that time  the number of large truck fatalities is moving in the wrong direction          More and more people are dying on our highways  and the Congress has sought to respond   There are increased funding levels    consistent with the SAFETEA LU authorization law    both for highway safety and motor carrier safety in both the House and Senate Appropriations bills          But these additional resources to save lives on our highways will just have to wait   Why   Because the Senate Republican Leadership didn  t want to debate Transportation Appropriations bill prior to the election         Failure to Act Has Real Consequences    These decisions by the Senate Republican Leadership to stall the Appropriations process can and will have very real consequences   So  in conclusion  Mr  President  I want to state my deep disappointment that the Senate Republican Leadership has done such an abysmal job in fulfilling its most basic responsibility to fund our government          It didn  t have to be this way  Mr  President   Rather than spending the month of July and September debating bills for political reasons  we could have been debating the bills that are critically needed for our safety and security        We could have been fighting for the citizens of this country   We could have been meeting their basic needs  protecting their livelihoods  and ensuring their safety   But the Republican Senate Leadership said  no   and now families are paying a price   Mr  President  the Senate deserves better    and more importantly    the American people deserve better
