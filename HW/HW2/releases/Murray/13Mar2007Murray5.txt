 Tuesday  March 13  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  reintroduced legislation to help more veterans who have Multiple Sclerosis  MS  qualify for disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   Under current law  veterans have a deadline of seven years after being honorably discharged to connect their MS to their military service  Murray s bill would remove the seven year limitation         This arbitrary deadline is another example of the unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles our veterans face when they return home   said Senator Murray   This bill institutes a common sense approach that gives our veterans every opportunity they need to get the coverage they deserve  Especially now  as the administration continues to shortchange veterans  we need to make sure that we are opening doors to coverage rather than closing them         A disproportionate number of veterans from the first Gulf War are developing symptoms of MS  but they often face difficulty obtaining disability benefits from the VA  Unfortunately  many veterans don t develop the symptoms of MS until after seven years  making them ineligible for automatic disability benefits from the Veterans Administration  These veterans must then go through a lengthy appeals process to prove that their disability is service connected         Senator Murray s bill is supported by a number of organizations that represent veterans with MS  including the National Gulf War Resource Center  NGWRC  and MS Vets          I applaud Senator Murray for working to clear the path to VA benefits for those of us with MS   said Julie Mock  a leading advocate for fellow Gulf War veterans who suffer from MS   I have watched too many fellow veterans struggle to get VA benefits simply because the debilitating symptoms of MS showed up late or were not properly diagnosed  We cannot force future veterans to endure the same arduous process          Senator Murray has been a great champion of veterans with Multiple Sclerosis   said Ed Butler  co founder of MSVETS and a board member of NGWRC   We thank the Senator for her continued efforts and support to end the VA s seven year presumptive rule for service connected to Multiple Sclerosis  We pray that others will follow the Senator s lead and support this bill and our nation s veterans           The environmental assault that those of us endured in the 1991 Gulf War is very evident and is reverberated throughout the Middle East   Butler said   This indicates that the disease may take longer than seven years to develop  Senator Murray has had the foresight to forge forward in context to the changing science and our veteran s needs         In September 2005  the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that   of the 700 000 U S  troops who served  in Iraq  in 1991  a disproportionate number experienced serious neurological disorders   Whereas nationally  1 in 700 people suffers from MS   1    the Post Intelligencer reports that 3 in 36  8   soldiers who served near Julie Mock s battalion in Iraq have been diagnosed with MS  and one is suffering from an undiagnosed condition        Background information on veterans benefits  MS  and Senator Murray s bill  follows     WHAT DOES SENATOR MURRAY S BILL DO     The bill would remove the seven year limitation for veterans trying to gain service connected status for their Multiple Sclerosis  This legislation would ensure that a person diagnosed seven years and one day after their honorable discharge from the U S  military will still get access to the VA treatment they need  Some veterans with MS have difficulty receiving care since MS is not seen as service related  Veterans with MS should not be penalized because their symptoms were diagnosed more than 7 years after separation  Scientists aren t 100  certain whether exposure to combat stress  experimental vaccines  toxins released from oil well fires  sarin from the destruction of weapons caches  pesticides  pyridostigmine bromide pills  to protect against nerve gas   or some combination of any of these causes Multiple Sclerosis  There is a general consensus that MS is higher among Gulf War veterans than the general population  This bill will help veterans access the care they need by making MS a presumptive disability  no matter when its symptoms emerge        WHAT IS A PRESUMPTIVE DISABILITY     Sometimes veterans return from military service with physical and mental conditions that the VA presumes are linked to military service  This means that science hasn t been able to connect a disease with service without a doubt  but there is sound scientific evidence that suggests there is a connection between exposures veterans experienced and a disease they developed later  The VA recognizes 41 chronic diseases for service connected benefits  and Multiple Sclerosis  MS  is one of those diseases   but only for 7 years after a veterans separated from service  This means that a veteran diagnosed with MS after the seven year window  has to prove their multiple sclerosis was directly connected to their service  Presumptive service connection is important to our veterans because it helps them qualify for the benefits they deserve so they can get appropriate treatment through the VA s medical system       WHAT DOES SCIENCE SAY     Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease with symptoms ranging from clumsiness to blindness to numbness  The problem with the seven year limit for Multiple Sclerosis is that a person with MS may not show symptoms for years even though they have the disease  According to the VA s MS Center of Excellence   there is considerable evidence that MS precedes symptoms in most patients  Most patients with MS have several lesions  shown on an  MRI at the time of their first symptom       WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AFFECTED VETERANS     Approximately 700 000 U S  service members were deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War  According to a 2000 VA study  Gulf veterans report being not as healthy as their military peers who were not deployed in the Persian Gulf  A September 2005 Seattle Post Intelligencer article reported that   of the 700 000 U S  troops who served there in 1991  a disproportionate number experienced serious neurological disorders  More than 65 percent have sought health care for service related ailments  Nearly 200 000 are receiving disability compensation    twice the rate as vets from World War II  Korea and Vietnam   Numbers of Persian Gulf War veterans diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis range  but according to the National Gulf War Resource Center   the rate of multiple sclerosis is rising among Gulf War veterans
