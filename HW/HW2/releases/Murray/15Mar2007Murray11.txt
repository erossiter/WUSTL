                                                          News Release          Murray s Statement   Hearing on the Federal Housing Administration Statement of Chairman Patty Murray Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development   Related Agencies    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 15  2007    This morning the Subcommittee will hear testimony on the Federal Housing Administration  FHA    We will discuss the overall solvency of its mortgage lending program as well as the Administration s proposals for reforming the FHA   I am pleased that our Federal Housing Commissioner  Brian Montgomery  is here   He is joined by the HUD Inspector General   Kenneth Donohue and witnesses from the GAO  the Mortgage Bankers Association  and the National Association of Realtors         Over the last 73 years of its existence  the FHA has served as a powerful engine to expand home ownership across the country   It has played a critical and essential role in providing access to capital for low  and moderate income families    Most recently  however  the FHA has come to look more and more like an anachronism   Critics have said that  they are out of touch with the marketplace  their mortgage products are outdated  they are a technological dinosaur  and they are hard to do business with            Indeed  in recent years  the FHA has captured a smaller and smaller percentage of the overall mortgage market   And its decline has been a rapid one   In my state  we have the Washington State Housing Finance Commission whose mission  like the FHA s  is to serve low  and moderate income home buyers   The Commission s Executive Director recently told me that  in my state  the FHA s role in his efforts has been turned upside down in just the last ten years   A decade ago  FHA covered 80 percent of the loan activity in his agency   Today it only covers 20 percent   When you look at all mortgage lending  FHA now represents roughly three percent of total mortgage volume  nationwide    Now some observers like to argue that whenever the private sector can replace the government in providing essential services  it s a good thing   In this case  I am not so sure          The FHA s loan products have fallen out of favor in part because private lenders have aggressively marketed subprime loans to high risk borrowers   Some of these lenders have used temporary rate discounts   or  teaser rates     to push low income borrowers into exotic loans with high fees and penalties that they can barely understand  much less afford   Some of these lenders have been boosting loan volume by taking credit standards to new lows and demanding almost no proof of income or creditworthiness          And  as a result  we are now seeing rapidly rising foreclosures  and some of the most aggressive subprime lenders are shuttering their operations   Just two days ago  the Mortgage Bankers Association released their updated survey on mortgage delinquencies   It revealed that foreclosures of subprime mortgages had reached a record high   The share of subprime borrowers making late payments rose to more than 13 3 percent   That same day  the second largest subprime mortgage lender   New Century Financial    was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and announced that it had received criminal inquiries from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators   The announcements sent the stock market into a tailspin   By the end of the day  the Dow Jones Industrial average had dropped nearly 250 points or almost two percent   Financial stocks dropped even faster  falling almost 3 3 percent for the day          The collapse of the subprime mortgage market has elicited warnings from the Federal Reserve Board Chairman   Some economists have even predicted that the ripple effects of this collapse could eventually trigger a recession    These dire predictions should worry us all  but should surprise no one   It is estimated that one in every five new mortgages written in recent years fell into the subprime category    This year alone  some  1 2 trillion dollars in mortgages will have their interest rate reset upward   Some borrowers took out these adjustable rate loans banking on the fact that they would have an opportunity to either refinance their loan or  if necessary  sell their home   Now  the prepayment penalties built into many of these loans as well as the overall downturn in home prices means those opportunities have disappeared        Many economists have said that our mortgage markets are in for a very rough road   There is concern that this market upheaval could trigger a market overreaction  where the availability of mortgage loan capital for working families tightens dramatically or just evaporates   If the mortgage market overreacts and working families need help  they may have to rely on the FHA   That means we need to make sure the FHA is strong and effective         Today  the FHA s overall financial picture is weak   Absent the enactment of reform legislation this year  we are told that  for the first time in its history  the FHA could require a direct appropriation to subsidize its loan operations   This Subcommittee could be required to appropriate  143 million in 2008 just to keep FHA s loan activities in the black   That is  143 million that we won t be able to put toward Section 8 recipients  homeless programs  and other HUD programs serving needy citizens          Currently a growing percentage of the FHA s loan volume is not for traditional mortgages for new homeowners   Rather  an increasingly popular FHA product appears to be reverse mortgages for elderly homeowners   This is a worthwhile program that keeps elderly Americans with fixed incomes in their homes   But getting younger American s into their first home has always been central to FHA s historical mission   And  in these tumultuous times  I think we need to work to make sure that the FHA can once again be relevant in that market          This subcommittee continues to receive reports from the Government Accountability Office  GAO  and the Inspector General indicating continuing problems with the currency of FHA s data  the sufficiency of its underwriting  and the agency s technological obsolescence        The Bush Administration put forward a reform proposal for the FHA in the last Congress and we expect it to be resubmitted in this Congress   Enactment of this FHA reform  we are told  should eliminate the need for any appropriated subsidy and make the FHA more competitive with the private market    But this Subcommittee and the rest of Congress need to look at these proposals very carefully   We need to make sure that we are not encouraging FHA to engage in some of the same high risk  high cost lending practices that are now upsetting the markets and putting relatively new homeowners out of their homes             The FHA is the taxpayer s mortgage lender   As such  it has an obligation to protect consumers   The FHA has specific statutory mandates to employ measures to keep families in their homes   These are requirements and obligations that private lenders do not have          If the recent upheaval in mortgage lending means that private loan capital dries up for our working class families  we must make sure that the FHA is poised to keep the dream of homeownership alive   But the FHA must reestablish itself as America s mortgage lender  not by imitating the marketing and underwriting practices of New Century Financial   Rather  they must work to ensure that working families are getting into homes with loans that they can fully understand and afford
