                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray Disappointed by Bush Position on Life Saving Stem Cell Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Murray  Murray Disappointed by Bush Position on Life Saving Stem Cell Research  05 24 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Disappointed by Bush Position on Life Saving Stem Cell Research    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  May 24  2005      With millions of American patients and their families waiting for a cure  President Bush is threatening to veto hope        As he has in the past  the President acknowledged the benefits of stem cell research but told patients and medical researchers that to support its funding   would be a great mistake          The true mistake is to delay the potential of stem cells to treat and better understand deadly and disabling diseases and conditions that affect millions of Americans        While I am glad that the President has pledged support for research on cord cells  this step still falls well short of what is needed to realize the full potential of stem cell research          As a cosponsor of the Senate version of the Stem Cell Research Act  I support providing federal funding to conduct research on embryonic stem cells   This legislation mandates that the bioethical guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health will be implemented          Stem cell research offers a potential cure for patients across our country    The President should be providing hope    not threatening to veto it
