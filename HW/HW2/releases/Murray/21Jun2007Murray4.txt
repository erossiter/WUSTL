Intercollegiate College of Nursing  ICN  to complete research laboratories and purchase research  instruction  and communication equipment at the WSU Spokane Riverpoint campus  The funding was included in the Labor  Health  Human Services and Education  LHHS  Appropriations bill  Senator Murray is a senior member of the LHHS Appropriations Subcommittee  This funding will help the premiere nursing college in the Northwest fund new laboratories  purchase new equipment and grow to serve more students  said Senator Murray  This is a victory for two of our state s top goals  growing our workforce and providing better access to quality healthcare  More well trained  professional nurses will mean better access to quality care for more Washington state residents  Located near Spokane Falls Community College  the Washington State University s Intercollegiate College of Nursing  ICN  is scheduled to move to a new building on the WSU Riverpoint Campus  WSU s ICN also includes Eastern Washington University  Gonzaga University and Whitworth College  The College of Nursing has 5 physical locations  Spokane  Vancouver  Tri Cities  Walla Walla  and Yakima  Several Washington State

in the LHHS bill for telehealth equipment at three rural hospitals located in Deer Park  Colville  Mt  Carmel   and Chewelah  St  Joseph   The telehealth equipment will link the hospitals with Holy Family Hospital in Spokane  The funding will be used to train workers at the three rural facilities to use and maintain the new telehealth equipment  Too often rural residents are limited in their ability to see specialists  and rural healthcare workers are limited in their ability to learn new techniques and collaborate on critical decisions  said Senator Murray  This funding will help eliminate those limitations  Every rural resident deserves access to the best care and every rural doctor deserves access to the best information  I am pleased to help fund the technologies that are making quality health care more accessible to all  In addition to providing increased access  telehealth equipment will improve the ability of the rural hospitals to participate in distance learning and teleconferencing  It will also improve the overall level of information that is available to health care providers  patients and their families  Now that Murray s funding has passed the committee  it will move to the Senate floor for consideration  Senator Murray will continue to use her position in the Senate to improve healthcare access  affordability and innovation for residents throughout Washington state
