With  2 2 billion for specialty crop farmers  2007 Farm Bill will help Washington state s Ag industry remain strong  Republicans threaten bill s  passage with insistence on unrelated amendments    For Immediate Release  Thursday  December 6  2007     Washington D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  spoke on the Senate floor to urge Senate Republicans to end blockage of the critically important 2007 Farm Bill  The bill includes strong provisions that will benefit Washington state farmers  particularly specialty crop farmers  who grow more than 250 varieties of fruits  vegetables  and other specialty crops  Washington is ranked first in the nation in the production of several specialty crops  including apples  red raspberries  sweet cherries  pears  and Concord grapes  Senate Republicans have insisted on offering unrelated amendments that threaten to kill this legislation that our farmers need and deserve  This Farm Bill helps Washington state farmeres stay strong by investing in programs that help them find markets for their crops here and abroad  and that will help fund research to ensure farmers have healthy and safe crops in the future  The Farm Bill funds a wide variety of programs  including nutrition  commodity price and income support  agricultural conservation  research and rural development  The Congress considers the Farm Bill every five years   on how this Farm Bill assists specialty crop farmers  The full text of Senator Murrays statement on the Senate floor is below  Mr  President  Ive come to the floor today to talk about why it is so important for us to pass the 2007 Farm Bill  Mr  President  when many people think about my home state of Washington  Seattle  Boeing  and Microsoft usually come to mind  But farming is a vital part of my states economy  Washington is the 11th largest farm state  We are the third largest producer of fruits and vegetables  also known as specialty crops  And this bill will help keep my state healthy and strong  In fact  Mr  President  farming has been a big part of my life  My grandfather moved his family to the Tri Cities  in central Washington  to take a job with Welchs in the early 1900s  My dad grew up picking asparagus  My hometown of Bothell  Washington  was surrounded by berry farms  and we grew up with a clear understanding of how important family farms are to Washington states economy  So I know personally that passing the legislation before us is critical for our farmers who grow apples  cherries  peaches  grapes  asparagus  potatoes  and many other crops  This isnt a perfect bill  but it is the best farm bill in years for Washington state farmers  largely because of what it does for specialty crops  Mr  President  my home state  and our nation  cant be strong unless farmers are doing well  This bill helps them stay strong by investing in programs that help them find markets for their crops here and abroad  and that will help fund research to ensure farmers have healthy and safe crops in the future  Republicans are blocking this bill So we have an opportunity to move a good bill forward  But unfortunately  we have become bogged down because Republicans have insisted on offering unrelated amendments that threaten to kill the help our farmers need and deserve  Well  Mr  President  I want to be clear about whats happening here  Republicans have been complaining in the last several days about the need to move legislation forward  But they are the ones blocking this bill  Now  I really hope we could eventually make progress  So I want to talk about what this farm bill can do  and what we are losing if we dont move forward  This Farm Bill Does Great Things For Our Farmers Mr  President  the biggest victory in this farm bill for Washington state is the  2 2 billion to help specialty crop farmers  This is the first time weve addressed specialty crops in a comprehensive and meaningful way  The money helps carry out programs I have been pushing for in the last several years  It includes    270 million in block grants  which will allow local growers to increase the competitiveness of their crops  And  15 million in badly needed aid for asparagus farmers  who are really struggling to compete in the global marketplace with a flood of cheap asparagus being imported from Peru  This bill helps farmers compete in an increasingly global marketplace and find new markets abroad for their crops        For example  it increases funding for the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program  which helps our farmers overcome barriers that threaten our exports         Mr  President  this is so important in my home state  Just last week  I held a listening session in Yakima  Washington  where I heard from cherry farmers who are trying to develop a new market in Japan  This bill would help them with that program  And this bill will help ensure that nurseries can continue to have access to safe  virus free plant materials         Apples  peaches  and grapes are particularly vulnerable to viruses  And a single plant or grape vine can infect and wipe out an entire established orchard or vineyard         Washington State University Prosser is doing national research on this topic  and they will be an important part of this national clean plant network     Nutrition Programs Mr  President  I think a lot of people dont understand that well over 50 percent of our bill goes to nutrition programs  This is something I think is so important  The programs in this part of the bill would help kids get access to fresh fruits and vegetables in their school lunches  And it also would help people who receive food stamps and other assistance to get access fresh  nutritious food  It will help end benefit erosion in the food stamp program  This is a key program that helps low income families  Too use an old cliche  this is a win win because it helps children and adults fight obesity  and it helps specialty crop growers  Finally  Mr  President  I wish that we were able to include important improvements to the safety net that is so critical to our wheat farmers  Ive been working for several years with wheat farmers in Washington state to improve the counter cyclical payment program to really make it work for them  Unfortunately  we couldnt make significant changes in this bill  But Im happy that it bill holds them harmless  and that was important  As I said earlier  this is a very good bill for Washington state  Republicans are Blocking Progress on the Farm Bill So Mr  President  we have an opportunity to do a lot of good for our farmers  But Republicans have refused to work with us to get this done  Democrats have given Republicans repeated chances to work out an agreement  But instead  Republicans have insisted on offering extraneous  irrelevant amendments to this bill that do nothing but hold up progress  Let me give you a few examples  Republicans have offered amendments that deal with fire sprinklers  and tort reform  among others  Well  Mr  President  this is a Farm Bill  And its too important to our nations health and economy to use it as a vehicle for political games  Only once in modern history has a non relevant amendment been added to a Farm Bill  Each and every other time  the Majority and Minority have worked out a reasonable agreement that clears the path for this important bill  But this Republican Minority has clearly decided to throw out the history books  continue their record setting pace of obstruction  and kill the help our farmers need and deserve  Today when many families are struggling with rising gas prices  energy prices  the mortgage crisis  and health care costs  making sure that our farmers and our kids both benefit from investments in these programs is absolutely critical  These arent just numbers in a bill  These programs can make or break peoples livelihoods  And I urge Republicans to get their ship in order  agree to come to the table with a reasonable plan to move forward  and lets get this bill passed
