WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   today spoke out in favor of a compromise bill that will strengthen and expand the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP   The new bill addresses concerns raised by the President and some Republicans in Congress  while still insuring almost 4 million children who wouldnt otherwise get health care  In her speech  Murray reminded the President and her colleagues that it has been three months since the Senate first approved CHIP  and that the parents of millions of children are still waiting to hear about whether they will continue to get help paying medical bills  She cited a New York Times article  which reported that unless Congress acts  21 states will run out of money for the program next year   I am frustrated and angry that Im standing here again  talking about CHIP  and that were still trying to get the White House to understand  The supporters of this bill have agreed to compromise  We want to make this program work  And were back with another bill we think will meet everyones needs  Senator Murray said in her speech  Childrens health shouldnt be about politics  Ive said this over and over  Its about making sure kids can see a doctor  These kids arent Democrats or Republicans  Theyre just kids who deserve health care   The Senate is currently expected to vote on the new CHIP bill as early as tomorrow  The full text of Senator Murray s floor remarks on CHIP follows  Mr  President  back in August  I stood here on the Senate floor and shared the story of a little girl from my home state  I did that because I wanted to illustrate why its our moral obligation as Americans to renew and improve the Childrens Health Insurance Program  or CHIP  Shortly afterward  we approved the CHIP bill by an overwhelming margin because Senators on both sides of the aisle agreed that all children should be able to see a doctor when theyre sick  They supported re authorizing CHIP because it would reduce the number of uninsured American children by a third  But President Bush vetoed it  Mr  President  its three months later  and I am frustrated and angry that Im standing here again  talking about CHIP  and that were still trying to get the White House to understand  The supporters of this bill have agreed to compromise  We want to make this program work  And were back with another bill we think will meet everyones needs  So today I want to remind President Bush  and anyone else who still questions how important it is to approve this program now  about that little girl from Yakima  Washington  Because its time for the President to stop blocking her health care  Sydneys Story The little girl I want to tell you about is Sydney  and shes 9 years old  In many ways  Sydney is like any other happy child  She loves to sing and dance  She does well in school  And she has lots of friends  But Sydney also has a life shortening genetic condition called Cystic Fibrosis  It requires her to take a bucket full of medicine every day  And shes already spent weeks of her young life in the hospital hooked up to an I V  of antibiotics  which help her live to enjoy another day  All of this is possible because of the health care she receives as part of the CHIP program  Her mom  Sandi DeBord  told me about Sydney because she was frightened that CHIP might no longer be available for her daughter  She wrote   I know for a fact that without this bit of assistance  her life would end much sooner due to the inability to afford quality health care for her   Mr  President  Im telling this story again because Im sad to say that three months later  I cant assure Sydneys mom that CHIP will always be there  The News is Growing More Dire In fact  the news has become even more worrisome  Just today  the New York Times reported that because of the Presidents refusal to work with Congress on this bill  several states are planning to start dropping children from the program in order to save money    Unless something changes  California says it will begin dropping 64 000 kids a month starting in January  A study from the Congressional Research Service found that nine states Alaska  Georgia  Illinois  Iowa  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  New Jersey  and Rhode Island will run out of money by March  Twelve more states will run out between April and September  Mr  President this is a tragedy  and its our moral obligation to correct it  Were trying to do that today  Vetoing the CHIP Bill Denied Insurance for 4 Million Children Mr  President  as Sydneys story shows  the need for the Childrens Health Insurance Program is clear  It doesnt matter if you are a Republican or Democrat  progressive or conservative  making sure our children get health care is the right thing to do  When a child gets a cut that requires stitches  comes down with a fever  or an ear ache  or with any other imaginable problem  they should be able to get help  Period  Unfortunately  today  even in America  this isnt the case  Millions of children dont get the medicine they need  And the ranks of uninsured children are growing  because  as the cost of living rises  while wages remain stagnant  more and more parents are struggling to afford health care  Mr  President most of us in the Senate know this  The CHIP program has had strong Republican support  I particularly want to thank Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch  who co sponsored the original 1997 bill  They worked hard with Senators Baucus and Rockefeller  We Have Worked on a Compromise Even so  President Bush has complained about the bill we passed  As an excuse to delay this program  he  and a few Republican supporters  say we have been unwilling to work with them  They say it will increase costs  Well  Mr  President  thats not the case  Despite what the President says  we listened to their concerns and have already revised the bill  The new bill we are considering   Addresses concerns that children of illegal immigrants will be covered by requiring that states not only verify names and Social Security numbers  but also check citizenship information in the Social Security Administrations database  It ends coverage of child less adults by the end of one year  And it concentrates on making sure the poorest kids get covered first   The bill also helps bridge the gap for another 3 9 million children whose parents cant afford health insurance  And the program is paid for  I want to underscore this point  President Bush has just asked us to borrow  196 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for this year alone  But he opposes CHIP even though we have found a way to PAY for the cost of kids health care over five years  The  35 billion cost for CHIPs initiatives comes solely from a 61 cent excise tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products  No other programs are cut  Social Security isnt raided  The deficit wont be increased  And not only will this provide millions of children with health care  experts estimate that it will get 1 7 million adults to quit smoking  and prevent millions of kids from ever getting hooked  So this is good for kids health now  and it will help make millions of kids healthier in the future  too  Its About the Kids  Childrens health shouldnt be about politics  Ive said this over and over  Its about making sure kids can see a doctor  These kids arent Democrats or Republicans  Theyre just kids who deserve health care  Unfortunately  President Bush has let health care for our children get caught up in a desperate attempt to appeal to his dwindling number of supporters  Mr  President  we know CHIP is the right thing to do  Americans know its the right thing to do  more than 65 percent oppose President Bushs veto  So to President Bush  and any of my colleagues out there who still see this as a debate over politics and numbers  I want to remind you once more of 9 year old Sydney and the millions of kids out there who depend on this program  Sydney is still fighting Cystic Fibrosis  And her mother still needs to know whether CHIP will be there to help pay for her care  I hope to be able to tell her that it will  On behalf of Sydney  the 73 000 uninsured children in Washington state  and the more than 8 million uninsured children nationally I thank my colleagues for their continued support for this bill  And I urge the President to stop blocking this vital program  Thank you
