                                                  News Release          Senator Murray Questions Nominees for Mine Safety and OSHA    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  January 31  2006    Today at a hearing of the Senate HELP Committee  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  questioned two of President Bush s nominees for critical worker safety positions          The nominees are Richard E  Stickler to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  and Edwin G  Foulke  Jr to head the the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA        A transcript of Senator Murray s opening comments and questioning of the nominees follows    SENATOR MURRAY   Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this confirmation hearing to review the qualifications of the President s nominees to head the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA        The recent mining disasters in West Virginia should serve as a stark warning to all of us that we need to do more to protect our workers on the job  MSHA and OSHA should stand at the forefront of efforts to protect workers through new technology and new regulations           Instead  we have seen this administration s industry dominated political appointees remove numerous critical health and safety regulations from their safety agenda           And today it would appear we are being offered more of the same  While I am sure Mr  Stickler and Mr  Foulke are honorable men  their professional backgrounds give me pause  I wonder whether a coal company executive like Mr  Stickler will continue MSHA s policy of entering into voluntary partnerships with his former industry colleagues  while failing to move forward on important technological and other mine safety improvements           Under his industry predecessor  MSHA pulled 18 health and safety regulations from its agenda  reduced fines  and sought budget cuts and staff reductions at the agency  In his testimony Mr  Stickler said the Mine Act was working just fine  yet we know that over the last 5 years there have been over 400 fires in underground coal mines  often ignited because of accumulations of coal dust  A regulation to reduce coal dust was pulled from MSHA s regulatory agenda in 2002           For the last several years  Mr  Foulke has worked for Jackson Lewis  which is widely known as one of the most anti worker law firms in the country  A lawyer with a background of defending his corporate clients against workers who have been injured on the job does not strike me as the best hope for improving worker safety           And it certainly does not square with the original language Congress used when chartering OSHA    to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions             Mr  Chairman these are the only two agencies in the Federal Government which are explicitly chartered to protect workers on the job  Given their professional backgrounds  I am not at all sure these two nominees are the best candidates to fill these two critically important jobs  The President should go back to the drawing board and nominate individuals with health and safety backgrounds that will put the interests of workers first and foremost on their agendas           We owe that to the families of the miners in West Virginia  as well as the thousands of other workers around the country who are injured on the job every year       SENATOR MURRAY  Well  thank you  Mr  Chairman  for having this extremely important hearing  and thank you both for being here today  We are very interested in your answers  I know I will have more questions to submit that I will not be able to ask today  but it is terribly important that both of you recognize that the lives and the health of thousands and thousands and thousands of Americans will be in your hands  and the philosophy that you direct these departments and agencies with  I certainly think the mining accident made all of us much more aware that what we enact in terms of regulations and how we enforce those and whether they are voluntary can make the difference in whether or not someone s life is saved or not  So both of you are potentially heading up agencies that all of us are really looking to  to see where they go from here    I echo the words of Senator Kennedy  Mr  Stickler  and I know you are an honorable man  I think I want to hear from you where you are going to fall when it comes down to enforcing these regulations  I know West Virginia enacted very quickly a package of mine safety reforms  and I want to know from you  Are you going to move forward quickly in that direction  or are we going to hear more of the voluntary private partnership philosophy of they will do the right thing if we just sit back and let them  Or do you believe that we should move forward quickly with new mine safety provisions       MR  STICKLER  Well  I am aware that MSHA has already sent out the notice for information regarding technology for mine rescue or rescue devices or new technology in general  And if I am confirmed  I would look forward to reviewing the record of the information that comes in       SENATOR MURRAY  Do you see yourself coming back and encouraging us to move forward quickly on regulations to make sure that this does not happen again        MR  STICKLER I think whatever it will take to prevent these kind of tragic accidents is what I will pursue  the best of my ability to put those in place       SENATOR MURRAY  We do not know you well  Are you a fast acting  emphatic person  Or are you a person who sits back and looks at study after study       MR  STICKLER  Well  I am an engineer  I am analytical  but I don t think I have ever had paralysis from analysis  I try to get to the important points in my analysis and make appropriate decisions  and certainly the many years that I have been a manager requires somebody that can make decisions quickly       SENATOR MURRAY  You have a lot of background and experience  Do we need to update the laws that are out there       MR  STICKLER  The Federal mine health and safety laws       SENATOR MURRAY  Yes       MR  STICKLER  I think generally the laws are adequate  Since 1977  I have reviewed thousands of mine accidents and doing accident data analysis  and in the vast majority of the cases  the accidents could have been prevented had the law been complied with       SENATOR MURRAY  Do you think that was the case recently in the mining accidents       MR  STICKLER  Well  that accident investigation has not concluded  and the only information I have about it is what I have seen in the news media  and some of that may not be correct  But my experience has been that it is very important to complete a thorough investigation  collect all of the facts  and analyze those to determine the root cause  Once you have the root cause identified  then it is not that difficult to determine what corrective action should be taken      SENATOR MURRAY  OK  Thank you  I think that answers my question  and I just have a minute left  and I do want to direct a question to Mr  Foulke   I think you know that when OSHA was chartered  it was to assure  insofar as possible  every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions  And I just have to say that  looking at your resume and knowing that you come from a law firm that defends corporate clients against workers  causes me concern as to which side you are going to be on  And so I will be listening to you  the answers to your questions as to whether you are going to be advocating for workers  If you could just comment real quickly  and then I have a question on asbestos I want to ask      MR  FOULKE  Well  Senator Murray  I would say that my practice  especially through the Review Commission and then since then with my current law firm  you know  has been focused   on safety and health  and that I have worked with clients not only to abate their problems  the citations that they have received  but also to work with them to enhance their safety and health programs  So I think my         SENATOR MURRAY  Do you think it should be voluntary  or do you think that we need mandates      MR  FOULKE  Well  Senator  I think you need both  to tell you the truth  The act itself was set up and had a strong enforcement provision in the act  And so enforcement clearly is a tool that OSHA has to have  utilizing to ensure that workers are protected  But  also  we have to have  I think  the compliance outreach to assist employers to have programs in place  because  really  when you look at it  enforcement in the long run normally deals with after the fact when there has been some violation or some problem has occurred           Our goal should be to prevent any injuries and illnesses in the future  and so I think you work with the enforcement but also have the compliance assistance program to assist in getting those programs in place that we never have that problem      SENATOR MURRAY  Mr  Chairman  if you will indulge me just one question on asbestos  and I would like to submit my other questions for the record  I have done a great deal of work in the U S  Senate on trying to ban the production and importation of asbestos in this country and have seen the devastating impacts  As we all know  we are now struggling with how to pay for it  This country still allows the use of asbestos in the industry  Do you think that OSHA should propose a ban on the use of asbestos in the United States      MR  FOULKE  Well  Senator  I look at it from an OSHA perspective  We do have our asbestos standard in place  and I think that as long as we are assuring that that standard is being enforced  that employees and workers will not be exposed to asbestos      SENATOR MURRAY  So you think it is okay to have it here as long as we are just watching our workers       MR  FOULKE  It is my understanding that asbestos was no longer being utilized       SENATOR MURRAY  Asbestos is being used in this country today      MR  FOULKE  Well  on that issue  if the Congress was going to be promulgating some type of standard or some type of regulation  I would be happy to work with you on that and provide input      SENATOR MURRAY  Well  I will submit a number of questions on the record  Asbestos still is imported and used in a number of products in this country  including brakes  and we are trying to deal with the health outcomes of that exposure  And it seems to me the first thing we should do is ban the use of it  and I will submit a number of questions for the record on that issue  and several others  Mr  Chairman
