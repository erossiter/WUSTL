                                                                    News Release          Murray  Budget Resolution Shortchanges Washington State  Puts Future at Risk    For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 28  2005     of Senator Murray s Floor Speech         WASHINGTON  D C      Tonight  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke on the Senate floor to outline her concerns with the Republican budget resolution  which sets spending priorities for Fiscal Year 2006         Since the president first released his budget request in February  Murray has used her position on the Senate Budget Committee to try to increase investments in Washington state priorities  She offered amendments to          Fully fund the cost of veterans   health care  and to      Restore cuts to 48 education programs either cut or eliminated in the president  s budget        Both of her amendments were defeated on party line votes in the Committee   Murray also offered her amendment to fund veterans   health care on the floor of the U S  Senate where it was again defeated on a largely party line vote        Murray also helped to obtain a   Sense of the Senate    resolution opposing arbitrary cuts and caps to Medicaid       Murray  s full comments on the Budget Resolution follow        Mr  President  tonight  families in Washington state and across the country are concerned about the security of their jobs  their communities  access to affordable health care and a quality education   Unfortunately  rather than inspiring confidence  the budget we are voting on tonight leaves too many Americans questioning the future         On issue after issue  this budget falls short of what our communities and our country need to move forward        I  ve served on the Budget Committee for 12 years   I  ve served through recessions and economic expansion  during periods of record surplus and record deficit         I know what responsible budgets look like because I  ve worked with chairmen of both parties to create them   Unfortunately  this Republican budget fails to create jobs  improve security and meet our country  s needs       Power Grab    I am particularly concerned that this budget agreement was reached behind closed doors    with just one party in the room          The Republicans control Congress  but that does not mean that half the country has lost its voice or that the majority has carte blanche to make decisions that will hurt families and communities across the country          This is becoming an all too common tactic of the majority party these days          We  ve seen it with a power grab that seeks to undermine the constitution and minority rights on judicial nominations          While simultaneously moving toward breaking Senate rules  they  re ignoring the needs of the American people by shortchanging them with a pathetic budget that fails to protect our nation  s priorities or fulfill our commitment to our children  our seniors  or our veterans       Medicaid    One powerful example of how this power grab will hurt the most vulnerable is the billions of dollars this budget cuts from Medicaid          At a time when Washington state and others across the country are struggling to meet soaring health care costs  we should not be playing games with a program that helps ensure coverage to our most vulnerable residents   The guarantee of health insurance that Medicaid provides is a solemn commitment        In March  a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to strike the President  s dangerous cuts to Medicaid   And just yesterday the House of Representatives  too  said   no    to the cuts         But today    ignoring the wishes of the majority of Americans  and a majority of both houses of Congress    here we are  voting on a budget that includes these dangerous and short sighted cuts         As more and more working families struggle to pay for health care without the benefit of insurance  Congress has a responsibility to protect safety nets like Medicaid  not tear them down        Those cuts    and this budget    are both irresponsible and wrong         This Budget is Bad for Washington State    And this budget offers too little help for families in Washington state   My state has struggled over the past few years to get back on its feet          But this budget does not give Washington state families the support they deserve as they work to turn our economy around and build for the future          Washington residents deserve a real federal commitment as they work to create jobs  provide health care  and improve security and transportation   But on the issues important to my state  this budget comes up short         Deficits    Not only is this budget bad for Washington state  but it  s also bad for our country  s economic future    lining up massive deficits for years to come   While many in the Majority speak of the need for   fiscal discipline     the rhetoric doesn  t match the reality          We are currently fighting a war in Iraq and Afghanistan that we are paying for entirely out of deficit spending           We are paying for today  s war on the backs of our children and grandchildren  when we should be doing it responsibly as a part of the budget   And that s only one of the many major spending initiatives this budget chooses to ignore in favor of heaping the consequences on generations to come         That is the most fiscally irresponsible action we could take        Veterans    Mr  President  this budget also shortchanges our veterans   Washington state is home to 700 000 veterans   They rely on the services they were promised when they signed up   Washington state has also sent thousands of brave men and women to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan and now  a large group is returning home    including nearly 4 000 members of the National Guard          That is why I tried twice in the budget process to increase funding for Veterans healthcare services   And twice  the Republicans said   no      I even tried to add this funding to the Supplemental    because caring for our veterans are a cost of war   Again  the majority party turned their backs        Mr  President  I am extremely disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have chosen to turn their backs on our veterans   By denying the crisis at the VA  they are ignoring our responsibility to fully provide for the men and women who risk their lives for our freedom        Now  the Republicans say that we can take care of the needs of our veterans through the appropriations process   Well  I  m telling you  that with this budget before us today  there will not be enough money to take care of our veterans through appropriations alone   They will be competing with our military bases and other critical needs for precious few funds          Our veterans  our military and our future recruits deserve better   We send these brave men and women overseas to fight for us   They should not have to fight for the healthcare they ve earned when they return home      Education    Next  let me turn to education   This budget fails to provide the funding that was promised in the No Child Left Behind Act   The Republican budget comes up short of what our local schools need to fulfill this promise to our children          I am also concerned that this budget drastically cuts student loan programs and programs which provide critical early intervention and preparation for students to help them graduate from high school and succeed in college       Transportation    Finally  Mr  President  I want to turn to transportation   Investing in transportation infrastructure means investing in and promoting jobs and economic growth          It  s estimated that for every  1 billion we spend on our transportation infrastructure  we create over 47 000 good paying family wage jobs   We know that investing in our transportation priorities today will help us improve our quality of life and provide for future economic growth          If this Congress truly cared about investing in jobs we would be considering a budget that includes the funding necessary to invest in our roads  highways and bridges across the country   Unfortunately  once again  this budget does not provide for our national priorities or future economic growth         Budget breaks promises  ignores needs    Mr  President this at the start of this second term  this Administration promised to restore bipartisanship and promised to reach across party lines to meet the challenges of governing          As a member of this joint House Senate Conference Committee  I can tell my colleagues that we were not even invited to the table  We were told our presence was not necessary  This partisan  back room dealing spells disaster for the entire budget process         Adoption of this Budget Resolution is only the first step in a lengthy budget process         It is far too early for this process to break down         I am disappointed in the decision to ignore many of the bipartisan amendments adopted in the Senate and as a Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I fear that this kind of partisan tone will make past budget battles seem mild         Mr  President  we ve heard a lot about fiscal responsibility throughout this budget process  Unfortunately  those lessons are ignored in this budget resolution          We are ignoring our priorities and our responsibilities and increasing our deficits    I urge my colleagues to reject this budget agreement and to work on a budget framework that invests in our future and pays our debts from the past
