                                                         Murray  Amtrak   Senator Murray s Remarks at Senate Appropriations Hearing  02 28 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          Amtrak   Senator Murray s Remarks at Senate Appropriations Hearing Subcommittee on Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 28  2007                This morning  the Subcommittee will hear testimony on the nation s intercity passenger railroad   Amtrak   This past year  like the year before it  Amtrak posted a new record for ridership   24 3 million passengers    The reasons behind Amtrak s recent success go right to the heart of the debate over whether we need a national intercity railroad   People boarded Amtrak in record numbers  Because gas prices were too high  Because highways were too congested  Because runways were too congested  Because weather eliminated other travel options  and because airlines abandoned air service to rural communities   Amtrak certainly isn t the perfect solution to all these problems   But it is certainly one part of the solution          Many of my Congressional colleagues have cited Amtrak s service problems and subsidy needs and have called for dramatic reforms   I agree that there are opportunities for reform at Amtrak   But we would all do well to remember some things about Amtrak s history before we launch into wholesale reforms with unknown outcomes   Amtrak was created several years ago by combining the money losing passenger operations of several different railroads          The government didn t have the luxury of designing a national passenger railroad from scratch   To the contrary  with several railroads heading rapidly into bankruptcy  Amtrak was created to take over these financial liabilities and link together all these money losing passenger lines          Today  Amtrak    as we know it    is still a hodgepodge   Amtrak owns its track in one region of the country but not in other regions  Some states like mine pay for both the operating costs and some capital costs of their trains  Some states pay just a portion of the operating costs  and still other states pay absolutely nothing for their Amtrak service   Some Amtrak services run with equipment that is just a few years old   Some services run with equipment that is several decades old   Even today  some of Amtrak s equipment dates back from before the railroad was founded   Some of it even dates back to before World War II        When you are dealing with a hodgepodge system  you need to be very suspicious of reforms where one size is expected to fit all   I believe that reforms are needed at Amtrak   But I also believe that these reforms should not just be about cutting employees  cutting wages  and cutting communities off of the national rail map        When it comes to cutting employees  Amtrak has already dropped its employee headcount by almost 6 250   That is a cut of more than 25 percent in the last six years   When it comes to wages  most Amtrak employees haven t seen a real wage increase in almost eight years        Last year  in the name of  reform   Amtrak s Board of Directors proposed to send some Amtrak jobs overseas   That s right    a company that receives over a billion dollars in taxpayer money each year  would be using those tax dollars to send jobs overseas   Senator Byrd and I included an amendment on last year s Appropriations bill to prohibit that   As a result  the Amtrak Board abandoned its plan   My point here is that not everything that is proposed in the name of  reform  makes sense for the American people  for the taxpayers  or for Amtrak s passengers          I can think of a number of  reforms  at Amtrak that do make sense and are long overdue   They include          Reforming the way the nation s freight railroads dispatch Amtrak trains  so that the passengers have a fighting chance to arrive on time        Reforming the way Amtrak compensates its employees  so they can attract and retain the skilled personnel they need  and      Reforming the way the Bush Administration budgets for Amtrak s needs  so that the Administration and the Congress can focus together on truly modernizing the railroad rather than battling annually over whether the railroad will be allowed to limp into the next year        When you look at the recent record  Amtrak has been able to increase riders and revenue    not just on the Northeast Corridor    but on its state supported and long distance trains as well          That fact is all the more impressive when you look at the abysmal on time performance on some of these trains outside the Northeast Corridor   Outside the Corridor  Amtrak travels over track that is owned  maintained  and dispatched by the freight railroads              But  as a matter of Federal law  those freight railroads are required to give Amtrak trains preference over freight traffic when dispatching traffic over their rails   When you look at the on time performance of many of these Amtrak trains  you have to question whether the law is being ignored              There is no question that we need our freight railroads to move cargo   Freight mobility is essential to our economy   especially in an agricultural and trade state like mine    It is simply not realistic to expect our freight railroads to put every coal and container train on a siding so passenger trains can breeze through          But right now  more than half of Amtrak s long distance trains arrive late    many of them extremely late   When you review the data as to why these trains are late   there is one factor that out weighs all the others   interference with freight trains   More than 76 percent of the delay time that these trains endure is associated with problems at the host freight railroad   It is either interference with freight traffic  slow orders due to deferred maintenance  signal delays or other problems          When you look at some of the Amtrak trains that are supported by state subsidies  the record isn t much better    Let me just discuss the examples of two states that get a lot of attention by this Subcommittee   Washington State and Missouri   My home state doesn t only finance the operating losses of the Cascades trains  it has even purchased some of the rail cars for that service   But last year  these trains still arrived late almost half the time          In Missouri  the state puts up millions of dollars each year to operate twice daily trains between Kansas City and St  Louis   But last year  those trains were allowed to arrive on time less than one third of the time   The on time performance of these trains in December was no better   It is a deplorable record          Given this record  it is amazing indeed that Amtrak can sell any tickets on this train    Yet  here too  ridership has increased because people want to use the service         When you look at the Bush Administration s budget for Amtrak and the separate budget request submitted by Amtrak s Board of Directors  there is one notable area where they are in agreement    Both budgets want this subcommittee to set aside  100 million in matching funds for the states to launch new passenger corridors   When both Amtrak and the Bush Administration agree on a budget proposal  you have to take notice        But given the problem with the on time performance of these State supported trains  I am left here asking           What is the point in providing additional funds for new state supported rail services if those trains are just going to suffer the same congestion and dispatching problems that befall Amtrak s current trains         If we are going to put federal tax dollars into capital improvements over privately owned freight track  shouldn t we be focusing those dollars on improving the current services before we start paying for new services        Why should states like mine   states that already make substantial cash contributions for their Amtrak service   have to put up even more state dollars just so that their existing trains don t arrive consistently late        So one Amtrak  reform  this subcommittee must look at is how we can better ensure that Amtrak trains have a fighting chance of arriving on time   No one should expect Amtrak to dramatically improve their ridership and financial performance off the Northeast Corridor when it is more likely than not that those trains won t arrive on time             Another Amtrak  reform  we should look at is seeing to it that Amtrak has the resources that it needs to recruit and retain the employees they need   Amtrak and its labor unions have not been able to reach agreements on a new contract for seven years   It is time for this impasse to end   Many crafts have not experienced a meaningful pay increase in all that time   The result has not just depressed employee morale          Amtrak is now facing serious shortages in a number of skill areas because trained and experienced employees are taking better paying jobs with the commuter railroads  freight railroads  or outside the railroad industry    Amtrak will not be able to improve its efficiency  safety  and service quality if it is the lowest paying competitor in the industry          Finally  it is my hope that we can start having a meaningful fact based dialogue with the Bush Administration about Amtrak s real financial needs   President Bush s Federal Railroad Administrator will testify to us today that  if we cut overall funding for Amtrak by almost 40 percent  Amtrak can still stay out of bankruptcy next year   I m not sure that any other witness will agree with that observation          The DOT Inspector General has performed a valuable service for this subcommittee by being an impartial monitor of Amtrak s financial condition   Today s witness from the Inspector General s office will testify that what Amtrak really needs is to be reauthorized          I totally agree that Amtrak desperately needs comprehensive legislation that addresses each of the challenges that I have cited and many others          I sincerely hope that such legislation is signed into law this year   This subcommittee s practice of providing incremental reforms through appropriations legislation each year is not the ideal way to do business          But  absent the enactment of a comprehensive Amtrak reform bill  we will continue to do what needs to be done to address these areas and keep Amtrak alive for the steadily growing number of citizens that demand the service
