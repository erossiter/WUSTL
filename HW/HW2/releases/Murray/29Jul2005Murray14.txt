                                                         News Release          Murray Declares Victory in Her Fight to Fund Veterans  Healthcare Senate passes  1 5 billion in funding to close VA shortfall for FY05    For Immediate Release  Friday  July 29  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   a member of the Senate Appropriations and Veterans Affairs committees  today declared victory in her months long fight to provide  1 5 billion in funding to the Veterans Administration  VA  to pay for veterans  healthcare          The funding will close a fiscal year 2005 shortfall that was announced by the VA over a month ago  and that seriously imperiled VA s ability to provide care for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan           I am gratified    and relieved    that we have been able to get VA the funding it needs to care for the brave men and women who have sacrificed for our freedom   Murray said    I ve been saying for months that taking care of our current and future veterans is a cost of war   It s a promise that must be kept  and I m glad that my colleagues agree          Murray inserted the amendment in the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006   The House Senate agreement passed the Senate this morning   It will now go to the President to be signed into law          Senator Murray spoke on the Senate floor this morning in support of her amendment         Her remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow     Mr  President  the U S  Senate has just done the right thing for America s veterans  I stand up in support of the bill  as it represents a step in the right direction for our veterans   Today the Senate will pass the Interior Appropriations bill for FY 2006  which includes my amendment to fix the VA s shortfall by providing  1 5 billion for FY 2005  This victory is long overdue  and I want to thank Senator Craig  Senator Hutchison  Senator Akaka  and Senator Feinstein for working with me to fix the VA s current shortfall        I want to make sure that the VA uses this money in the way Congress intended  As the author of the amendment  I can tell you that these dollars must go to helping veterans    It should not be used for budget shell games to make the VA look solvent   It should not be used for red tape or accounting tricks   It should not be saved as a rainy day fund  The money in this bill is there to help veterans get the medical care the have earned  It should be used to end the hiring freeze  provide mental health services to veterans  and expand the VA s outpatient clinic initiative  I will be watching to make sure that money is used the way that all of voted for it to be used        Now that we are taking care of the shortfall for FY 2005  we must turn our attention to funding for FY 2006  I want to make sure we don  t make the same mistakes that left our veterans so vulnerable this year  So far  I m a troubled by some of what I hear coming out of the Administration  With new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan every day  this problem will only get more severe          Veterans  funding has not kept pace with inflation in medical costs  When adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000   This is having a big impact on patients and on VA healthcare personnel   In my home state of Washington at the VA  s American Lake facility  you can only get an appointment if you are 50 percent or more service connected disabled  In the Puget Sound  as of January  there was an  11 million deficit  forcing the VA hospitals to leave vacant positions unfilled   The VA has dedicated  highly professional employees   They are working everyday to help veterans   We need to make sure the VA system helps them do that  rather than getting in their way        As we work on funding for FY 2006  I want to be clear that veterans need real funding  not budget games  Congress will not accept gimmicks like forcing higher fees and co payments on our veterans and calling that new revenue  Any plan that increases the burden on our veterans is also a nonstarter in my book  What  s really needed now is for us to step up and meet our responsibility to our men and women in uniform   This requires an infusion of cash to stop the bleeding at the VA and a real investment towards assistant America  s veterans   Now is the time to come together and provide the needed dollars so that our veterans have the quality  accessible care they need and deserve  The security and integrity of our nation depend on our willingness to keep our promises to our veterans  We have all heard reports of military recruiting not meeting its goals   Each day we limit veterans access to care  we are sending the wrong message to the troops of tomorrow         Mr  President  I conclude with a quotation from our first President  George Washington  who knew that helping veterans helps America s security   He said   The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country    I call on my colleagues to support this bill and work with me to keep the full  1 977 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Veterans  Affairs Administration for fiscal year 2006  We should do everything to assist the VA with this funding now  so that we do not face future shortfalls  I hope that everyone here will continue to support at least  1 977 billion in emergency funding for fiscal year 2006  Thank you  Mr  President
