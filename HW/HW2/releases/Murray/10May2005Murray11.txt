Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  05 10 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray Supports Funding for America s Troops But is Troubled by Immigration Provisions and Lack of Veterans Funding in Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill Murray Outlines Concerns in Speech on Senate Floor    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  May 10  2005          Washington  D C      In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  said she will vote for the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  which provides  82 billion for U S  troops and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan   Murray expressed her disappointment that the bill does not include funding for veterans healthcare and that Real ID  a far reaching immigration provision  was added to the must pass bill without debate or a vote before it reached the Senate floor        Senator Murray s full speech follows     Mr  President  I rise today to discuss the Supplemental appropriations bill  which funds our military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan   Overall  I support this bill because I think we need to get this money out to the troops   But I do have several concerns about what it leaves out  and how it was put together   I m particularly troubled that I and other Senators were denied a promised opportunity to debate and vote on some very controversial immigration changes that have been attached to this bill      Funding for Troops    First  I know how important this funding is to our troops overseas   In March  I traveled to Iraq to meet with troops from Washington state   To a person  each of them was a dedicated professional who was putting duty above their personal well being   They need our support and they deserve every resource that our grateful nation can provide   As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran and the representative for hundreds of thousands of Washington state veterans and military families  I support every dollar in this aid bill to help our troops protect themselves and complete their dangerous missions successfully       Lack of Funding for Veterans    Second  I am very concerned that when all of these new veterans come home and need medical care they  re going to be pushed into a VA system that doesn  t have the medical staff  facilities or funding to care for them   That is why I fought to include funding within the Supplemental to pay for a critical cost of war    the care of our nation  s veterans   I am extremely disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have decided that funding for veterans healthcare is not an emergency and not a priority   By denying the crisis at the VA  they are ignoring our responsibility to fully provide for the men and women who are risking their lives for our freedom   Our veterans  our military and our future recruits deserve better   Taking care of our veterans is part of the cost of a great military       Real ID Provision    Next  Mr  President  I am very troubled by how far reaching and unrelated immigration rules got attached to this bill without a vote and without an opportunity to debate   The Real ID provision has ramifications for privacy  states   rights and immigration policy   I am disappointed that it has been rammed through as an attachment to desperately needed funding for our troops         Denied a Vote    Many of us are scratching our heads about how this Real ID provision ended up in the conference report   I know I didn t vote on it   I know there wasn t even a discussion of it in conference  but somehow    here it is    included in this must pass bill        I served on the conference committee   I want to share with my colleagues exactly what happened in the conference meeting so they will understand why the sudden appearance of the Real ID provision is so surprising to many of us   When the conference committee met  the Chairman gave assurances to the minority that we would be able to vote on several provisions when the conference met again          But the conference never met again    leaving no opportunity for the minority party to vote    much less to strike these provisions        Let me share the specifics   In our second meeting  Senator Durbin asked Chairman Cochran for his assurance that we would get a chance to vote on these immigration changes    and other open items    before the supplemental was sent to the floor   In fact  I want to read a portion of a transcript from that meeting   This discussion took place on Thursday  April 28th           Senator Durbin   I would also like to say to my colleagues  if this bill contains    as I believe it does    the Real ID Act  I would like a vote on that so that we can be on the record on an issue that has never been brought before committee in the Senate   My question to you is this  Mr  Chairman  there have been times when conference committees of this magnitude have recessed and never been heard from again   The next thing we find is a conference committee report on the Floor on a take it or leave it basis  Can we have your assurance that we will return for votes on amendments such as those we have debated today and those that I have mentioned           Here was Senator Cochran s response to Senator Durbin          Senator Cochran   Senator  I would be glad to make the assurance that if there is work to be done  if there are open items to be considered  that we can consider those in conference   I am not prepared to make a commitment as to when that will be   I don  t want to lead you to believe that I am going to surreptitiously or in secret reach an agreement on the other side without consulting with all the conferees on the Senate side   I think everyone in this conference has a right to participate in this discussion and I wouldn  t want to cut off anybody  s right to participate          Now I ve worked with Senator Cochran for many years  and I know him to be a man of his word   Mr  President  to me that exchange meant that we would have an opportunity to vote on the Real ID provision  but that never happened   To me  that is wrong   The Real ID provision will have dramatic and far reaching changes and yet it has never been brought before a Senate committee and was never voted on in the Conference        Mr  President  that is why I did not sign the final conference report  which is unusual for me   I did not sign it because I believe the process was flawed  and we were denied an opportunity to debate and discuss these immigration changes before they were brought to the floor as part of a must pass bill        We are all very concerned about our security  but this received very little debate   Before Congress mandates these kinds of changes  we should have a more informed debate   In fact  it begs the question    why was this added to a must pass bill without any debate  Probably because it couldn  t withstand a rigorous and open public debate   But that s what we should have on this issue  and I m disappointed that the Majority denied us that opportunity        I also want to note the irony that the Senate is about to allow a technical fix to immigration related language that was included in the supplemental    which I agree needs to be fixed   but the Democrats in the conference committee were not provided any opportunity to fix the any other immigration provisions   I want to reiterate my frustration with how the Real ID Act was included  and that we were not given the same consideration regarding that language       Real ID   Impact on Washington State    Let me add that the Real ID provision has unique impacts on my home state   This section on immigration is particularly troubling to me because Washington state has proactively enacted several laws to protect the privacy of Washington state residents   While I understand the need for increased security  I don t think Washington state s law should be completely overridden by this provision especially with no chance for debate and discussion   We know this bill is going to pass because our troops need the funding that it includes   I am already working with communities and officials across Washington state to help find a way to implement these new requirements   And I will continue to push the Administration to provide the funding necessary to make these changes without piling new burdens onto our already cash strapped states          It is unfortunate that at a time when we should be focusing on the needs of our troops and veterans  the majority party is using the Supplemental aid bill as a vehicle to legislate on subjects that have not received the debate and attention they deserve   But at the end of the day  we cannot afford to fail in our missions abroad   With hundreds of thousands of troops sacrificing everyday in Iraq and Afghanistan  I support this Supplemental bill and I will continue my work to fight for their care as they return home
