                                                News Release          Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security    For Immediate Release  Thursday  February 3  2005     WASHINGTON  DC     Senator Patty Murray this morning joined the Democratic Women of the Senate to declare her intention to fight to preserve the guaranteed benefit provided by Social Security for generations to come   Social Security is especially important to women  Murray said  and it s protection is essential as the debate on President Bush s proposals moves forward          Citing the resounding success of the program in its 70 year history  Murray laid out a series of values and principles that must be preserved as Social Security reform discussions move forward   At the same time  she declared her strong opposition to President Bush s risky privatization scheme  saying it would do nothing to save the system while gambling the Social Security s guaranteed benefit on the stock market         Senator Murray s complete remarks follow     A few short years after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression  one of our nation s greatest leaders    Franklin Delano Roosevelt    set out to create a program to provide peace of mind and a sense of security to America s retirees   During his crusade to create the program  FDR said   There is no tragedy in growing old  but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support         The program he created is to this day the single greatest social insurance program in our nation s history   Social Security  as it would be called  has been a resounding success by keeping millions of people out of poverty            Just months before the new program was enacted  FDR laid out his vision of how this most important program should be implemented          He said   We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life  But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty ridden old age  This law  too  represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built  but is by no means complete     It is   a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness   Those were the words of FDR in August  1935       But today  this cornerstone  this basic American value  is now under attack          President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically restructured   But I rise today to reaffirm the values and spirit FDR laid out 70 years ago          Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of retiring minds at ease   America s insurance program is a guaranteed benefit that all Americans can count on           It s a promise that if you work hard  you ll have some security when you retire or if you become disabled  It s a promise that seniors won t have to live in poverty  And it s a promise that if your spouse passes on  you will continue to have the support and security you need         And of course the program is about more than security    it s about community   In America  we believe that it s important to take care of the generation that came before   It s important to guarantee them a quality of life   And it s important that we guarantee benefits after a lifetime of hard work          But I m very concerned that President Bush s  restructuring  will imperil the security of all Americans    from young workers retiring in decades to seniors retiring today   The problem with his plan is that        It s the end of guaranteed benefits  It does nothing to fix the long term issues the system faces  It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt  It s dangerous     We cannot  and will not  let President Bush tear apart Social Security          While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens  our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we re doing right by those who rely on Social Security    from current workers to retirees  the disabled and widows          Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them  and if I see something that s going to hurt our workers  our families  and our seniors  I m going to fight it with everything I ve got        Any discussion about Social Security must meet certain criteria if it means to be productive   You could call it a test    and any proposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from this body          We must       Preserve Social Security s guaranteed benefit  Preserve Social Security s protections for workers when they are disabled Protect against benefit reductions for women  minorities and all others Protect our budget from ever growing deficits       Anything short of this would be an unnecessary  dangerous gamble unworthy of this important insurance program          While we  re just beginning this discussion  my female colleagues and I have worked for years to ensure some basic principles are followed as we move forward   The promise of Social Security is especially important to women because women face unique challenges in retirement  We know that women make less money than men  women leave the workforce to raise families  women live longer  and women are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition         Even with those special challenges  Social Security keeps millions of older women out of poverty  Its benefit formulas are tilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and minorities  If the President privatizes Social Security  he would destroy the guaranteed benefit that low wage earners need in their retirement years           We also know that Social Security isn t just a retirement program  As I ve said  it protects disabled workers and their families  If Social Security is privatized  what happens to a worker who is disabled and can t contribute to her account  Today  under Social Security  that worker is protected  But there s no guarantee under the Bush plan           President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older women depend on  This is one reform that would have disastrous results  and I know we will not stand for it           Under this Administration  many things we take for granted from overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been threatened  Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security  I am here today to say that some things are just too important to American families  Providing real security to all Americans is a basic value worth protecting   We will make sure that President Bush doesn t gamble that security and break the promise Social Security keeps for millions of women and their families
