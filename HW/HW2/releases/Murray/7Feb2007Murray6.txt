                                        News Release          Murray  Larsen Re Introduce Wild Sky Legislation Wild Sky to be First New Wilderness Area Designated for Washington in Over Twenty Years    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 7  2007     Washington D C     Sen  Patty Murray  D Wash   and Rep  Rick Larsen  D Wash   introduced companion legislation in the House and Senate today to create the first new Wilderness area in Washington state in over twenty years  After more than five years of preparation  Murray and Larsen are hopeful that their Wild Sky legislation will become law in 2007         We have a great tradition of preserving the places that make Washington unique  and the Wild Sky Wilderness bill continues that tradition   Murray said    I m thrilled that we will finally have a real opportunity to protect this remarkable area  It s the right thing to do for our environment  our economy  and future generations         Senator Murray and I are introducing this bill to protect some of the most pristine forests and streams in Washington state   said Larsen   Years of community input have helped us carefully craft this legislation to protect Wild Sky  Washington families and businesses will benefit from this accessible wilderness for generations to come         Larsen and Murray originally introduced legislation to make Wild Sky a National Wilderness Area on May 29  2002  In the 107th  the 108th and the 109th Congress  the bill passed the Senate and enjoyed broad bi partisan support but failed to make it through the House        The Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2007 will designate 106 577 acres of national forest in east Snohomish County as wilderness  In the past  wilderness has consisted solely of old growth forest at higher elevations  Wild Sky protects thousands of acres of low elevation old growth and 25 miles of salmon streams to make the land accessible for recreational use       The area is located within 90 minutes of 2 5 million people        It s long past time we added this magnificent natural treasure to our nation s wilderness system  and this year we intend to get the job done   said Senator Maria Cantwell    Preserving Wild Sky will boost tourism at gateway communities all along Highway 2  safeguard accessible recreation opportunities  and protect an irreplaceable piece of Washington s natural heritage         Having looked down from the summit of Mount Baring  I can tell you this truly is wild country worth protecting   said U S  Rep  Jay Inslee  D Wash    who serves on the House panel with jurisdiction over wilderness bills    It s amazing we have such pristine forest so close to downtown Seattle   I look forward to helping the efforts of Senator Murray and Congressman Larsen by shepherding the bill through the Natural Resources Committee        The carefully crafted bill was designed after consulting with constituents and a number of interested parties  Public meetings were held in both Index and Monroe  Since 2001  staff from Murray and Larsen s office have been in constant communication with Snohomish County and the local Forest Service  They have also worked with the Washington Seaplane Pilots Association  local tribes  Washington Snowmobilers Association  Snohomish County Emergency Responders  backcountry horsemen and Washington Coalition of Citizens with disAbilities  Murray and Larsen continued to communicate with local stakeholders following the Fall of 2006 floods       Senator Murray s full statement follows     Mr  President  I rise today to reintroduce the Wild Sky Wilderness Act  a bill to protect some of Washington s most unique and remarkable public lands for families today and for future generations          For more than six years  citizens  community leaders  groups and organizations have worked together with Representative Rick Larsen and me to make this proposal a reality    I am proud to offer our bill here in the Senate on their behalf   This is the fourth time I ve introduced this bill  and I m really excited about finally moving this bill across the finish line this year        The Wild Sky Wilderness Act reflects the best values of my home state of Washington   environmental protection  stewardship of our land  and community partnership   It also respects the economic and recreational interests of the people of Snohomish County   Our bill will protect an important area while keeping it accessible for recreation and enjoyment today and for generations to come        For many years  I ve been concerned by the rapid growth taking place in Western Washington   It s no surprise that more people want to live and work in the region  but we need to make sure that development does not destroy the natural beauty that is such an important part of our state s identity and our quality of life   We also need to ensure that growth and development do not destroy native species of plants and animals that have flourished here for centuries        So several years ago  I began to consider new wilderness legislation   I learned that we haven t added any new wilderness areas in Washington state since 1984   I knew that if we were going to protect public land  I wanted to do it in an inclusive way by seeking input from local communities and stakeholders and working with them to develop a sound proposal   I am proud to say that the fruits of our labor are now before the United States Senate   My partner in the House of Representatives  Congressman Larsen  and I worked alongside all of the local stakeholders every step of the way to select these particular areas in the Mt  Baker Snoqualmie Forest        The Wild Sky Wilderness will protect wildlife and promote clean water by preserving the landscapes that host many native plants and animals   We can still find many of the species that have historically called this area home  but their populations are much smaller today   If these animals are going to be here centuries from now  we must protect their habitats   This wilderness designation is especially critical for threatened species of salmon  steelhead and trout  and it will protect the upper reaches of water to ensure prime habitat and clean water          In addition  our bill ensures that the public will have access to these remarkable  protected places   It s estimated that 2 4 million people live nearby in King  Snohomish and Skagit counties   Our bill will ensure they have new recreational opportunities in the Wild Sky Wilderness   In this hectic  fast paced time  more and more people and their families are turning to outdoor recreation on our public lands   This bill will provide new opportunities for the public to use this land by directing the U S  Forest Service to develop a series of hiking and equestrian trails         In addition to the environmental protections and recreational opportunities  the Wild Sky Wilderness Area will be good for the local economy   Every climber  hiker  hunter and angler setting out for the Wild Sky Wilderness will be stopping at hotels  campgrounds  restaurants  and stores in the gateway communities of Index  Skykomish  Monroe  Miller River  Startup  Grotto  Baring  Sultan  and Gold Bar         Over the years  so many people have worked hard to make this bill possible  I can t name all of them  but I do want to recognize one great leader who is not with us to see the progress she helped make possible  Karen Fant   Anyone involved in wilderness protection knows the legacy that Karen has left us through her years of advocacy for our state s natural places   Early on  Karen recognized the need to bring together and involve local people in efforts to protect wilderness  She co founded and directed the Washington Wilderness Coalition  and she was instrumental in forming a statewide community of wilderness advocates          To those who knew her   and especially those lucky enough to sample her famous cookies    Karen provided never ending inspiration and enthusiasm to continue working to protect wilderness and wild lands in the Pacific Northwest and beyond          I cannot summarize Karen s amazing four decades of service  but I think some of her many friends said it best when they wrote          There are thousands of miles of trails and millions of acres of wilderness that are protected due to her work and the work of others she organized to make a difference   As we walk these trails and gain renewal from these lands  we should all remember the work we shared and the fun and camaraderie we all experienced with Karen         With Karen s passing  we ve lost a pioneer in the fight to protect our wild spaces  but thankfully she s left a clear trail and a generation of inspired  empowered advocates to continue her work         Mr  President  I urge my colleagues to help my state take a great step forward in protecting our environment  improving recreation and supporting economic development by supporting the Wild Sky Wilderness Act
