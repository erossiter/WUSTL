                                                         News Release          Murray  Cantwell Demand Answers on Plan to Cut 260 Fairchild Jobs    For Immediate Release  Monday  September 25  2006    WASHINGTON  DC    Monday  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D WA  and Maria Cantwell  D WA  called on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to provide immediate answers to reports that Fairchild Air Force Base will lose as many as 260 jobs    While the possible cuts reported by Spokane media last week are part of anticipated force restructuring throughout the Air Force  the senators criticized the lack of details provided by the Defense Department as well as the Pentagon  s failure to notify communities surrounding Fairchild  including Spokane  and the Washington Congressional delegation of the plan  s details          Fairchild Air Force Base is not only a critical national military asset  but an important part of the Spokane community   The men and women of Fairchild and their families are a positive presence in our economy  our schools  and the livelihood of our entire region     Murray said     Just as they work to protect us everyday  we  too  need to ensure the protection of our workforce at Fairchild  and the best way to do that is to involve them  our communities and members of Congress in the decision making process             The men and women who serve at Fairchild play a critical role in protecting our national security  and are also valued community members     said Cantwell     Given the importance of Fairchild for our nation  state  and the Inland Empire  the Defense Department  s failure to disclose important details to the public and Congress about Fairchild personnel reductions is concerning           In a letter sent Monday to Secretary Rumsfeld  Murray and Cantwell criticized the lack of details on the Fairchild personnel reductions and asked for clarification on the military  s plans   Specifically  the senators asked for the number of positions slated for elimination and if there would be any additional cuts in the future   They also requested details on the Defense Department  s policy for providing public and Congressional notification in advance of personnel reductions like those at Fairchild          While we support providing the right level and mix of personnel to meet Fairchild  s present and future missions  there has not been adequate notification on this recent round of Fairchild personnel reductions     the senators wrote     We believe prior notification of the recent personnel reduction would have provided appropriate and important clarity to affected personnel  their families  surrounding communities  and the Congress           In their letter  the senators also highlighted the value of the men and women who support Fairchild  s multiple missions   Fairchild based personnel support valuable survival training and air refueling capabilities  and have aided in numerous civil emergencies  including wildfires and floods       The text of the letter to Secretary Rumsfeld follows      September 25  2006        The Honorable Donald H  Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Room 3E880  Washington  DC 20301 1000        Dear Secretary Rumsfeld        We are writing to request further clarification on reported job reductions at Fairchild Air Force Base  AFB   Last week  media outlets reported that Fairchild AFB will lose some 260 jobs as part of larger restructuring efforts within the Air Force   While we understand the Air Force has been planning to reduce its size as part of larger   force shaping    efforts  the lack of public and congressional notification on important details associated with the layoffs is troubling to us and communities surrounding Fairchild AFB        We are very proud of the civilian and military workforce at Fairchild Air Force Base  Fairchild  s hardworking men and women support multiple critical national defense and homeland security missions  The refueling tankers of the 92nd and 141st Air Refueling wings at Fairchild are vital assets in the rapid projection of forces throughout the region  nation  and world  As you know  Fairchild  s tankers continue to play an important role in ongoing military operations around the world  Additionally  the 336th Training Group of the U S  Air Force Survival School  based at Fairchild  provides critical training capabilities to the Air Force and other branches of the armed services  The group provides airmen with necessary survival training including combat and water survival  underwater egress  and survival leadership        For decades  the State of Washington and the communities that surround Fairchild AFB  including the City of Spokane  have embraced the base as part of the community  We understand that the mission of the Air Force generally  and Fairchild specifically  will continue to evolve  While we support providing the right level and mix of personnel to meet Fairchild  s present and future missions  there has not been adequate notification on this recent round of Fairchild personnel reductions  We believe prior notification of the recent personnel reduction would have provided appropriate and important clarity to affected personnel  their families  surrounding communities  and the Congress  With that in mind  please respond to the following questions         Can you confirm how many positions will be reduced at Fairchild Air Force Base as a result of   force shaping    activities        Which Fairchild units will have positions reduced    What positions will be reduced at Fairchild        When will the cuts take place        Will there be additional cuts at Fairchild as a result of   force shaping           How many cuts will be made to the civilian and military workforce at Fairchild        Will there be involuntary job reductions as a result of the cuts        What is Department of Defense policy for providing public and congressional notification on personnel reductions like those at Fairchild        Given the importance of Fairchild  s mission  the impact on the State of Washington  and the sense of uncertainty in the communities surrounding Fairchild  we respectfully request a timely response to these questions  Thank you very much for your attention to this important matter        Sincerely        Senator Patty Murray  Senator Maria Cantwell
