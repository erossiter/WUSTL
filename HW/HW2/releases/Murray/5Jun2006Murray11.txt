                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Statement of Sen  Patty Murray on the Proposed Washington State Pharmacy Regulation Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Statement of Sen  Patty Murray on the Proposed Washington State Pharmacy Regulation Change  06 05 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement of Sen  Patty Murray on the Proposed Washington State Pharmacy Regulation Change    For Immediate Release  Monday  June 5  2006     I am deeply troubled and disappointed by the proposed regulation by the Washington State Board of Pharmacy  This proposal would directly undermine Washington State s proud tradition of expanding access to care and protecting reproductive choice          In an effort to clarify  this proposal creates new barriers to care and would allow a pharmacist to refuse to fill a legal prescription for any reason   No patient should be denied a medically appropriate  safe  legal prescription based on personal  religious  or moral objections of individual pharmacists   Women should not be at the mercy of their local pharmacists   Instead  women must be allowed to make their own appropriate health care decisions without undue interference   Whenever regulators allow personal ideology to interfere with science  women s health suffers        In my ongoing fight to protect the health and safety of women across the country  I have often pointed to Washington State as a proud example   We were one of the first states to act to expand access to Plan B  and we have seen the rates of unintended pregnancy decline as a result   The Board  s decision to restrict access is not consistent with our strong record of expanding access to care          I urge the Board  during the public comment and hearing period  to carefully consider the ramifications of this Proposed Regulation and remember that they must work to protect patients first   Regulators pushing their individual ideology should never trump a woman s right to make her own health care decisions
