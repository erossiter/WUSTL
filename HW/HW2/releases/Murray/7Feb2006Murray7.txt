Warns that Budget Decisions Made Today Will Limit Our Ability to Help Families Tomorrow  Murray Says Budget Must Reflect Our Values   Priorities Senior Budget Committee Member warns   You cannot vote for an unrealistic budget in the Spring and then act surprised in the Summer and Fall when painful cuts are required      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 7  2006          Washington  D C      In a major Senate floor speech one day after President Bush released his FY 2007 budget request  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  warned that the decisions made in the Congressional Budget resolution this year will determine the government s ability to meet the needs and priorities of the American people        Murray  who has served on the Senate Budget Committee throughout her 13 years in the Senate  said that the painful cuts and last minute pressures of the FY 2006 appropriations bills reflect the flawed assumptions and wrong choices in the budget resolution Congress passed last year         The budget decisions we make now will either empower us    or tie our hands    when we turn to write the appropriations bills   Murray said         The Federal Budget is the statement of our priorities as a people   It should be a moral  thoughtful document   It should carefully consider its impact on the nation s best off and worst off    Too often  I fear  this impact is overlooked in all the details and process  Its impact is lost in the time from the budget s passage to the enactment of the final appropriations bills          We need a government that reflects our values    and provides real economic incentives to encourage job creation   Murray said    We can do that by investing in our infrastructure  providing affordable  accessible healthcare  supporting energy independence  providing education for all of our children  and protecting our ports and borders           Senator Murray s full remarks follow     Mr  President  a week ago we all listened as the President laid out his priorities in the State of the Union   At the time  I noted that what he says in his speech is a lot less important than what he does in his budget   Yesterday  he sent us his budget  and I am deeply concerned about what it means for our country  our people and our future   Later today  I ll raise some of my concerns directly with the Budget Director  and I ll come back here to floor time and again to talk about what we should be doing        But this morning  I want to step back and take a broad look at the significance of the budget and the choices before us   I want to remind my colleagues that what we do now will affect us    and the American people    months from now   The budget decisions we make now will either empower us    or tie our hands    when we turn to write the appropriations bills          I m speaking on the floor today to warn my colleagues that you cannot vote for an unrealistic budget in the Spring and then act surprised in the Summer and Fall when painful cuts are required        At the end of every year  Congress crams several important pieces of legislation through in a rush to head home for the holidays   This past year was no different   In a matter of days  we finished appropriations bills  authorization bills  and even spending cuts        Unfortunately  the logjam we experienced at the end of last year was not a surprise to many of us who work closely on the Budget process   Starting in March  many of us began raising concerns that we were headed in the wrong direction   We knew that there was no way we could         honor our commitment to America  s working families        enact huge cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid          enact another round of tax cuts        and continue to cut our nation  s deficit        When you add in the growing cost of war and Hurricane Katrina  the legislative train wreck was entirely predictable         But no matter what the hurry  make no mistake these bills have serious consequences  and their impact will be felt for years to come   They set funding levels  cut and grow programs  and set important policy for agencies and programs touching nearly every American          But it is more than that   Collectively  they represent our priorities and reflect our values   They provide the direction we intend to lead the country   And what too few Americans know    and too few Senators seem to remember    is that one single document serves as the blue print for these additions  subtractions and everything in between each year   I m speaking  of course  about the federal budget resolution       BUDGET RESOLUTION    Every year  with much fanfare and even more detail  the Administration sends Congress a spending and revenue plan for the next 5 years   Congress is required to draft a similar spending and revenue plan          Our work begins on the day we receive the President  s Budget and is supposed to be completed by April 15th   From early February  until April we debate  mark up  and offer a multitude of amendments   Most of the time  we complete this process and move to the next phase of the Budget process on May 1st   The Congressional Budget Resolution sets the tone for the entire Budget process  including Appropriations           I ve served on the Budget Committee for my entire Senate career   It s a very important committee  one that I take great pride in working on   But its work is not often considered newsworthy or particularly interesting for the press and public        While this process may not always draw front page coverage  its importance could not be greater     This one document is more than numbers and charts   From health care to energy  security to the economy  this one document is the vehicle that allows us to act on each and every priority the government will have for an entire year          The Federal Budget is the statement of our priorities as a people   It should be a moral  thoughtful document   It should carefully consider its impact on the nation s best off and worst off    Too often  I fear  this impact is overlooked in all the details and process  Its impact is lost in the time from the budget s passage to the enactment of the final appropriations bills        That s why this year with the benefit of our action at the end of 2005  with upcoming votes on left over items from last year  and with the President s new budget  I wanted to come here to the floor to ensure that we all know the stakes of this great debate          And I intend to be back  saying much the same  I fear  in the weeks and months ahead   This year s budget  and the priorities is enacts  will not be lost to time  if I have anything to say about it   It is simply too important to forget          OVERVIEW    As I listened to the President s State of the Union  I felt a real disconnect between his priorities and the challenges facing working families in Washington state  Americans across our country  and those fighting for our freedom abroad        We all want America to be strong again and that means we must invest in our people and in our infrastructure   What the President said last week matters much less than what he does in his budget          That budget is a document of values  and it will tell us if he is really intent on creating a brighter future for America or just giving us more of the same        It  s time to put the needs of America  s working families first   We need a government that reflects our values    and provides real economic incentives to encourage job creation          We can do that by investing in our infrastructure  providing affordable  accessible healthcare  supporting energy independence  providing education for all of our children  and protecting our ports and borders          These are the priorities that will make our union and our families strong   We also have a moral obligation to ensure that our troops who serve and protect all of us have the resources they need on the battlefield and when they return home          Unfortunately  if last year  s budget and this year  s speech are any indication  the President  s priorities are simply not in line with those of the American public         LAST YEAR S BUDGET PROCESS    Almost exactly one year ago  the President previewed his FY 2006 budget in the State of the Union address   He said  quote           My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results  or duplicate current efforts  or do not fulfill essential priorities  The principle here is clear  Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely  or not at all         A week later  we received a budget from President Bush that slashed health care programs  punished veterans  cut education aid  and increased the long term financial obligation we  ll leave to the next generation   His  non essential priorities  were made quite clear          In choosing to vote against that budget  I said         Families in Washington state and across the country are concerned about the security of their jobs  their communities  access to affordable health care and a quality education  Unfortunately  rather than inspiring confidence  the budget we are voting on tonight leaves too many Americans questioning the future         On issue after issue  this budget falls short of what our communities and our country need to move forward         I know what responsible budgets look like because I  ve worked with chairmen of both parties to create them  Unfortunately  this Republican budget fails to create jobs  improve security and meet our country  s needs         Mr  President  last year s budget proposal was a disaster   It cut Medicaid    the health care for our most vulnerable   It cut education   It cut veterans funding   And incredibly  once again it increased the deficit         The president has rightly been focused on our nation  s security  but his budget didn  t reflect the type of priorities that keep Americans safe   Speeches are one thing  but they ring hollow if not matched with a real commitment of funding          In fact  in his budget proposal last year  the President tried to cut Firefighter Grants  funding for U S  Search and Rescue  and the Port Security Grants that help keep cities like Seattle and Tacoma safe   If we are serious about our security  then each of these should be priority for this president        And after that budget passed    by the slimmest of margins  I might add    we felt the pain it inflicted   In appropriations debate after appropriations debate Democrats  and in some case even some Republicans  fought to provide the basic funding the services that make a difference in every American  s life most important programs needed          Several times Republicans invoked the budget  saying we couldn  t provide the necessary dollars because of its constraints   The budget and the Bush priorities were taking their toll        RECONCILIATION MADE THINGS WORSE    As if these painful cuts weren  t enough  the Bush team actually used the budget to ensure more hardship for the least among us    while handing out more perks to the best off          Through reconciliation  Republicans  saved  billions of dollars on the backs of the poor   Again  by the slimmest of margins in each chamber  they cut Medicaid  Agriculture  and retirement security programs            Reconciliation is intended as a tool for reducing the deficit   Unfortunately  the Republican leadership has pushed Reconciliation bills that actually make the deficit situation worse and pass the burden of tax cuts for the wealthy  and the costs of the war  on to the backs of poor children  the disabled and our nation  s seniors         I  ll say again what I said when they brought this immoral bill to our committee at a time when communities along our Gulf Coast are hurting         when we are facing the implementation of a confusing new Prescription Drug Law  when our roads  bridges and railways are aging  when millions of Americans are concerned about how to pay to heat their homes this winter  and when the men and women who have sacrificed to serve us overseas cannot find healthcare or jobs when they return home  we should be focused on protecting our most vulnerable    not handing them further burdens         Mr  President  there s one particular area that warrants mentioning because we ve heard so much about it in recent days  health care   We heard the president talk a lot about his health care priorities in the State of the Union address last week   But all Americans know that actions speak louder than words        One of the most serious challenges facing all working families is the escalating cost of health care   Instead of addressing the increasing cost of health care and its impact on the uninsured  last year  s failed budget strategy only makes the situation worse        In the Reconciliation package that the House approved  half of the cuts will come from Medicare and Medicaid   We know from a recent CBO report that an estimated 65 000 enrollees in Medicaid will lose coverage under the Republican Budget Reconciliation bill          The Reconciliation package shifts greater costs to working families and could reduce Washington State  s share of Medicaid funds by  185 million   The package requires higher co payments and premiums for low income children   It eliminates the focus on prevention benefits and early screening for children          Medicaid is an essential safety net program for seniors  the disabled and children   Without Medicaid  there are few options available for receiving care   Nationwide  40  of all births are paid for by Medicaid   Where will these people go for care   Who will pay        The reconciliation bill cuts  35 billion from services that make America stronger and make our communities more secure   all while burdening our children with massive debt         TAX RECONCILIATION    WRONG PRIORITIES    Rather than being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and helping our nation become stronger and more secure  and rather than paying down the debt  the Republicans are back up to their old tricks   They want to keep shoveling money right back out the door in the form of billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans          My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to point out that they cut spending by  40 billion  But they did so by cutting student aid  cutting health care for the poor and cutting other programs that are critical to working families   And the Republicans did it all while increasing the deficit         As outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said   If you are going to lower taxes  you should not be borrowing essentially the tax cut  That over the long run is not a stable fiscal situation         I agree  Imposing painful cuts on hard working families in order to pay for more tax cuts  and then passing the cost on to our children is clearly wrong  We can and must do better   And let s not forget   higher deficits also mean a larger debt          It is no surprise that we will soon be acting to raise the borrowing authority yet again for the Federal Government to over  8 trillion   This will mean less capital for small businesses to expand and higher interest rates for all working families   Once again  the budget and the Bush priorities take their toll         REAL PRIORITIES    As I look at the challenges facing our country    and as I listen to people in my home state of Washington    it is clear that our top priority now must be making America strong again   To do that  we need to invest here at home   That means taking care of education and health care  infrastructure and housing  safety and security   On each of these fronts  the Bush priorities have been    time and again    misguided  adrift  and downright painful for millions of Americans         HOUSING    I believe that in order to make America stronger we need to make investments here at home    in our people  in our infrastructure  and in our communities          Everywhere I travel in Washington state I hear from families struggling to find a safe and affordable place to live   Whether it is a young couple looking to buy their first home  a family searching for rental housing near their job  or a senior citizen who wants better access to social services  it is harder than ever to find affordable housing          Across the country public housing agencies and non profit organizations are working to help families find a place to call home   At the same time  they are contributing to community revitalization efforts that will bring new jobs and opportunities   But a lack of funding threatens the achievements that have been made and the work that is yet to be done         TRANSPORTATION    It is also critical that we continue to invest in our nation  s infrastructure   Recent cuts in transportation spending threaten to weaken airline safety  impose new transportation costs on American businesses  and cost tens of thousands of construction jobs          Investing in our nation  s transportation infrastructure will help reduce congestion  improve safety  and support continued economic growth   I urged the President to support these critical investments and put action behind his good rhetoric         EDUCATION    When I am in my home state of Washington and here in D C   I hear a lot of concern from the business community  local governments  and families over the United States losing its global competitiveness   In fact  we heard a great deal from President Bush the other night on this very subject          But last year  the FY06 budget set us on that path by weakening education programs at all levels   This new budget does the same thing        The FY06 budget so constrained education programs that the Labor  HHS appropriations bill failed once in the House and almost didn  t pass at all   In the end  programs faced one last hit    a 1  across the board cut further hindering education at all levels          At a time when schools are facing increasing requirements under No Child Left Behind and families are facing rising college tuitions  this is no time to be shortchanging education     Last year  s budget resulted in funding levels that represented the smallest increase in education in a decade   This year  the President is proposing the largest cut to education in 26 years        This year   12 7 billion will be cut from student loans that help low income and middle income families pay for college   Seventy percent of those cuts will be paid for by students and their families   These cuts will not go for balancing the budget either    they will go to tax cuts for those that need them the least          Tuition and fees increased this year by 7 1 percent for four year public universities and 5 9 percent for private universities  Not only is cutting student aid the wrong priority for our country today  but it will cost our nation dearly in the long term          Currently only one third of the U S  workforce has a post secondary education   It s estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st century will require a college education   Workers who have attended college have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment than those who don  t   And those with a college education also are more likely to have jobs with benefits like health care  retirement and pensions plans   We should be helping to break down the barriers to a college education  not building them up          VETERANS    Next I want to turn to veterans funding   With so many of our brave men and women fighting for us overseas  I believe that our most fundamental priority must be to take care of those who  ve sacrificed so much for all of us          While I  ve said time and again that actions speak louder than words  it was nevertheless troubling that President Bush failed to even mention our veterans in his State of the Union Address   I hope he will not forget them again in his budget proposal          I m concerned that the President  s Fiscal Year 2007 budget is not based on real numbers and does not reflect the real demand for VA services    I am convinced without real budgets based on real numbers the VA will face another shortfall later this year   And more veterans will be denied the care they have earned          The rising utilization rates  increasing costs of medical care  and the influx of vets from Afghanistan and Iraq will require more VA funding        In addition  the new Medicare Prescription Drug Program  has added more demands on the VA   Many seniors who are veterans are being told they should go to the VA for their prescription drugs   Surely  this influx of new VA patients will have a major impact on the VA system and will delay access for veterans         And finally  much of the increased demand on the VA system is due to the nationwide healthcare crisis   As veterans lose their healthcare coverage from their employers  they are coming by the thousands to the VA to get care for the first time           The longer the healthcare crisis continues to grow  the more the demands will be on the VA to take care of the veterans population          Last year  I was told that the VA did not need more funding   The Administration told me everything was fine  and that they could handle the demands brought about by the Iraq War           I tried time and time again to increase funding for the VA in order to maintain veterans   access to the healthcare   I was fought at every level   And then in June  Secretary Nicholson announced the VA was facing a  1 billion shortfall in fiscal year 2005 and that the VA had miscalculated demands in the VA by over  3 billion between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006          In June  when I asked whether or not the Administration had adequately planned for the impact of the war  I was told that the VA underestimated the number of Iraq War veterans by over 300           I was able to work with my colleagues to attach  1 5 billion in emergency funding for the VA on the fiscal year 2006 Interior Appropriations bill  and another  1 2 billion in the fiscal year 2006 Military Construction bill to cover this shortfall          Since the war in Iraq began there have been 2 245 casualties and 16 548 wounded soldiers  sailors  airman and marines   Our men and women in uniform    past  present and future    will time and time again answer the call to duty  and at the very least deserve a budget that fulfills our commitment to them and their families         So in closing  I look forward to debating President Bush  s budget   I truly believe it  s one of the most important actions of the year  because it sets the tone for everything else we do   Tuesday night the President told Congress and all Americans that  quote   In this decisive year  you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country          I could not agree with him more    our future and our character are at stake   A budget reflects our priorities and our values   Let s make sure our budget for the coming year reflects the best of both  and let s remember that the decisions we make now will tie our hands months from now
