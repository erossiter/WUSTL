                                                                                                                 For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 17  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  helped pass a budget resolution for Fiscal Year 2008 that reverses years of cuts and invests in America s priorities    The budget  which passed the Senate today 52 40  invests in key areas like education  children s healthcare  and veterans healthcare  It also funds Murray s SAFE Ports Act          We have finally turned the corner after years of budgets that neglected our needs at home and burdened our children with debt   Murray said    This budget makes the right investments for our schools  our people and our communities  and it does so in a responsible way         Murray helped draft the budget as a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee   She was one of three Senators who served on the joint House Senate conference committee that resolved differences between the House and Senate versions of the budget resolution        The budget conference agreement also passed the House earlier today   The budget resolution provides the funding framework for the Senate Appropriations Committee  which now begins work drafting appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2008        As the Senate debated the budget today  Senator Murray spoke on the Senate floor in support of the budget resolution       Senator Murray s remarks on the Senate Floor today follow     Mr  President  we re considering today a budget that reflects the priorities of families across the country  returns fiscal responsibility to Washington  D C   and invests in critical needs for all Americans   I m proud to support it            First and foremost  I want to thank our chairman  Senator Kent Conrad  for his tireless work on this most difficult task   I ve served with him through this process time and time again  and I m always amazed and impressed by his thoughtfulness  his attention to detail  and of course  his charts   He always works  along with his partner in the House Congressman Spratt    to establish priorities all Americans can be proud of   Writing a budget of this size and scope is not easy  but Senator Conrad has again this year proven that he is up to the task          Senator Conrad and all Democrats want a budget that reflects the priorities of American families  We do that in this budget by investing here at home    in our schools  our infrastructure  and our communities   And it still provides every dollar the President seeks for defense spending over the next five years        At the same time  Americans want the return of fiscal responsibility in Washington  D C   Every family knows the importance of balancing their checkbooks and paying their bills   They expect the federal government to be responsible with money  too  Unfortunately  for years  Republicans failed to manage tax payer dollars   Year after year they produced some of the largest debts this country has ever seen         Our budget says no more  Our plan includes strong pay as you go rules   This means we re being responsible today   and not burdening our grandchildren with future debt  In fact  we ve produced a budget that will produce a  41 billion surplus by 2012        American families also need relief from taxes   Our budget supports middle class tax relief  including extending marriage penalty relief and the child tax credit  The Conference Agreement also supports reform of the estate tax to protect small businesses and family farms  We also provide relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax for one year        Veterans   I m especially proud of the attention this budget pays to our veterans when they return home  From veterans struggling to get mental healthcare or facing month and year long waits for benefit checks  to a lack of focus on TBI care  it is clear the President has not adequately funded veterans  programs        Our budget reverses this and provides  43 1 billion for fixing these problems        Our budget also rejects the President s proposal to impose new fees and higher drug co payments on certain veterans   This would have forced more than 100 000 veterans to leave the VA health care system   This is not in line with the promise made to our heroes   Our budget restores this promise and pays honor to those who were willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice for our country       Port Security   Mr  President  our budget also invests in critical ports security needs    Last year we passed the SAFE Ports Act   Unfortunately  the President did not adequately fund this program   In our budget  we increased funding for the SAFE Ports Act  This funding means more radiation detectors  more partners in safe trade  and more customs officials to facilitate trade         Education   Our budget also reverses years of painful cuts to education   It provides the largest increase in funding for elementary and secondary education programs in five years   Our budget also increases Department of Education funding by  9 5 billion above the President s request  and restores all of Presidents Bush s education cuts  As a parent and former teacher I know the importance of investing in our children s  education   I am proud our budget does just that        Children s Healthcare  SCHIP    Our budget also provides up to  50 billion for SCHIP over the next five years   These funds will expand health coverage to nearly six million children  and is an important step toward providing every American child with health care         Mr  President  it is important to note that in three of the last five years  the Republican Congress failed to pass a budget   They even had a larger majority in the Senate than we have now   Unfortunately  we all saw the results of their failures   historic debts that are passed on to the tab of our children and grandchildren         Last November  Americans demanded a change  and this budget reflects that call   It returns fiscal responsibility to Washington  D C  and ensures our nation s priorities are addressed  I m proud to support it
