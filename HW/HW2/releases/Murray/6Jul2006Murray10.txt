                               News Release          Keep America s Railroad Jobs in America Byrd  Murray Oppose Effort to Outsource Amtrak Jobs Overseas    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 6  2006     WASHINGTON  D C    America s national railroad should not have its jobs outsourced to foreign countries  U S  Senator Robert C  Byrd  D W Va   and Patty Murray  D Wash   said on Thursday         Amtrak s senior management recently informed Byrd and Murray that the railroad s Board of Directors  all appointed by the Bush Administration  will invite private vendors to take over major parts of its national reservation system  including vendors based overseas          After having to fight to keep Amtrak alive in the face of budgets that would have put the railroad into bankruptcy  now we are fighting to keep Amtrak s jobs here in the United States   the Senators explained    Amtrak is America s railroad   It is funded in part with American tax dollars   Its jobs should be American jobs          Byrd and Murray on Thursday wrote to David M  Laney  Chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors  to protest the outsourcing plan and to urge the railroad to step away from its efforts to take jobs out of the United States   The letter was also sent to U S  Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta along with the other members of the Amtrak Board    If the railroad does not reverse its plans  the Senators pledged to offer an amendment to the Amtrak funding legislation that would block the overseas outsourcing plan         Byrd is the leading Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Murray is the leading Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations transportation subcommittee   Both will have a major role in moving the federal transportation funding bill  including operating funds for Amtrak  through the Appropriations Committee later this month          We believe it is wrong to use taxpayer dollars to ship Amtrak jobs overseas and put American workers on the unemployment line   This policy insults American taxpayers who expect their elected and appointed leaders to strengthen rather than erode the economic security of hard working American families   the Senators wrote to Mineta and Laney           Amtrak service relies on subsidies that are derived from the taxes paid by all Americans   As such  you and all the other Members that President Bush has appointed to the Amtrak Board have an obligation to expend these funds in a manner that reflects the values of American taxpayers   We believe that the vast majority of taxpayers would agree with us that it is wrong headed and inappropriate to use their tax dollars to ship jobs overseas    especially jobs necessary to operate our national passenger railroad   Byrd and Murray wrote       The full text of the Byrd Murray letter follows      July 6  2006       The Honorable David M  Laney  Esq   Chairman  Board of Directors  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  60 Massachusetts Ave   NE  Washington  DC   20002       Dear Chairman Laney        We write to voice our dismay and outrage over the plan of the Amtrak Board of Directors to consider the outsourcing of Amtrak jobs overseas   In your capacity as Chairman of the Amtrak Board  we implore you to immediately reverse this grossly misguided policy          The National Railroad Passenger Corporation  Amtrak  is just that    the national railroad that connects all of our communities   Over the last several years  we have been proud to lead the fight against those that would decimate funding for Amtrak  put the railroad into bankruptcy  and leave over 25 million passengers stranded at the platform   But we recognize  as you should  that Amtrak service relies on subsidies that are derived from the taxes paid by all Americans   As such  you and all the other Members that President Bush has appointed to the Amtrak Board have an obligation to expend these funds in a manner that reflects the values of American taxpayers   We believe that the vast majority of taxpayers would agree with us that it is wrong headed and inappropriate to use their tax dollars to ship jobs overseas    especially jobs necessary to operate our national passenger railroad          Just last week  Amtrak s senior management informed our Committee of its plans to solicit bids from outside vendors to take over certain reservation functions    potentially displacing as many as half of Amtrak s reservation agents at its call centers in Philadelphia  PA and Riverside  CA   They further told us that the Amtrak Board has decided to welcome bids from overseas vendors  Amtrak s representatives were quick to point out that the labor organizations representing their reservation agents would be given the opportunity to submit competing bids in order to keep their jobs   But the comparative cost figures displayed on Amtrak s own  Fact Sheet  make clear that the current employees don t stand a chance   According to this document  the costs associated with call centers operating overseas are 70 percent below Amtrak s current costs   The fact that foreign vendors can pay their employees very little while providing few if any benefits does not justify exporting even more American jobs          Recently  the Bush Administration has pursued a policy of outsourcing the collection of delinquent Federal taxes to non Federal employees    a policy we do not support   But even President Bush s IRS Commissioner had the good sense to ensure that these outsourced tax collection activities will be performed by contractors within the United States          We don t agree that the solution to Amtrak s financial challenges lies in the outsourcing of jobs   Just this past week  we received word from the DOT Inspector General that         Amtrak s most recent financial information shows a significant reduction in operating losses since    early March   Passenger revenues are up  particularly on corridor trains  salaries  wages and benefits are down due to lower headcounts  offset by higher fuel and power costs   In addition  some of Amtrak s operational reforms are being implemented faster and achieving savings greater than originally anticipated         We welcome efforts to reduce Amtrak s operating losses  but we believe it is wrong to use taxpayer dollars to ship Amtrak jobs overseas and put American workers on the unemployment line   This policy insults American taxpayers who expect their elected and appointed leaders to strengthen rather than erode the economic security of hard working American families        In two weeks  our Committee is scheduled to meet to report a Transportation Treasury Appropriations Bill to the full Senate   If you have not renounced and reversed your policy by that time  we intend to pursue an amendment to that bill to prohibit you from outsourcing Amtrak jobs overseas
