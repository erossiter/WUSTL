  For Immediate Release  Thursday  November 8  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    Today  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  joined her colleagues in voting to override the Presidents veto of the Water Resources Development Act  The override  by a vote of 79 14  means urgently needed flood control  navigation  and water quality projects can become a reality  The House overrode the veto earlier this week  Senator Murray said the vote showed the Senate wont allow the President to block critical projects that will protect Americans health and safety  This vote sends a clear message to President Bush that we are not going to sit idly by watch him veto vital investments in our communities  said Senator Murray  Its time to turn the page on the Presidents obstruction  This is the first step  I hope there are many more to come  On Wednesday  Senator Murray spoke on the floor about the importance of the bill  The full text of Senator Murrays floor remarks on WRDA follows  Mr  President  I rise today to urge the Senate to override the Presidents shortsighted veto of the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA renews critical flood control  navigation  and water quality projects that are important in my home state of Washington  and across the country  The bill ensures our waterways can continue to be used to move goods  It helps restore beaches and wetlands  which are vital to the health of our coastal communities  And it makes sure we are protected from catastrophic floods  These projects are critical to our economy  And  as we saw with Hurricane Katrina  they can also be a matter of life and death  Thats why I was astonished that President Bush vetoed this bill  More than two years after Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans  destroyed coastal Mississippi  and killed 1 600 people  the President said No to this bill  Even after he failed to respond to the devastation on the Gulf  he is standing in the way of projects that will protect the people of that region  Mr  President  81 Senators approved this bill in October because we understand that we have a responsibility to invest in these important projects that provide for our public safety and keep our economy healthy  The Presidents veto is another example of his misplaced priorities  Throughout the year  he has insisted on playing political games at the expense of our nations economy  health  and safety  So  again  I urge my colleagues to override this veto and show the President that hes got it wrong  I know most of the Senate agrees that its critical for us to address these needs now  This bill will help us avoid another catastrophe like that in New Orleans  And it will help ensure our environment and our economy stay healthy  WRDA Includes Important Public Safety and Economy Projects Mr  President  too many years have passed since the Water Resources Development Act was re authorized  Its now five years overdue  And the needs keep piling up  I want to thank Senators Boxer and Inhofe  Their leadership in the first year of the Democratic controlled Congress made sure this bill finally got to the President  Mr  President  the tragedy in New Orleans provided a dramatic example of how necessary this bill is  But there are hundreds of communities across our nation that have been waiting for years for Congress to act on this bill and ensure vital projects can get started  For example   WRDA creates a national levee safety program and ensures thousands of miles of levees across the country will get a general safety inspection  It enables the federal government to act quickly on critical flood control projects  And it helps local communities prepare for damaging and deadly floods   This bill is also about economic development  It ensures that shipping can continue on our waterways  enabling us to move everything from wheat  to cars  to wind turbines  from port to port  And its about making sure our lakes and beaches are clean and safe  It protects our environment  promotes recreation  and provides jobs  By vetoing this bill  the President said No to the communities that have been waiting for years to go ahead with these critical environmental  safety and economic development projects  Pacific Northwest Projects And Mr  President  some of those communities are in my home state  From shipping  to boating  to fishing  our waterways are vital to our way of life in the Pacific Northwest  That includes a major shipping route along the Columbia River  Container ships  bulk carriers  tankers  and car carriers travel back and forth along the river carrying goods in  and shipping lumber  grain  and countless other products out  Its vital to the economy of the region that the Columbia gets regular dredging and maintenance  WRDA lifts restrictions on the number of days federal dredges can operate to ensure that happens  And it helps my region in another way  too  The bill gives the Corps of Engineers another tool so they can eliminate a huge backlog of permit applications for people seeking to do anything from building piers to expanding a port  That will save local governments millions of dollars  So by vetoing WRDA  the President said No to the economy  safety  and environment in Washington state  too  The WRDA Veto is an Example of the Presidents Misplaced Priorities Sadly  Mr  President  the Water Resources Development Act isnt the first important  and bipartisan  bill the President has blocked  Its the fifth  Besides this bill  President Bush has already vetoed   Childrens health insurance  Life saving stem cell research  twice  And our effort to change course in Iraq and bring our troops home   And he has threatened to veto several more appropriations bills  He objects to the spending bills because they invest  22 billion more than he requested  Now  President Bush is happy to talk about pork and complain  But what he wont do is tell us  and tell the American people  just what he wants to cut  Would cut health care funding  Money to rebuild deteriorating bridges and roads  Maybe he would cut investments the FBI and DEA  Or perhaps its the millions in funding for things like job training and education he objects to  He wont say  But he should know this  we stand by these important investments  Our bills ensure that our roads  bridges  airports and railways are in good condition  that our children can see a doctor  and that we can do cutting edge research to find a cure for diseases like diabetes and M S  Yet the President has insisted on blocking these priorities  repeating his favorite four letter word  veto  Instead of investing in our communities  he insists on political games  Instead of progress  he insists on vetoes  Message to President Bush So we need to send a message to President Bush  Were not going to stand idly by and watch you veto these investments in our communities  Im urging my colleagues to override his veto on legislation to prevent another disaster like Hurricane Katrina  I believe that standing together  as our friends in the House did earlier this week  we can send a strong message to the President about who has the right priorities for America  And I hope that by doing this we can finally unite with our Republican colleagues in choosing a new course on other important bills  the childrens health bill  our Appropriations bill  even the stem cell research bill  Its time to turn the page on the Presidents obstruction  This is the first step  I hope there are many more to come  Ive said this before  and Ill say it again now  People around the country are eager for a change  They want to see a light at the end of the tunnel  We need to make sure the President cant put out that light
