Strong Support from Experts  Victims  Advocacy Groups and Other Senators    Capitol Hill Worker Testifies About Asbestos Exposure on the Job    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 1  2007    Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  re launched her six year effort to ban deadly asbestos by introducing legislation and holding a hearing on it   Murray s bill  The Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007  would ban asbestos  invest in research and treatment  and launch a public awareness campaign to protect American workers and families          How many more Americans have to die before our government finally does the right thing and bans asbestos   Murray asked at the hearing    We have to do the right thing  and we have to do it now          At the hearing  Murray held up photos of two advocates who worked with Murray to ban asbestos over the years  but who have since died from asbestos diseases   Murray honored Brian Harvey of Marysville  Washington and George  Fred  Biekkola of Michigan  saying  Fred and Brian are not with us  but their words hang over this hearing         Murray noted that up to 10 000 Americans die from asbestos exposure  and that asbestos is still put in consumer and industrial products on purpose   Murray held up a box of brake pads that are made with asbestos  which often pose an unknown hazard to auto mechanics        Also testifying was John Thayer  a pipefitter welder and supervisor of the 10 man power plant tunnel crew which maintains the heating and cooling systems beneath the U S  Capitol   Mr  Thayer  who works for the Architect of the Capitol  AOC   said he and his crew have been exposed to asbestos on the job          Just over a year ago  we found out that the AOC had been misleading us for years about the extent of our workplace exposure to asbestos   Thayer said   We asked to see the medical records from our annual employment physicals conducted by the Office of Attending Physician  My own records stated that my lung age was 118 years old   I was 33 at the time  No one ever told me this  on the contrary  every year the doctor gave me a paper saying I was cleared to work in the tunnels      Even worse  the Architect had let us carry deadly asbestos home in our clothes every day for years  without telling us that this posed a real risk to our wives and children        Other witnesses included  Dr  Barry Castleman  Dr  Harvey Pass  Mrs  Sue Vento  and Dr  Richard Wilson        Mrs  Vento spoke about her husband  the late Congressman from Minnesota Bruce Vento  who died from asbestos exposure in 2000            On the morning of January 29  2000  Bruce was told that he did not have lung cancer  but instead he was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma   Vento said    Bruce wracked his brain to determine where he could have been exposed to asbestos   He later recalled those jobs at the factories and the brewery during the early 1960s   His exposure to asbestos was no more significant than that which so many Americans have experienced in their work and home settings        Senator Murray held the hearing in her role as chairman of the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety   The bill has already garnered support from more than a dozen other Senators  including Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   who chairs the committee of jurisdiction  the Environment and Public Works Committee   Boxer joined Murray  Vento and Thayer at an afternoon press conference to express support for the bill           Senate cosponsors include    Senator Barbara Boxer  Senator Max Baucus
