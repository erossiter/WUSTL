Privatization Plan Murray  First Legislative Proposal Fails Basic Reform Tests    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  March 9  2005     WASHINGTON  DC     Senator Patty Murray today called the first officially introduced Republican plan to privatize Social Security a risky scheme that would add trillions to the national debt and unfairly slash benefits for women   On the floor of the U S  Senate  Murray reiterated her plan to stand up for current and future retirees by ensuring that Republicans aren t able to deconstruct America s social insurance program          Murray s full remarks follow        We ve heard a lot of talk on this floor  on TV talk shows and all around the country in recent weeks on Social Security   We ve heard about a supposed  crisis  in the program  that it will be flat busted or broke   We ve heard about the President s view that this social insurance program must be radically restructured   And we ve heard that privatizing Social Security is the only way to go          Now  we hear that the President is embarking on a 60 day  60 stop campaign tour in an effort to sell his privatization plan to the American people   But Mr  President  the American people aren t buying this risky privatization scheme          From the day this debate began  I ve consistently said that any proposal put forward to address Social Security must meet a few basic standards        It must          Preserve Social Security s guaranteed benefit       Preserve Social Security s protections for workers when they are disabled       Protect against benefit reductions for women  minorities and all others      Protect our budget from ever growing deficits          This week we in the Senate saw the first bill that purports to reform Social Security introduced in this body   But unfortunately  this first legislative proposal fails my simple test in a few not so simple ways         Guaranteed Benefit   First  preservation of the guaranteed benefit must be our top priority   The bedrock of Social Security is the guaranteed benefit  and the President s plan calls for cutting benefits by one third or more   That s a huge hit to every retiree who depends on the system           Like Bush  s plan  this new Senate bill will slash benefits   The plan has a further 7  reduction in benefits for early retirees    relative to current law    that is phased in between 2024 and 2028   In conjunction with the two pieces of the plan that raise the retirement age  the proposal would reduce benefits for those retiring at age 62 by 40  by the year 2026  by 50  by the year 2054 and   by 56  by the year 2080          The deconstruction of the guaranteed benefit leads us further and further away from the real security this program provides   And this country needs to know that even though Republicans don t like to campaign on it  their plans would be the end to the guaranteed benefit        Impact on Women   Mr  President  a few weeks ago I joined several of my female colleagues to speak on this floor about how the President s plan would impact women   Unfortunately  this is not a new battle   For years  we ve fought together to ensure that women and minorities receive a fair shake from Social Security reform discussions          The promise of Social Security is especially important to women because women face unique challenges in retirement  We know that women make less money than men  women leave the workforce to raise families  and women live longer    and are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition         Even with those special challenges  Social Security keeps millions of older women out of poverty  Its benefit formulas are tilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and minorities         Unfortunately  time and time again  we ve found that proposals new proposals will impoverish women and slash their benefits   This new plan is no exception   This plan would cut benefits based on a new life expectancy requirement   The Senate Republican plan says  and I quote   By factoring increased life expectancy into the base benefit calculation  the rate of increase in benefit payments will be slowed         Addressing the long term solvency of Social Security is a laudable goal    but trying to balance the books by slashing benefits for women is absolutely unacceptable   This plan would dismantle the progressive nature of Social Security benefits  leaving women with less money over a longer period of time          It makes no sense to reduce women s benefits    already limited by their lower income    by cutting them again simply because they live longer   In fact  we should be doing all we can to ensure progressive benefits for low earners that is targeted to those least likely to have other retirement savings   All too often  that means women           I won t stand for this Republican attack on women  and I know many of my colleagues will stand right along side me in this fight        New Debt   Finally  there s another most important issue that no one on the other side of the aisle or the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue cares to address   These Social Security plans would add trillions of dollars to an already massive federal debt    a debt that our generation will hand over to the next          In traveling the country to sell his privatization plan  President Bush has been saying         We have an obligation and a duty to confront problems and not pass them on to future generations         Many of us    on both sides of the aisle    agree with him   We should not create new problems for the next generation to handle   Trouble is  the president s plan actually adds to the problems of the next generation    it does nothing to solve them           This new Republican plan  just like President Bush s  would add trillions of dollars in debt to our country s financial sheets in the next two decades alone   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that the privatization proposal will create nearly  5 trillion in new debt over 20 years          That money is going to have to come from somewhere  and it s na    ve to think that huge new borrowing won t affect current retirees   It s na    ve to think massive new borrowing won t affect programs like Medicare and Medicaid that need our attention   And it s na    ve to think we ll simply go along and pass on this massive new problem to our children and grandchildren          So once again  we re left to consider privatization plans that run up massive new debt on the country s credit card while pulling money from the Social Security system and ending the bedrock of the program    the guaranteed benefit   That s a recipe for disaster          The President and his friends in the Senate seem fixated on private accounts  even though they will do nothing at all to address the long term solvency of the program   Last week  I joined with 41 of my colleagues to ask President Bush to take this risky scheme off the table before moving forward with any Social Security reform   The letter said  in part            Funding privatized accounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program  s long term problems worse  but many believe it represents a first step toward undermining the program  s fundamental goals  Therefore  so long as this proposal is on the table  we believe it will be impossible to establish the kind of cooperative  bipartisan process we need to truly address the challenges facing the program many decades in the future          Mr  President  we will not stand for the president s plan is for Social In Security   We will continue to stand up for future generations against a private solution that simply adds trillions in debt to our future generations   We re going to be proud of what we pass along to our children and grandchildren
