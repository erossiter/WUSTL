Murray FY2007 Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Labor  HHS and Education Appropriations Subcommittee Mark up      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 18  2006    Mr  Chairman  you and Ranking Member Harkin were dealt an almost impossible hand   You were charged with providing critical investments in our workplace  health care  and education    but you were not given an allocation to make that possible        Today  I m hearing from many friends and advocates who are calling for more funding for key priorities   I agree with them   But I also know that our hands are tied today by the unrealistic budget that the Senate approved in June as part of the Supplemental          I know that this mark is almost  5 billion above the President  s level and more than  1 billion over last year  but it still falls short of what we need          Mr  Chairman  I want to acknowledge your efforts  along with Sen  Harkin during Senate consideration of the Budget Resolution   You put partisan politics aside and brought an amendment to the floor that would have provided an additional  7 billion investment in job training  health care  education  elderly nutrition programs  Safe and Stable families  and home energy assistance           Your amendment received broad bipartisan support  and I was happy to stand with you and Senator Byrd throughout the Supplemental negotiations as our allocation was being considered            As disappointed as I am by some of the funding cuts  I know you and Sen  Harkin did your best         I do want to raise a few concerns that I hope we can continue to work on as this process moves forward   Perhaps when we go to the floor  the 73 Members who supported the Specter Harkin Budget amendment will again support additional funding       Labor    On labor issues  President Bush continues to play a bait and switch game with America  s workers  This President talks a good game when he visits employers around the country touting the skills and productivity of our nation  s workers  He often highlights the ongoing needs employers have for skilled workers to remain globally competitive   And when I travel around Washington State employers also tell me they are desperate to find workers with the skills they need to grow their businesses         Yet  for the sixth year in a row this President has proposed hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to job training programs  eliminating the hope of millions of dislocated workers  youth and disadvantaged adults to share in the American dream         Despite these misguided presidential priorities  Senators Specter and Harkin have gone to great lengths over the last six years to maintain a viable federal workforce and training system  I applaud their work        I also want to acknowledge their support for Senator Byrd  s efforts to provide increased funding for mine safety inspectors and technology        Healthcare   HHS    There is no greater issue facing working families than the issue of health care   The increasing cost of health care and the lack of access to affordable health care  is crushing families and small businesses   The increasing cost of Medicare and Medicaid is further burdening federal taxpayers   Yet  the very programs that seek to improve access  reduce shortages of health care professionals and reduce long term health care costs  are being eliminated or reduced          I am more than disappointed that we were not able to restore funding for the HCAP program  I appreciate the Chairman  s efforts to restore the President s proposed cuts to Children  s Hospital GME  NIH  CDC  and Poison Control Centers   But I know we need to do more to meet the challenges these programs address           While I am grateful for the additional funding for Ryan White Care Act  Older Americans Act programs  and Community Health Centers  these marginal increases will not allow these programs to keep pace with ever increasing demand for services   These programs reduce the burden on our health care system and provide care with dignity and compassion   We should be investing more in access and programs to reduce long term health care costs         Education    I appreciate the challenges that the Chairman and Ranking Member faced in funding education programs given the constraints of the budget resolution   However  I remain concerned about the continued cuts our schools are facing in critical programs          With across the board cuts  inflation  and the increasing demands of No Child Left Behind  our schools are facing dramatic decreases in program funding that affects their ability to serve students          The number of students eligible for Title I services has increased by nearly 10 percent over the last two years despite  level funding   and the federal government continues to slide backwards on its commitment to students with disabilities        Head Start    I am particularly concerned about the funding cut to Head Start   Head Start already has faced four years of level funding and across the board cuts despite increasing program costs and pressure to recruit highly qualified teachers   I am sure all of the members of the committee have seen the impact of the last few years of funding in their own states            In my home state of Washington  the lack of funding has resulted directly in cuts to services for poor children   In the Seattle area alone  there are an estimated 25 000 eligible children on waiting lists   We need to be increasing the number of Head Starts around the country    not cutting services          Student Loans    College students are also facing difficulties paying for school   This year   11 9 billion was cut from student loans that help low income and middle income families pay for college   Seventy percent of those cuts will be paid for by students and their families   Tuition and fees increased this year by 7 1 percent for four year public universities and 5 9 percent for private universities  Not only is this the wrong priority for our country today  but it will cost our nation dearly in the long term   Currently only one third of the U S  workforce has a post secondary education  but it is estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st century will require a college education  Workers who have attended college on average have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment than those who don  t   And those with a college education also are more likely to have jobs with benefits like health care  retirement and pensions plans         Title IX    I do want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member and their staff for continuing to be champions for Title IX   We share concern about the Department of Education  s new policy guidance on Title IX in athletics         It is critical that the Department of Education clarify that the model survey should only be used by schools as one tool in showing compliance and that the lack of response to a survey shows just that  not a lack of interest           I look forward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member to ensure that the Department follows through with the Committees request regarding changes to the Additional Clarification        I know the Chairman and Ranking Member were dealt an impossible hand  I appreciate their hard work to make the most of the funding that s available and I hope we can improve this bill as the process continues
