                                                                                       News Release          Senator Murray Voices Continuing Support for Early Care and Education For Washington s Children In speech to 1200 educators and child care professionals  Murray expresses support of Medicaid  Head Start  and IDEA    For Immediate Release  Monday  May 2  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Senator Patty Murray  D  Wash   today addressed the 25th annual Infant and Early Childhood Education Conference at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue   Murray  a former preschool teacher and a current member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  has been a Senate champion of early healthcare    including prenatal care    and early education for children          As a mother and a former pre school teacher  I know how important the early years are to a child s development   Murray said    In fact  I remember kids coming in on the first day of school in my pre school class   Many of the children who were not in high quality preschool programs came to school already behind their peers  and too many of them spend the rest of their lives behind  trying to catch up   she told the audience       Murray s remarks focused on the importance of Medicaid  Head Start  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA    Murray has spoken out strongly against proposed Bush Administration cuts of  14 billion to Medicaid   She also updated the audience on the upcoming HELP Committee markup and Senate reauthorization of Head Start   The Bush Administration has proposed that some of the funding in the reauthorization should go to states in the form of block grants  a proposal that Murray says are a first step in the dismantling of the program       Murray also spoke about her work on the recent reauthorization of the IDEA  a program crucial to learning disabled students who come from highly mobile living situations such as children who are homeless  in military or foster families  or from migrant working families   Murray proposed an amendment  which was accepted to the reauthorization  that increased access to special education services for these children in school and for early intervention services for children before they enter the public school system   Murray s amendment also strengthened early intervention services for poor  homeless  and foster children        In spite of a Republican budget resolution for fiscal year 2006 that guts education and healthcare programs relied upon by children from poor families  Murray vowed to continue fighting for these programs        It s a tough year for the budget  and for the programs we know are doing the most good for women and children in our state   Murray said    But I want you to know today that  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  I ll fight to get every possible dollar to ensure that our children get the good  early start they need   she said       Senator Murray s full remarks follow       It s great to be here with all of you today   And it s especially an honor to address you at the 25th anniversary of your conference   I know how important it is that you get together each year to share your experiences and your ideas  and I m so glad to be here today to talk about progress    and challenges    as we work to give our children the early start they need       First and foremost  let me begin by thanking you   Whether you re a health care provider  a child care staff member  a special educator or a parent of a child with special needs  or whether you represent a government agency or university  I want you to know that I sincerely appreciate all your efforts on behalf of our kids   You re on the front lines  and you re making sure our kids have the opportunity to realize their dreams by preparing them for school and the future       Today  I d like to let you know that I m aware of just how important it is that we get involved in children s health and education early   I d like to talk to you about three programs that are critical in getting our children the early care and education they need    Medicaid  Head Start  and IDEA         And I d also like to update you on what s happening back in Washington  D C  on each of these programs   I want you to leave here today energized to advocate on behalf of the children of Washington state   And I think it s essential that you know what s going on at the federal level so that your advocacy can be as informed and effective as possible       My Healthcare Philosophy      Before I turn to my discussion of Medicaid  Head Start  and IDEA  I d like to briefly share with you my philosophy on infant and early childhood development   And  you know  when it comes to infant and early childhood development  we share the same priorities   As a mother and a former pre school teacher  I know how important the early years are to a child s development         In fact  I remember kids coming in on the first day of school in my pre school class   Almost immediately  I could tell which children had benefited by getting the care and early education they needed to put them on the right track   Many of the children who were not in high quality preschool programs came to school already behind their peers   As you know  it can be difficult for children to make up that lost ground  and too many of them spend the rest of their lives behind  trying to catch up         I ve seen it happen   And that s why my philosophy on infant and childhood development is based on a continuum   This continuum begins with a healthy pregnancy and continues into the school years   We know this means providing quality prenatal care and continuing to provide prevention based care that includes immunizations and screenings for both mother and child  along with early intervention and education   It s only through a comprehensive approach that allows us to coordinate health  nutrition  and education programs that we can provide our children and their parents with a foundation for success in school       We Must Support Medicaid      And that s why it s so important that we support safety net programs Medicaid   Medicaid is a lifeline for low income women and their families  so any cuts will disproportionately affect them   Currently 71  of adult Medicaid beneficiaries are low income women   40  of single mothers are covered under Medicaid   In Washington state 42 5  of all births in the state are covered by Medicaid  and Medicaid ensures access to comprehensive prenatal care for these women   Medicaid is also the largest single source of health care coverage for children in this country   In fact  half of the 53 million Medicaid enrollees are children  with one in four children in this country relying on Medicaid for coverage       Considering all the benefits provided by Medicaid and the growing crisis of the uninsured  I believe we should be talking about strengthening the program   But as you know  in this year s budget    the Bush Administration has supported  14 million in arbitrary and damaging cuts to Medicaid         Now  I know we ve heard that this the President s budget proposal simply slows the growth in Medicaid   But  are we seeing a slowing in the growth of demand  medical costs  or new technology   Of course not       The fact is  to achieve savings  states simply have no choice but to drop beneficiaries from coverage    or reduce benefits   But we know this would have disastrous effects here in Washington state  and all over the country         Some in Washington  D C   who want to attack this vital program say that Medicaid is being misused and dollars are being wasted   Well  to that I say that I know we can provide incentives to use limited dollars more wisely   And that s why I support the Medicaid Commission to study how we can best utilize Medicaid dollars  without simply cutting beneficiaries         Yet  it s also important that we remember Medicaid is still far more cost effective than private health insurance   Medicaid spends 30  less per adult than private coverage  and Medicaid costs have been growing at slightly more than half of the rate of the cost of private insurance   So  the fact is that Medicaid works   And while the final number of the proposed cuts is yet to be determined  I know that any cut in Medicaid    even one dollar    will hurt poor women and children         It will make all of your jobs that much more challenging    and that s why I plan to fight these cuts in every way I can   Although it s a tough year for the budget  I hope for a balanced Commission that is able to make recommendations allowing us to improve the program without taking away this important lifeline for children s health and development       I also want to make clear that I will continue to use my position on the Labor HHS Subcommittee to fight for programs like the Maternal Child Health Block Grant  the Preventative Health Block Grant  CDC Birth Defect Prevention  and Nutritional Assistance that fill the gaps in Medicaid       We Should Keep Head Start Strong  But I know that it s not only about the physical health of a child    often  there are economic challenges to overcome   That s why I support Head Start    because it s a comprehensive program   The fact is  we should not be making an either or choice between meeting children s physical  social  and emotional needs or their literacy needs    any preschool teacher will tell you we have to do both     And you know  in my time in the United States Senate  I ve spent a lot of time in Head Start centers here in our state  and I can tell you that everywhere I go I see Head Start doing both  It s not just teaching kids    it s changing lives     Currently  more than 900 000 children are participating in Head Start    nearly all of them low income  and the majority of them well below national norms for literacy and language   About one quarter    or 250 000    of these children do not speak English as a first language   Another 70 000 have speech and language delays   And nearly one fifth of these children have witnessed domestic violence or have been exposed to violence in their community        Head Start is a comprehensive solution to these problems   Not only does it help kids hit the ground running with their reading and social skills  but it also provides great health outcomes   Annually  hundreds of thousands of children in Head Start programs receive medical treatment   Head Start provides meals and snacks    sometimes the only meals they will get   Head Start works with families to ensure children have check ups  screenings  and dental care   And Head Start provides parent education and involvement programs to strengthen and support families         Now  if you ask me  this sounds like a program that should be expanded to reach every American child who needs it   It sounds to me like a program that should never have to justify its existence or fight for its funding   Yet  as you know  the President has put forth proposals for Head Start reauthorization that could dismantle the program as we know it         One proposal that I continue to be very concerned about is block granting   The extra layer of bureaucracy that block granting would add to Head Start is not only unnecessary  but it undermines this important program s effectiveness    and we all know it s a first step towards de funding Head Start       The HELP Committee is currently working on the Head Start reauthorization  and as a member of that Committee I will work on strengthening the program  and fighting proposals    like block grants that would weaken it   As a member of the Appropriations Committee  I ll keep fighting for increased funding for Head Start that is not attached to any form of block granting   I believe that any honest discussion of improving education in our country must include strengthening Head Start       IDEA  Making a Good Program Even Better      And it s also crucial that such a discussion confront the developmental disabilities so many of our young children face   As with the other challenges they must overcome  it s critical that we get developmentally disabled children services as early as possible   And that s why the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is so important       Since Congress recently reauthorized the IDEA  I d like to take a few moments to talk to you about that bill and how it will benefit developmentally disabled children         Part of the new bill focuses on early intervention services for children with disabilities   It maintains early intervention and preschool special education programs for infants  toddlers  and preschoolers with disabilities   This includes allowing states to give parents the choice to have their child continue early intervention services until the age of five        The bill also requires early intervention services provided to children age 0 3 with a developmental delay in their physical  cognitive  communication  social or emotional  or adaptive development   The new bill also increases the focus of early intervention services on achieving school readiness  by incorporating science based pre literacy  language  and numeric skills work         It also requires states to set a rigorous developmental delay standard that triggers eligibility for early intervention services in every state  including a new mandate to serve infants who are    abused  neglected  drug exposed or exposed to violence       But  in addition to these improvements  there were also other measures that    during reauthorization    I specifically worked to include in the bill   I knew that it was necessary to improve disability services for homeless and foster children  and other children who are highly mobile  such as children with disabilities in military families  and in migrant and seasonal farmworker families         So I crafted an amendment to IDEA that sought to provide    increased access to special education services for these children in school and for early intervention services for kids before they enter the public school system   To strengthen early intervention services  my amendment improved coordination between McKinney Vento and IDEA and overall representation of homeless and foster children in IDEA   It required that states meet the requirements of the McKinney Vento law  and also strengthened and expanded early intervention services for these vulnerable populations       I m glad my amendment made it into the final bill  because I know how badly disabled homeless and foster children need that extra help and care       So that s some of what I m doing in Washington  D C   as your partner at the federal level   It s a tough year for the budget  and a tough year for the programs we know are doing the most good for women and children in our state   But I want you to know today that  as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  I ll fight to get every possible dollar to ensure that our children get the good  early start they need         I know the early years are the most important years  and I m going to keep fighting in the United States Senate to see that all our children have a chance to dream big  and follow those dreams wherever they lead
