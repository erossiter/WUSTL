10 06 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Citing Critical Aviation Safety Vulnerabilities  Senator Murray Urges the Senate to Pass the Transportation Treasury Bill  H R  3058  Airline Bankruptcies  Mergers and Overseas Maintenance All Call for More Safety Inspections  But the FAA Downsized 300 Safety Inspectors    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 6  2005     Washington  D C      In a Senate floor speech today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged the Senate to immediately debate and pass the FY 2006 Transportation  Treasury  HUD and General Government Appropriations bill once it completes its work on the pending Defense bill          In her remarks  Murray  the Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation  focused on one specific problem with the Senate s failure to act   The Federal Aviation Administration is downsizing safety inspectors at a time when airline bankruptcies  mergers and outsourced maintenance in countries like El Salvador require more frequent and thorough safety inspections       Her remarks follow    MURRAY   Mr  President  I rise today to urge the Senate Leadership to call up H R  3058  the Transportation  Treasury  HUD and General Government Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2006        Make America Strong    We want to make our country strong again   We want to make our communities strong again   One way to do that is to invest in our transportation infrastructure  in public housing  and in the other priorities in this bill   Every day that we go without a Transportation Treasury bill is a day we fall short of making the investments we need to make to strengthen this country         Affects Our Safety    We re not just talking about our physical infrastructure  we re talking about our own safety   As I ll show in a moment  the Senate s failure to bring up the Transportation Treasury bill could actually be threatening the safety of every American who flies on a commercial air carrier       Long Overdue    A floor debate on the Transportation Treasury bill is long overdue   The House of Representatives passed this bill more than three months ago   The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the bill almost two and a half months ago   Today  we are almost a full week into Fiscal Year 2006    and still    the Senate has been denied an opportunity to consider  debate and pass this bill         Must Avoid an Omnibus    Mr  President  the Senate needs to debate and pass this bill so we can avoid the unruly and unfair process of funding the government through another  omnibus appropriations bill    The Senate needs to debate and pass this bill so that all United States Senators  not just those on the Appropriations Committee  can have an opportunity to consider and  if necessary  amend this bill          The Senate needs to debate and pass this bill so that we can urgently address the critical needs of our Transportation and public housing sectors including the pressing need to protect the safety of our citizens         Mr  President  2002 was the most recent year in which the Transportation Appropriations Bill was sent to the President as a freestanding measure   I was Chairman of the Subcommittee at that time   Ever since then  the funding for the agencies under this Subcommittee  s jurisdiction has been enacted as part of a series of unwieldy omnibus appropriations bills   The process by which these bills were put together did not reflect well on the Senate or the Congress as a whole          Last year  s process was the worst of all   Last year  the Transportation  Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005 was never even debated in the Senate   Once the appropriations bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee  the bill languished for months while Congress went home for the election    Then  just before Thanksgiving  Congress reconvened and tried    in three days    to assemble a final conference report for dozens of major Federal agencies   even though the Senate had never passed many of the appropriations bills that funded those agencies          I think members of all political stripes in both the House and Senate recognized how poorly the public and the Congress were served by that process         Everyone Said  Not Again     In January  everyone said   We won t do that again    We heard it from the leadership of both the House and Senate and from the new leadership of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees   I  m glad they said it back in January  but from where I sit  as Ranking Member of the Transportation  Treasury Subcommittee  it sure looks like we re heading toward another omnibus appropriations bill           The bottom line is this  The Transportation Treasury bill has been sitting on the calendar  ready to be called up  for almost two and a half months   If we want to avoid another omnibus appropriations bill  we need to call up and pass that bill as soon as we are done with the Defense bill           Unfair to Many Senators    This process of sending bills approved by the Appropriations Committee directly to conference without appropriate debate on the Senate Floor is not just grossly unfair to Democratic Senators          It is grossly unfair to all of the 72 Senators that do not sit on the Appropriations Committee            The appropriations bill that Senator Bond and I are recommending to the Senate was approved unanimously by the Appropriations Committee back in mid July   It proposes to spend over  137 billion   These are not just tax dollars collected in Missouri  Washington  and the other States represented on the Appropriations Committee   These are tax dollars collected from all Americans   As such  every United States Senator should have the opportunity to debate this bill and pass judgment on our recommendations   Every Senator should be given an opportunity to amend that bill        Practical Difficulties of an Omnibus    So we need to avoid an omnibus to ensure a fair process   There are also some very practical programmatic reasons why we must call up and pass the Transportation Treasury bill as soon as possible   Right now  the government is functioning under a Continuing Resolution   Under the requirements of that resolution  programs funded in the Transportation Treasury bill are all operating at either    the lower of the funding level passed by the House of Representatives back in June  or the level the program was funded at in fiscal year 2005   And some observers have speculated that we could be operating under this Continuing Resolution until Christmas         I Could List Every Program    Mr  President  it would take hours for me to list all the programs and national needs that will suffer if they are required to operate for any length of time under the funding restrictions in this Continuing Resolution   If we do not get agreement soon to debate the Transportation Treasury bill  I may take the time of the Senate to explain each and every one of them         Today s Example  Aviation Safety    But today  I want to focus just on the topic of aviation safety and what our failure to move the Transportation Treasury Appropriations bill means for the millions of Americans that travel by air in this country          Mr  President  over the last few years  our national aviation enterprise    our airlines  our airports and the FAA    have been under an unprecedented amount of financial pressure   We now have no fewer than six airlines in bankruptcy   And if jet fuel prices don  t start declining soon  that number could grow even higher          In the interest of cutting costs  airlines have been    cutting back on staff  renouncing their pension plans  and outsourcing an increasing percentage of their aircraft maintenance   I know that many other Senators who  like me  travel home almost every weekend  have noticed the changes in the service the airlines offer   Staffing is leaner than ever and flight delays  and mechanical problems are on the rise        Outsourcing Maintenance    One important area of cost cutting has been the airlines   continuing efforts to contract out their aircraft maintenance activities to third parties    including many overseas vendors known as foreign repair stations   In the past  airlines maintained their planes with experienced  veteran  unionized mechanics   Today  they outsource more than 50 percent of their maintenance work to independent operators   Airlines such as Northwest send some of their aircraft as far as Singapore and Hong Kong for heavy maintenance   We have one major carrier  JetBlue  that sends a large portion of its all Airbus fleet to be maintained in El Salvador  Central America   America West Airlines  now merged with US Airways  does the same thing       JetBlue Example    Many of us watched in fear a couple of weeks ago when a JetBlue A320 was required to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International   As we all saw  its front landing gear was facing sideways 90 degrees   Well  Mr  President  that wasn  t the first time the Airbus 320 landing gear did not engage correctly   In fact  it was not the fifth time  or even the tenth time   It was the fourteenth time that the FAA learned of the front landing gear of an A320 aircraft not engaging correctly          According to the FAA  these fourteen dangerous and frightening mishaps have occurred as a result of five separate and distinct causes   It is the job of FAA inspectors to find out why those problems happened to force the plane s manufacture to fix the problem   We can t afford to have an understaffed or overwhelmed FAA safety office       We Need More Inspectors    Mr  President  our airlines are going through a period of dramatic and rapid change   That puts an extraordinary amount of stress on the aircraft inspection function of the Federal Aviation Administration         Disturbing Reports    We have received a disturbing series of reports from the DOT Inspector General  the Government Accountability Office  GAO   and the National Transportation Safety Board  NTSB  citing deficiencies with the FAA  s inspection efforts        In 2004  the NTSB found that deficient maintenance by an outside contractor  and inadequate oversight by the airline and the FAA contributed to the 2003 crash of a commuter flight in Charlotte  North Carolina   That crash killed 21 people    The DOT Inspector General first identified serious deficiencies with the FAA  s inspection efforts back in 2002          Just this past June  the IG reported that many of those deficiencies have still not been adequately addressed   The IG found the FAA focused too much attention on the airlines   dwindling in house maintenance functions and not enough attention on the outsourced maintenance activities of their foreign contractors   The IG found FAA inspectors were spending too much time inspecting maintenance facilities during the day  while the majority of maintenance activities are actually conducted at night   The IG found the FAA was doing an insufficient job in its surveillance of financially distressed or rapidly growing airlines   And the IG found the FAA was not able to meet its own standards for frequent inspections because it is short staffed         The FAA Needs to Increase Inspections    In just the last few weeks  the FAA  s staffing shortage has become even more critical   As airlines enter bankruptcy  the FAA is automatically required to step up its inspections of bankrupt carriers    Today  the FAA must give heightened scrutiny to the six bankrupt carriers    as well as four other carriers that are in merger proceedings         Not Another Eastern Airlines    Mr  President  following the liquidation of Eastern Airlines several years ago  a number of dramatic and horrifying revelations came out regarding the maintenance shortcuts that Eastern took in the interest of conserving cash in its waning days   The entire aviation community vowed that there would not ever be a repeat of the Eastern Airlines experience         The FAA Should Be Hiring More Inspectors    Now  Mr  President  you would think that with the external recommendations and the record I have cited  the FAA would be rapidly hiring more inspectors to keep up with its growing and challenging workload   Unfortunately  over the course of the last year  the exact opposite has been the case         300 FAA Inspectors Were Downsized    Despite the fact that the Congress granted the FAA  s inspections office every penny that was sought in the President  s budget for fiscal year 2005  the office has been required to downsize by roughly 300 inspectors over the course of the last year          That  s right  Mr  President    as the requirements on our FAA inspectors to maintain safety in our skies has increased dramatically  the FAA has been downsizing its inspection force each and every month       We ve Worked to Fund More Inspectors    This unacceptable situation is one that Senator Bond and I pursued as part of our hearing with Secretary Mineta this year   The House Appropriations Committee did the same   And I am proud to say that  on a bipartisan and bicameral basis  both the Transportation Treasury bill passed by the House and the bill as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee seeks to rectify this situation          The House Appropriations Committee provided this office with an increase of  4 million over the President  s budget request and committed those funds to the hiring of additional inspectors          The Senate provided an increase of  8 million above the President  s request   We directed that the funding be used to restore safety inspector staffing reductions that occurred during fiscal year 2005          Personally  I still question whether we should do even more in this area since we have had two more airlines enter bankruptcy since we marked up our appropriations bill   But still  these actions on the part of the House and Senate Committees indicate that the Congress    on a bipartisan and bicameral basis    is prepared to address this glaring safety vulnerability even if the Administration is not          That said  we can  t make any progress in tackling this problem if we do not call up and pass the Transportation Treasury Appropriations bill        Without Our Bill    No Progress    Under the current Continuing Resolution  the agency can make no progress in restoring the necessary FAA inspectors to a level that could better protect us   As I said  this is just one of several reasons why it is imperative for the Senate leadership to call up the Transportation Treasury bill   So again  I implore the Senate Republican Leadership to call up the Transportation Treasury bill immediately upon the completion of the Defense bill          We must debate that bill    not just for fairness to our colleagues and to maintain the integrity of the Senate  we must debate that bill and pass it so as to ensure the safety of our citizens
