                                                                                   News Release          Senator Murray Announces New Funding for Farmworker Housing at Celebration in Yakima County    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  August 2  2005     Yakima  WA     At a celebration attended by dozens of residents  growers and advocates  Senator Patty Murray today announced that she has secured an additional  1 5 million in federal funding to support the Washington State Farmworker Housing Trust       Senator Murray s remarks follow     I m so excited to be here to celebrate what all of you have accomplished and to announce new funding to give even more families safe  decent  affordable housing  Throughout our state  people are coming together to address challenges like jobs  transportation  and education  For many years  the challenge of farmworker housing seemed like it was stuck in neutral  There was a sense of division that made it hard for different sides to come together and make progress   But all of you had the courage to reach across the lines and help our state do the right thing        You turned farmworker housing from a stalemate to a success  You built a partnership that is housing families  helping growers  and supporting communities  Now  when people in other states try to address farmworker housing  they look at Washington State and say it can be done   All of us recognize that farmworker housing is a moral issue  an economic issue  and a family issue  Too many workers and their families face very difficult living conditions  Some live in their cars   Others share run down  overcrowded rooms with other families   These are not the kinds of living conditions we can tolerate in the United States in the 21st Century  They are certainly not suitable for the people who help put food on our tables and who keep our state s economy strong  We can do better  and all of you recognized that and got to work        This all started several years ago  when I secured  1 million to assist growers with on farm infrastructure needs   At that same time  the State of Washington created a  40 million fund to address community based housing shortages   These efforts represented a great first step  But I knew it would take more   It would take leadership  people who could sit down together and come up with solutions  it would take more state and federal dollars  and it would take flexible foundation funding   So in 2003  I called together 16 leaders from around the state to create the Washington State Farmworker Housing Trust   I asked them to research the problem and develop a plan   And I promised that I would work as their partner to make that plan a reality          To help launch the Trust  I secured funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development  Since then  the Trust and its members have soared even beyond my own expectations  They created a partnership between agencies  growers  and farm worker advocates   They facilitated the development or improvement of thousands of units of on farm housing  And that s not all  Our trust members incorporated as a non profit  figured out the needs  surveyed the best practices  and are now working to expand the pool of resources to eradicate this crisis        The Trust Board brought many new players to the table  including the philanthropic community  Now companies  foundations  and grant makers understand the challenge of farmworker housing and are getting involved  So many people have been part of this effort   I especially want to thank Frank Chopp and Phyllis Kenney for pushing our state Legislature to do more  I want to thank the Trust Board Members and all of their advisory and philanthropic partners for their vision and continued commitment  I want to thank the growers and the farmworker advocates  And I want to thank great organizations like the Washington Housing Authorities  the Diocese of Yakima and Washington  Mike Lowry  s Organization the Washington Agricultural Families Assistance Corporation  and the Office of Rural and Farmworker Housing for their perseverance   Thousands of people in rural Washington have decent  affordable places to live thanks to all of your efforts          I know we have a very strong foundation of partners and leaders who are working to solve the crisis  That is why I am so pleased to announce today that I have secured an additional  1 5 million in federal funding to support your work  These dollars will help you serve more people  improve the infrastructure  and provide a range of housing options for hard working families  In Washington  D C  many housing programs are being cut  including Section 8 and other lifelines for working families   It wasn t easy to secure this funding in a tight budget year  but I know it will be worthwhile and will make a big difference for the families you serve  Working families have a right to dignity   They have a right to safe  decent affordable housing  and you make that a reality        I  m so proud of the work you  ve done  and I  m proud to continue as your partner in the effort to create a better and more sustainable agricultural community in Washington state  I m looking forward to hearing from some of our partners and the families they serve  Again  thank you all for being here  and let  s continue the fight
