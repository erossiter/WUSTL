Immediate Release  Friday  June 24  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray secured more than  18 million for Washington state  s agriculture priorities in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill   As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee  Murray was able to restore funding for numerous projects that were not funded in the president s budget for fiscal year 2006           I am glad to have been able to secure this funding for agriculture in Washington state     Murray said    The research enabled by this funding will help Washington state agriculture related industries remain viable and competitive in a global marketplace            Among the projects for which Murray secured funding is  4 million for construction of the Agricultural Research Service Laboratory at Washington State University in Pullman   Researchers from the Agricultural Research Service    the body responsible for conducting agricultural research sponsored by the federal government    and Washington State University have enjoyed a long and effective partnership  collaborating on national and regional projects and training students          This new facility will strengthen the federal state partnership  and is critical to the future of agriculture in the Pacific Northwest  Senator Murray has been a strong advocate for this facility           I m especially excited about the funding for the ARS WSU facility and partnership it helps foster   Murray said   This partnership will be strengthened by a new  state of the art research facility I ve been able to fund   This project will play a crucial role in helping Washington state stay on the cutting edge of agricultural research and technology         Senator Murray also restored  6 559 793 million in proposed Bush Administration cuts specifically for Agricultural Research Service Projects  including        Agricultural Research Service Projects for which Funding was Cut by President Bush but Restored by Senator Murray  though some projects are based in OR  all projects benefit WA crops         Minor Use Pesticides in   Prosser and Wapato  147 454        Potato Research

Wheat Quality Laboratory   Pullman  495 000        Following is a list of agriculture related projects for which Senator Murray was able to secure funding     Agricultural Research Service Research Laboratory Construction  Pullman  WA   4 million      Researchers from the Agricultural Research Service and Washington State University have enjoyed a long and effective partnership  collaborating on national and regional projects  and training students   This new facility will strengthen this federal state partnership  and is critical to the future of agriculture in the Pacific Northwest      Wine Industry     289 000    This funding will help create a virus free source of rootstock to keep Washington state  s growing wine industry strong and competitive  As the industry grows  it needs a disease and virus free   motherblock    of plant material to ensure that all planted grapevine is free of diseases that could devastate the broader industry  These research dollars will help build a new foundation block for distribution to growers  ensuring that our state  s wineries always have clean rootstock for planting new vineyards      Asparagus Technology and Production   248 000      Washington State University and Michigan State University are jointly researching methods to reduce labor costs in the asparagus industry  The industry  s labor costs  combined with federal anti drug and trade policies that have led to a disproportionate increase in imported asparagus have left Washington  s asparagus at a competitive disadvantage   This project will help the industry reduce labor costs while shifting its workforce to value added employment       In addition  Senator Murray included language asking the U S  Department of Agriculture to purchase asparagus in 2006 for domestic feeding programs   In less than a year from now all asparagus processors will have ceased operations in Washington state    moving to Peru    leading to a surplus of more than 9 million pounds of asparagus       Small fruits research   443 000      The Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research conducts coordinated research for berry and grape growers in Washington  Oregon and Idaho  Breeding and genetics research have tremendous potential to enhance the productivity and profitability of the small fruits industry in the Pacific Northwest  This funding will continue the Center  s work on genetics research  plant breeding  pest management and product quality improvement methods  which are critical to the long term viability of the industry      Competitiveness of Agricultural Products   679 000     This funding supports the International Marketing Program for Agricultural Commodities and Trade at Washington State University and the Center for International Trade in Forest Products at the University of Washington  These complementary programs apply science and technology to determine new export marketing opportunities  solve technical problems that impede exports  and develop new products  processes  technologies  or strategies to increase exports  These programs receive matching state and private sector funding for specific projects     Strengthening Organic Crops Research and Education   359 000     Washington state enjoys a rapidly growing organic foods industry  which is valued at more than  100 million  The WSU Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources is developing a comprehensive organic farming research and education program  The Center  s plans include developing organic seed protection and production technology  determining the effect of production practices on nutritional content  developing organic weed control methods  water management  and pest control      Research on TSE Strains   600 000     Pullman    This funding will support diagnostic testing research on Scrapie  Chronic Wasting Disease and BSE at the Pullman Agriculture Research Service  ARS  facility   Scrapie  a nervous system disease in sheep similar to BSE in cows  has been a targeted disease for eradication by the U S  Department of Agriculture  for decades  but the disease has been intractable   This program brought about the first practical test for diagnosing the scrapie in live animals  and may help the livestock industry gain the upper hand on    and eventually eradicate    one of its worst problems   It may also help scientists find a live test for BSE   This funding will continue to support a research partnership between WSU and ARS to help find new ways to detect and eradicate these nervous system diseases      Potato Research   1 497 000     Washington  Oregon  and Idaho make up the tri state portion of the potato research program   The Tri State Variety Development Program uses this funding to produce new varieties that are resistant to pathogenic diseases  requires fewer pesticides  and are more marketable
