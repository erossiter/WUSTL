Northwest Regional Council Conference    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 26  2006     Washington  D C     Today  Senator Murray spoke by phone with 200 housing leaders who were gathered in Portland  Oregon for the annual conference of the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials  NAHRO          Murray updated the group on the fight for housing in Washington  D C   They presented Senator Murray with award naming her  Advocate of the Year          Senator Murray s remarks follow     Thank you Chris  Chris Pegg  Longview Housing Authority  and thank you all for this great honor        The truth is all of you are the advocates who deserve an award   You re on the frontlines   standing up for families in your communities  and I m proud to be your partner in D C   I wish I could be with you in Portland today  but I think you ll agree that I need to be here to fight for our priorities        I m so proud of your work   I ve sat down with many of you  You ve opened up your communities to me   You ve shown me the progress you re making  and I am so grateful that in our region we have so many people dedicated to our families and communities        Housing is a really silent epidemic   In our region we have areas of tremendous growth  Housing is often too expensive for many families   And our housing authorities have waiting lists of families who need help        This year in Washington  D C   our government has to make a choice   Either we re going to invest here at home and make our country strong  or we re going to leave families and communities behind   So far    it doesn  t look good        The President offered a budget that cuts our investment in housing and community development  As you know  his budget proposal        Cuts CDBG by more than a billion dollars Eliminates HOPE VI Cuts housing for the elderly by 26 percent  Cuts housing for the disabled by 50 percent Fails to help with rising utility cots And cuts the Public Housing Capital Fund     To me    those are the wrong priorities   We can do better          In the Senate  I worked to fix those priorities   As you know  I offered the amendment to save CDBG funding   In fact  right around that time many of you were in the Capitol for the national conference and it was great to have you making the case with your Members of Congress   Unfortunately  they still didn t get the message  So we ve got to keep fighting         I ve been traveling throughout Washington state to help rally support for housing and community development    Last month  I held a rally in Seattle with local leaders   And 2 weeks ago in Bremerton  I held a tour and rally with community leaders to send the message that we need to invest here at home        In the coming weeks  the full Senate Appropriations Committee will decide how much money each of the eleven Subcommittees will have to spend next year   As the top Democrat on the Subcommittee that funds HUD and the departments of Transportation and Treasury  I  ll be working hard to get as good an allocation as possible    but it  s too soon to say how that will turnout        I m also speaking out about the way HUD is treating all of you   I ve heard some in this Administration claim that housing authorities are not performing   They ve got it wrong   I know you re working harder than ever   The truth is that HUD and this Administration are not serving our housing authorities and the families who rely on them   So I ve got a message for HUD too    stop criticizing the folks on the frontlines and start helping          I can deliver that message with confidence because I ve worked with you  I know your programs and I ve seen what you re doing   I am so impressed by the partnerships you ve created in the Pacific Northwest   If we re going to help families and communities    we ve all got to work together    and you need a federal government that s a strong partner with all of you        So it s a tight budget year and it won t be an easy fight    but you can bet I m going to push to make sure we invest here at home    and I m proud to be your advocate in that fight for a stronger America
