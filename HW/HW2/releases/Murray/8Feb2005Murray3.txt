                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Bush Budget Leaves Security of Washington State Priorities in Jeopardy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Murray  Bush Budget Leaves Security of Washington State Priorities in Jeopardy  02 08 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Bush Budget Leaves Security of Washington State Priorities in Jeopardy Cuts to ports  transportation  education  health care and veterans will be felt around state    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 8  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Less than a week after delivering a State of the Union address in which he vowed to cut support for programs that   do not fulfill essential priorities     the President today unveiled a budget that defines the   non essential     veterans  students  ports and borders  accessible health care and nuclear waste cleanup          Families in Washington state and across the country are concerned about the security of their jobs  their communities  and access to affordable health care and quality education   Unfortunately  rather than inspiring confidence  the President  s budget leaves too many Americans questioning the future     Senator Murray said     On issue after issue  this budget falls short of what our communities need to move forward            HEALTH CARE     The President  s budget request includes cuts important to Washington state    and particularly to rural Washington   The President cuts  10 8 million for Rural Health Outreach    a 73 percent cut          The President also eliminates the Community Access Program  CAP    The CAP program provides health care to thousands of uninsured and under insured across the country and has four grantees in Washington state alone         The President  s budget also cuts  45 billion from Medicaid   This will mean a cut of  747 million for Washington state over 10 years            The President  s proposed cuts will be felt across Washington state  particularly in our most vulnerable and underserved rural communities     Senator Murray said     At a time when thousands of Washingtonians have lost their jobs and their health insurance  we simply cannot afford to put more families in jeopardy   Unfortunately  the President  s budget does just that           VETERANS     The President  s budget continues the ban on some veterans from coming to the VA for care   So far  192 260 veterans have been turned away across the country  including more than 3 000 Washington state veterans          The President  s budget also increases out of pocket fees and co pays for our nation  s veterans   The President  s budget includes new  250 annual fees for some veterans to seek care at VA hospitals   The budget request also increases co pays for prescription drugs               Our veterans deserve the security of knowing that they will be cared for when they return home   At a time when the next generation of combat veterans is risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan  this budget sends the wrong message     Senator Murray said     The VA health care system simply cannot provide quality care at the President  s requested funding level   The President  s budget means longer lines and more out of pocket costs for veterans in Washington state            PORT SECURITY     The President  s budget eliminates port security grants and includes no funding for Operation Safe Commerce   Last year Washington state ports received  14 5 million including nearly  7 million to secure Washington state ferries            Our ports remain one of our nation  s most vulnerable assets  but the President  s budget completely ignores this reality     Senator Murray aid     In Washington state  we know that ensuring the safety of cargo coming into our nation  s ports will prevent both the loss of life and economic losses that could come from a terrorist attack   I will continue to fight this Administration to provide the resources and planning to ensure the safety of our ports and the strength of our economy            HANFORD    The President  s budget cuts  297 million from cleanup efforts at Hanford   The Hanford cuts include  148 million from the Office of River Protection and  149 million from the Richland Operations Office               For four years the Bush Administration has talked about accelerated cleanup of waste at Hanford   Unfortunately  their rhetoric doesn  t match the reality of the President  s budget request   Hanford area residents and workers deserve a strong federal commitment to nuclear waste cleanup   The President  s budget not only breaks that promise  but puts the safety and economic security of this community at risk            EDUCATION     The President  s budget cuts funding for the Department of Education by  530 million    the first cut in overall education spending in a decade          While the President  s budget includes an increase in Title I funding  money for disadvantaged elementary and secondary schools     this is still   9 billion shortfall  which will result in a loss of over  306 million for Washington state   This shortfall will deny nearly 39 000 Washington state students Title I services                As students and teachers continue to struggle to fulfill the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act  the President  s budget will only make it harder     Senator Murray said     The greatest test of No Child Left Behind has always been whether we can make the law work for kids without punishing them   So far  the President is failing that test              The President  s budget also eliminates GEAR UP and parts of the TRIO program which provide critical early intervention and preparation programs for students to help them to graduate from high school and succeed in college              I am glad that the President has finally begun a dialogue about our high schools  but I am concerned that his budget eliminates programs that we know help kids to succeed     Murray said     Our kids deserve more than a test    they need a comprehensive plan that puts them on the right path to succeed in college or the workforce  that is what GEAR UP and TRIO do            TRANSPORTATION    The President  s budget cuts the Federal Aviation Administration  s Airport Grants program by  472 million and the Facilities and Equipments program by  77 million              At a time when air travel is returning to pre 9 11 levels and both security needs and delays are on the rise  now is not the time to slash funding to modernize and improve our nation  s airports     Senator Murray said          The President  s budget also eliminates funding for Amtrak          By recommending a budget with nothing for Amtrak  the President has made the decision to leave millions of regular Amtrak riders standing on the platform and thousands of employees standing on the unemployment line     Senator Murray said      AGRICULTURE     The President  s budged reduces USDA spending by  2 6 billion in fiscal year 2006          Among the proposed cuts are  14 million in agriculture research  primarily at Washington State University   This research supports a broad range of agriculture sectors in the state  including  wheat  potatoes  barely  shellfish  wine grapes  hops  asparagus  and small fruits        Also not included is funding to continue construction of a new Agriculture Research Service building at WSU  s Pullman Campus    Sen  Murray secured  3 million in the FY 05 Omnibus to begin construction              With farmers in Washington state still reeling from years of low prices  natural disasters  and closed foreign markets  this is the time to help provide a leg up  not cut back on research and investment     Senator Murray said    I will continue to work to support research and investment to create new jobs and expand opportunity for our state  s farmers and producers
