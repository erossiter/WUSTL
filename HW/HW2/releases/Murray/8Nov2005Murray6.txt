bill provides  1 4 million to support the work of the Northwest Straits Commission   Murray helped launch the innovative grassroots approach to marine protection seven years ago and has secured over  4 million for the restoration efforts in the past six years          I am pleased to have secured this funding for the Northwest Straits Commission  This is exactly the type of grassroots  collaborative effort needed to restore salmon runs  protect marine environments and increase environmental awareness     Senator Murray said        In the late 1990s  Washington communities were divided over how to protect marine resources in the Northwest Straits  an area in the northwest part of Washington from the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Northern Puget Sound to the Canadian border        In 1997  Senator Murray helped found the Commission  bringing opposing stakeholders together  to create an advisory commission that would address local issues  At a time when few thought the experiment would work  their coordinated efforts created an innovate model of restoring and protecting marine habitats  As a result  the Northwest Straits Commission was created a year later as the best approach to restoring the marine resources of the Northwest Straits        Commencement Bay Conservation Initiative     1 55 million    The Commencement Bay Conservation Initiative is a multi tiered plan to purchase  conserve  and restore stretches of shoreline along Commencement Bay   Once completed  the Initiative will provide a diverse range of functional and sustainable habitat types and species within the ecosystem to enhance fish and wildlife resources   Funding will be used to support the Commencement Bay Natural Resource Restoration Plan and to acquire property to help mitigate the Bay  s long history of environmental degradation  which has significantly diminished critical habitat to the detriment of marine life  including federally endangered Chinook salmon         Methamphetamine Program for Washington State    2 million   Washington state is combating the explosion of methamphetamine production and use through an intensive and pro active approach   This

investigation and forensics  public health and ecology  professional training  community education and prevention  and family treatment services        This funding will help make our communities safer by cracking down on methamphetamine   said Murray   Washington state s families are concerned about the safety of their children and neighborhoods  and this funding will help provide the resources to help protect our communities        Muckleshoot Indian Tribe Gang Intervention Program    250 000    The bill provides funding to expand the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe  s successful Gang Intervention Program   The program was established eight years ago to address gang activity on and near the tribe  s reservation   This funding will enable the tribe to hire an additional caseworker and female counselor to do outreach to female youth           I ve been proud of the success of the Muckleshoot Tribe s Gang Intervention Program   Murray said    This additional funding will allow them to continue    and expand    the crucial work they re doing for the future of the entire tribal community        Pacific Northwest Regional Collaboratory    4 million    Funding is provided to

 the Environmental Protection Agency  and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife       North Pacific Fixed Gear Research    150 000    The bill provides funding to support research on the effects of fixed gear fisheries on marine mammals   Many marine mammal species in the North Pacific have been listed as endangered under the U S  Endangered Species Act  ESA  or recommended for possible listing   These listings have required significant modifications on fixed gear fisheries   More research about the impact of these interactions is necessary to ensure that the proper steps are being taken to protect marine mammals
