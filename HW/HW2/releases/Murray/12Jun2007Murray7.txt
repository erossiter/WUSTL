                                                   News Release          Murray Testifies about the Need to Ban Asbestos in the U S  Murray discusses her bill to ban asbestos in America and honors victims of asbestos related disease  Committee Chairman Boxer expresses her full support for bill    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  June 12  2007      Listen to Senator Murray s Opening Statement   Available shortly after the completion of today s hearing  Washington  D C   U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  testified today at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that examined the damaging health affects of asbestos exposure  Murray testified on the urgent need to ban the importation and use of asbestos in the U S     In March  Senator Murray reintroduced legislation to ban asbestos that she has been fighting to enact for six years  Her bill  the   prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos in addition to dramatically expanding research  disease treatment programs  and public awareness of the dangers of asbestos     Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   Chairman of Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  expressed her full support for Murray s legislation and her confidence that her committee would move forward with consideration of the legislation  This was the first full committee hearing to consider Murray s bill    Murray also took time in her testimony today to honor the heroic efforts of asbestos victims who have stood with her in advocating a ban over the last six years   at the hearing included testimony from a variety of doctors  experts  and advocates including the wife of an asbestos related disease victim    The following is Senator Murray s Testimony from today s hearing     Thank you  Chairman Boxer  for convening this hearing and for your long standing support of my efforts to ban asbestos in the U S     I m so pleased to be here this morning with the distinguished group of witnesses you have assembled for this hearing     I especially want to acknowledge the efforts of three of your witnesses  Dr  Barry Castleman  Dr  Dick Lemen and Linda Reinstein  Without their tireless work  we would not be where we are today   on the verge of finally protecting Americans from deadly asbestos    Youve called this hearing to examine the health effects of asbestos and ways to minimize its harm  Ive worked on this issue for six years  and I can tell you that   asbestos is deadly  its devastating families and communities  and every day that we wait to ban it  were sentencing more Americans to an early and avoidable death    Studies show that asbestos exposure kills up to 10 000 Americans each year  I want to introduce you to two of them     This is George Fred Biekkola from Michigan  Fred served in World War II     For almost 30 years  he worked for a mining company in Michigan  where he was exposed to asbestos  Fred testified at my first hearing on asbestos six years ago  I ll never forget what he told us  He said       Senators  please make sure that what happened to me wont happen to anyone else Workers like me are counting on you to protect us  Please don t let us down   I m sad to say that we let Fred down  We didn t ban asbestos  We didn t warn the public  And we didn t invest in research and treatment  Fred died of asbestosis and mesothelioma on April 7  2004    Sadly  Fred is not the only advocate we ve lost over the years because Congress has failed to act     This is Brian Harvey  a teacher from Marysville  Washington  Brian stood by my side as I introduced my first bill to ban asbestos in July 2002     Most asbestos victims die within a year of being diagnosed  Amazingly  Brian lived for six years  He knew he was living on borrowed time  so he used his time to fight for others  He stood by my side again in 2004 at another press conference  but sadly Brian died in July of 2005    Fred and Brian are not with us  but their words hang over this hearing     As I mentioned  it s estimated that each year  up to 10 000 Americans die every year from asbestos related causes  I ve been at this for six years  this is my third bill  and I know we cannot wait another year to fix this problem  The stakes are just too high     To anyone who says  We don t need this bill  I would just pose one question     How many more Americans have to die before our government finally does the right thing and bans asbestos     We have to do the right thing  and we have to do it now  As I look at this issue  four problems stand out        1  Asbestos is Deadly    First  asbestos is deadly  It s so deadly that there is no known safe level of exposure  It only takes a tiny bit of fiber to cause disease     2  Asbestos is Widespread    Second  asbestos is everywhere  It s put into consumer and industrial products on purpose every day     My staff bought these brake pads in an automotive repair store in my home state  They contain asbestos  Brake pads like these are on tens of thousands of cars  Anytime one of those cars goes in for maintenance  a mechanic could be unknowingly exposed to deadly asbestos  Fortunately  there are alternatives     These brake pads are made without asbestos  and they work just as well  We shouldn t keep selling asbestos products and putting workers and countless consumers at risk  There are thousands of other products that contain asbestos including floor tiles  roofing material  cement pipes  and even hair dryers  And deadly asbestos is still putting construction and maintenance workers at risk  Joining us at this hearing today are Capitol workers who have been exposed to asbestos in the tunnels below this hearing room     3  Asbestos is Still Legal        Third  asbestos is still legal  Many Americans assume  as I did  that asbestos is already banned  but it s not  In 1989  the EPA tried to ban asbestos  but most of those regulations were overturned in court in 1991  As a result  while new applications for asbestos were banned  asbestos is still being imported and used in consumer and industrial products        4  Strong Need for Research and Treatment    Fourth  research and treatment for asbestos diseases are not very far along  Doctors have been hampered by a lack of funding for research on how asbestos fibers actually cause disease and what treatment strategies work best  Industrial hygienists have been hampered by the lack of research on how to best measure asbestos fibers in the air     I know that the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation  MARF  has privately awarded over  4 million in grants     The Foundations investment in research is helping motivate brilliant investigators to study mesothelioma  But the Foundations seed money is not enough  Federal funding is critical to the research effort if we are truly going to help people    My bill also requires collaboration among the 10 research and treatment centers established under the bill along with the National Cancer Institute  the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH      And because nearly one third of mesothelioma victims were exposed to asbestos while serving in the US Navy  my bill directs the Pentagon to conduct additional research on asbestos disease  early detection and treatment as well    I am very encouraged that the NIOSH has embarked on an ambitious research roadmap to better answer current scientific questions about appropriate occupational levels of exposure     The Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007    To address the national scourge of asbestos  I ve again introduced the Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007       My bill does three things   First  my bill bans asbestos  It prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos  Unfortunately some 2 500 metric tons of asbestos was used in the US in 2005 and imports of products containing asbestos in cement pipe  tiles  brake gaskets and linings continue unabated today    Second  my bill dramatically expands research and treatment  It creates a  50 million  10 center Asbestos Related Disease Research and Treatment Network  It creates a new National Asbestos Related Disease Registry  It supports research at the Department of Defense and launches a study to determine the most promising areas for new research    Finally  my bill launches a public education campaign to better inform Americans of the dangers of exposures to asbestos in the workplace and in the environment  while also providing helpful steps all of us can take to better protect our families   Other Countries Are Protecting Their Citizens I know we can and should make progress in banning asbestos  More than 40 other industrialized countries have already banned asbestos  Around the world  chlorine producers are phasing out dangerous and inefficient methods in favor of safer and more environmentally responsible technology  We need to help U S  companies embrace new  greener approaches today     I am very grateful that industry leaders have stepped up to the plate to work with me in achieving a goal everyone supports  a ban on the production and importation of asbestos in the U S           These corporate leaders also strongly support the need to better educate the public and to provide for more research and treatment dollars to better mitigate the effects of asbestos on workers and their families    I look forward to working with all of the Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee to achieve a bipartisan consensus on banning asbestos in the US in this Congress  Chairwoman Boxer  I know this hearing will go a long way in helping us achieve that goal     Weve lost enough people like Brian and Fred  and we have a responsibility to protect tens of thousands of people just like them    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify
