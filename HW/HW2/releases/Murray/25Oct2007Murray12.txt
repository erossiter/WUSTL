                                        News Release          Murray to President  Don t Veto America s Future Senator frustrated that President continues to spend excessively in Iraq while cutting funding at home    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 25  2007         WASHINGTON  D C    In a speech today on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  underscored the importance of critical Senate approved investments in transportation  safety  and health  which the President has threatened to veto  Senator Murray expressed frustration that the President is asking for  196 billion this year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  but he objects to spending just  22 billion over his budget request for domestic priorities  In her speech  Murray said the Senate bills have solid bipartisan support and would restore money the President cut in his proposed domestic spending plan  Funding these priorities will make our country safer  our communities healthier  and our economy stronger  Murray said  Among other things  the President would veto an amendment Senator Murray included in the Commerce  Justice  and Science appropriations bill that would take steps to replace FBI agents reassigned to counter terrorism after 9 11  A Seattle Post Intelligencer investigation found that Washington state has just 2 1 FBI agents per 100 000 people compared to the national average of four   If we can spend  10 billion a month for the war in Iraq  we should be willing to spend a fraction of that to ensure the security of our citizens at home  Murray said  Whether its the war in Iraq  or gas prices  or access to health insurance  people feel a real weight on their shoulders  Murray said  Theyre looking for a light at the end of the tunnel  and by vetoing these important bills  and failing to invest in the safety  health and economic future of all Americans  the President keeps putting out that light   The full text of Murray s speech is below  Mr  President  over the past few months  we have sent the President critical legislation that invests in our countrys transportation  economic  health  and safety needs  Funding these priorities will make our country safer  our communities healthier  and our economy stronger  Unfortunately  the President doesnt seem to share these priorities  He proposed harmful budget cuts  And now he says he will veto several of these vital bills because we are asking for  22 billion more than he requested  He says our domestic spending is irresponsible and excessive  Mr  President  I personally find that hard to understand when  at the same time  he wants  196 billion in emergency spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  And by the way  that doesnt include any money for veterans  In fact  the  22 billion we want to invest in these priorities at home represents less than what the President spends in Iraq in three months  Mr  President  that  not these bills  is what is irresponsible and excessive  We need to make sure we arent ignoring our needs at home  These bills have the support of both parties  They ensure our roads and bridges  airports and railways are in good condition  that workers and families are healthy  and that all children have a chance to succeed  and that we have enough law enforcement officers to keep our communities safe  These bills simply restore some of the money the President cut  and take a modest step forward after years of going in the wrong direction  The President is Saying No to Critical Investments Mr  President  a healthy transportation system is vital to a healthy community  We need to ensure families can get to school and work  and that goods can move from place to place  But  by saying No to our bill that provides money for transportation  housing and urban development  the President is saying No to investments that ensure our communities are strong and that prevent disasters  like the bridge collapse in Minneapolis  from happening in our country again  So I frankly am baffled that the Presidents request for the war includes roughly  200 million for the construction of secondary roads in Afghanistan  He wants to spend  200 million on roads in Afghanistan  but hes upset about our amendment to fix bridges in the U S   Mr  President  clearly the Administration thinks these projects are a priority for Iraq and Afghanistan  Otherwise the President wouldnt include them in an emergency spending bill for the war  So I ask why doesnt the President think roads and bridges are a priority in the United States  The President is Blocking Programs that Help Families Mr  President  while the President is waging war overseas  we also are trying to make sure employers have workers  families have access to health care  and children get a good education  Tuesday night  an overwhelming majority of this Senate voted to spend  11 billion over the Presidents request on labor  health and human services  and education programs so we could do just that  That bill would also invest in cutting edge medical research for diseases like Alzheimers  diabetes  and cancer  research that would bring hope for millions of Americans  In taking that vote  a bipartisan group of Senators agreed to restore funds for education  job training and health systems  when President Bush would have left them to cope with yet another year of unfunded mandates and empty promises  The childrens health insurance bill we approved earlier this fall also would help millions of kids  That bill  too  received a majority of support in the House and Senate  But not from the President  These bills would make Americans healthier and the economy more competitive  Yet the President disagrees  He says these programs also are irresponsible and excessive  But guess what he proposes in his  196 billion request for Iraq and Afghanistan  Roughly  25 million for economic development projects to foster job creation in Iraq  and  60 million to fund economic projects to sustain development in the tribal areas of Pakistan  Let me say that another way  He plans to veto job creation and economic development at home  but he wants to spend millions on similar programs in Iraq and Afghanistan  The President is Blocking Important Safety Programs The President says the  196 billion he is requesting for the war is necessary to make our world safer  Well  Mr  President  we believe we also need to invest more in safety here at home  Our bill funding commerce  justice  and science programs works to ensure our communities have enough FBI agents and police on the streets  And  like the other programs we want to fund  this restores deep cuts the President has proposed  Mr  President  few bills are as important to the safety of our communities as this one  But Im especially concerned that the President is threatening to veto this bill because of how it affects my home state and the nation  Six years after 9 11  the Administration still hasnt replaced 2 400 law enforcement agents across the country that it re assigned to counter terrorism after 9 11  In Washington state  we were hit particularly hard by this  According to an investigation by the Seattle Post Intelligencer  we have a critical shortage of FBI agents  2 1 agents for every 100 000 residents  or about half the national average  The shift to counter terrorism has left law enforcement short handed  Local police and sheriffs told me that the FBI has virtually disappeared from white collar crime investigations  They said the FBI doesnt have the resources to adequately staff anti gang task forces  Yet criminals havent stopped robbing banks  dealing drugs  or stealing identities  An amendment I got included in this bill would take steps to get more FBI agents in my community and wherever they are needed  But by vetoing this bill  the President is saying No to this amendment  Mr  President  if we can spend  10 billion a month for the war in Iraq  we should be willing to spend a fraction of that to ensure the security of our citizens at home  Clearly  the President is the one who is being excessive and irresponsible  Conclusion This might be an abstract debate about federal funding for the President  But we know its about real people   Its about hardworking parents searching for a way to get health care for their families when it isnt provided by their employers  Its about getting citizens out of traffic jams  and ensuring our roads and bridges are safe  And its about making sure citizens can trust that enough law enforcement officers will be there to fight crime   When I travel around Washington state  people tell me they want hope and change  Whether its the war in Iraq  or gas prices  or access to health insurance  people feel a real weight on their shoulders  Theyre looking for a light at the end of the tunnel  and by vetoing these important bills  and failing to invest in the safety  health and economic future of all Americans  the President keeps putting out that light  Mr  President  we are investing  22 billion over last year in the future of our country and on behalf of the millions of American children and families who would benefit  And I hope the President is listening
