                                                                            News Release          Senator Murray Works to Confirm King County Judge Richard Jones to the Federal Bench      For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 19  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  introduced Richard Jones before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Jones is a King County Superior Court Judge who the President has nominated to be a District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington State  Senator Murray helped select Judge Jones and strongly supports his confirmation  Senator Murray s remarks introducing the judge follow  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  Senator Specter  and Members of the Committee  I am honored to introduce to the United States Senate a distinguished lawyer and King County Superior Court Judge from my home state  Richard Jones  a man who enjoys broad bipartisan support and who deserves a seat on the federal bench  President Bush nominated Judge Jones to be a District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington State  He is an excellent choice  I m proud to support him  and I m pleased to welcome him before the Judiciary Committee  On this special day  Judge Jones is joined by his wife Leslie  his sister Teresa Frank  his niece Dana Frank Looney  his sister Mardra Jay  and his brother in law Christopher Jay  If you were to ask lawyers and judges in my home state about Judge Jones  here are some of the descriptions you would hear  He s admired by everyone in the justice system    He gives respect  and he gets respect    The test of one s performance is the way they handle the smaller cases  Richard displays precisely that same degree of sensitivity to all that appear before him   One newspaper said that  In his courtroom  Jones is known for making eloquent statements that express just the sort of values needed in a judge  The Seattle Times went on to say  This is a lifetime appointment with no room for mistakes  and we believe there is no mistake here  Mr  Chairman  I couldn t agree more  Judge Jones has handled some of the most difficult cases in Western Washington in the past decade  and hes won the respect of everyone whos come before him  For example  he heard the murder charges against Gary Ridgway  also known as the Green River Killer  Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated first degree murder in 2003 and is one of the most prolific serial killers in American history  It would be a tough case for any judge  but Judge Jones earned praise for the sensitivity and dignity he showed for the victims of the Green River Killer  As a result of that case and in recognition of his long service to Washington State  in 2004 Judge Jones received the Judge of the Year Award from the Asian Bar Association of Washington  the King County Bar Association  the Washington State Bar Association  and the Washington State Trial Lawyers Association  Both Senator Cantwell and I assisted the President in choosing Judge Jones from a list of very qualified candidates  When I met him  I was so impressed with his sensitivity  his professionalism  and his overall sense of fairness  Throughout his career  Judge Jones has won high praise for his judicial demeanor and for the respect he shows all parties  He clearly meets the standards of fairness  even handedness  and adherence to the law that we expect of our federal judges  In terms of his personal background  he graduated from Seattle University and the University of Washington School of Law  In private practice  Richard Jones successfully represented both plaintiffs and defendants in a variety of civil cases  As a state and federal prosecutor  he had extensive experience prosecuting criminal cases  And most recently  as a full time King County Superior Court Judge  Richard Jones has distinguished himself and won broad support  Since he was first appointed in 1994  the voters of King County have reelected him three times  I know that I speak on behalf of a large number of the people in my state s legal and law enforcement community in saying that our federal bench will be stronger when Richard Jones is confirmed  So it s my pleasure to introduce this great lawyer and judge to the committee  to support his nomination and to help make him our newest Federal judge  I urge this committee to approve his nomination promptly  and I hope we can confirm Judge Jones before the full Senate quickly
