Nation s Heroes      For Immediate Release  Thursday  November 8  2007         WASHINGTON  D C    In a Veterans Day speech today on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  urged President Bush and her Senate colleagues to reaffirm their commitment to our veterans by making it a priority to provide for their care  Murray reminded them about the hurdles these heroes have faced when they return home  and she detailed how the Administration and Congress can improve the treatment of veterans  It is simply unacceptable that our heroes have had to fight their own government for treatment they need  said Senator Murray  As we approach Veterans Day  I urge us all  especially the President  to reaffirm our commitment to our veterans by providing the money  the attention  and the leadership they deserve  Murray said the Administration has failed to account for veterans as a cost of war  She explained that it can improve care by addressing problems in three key areas   Mental Health  The VA must ensure the mental health needs of veterans are met  especially by raising the awareness about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and combat related stresses  It also must hire more counselors to help treat veterans struggling with the legacy of war  Access to Benefits  The VA must clear the backlog of claims so that veterans can get care in a timely  and fair  way  In particular  the President needs to sign legislation to ensure that the Department of Defense and the VA are working with the same disability rating system and that records arent lost between the two systems  Adequate Funding  We must provide enough money so that our veterans get the quality care they deserve  Senator Murray urged the President to sign a VA and military construction funding bill supported by nearly all of the Senate  The bill would provide almost  4 billion above the Presidents request that would take important steps to improve care   The Administration has ignored these problems for too long  But the Democratic controlled Congress has taken action  said Senator Murray  President Bush has been more than willing to use our veterans as props as he argues in favor of his misguided war policies  Now its time to turn that lip service into reality and give our veterans the care they need and deserve  They are a cost of war that we simply cant ignore  The full text of Senator Murray s floor remarks on Veterans Day follows  Mr  President  I rise today to talk about something that has been a priority for me and many of my colleagues  our veterans  Sunday is Veterans Day  a day designated for us to thank our nations heroes for their service to our country  Its also a time to ask whether our country has done enough to repay our veterans for all they have given to secure our safety  As thousands return home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  some from their fifth tour of duty  I wish I could say the answer to this question is  Yes  But tragically  this issue has not been a priority for this Administration  We have too often failed to provide the care our heroes have earned  From the shameful conditions at Walter Reed and VA facilities around the country  to a lack of mental health counselors  to a benefit claims backlog of months and sometimes years  our veterans have had to struggle to get basic care  Mr  President  fighting overseas takes a tremendous toll on the lives of our troops and their families  It is simply unacceptable that our heroes have had to fight their own government for treatment they need  So today I want to remind my colleagues  and President Bush  about the hurdles our veterans have faced  And as we approach Veterans Day  I urge us all  especially the President  to reaffirm our commitment to our veterans  by providing the money  the attention  and the leadership they deserve  Importance of VA Care Mr  President  I know from personal experience how military service affects veterans and their families  and how the wounds veterans suffer from their military service can shape their lives forever  As a volunteer at the VA  I learned how some veterans can slip through the cracks  But the experience also taught me that the doctors and nurses there are dedicated to caring for their patients  It convinced me that the VA system  not private medicine  is where our veterans can get the best care  Our VA system is uniquely positioned to recognize and treat the specialized injuries  medical conditions  and mental health challenges caused by combat and military missions  Private medicine doesnt always have the knowledge base or resources to deal with these unique problems     Its one reason I will continue to fight for better access to the VA that allows our veterans to get the care they need without endless waits and red tape     Rather than kicking our veterans into yet another maze of processing and paperwork  we should work to provide better access to one of the best health care systems in the country    Veterans are Sometimes Reluctant to Seek Care   I also know from experience in my own family that veterans are sometimes reluctant to seek care or attention     My father was one of the first G I s to land on Okinawa during World War II  He earned the Purple Heart and returned home disabled  My family is enormously proud of my dad and his service  But like many of his generation  he didnt talk about his experiences  In fact  we only really learned his story by reading his journals after he passed away  This Illustrates a Larger Lesson About Veterans Mr  President  these two experiences in my life also illustrate a larger lesson that applies to many veterans  Often  they dont want to call attention to their service  And sometimes  they are suffering so much  they cant even ask for the help they need  Thats why we need a VA system ready and able to care for veterans of all wars  But five years into this war  the VA is still struggling to provide some basic services  And it still took President Bush months to announce his nominee to head the beleaguered system  The Presidents lack of leadership on this critical appointment mirrors his Administrations lack of focus on the needs of aging veterans of previous conflicts  It underscores his failure to count our veterans as a cost of this war  And just this week  Mr  President  we learned that 2007 will go down as the deadliest year of the war in Iraq  Our hearts go out to the families of the nearly 4 000 brave Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the war  and to the tens of thousands more who have returned with physical and mental wounds  Shining a Light on Mental Illness Mr  President  the physical wounds our veterans have suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan are horrible  But I have worked especially hard as a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee to shine a light on the mental wounds our veterans are suffering in this war  These wounds run just as deep  and can be just as devastating  as physical injuries  And this problem just isnt getting the attention it deserves from the Administration  Our troops are under great strain  In the past  we were always able to give our service members a break to allow them to recover from physical  psychological  and emotional demands  Now  some are serving for their third  fourth  and even fifth tours of duty  All of this increases the likelihood they will suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other mental health conditions  According to the VAs own numbers  fully one third of all returning Iraq veterans will suffer from a mental health condition  Thats an astounding statistic  But its also probably too low because many veterans are still afraid to seek care  Earlier this year  I spoke with National Guard members at Camp Murray who told me that they dont want to be labeled with PTSD or Traumatic Brain Injury because they are afraid it would hurt their careers  One soldier told me that to be labeled with mental trauma  jeopardizes their lives outside of the service  Clearly  the Administration must focus on changing this perception  Ensuring Access to Care We also must ensure that when our service members decide to seek care  they dont have to struggle to navigate the system alone in order to get the treatment they need  But so far  thats not the case  Just last year  a VA official revealed that some clinics dont provide mental health or substance abuse care  Or if they do  waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible  At a hearing on this issue that I held recently in Tacoma  Washington  Dan Purcell  an Iraq veteran  summed up the frustration felt by so many of the service members I have spoken to  He said that he felt like he was being treated as a tool that could be casually discarded when broken or found to be no longer useful  Ensuring VA Benefits Arent Cut Short Its shameful that our veterans across the country are forced to fight to get mental health care  But others struggle to see even a regular doctor  They are forced to wait months  even years  to get their claims processed  Across the country  veterans with the same health problems are given different ratings and different benefits  And in 2003  the Administration closed the door to VA health care for new Priority 8 veterans  Some veterans say it sometimes feels like the VA is fighting them instead of fighting for them  That is unconscionable  When the Iraq war ends  the news fades  and the conflict becomes just a page in history  we want to be sure our commitment to veterans doesnt fade along with it  Three Steps to Overcome These Problems So  Mr  President  how do we overcome these problems  Fortunately  there are three clear areas where we can improve   First  we must ensure that the mental health needs of veterans are met  The VA needs to raise awareness about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and combat related stresses  It also must hire more counselors to help treat everyone  from the 20 year old veteran returning from Iraq  to the Vietnam veteran still struggling with the legacy of war  Next  the VA must clear the backlog of claims so that veterans can get care in a timely  and fair  way  The President needs to sign legislation to ensure that the Department of Defense and the VA are working with the same disability rating system and that records arent lost between the two systems  And most importantly  we must provide enough money so that our veterans get the quality care they deserve   The Senate has approved a bill that provides almost  4 billion above the Presidents request that would take important steps to improve care  It would   Improve conditions at VA facilities across the country  Invest in new ways to treat military ailments like PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury  And it would fund better prosthetics for thousands of troops who have lost limbs in battle   The Administration has ignored these problems for too long  But the Democratic controlled Congress has taken action  So now Im urging the President to support this critical funding increase  and prove his commitment to our veterans  Veterans are a Cost of War We Cant Ignore Mr  President  our men and women in uniform have answered the Presidents call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan without hesitation or complaint  They have left loved ones for years and put their lives on the line  Some have come home without limbs  Others have returned with mental scars  Many  thankfully  have escaped without injury  But all of them have earned our respect and the best care possible when they come home  And if we dont care for our service members now  we risk weakening our military for decades to come  President Bush has been more than willing to use our veterans as props as he argues in favor of his misguided war policies  Now its time to turn that lip service into reality and give our veterans the care they need and deserve  We owe it to our country to ensure that we are there to support our service members  our veterans  and their families every step of the way  They are a cost of war that we simply cant ignore
