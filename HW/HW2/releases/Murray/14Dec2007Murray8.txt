                               News Release          Victory  Wounded Warriors Passes Senate Legislation Co Sponsored by Murray Will Help Wounded Troops  Vets Get Care They Need    For Immediate Release  Friday  December 14  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    In a speech today on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  congratulated her colleagues for keeping their commitment to our service members and veterans by passing the Defense Authorization bill  The bill includes the Wounded Warriors Act  which the Senate passed earlier this year to address the poor conditions and bureaucratic red tape some service members were experiencing while recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other facilities after being wounded at war  Murray said the passage of this bill is a true victory for the service members and veterans who will see much needed improvements as a result  This is a major step toward real change  Murray said  By passing the Wounded Warriors Act  we are moving aggressively to make sure that these men and women are treated well when they come home  This bill provides real solutions for our troops and veterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between  The Wounded Warriors Act lays out a clear path directing the Defense Department and the VA to address shortfalls in the care of our wounded warriors   It requires the Defense Department and VA to work together to develop a comprehensive plan to prevent  treat and diagnose TBI and PTSD  It creates DoD centers of excellence for TBI and PTSD to improve our understanding of these devastating injuries  It directs the two agencies to develop a joint electronic health record so that critical medical files arent lost as our wounded troops move from battlefield doctors  to medicals holds  and on to the VA  The act requires the military and the VA to work together on disability ratings  This is the first step toward bridging the gap between the VA and the Defense Department  And it requires the military to adopt the VA presumption that a disease or an injury is service connected when our heroes  who were healthy prior to service  have spent six months or more on active duty   The bill also addresses many of the horrifying conditions that our troops found themselves in at Walter Reed and other facilities  It ensures our service members get adequate severance pay  And it can provide medical care for the families of recovering service members  The full text of Senator Murray s floor remarks on Wounded Warriors follows  Madam President  the Defense Authorization bill before us today includes vital military programs that will help keep our nation safe and secure  Ive come to the floor to highlight a section of this legislation thats especially important to me because it will make a huge difference in the lives of our service members and veterans  the Wounded Warriors Act  Madam President  the Wounded Warriors Act has already passed the Senate once on its own  To ensure it passed Congress this year  it was added to this Defense bill  too  Im optimistic today that we can pass this bill and get these much needed improvements to our troops and our veterans soon  This is a major step toward real change  This Bill Makes Important Changes for our Service Members Madam President  I want to talk about how we got to this point  and why this bill is so necessary  This February  the Washington Post stunned us all with a series of articles on the squalid conditions and bureaucratic incompetence some of our service members were living with at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  Im proud that Democrats led an aggressive effort in the Senate to reach across the aisle and craft legislation to address these problems  The Wounded Warriors Act we have now is the result of a historic partnership between two of our committees  the Veterans Affairs Committee  chaired by Senator Akaka  and the Armed Services Committee  chaired by Senator Levin  I want to thank both Senators for their leadership on this  The Scope of the Needs Madam President  the more we dug for information  the more we learned about the huge problems we need to address  Last winter  when I visited Walter Reed with our Leadership team  the service members we talked to werent just frustrated with their living conditions  They had reached the end of their patience trying to navigate a disability system  which made absolutely no sense to them  or to us  And the problem wasnt limited to service members at Walter Reed  When I went home and met with service members in medical hold in Washington state  more than 200 people showed up  They  too  were angry and frustrated with their situation  They told me story after story about how they had to struggle to get their disability ratings and fight for the care they needed  Other service members told us that theyve had to struggle to get the right diagnosis for their injuries  particularly Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  Democrats Said  No More As a result of our investigation  Madam President  Democrats said  No more  The Wounded Warriors Act is the result  It lays out a clear path directing the Defense Department and the VA to address shortfalls in the care of our wounded warriors  It requires the DoD and the VA research and develop a comprehensive plan to prevent  treat and diagnose TBI and PTSD  It also requires the two agencies to begin bridging the gap between them so that our troops no longer get lost in red tape as they transition from the military to the VA  Veterans Care In addition to the Wounded Warriors Act  the Defense Authorization bill includes important provisions passed by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  These provisions will help turn around some of the key issues weve seen at the VA by stepping up access to mental health care and extending  from two to five years  the period in which recent combat veterans qualify for VA health benefits  Democrats Moved Aggressively to Pass This Bill Madam President  Ive said consistently that no matter how you feel about the war  we have an obligation as leaders to make sure that our men and women who fight for us get the care they deserve  Im particularly proud of the way Democrats moved to address the problems facing our returning service members  This bill provides real solutions for our troops and veterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between  Peake Nomination Madam President  I also want to take a moment to say a few words about the nomination of General James Peake to be the next Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  On Thursday  I joined my colleagues on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and voted in favor of his nomination  As you know  there has been a leadership vacuum at the head of the VA for years now  And  for the reasons Ive already laid out today  we need someone strong to lead the agency as we work to change course there  While I believe we shouldnt dwell on the mistakes of the past  I believe we must learn from them  At his confirmation hearing  General Peake pledged to stand up and put the needs of veterans above the political needs of the White House  He can guarantee that I will hold him to his word  because we owe our troops nothing less
