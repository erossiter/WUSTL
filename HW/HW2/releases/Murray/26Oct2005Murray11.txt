                                                      Murray  Statement of Senator Patty Murray  Senate Budget Committee Mark Up    FY 2006 Reconciliation  10 26 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement of Senator Patty Murray  Senate Budget Committee Mark Up    FY 2006 Reconciliation    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 26  2005    Mr  Chairman  thank you for yielding          I would like to join with my Democratic colleagues in support of the remarks of our Ranking Member          Senator Conrad has once again clearly articulated the concerns we have on our side about the misguided fiscal path that the package before us today takes us down          Mr  Chairman  at a time when communities along our Gulf Coast are hurting  when we are facing the implementation of a confusing new Prescription Drug Law  when our roads  bridges and railways are aging  when millions of Americans are concerned about how to pay to heat their homes this winter  and when the men and women who have sacrificed to serve us overseas cannot find healthcare or jobs when they return home  we should be focused on protecting our most vulnerable    not handing them further burdens        Mr  Chairman  this is simply not the American way        Mr  Chairman  these are the wrong priorities for our country at the wrong time    and the American people know it  The role of our federal government is to protect all Americans and to provide security   Well  I can tell you that as I travel around my home state  people are worried        Mr  Chairman  Americans across the country were glued to their televisions watching as our government scrambled    and fumbled    our response to the devastation of Katrina   The truth is  Mr  Chairman  we simply weren  t ready          And there is a coastline  or a volcano  or a fault line  or an aging dam in every state in this nation    and this budget doesn  t make the right investments in prevention or protection        Mr  Chairman  as we sit here today  farmers and ranchers in Washington state are shutting down their operations   They can  t afford to put gas in their machinery and their livelihoods are at stake   And what are we doing here in Congress   Well  we  re cutting investments in our family farms        Mr  Chairman  my constituents    and yours    are losing their pensions  they can  t see a doctor for lack of insurance  they don  t understand why they will suddenly have to pay co pays on drugs they need to survive  and they can  t seem to save enough to send their children to college as the price of tuition continues to rise        Mr  Chairman  this isn  t the American dream    it  s a nightmare        Unfortunately  the dangerous fiscal policies of this Administration have brought us to this point         Mr  Chairman  a budget is a statement of priorities   My priorities and those of my constituents in Washington state are not represented in this Reconciliation Act        I believe we should be providing greater investments in the tools that spur economic growth and help all Americans    Education  Health care  Transportation  Job training  and wise fiscal policies        In short  we should be making Americans more secure        Unfortunately  the package before us today does just the opposite  It cuts Medicaid spending for our most vulnerable  cuts agriculture investments for our family farms who have been hit hard by soaring energy costs  opens ANWR up to shortsighted drilling  and increases PBCG premiums that could trigger an avalanche of companies eliminating defined benefit plans        While today  s action is not the final step in this process  I have little faith that conference with the House will bring us back to the right priorities        As we speak  the House leadership is working on a spending package that cuts  50 billion in needed infrastructure  education and healthcare investments        Now is not the time to take steps backwards   Now is the time to make the choices that will help Americans prosper and make our country stronger         Before I close  I want to say a few words about the Katrina package          It took a horrible natural disaster to open our nation  s eyes to the huge gap between rich and poor in this country   What we do    or don  t do   here in Congress  should not add to this divide   Now is a time for compassion and accountability          We should already have passed the Grassley Baucus Katrina relief legislation and provided the kind of aid and compassion Americans are known for        Mr  Chairman  I am voting   no   today  because I do not believe this package as it stands should move forward          It has the wrong priorities and continues the failed policies that are undermining America  s ability to overcome the challenges confronting us today
