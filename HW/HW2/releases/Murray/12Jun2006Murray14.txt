                                                                                              News Release          Senator Murray Discusses VA Data Theft  Disaster  and Unveils Legislation to Benefit Nation s Veterans    For Immediate Release  Monday  June 12  2006     Seattle    Senator Patty Murray  D WA  demanded action from the Department of Veterans Affairs in response to the recent data theft involving 26 5 million veteran and active military personnel at a press conference held today in downtown Seattle  Senator Murray also unveiled legislation that would provide funding for the response and other critical veteran services during the event          This is a disaster   said Senator Murray   Veterans are calling my office  and they are worried that their privacy has been violated and they are losing faith in the VA  We have the families of soldiers struggling with their family members away from home  now having to worry that thy may be victims of identity theft         Senator Murray called on the VA to take immediate steps in order to give veterans and those currently serving the peace of mind that they deserve  They included       A full accounting of the theft  including answers on why information has been slow in surfacing in the weeks following the theft and who has been affected        Increased outreach efforts so that veterans are aware of support services that may be available to them  and       Safeguards to ensure that a similar security breach never occurs again        Senator Murray  a member of the Senate Veteran s Affairs Committee  also offered up new legislation that addresses a myriad of veterans concerns  The legislation provides funding for the data theft response  health care costs  mental health care and prosthetic services  Much of the funding would directly benefit the VA which is being stretched thin by an influx of Iraq War veterans  Many of those veterans will also benefit from the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and transition assistance funding provided in Senator Murray s new legislation         I m introducing legislation because veterans and military personnel deserve better  Murray said   I believe this administration has a lot of work to do to win back the trust it has squandered  and I m going to hold them to it         Senator Murray was also joined at the press conference by Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowski who discussed the state s efforts to protect veterans as well as what the Attorney General s office is doing to assist veterans  Bill Schrier of the Ameican Legion addressed the crowd about how Veterans Service Organizations are assisting in the effort       Senator Murray s Full Remarks Follow     When Americans sign up to serve our country in the U S  military  they put their trust in the federal government  Now that trust has been broken  The VA has compromised the private  personal data of tens of millions of veterans and active duty military   For years  the VA ignored warnings about the way it handles veterans  information   Once the burglary occurred  the VA waited weeks to tell veterans   And it seems like each week we get different answers from the VA about the scale of this problem        So today I m joining with law enforcement and veterans advocates to warn those who are affected  to demand that the federal government protect everyone who is threatened  and to announce new legislation to give the VA the initial funding it needs to respond        I serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee   Over the years  I ve seen problems at the VA  and I ve worked to correct them   But this latest problem dwarfs them all in terms of the number of people affected  We re talking about the personal information of up to 26 5 million Americans   That may include up to 80 percent of our active duty military  Guard  and Reserve        Not only are a lot of people affected  but this information could do a lot of damage if it falls into the wrong hands   Criminals can use this information to get medical information  financial information  and military records   Criminals can use it to open new credit card accounts and can ruin the credit of victims who might not find out until months later          This is a disaster  Veterans are calling my office  and they are worried that their privacy has been violated and they are losing faith in the VA  We have the families of soldiers    who are already struggling with their family members away from home    now having to worry that they may be victims of identity theft or other crimes  Can you imagine being a young woman with a couple of children  your spouse is overseas in Iraq  and now you find out that your address has been stolen and your personal safety is at risk   Or imagine her husband    serving in Baghdad   He s already worried about his family   Now he learns that the VA may have lost his personal information    putting his family at risk  We have 85 year old veterans who don  t know the first thing about credit checks being told that their identity may be compromised   They don  t know what to do          I am appalled at the pattern of incompetence and negligence at the VA  The VA was warned time and again about the lack of protection for veterans   sensitive health and benefits information   Yet  the VA seems to have ignored these warnings  and our veterans are paying the price       In the Senate  I m demanding action on three steps      First  we need the full story from the VA   We need to know how this happened   We need to know why it took so long for the VA to warn veterans   And we need to know why so many of the VA s answers changed over time   This happened on May 3rd   Two weeks later  Congress was told about it         Two weeks after that  we were told that perhaps 50 000 Navy personnel were affected   The next day  we were told that perhaps 80  of active duty military plus all guard and reserve members could be affected   So we need the full story from the VA        Second  the VA needs to offer help for everyone who is affected   The VA has taken a few steps  but there is a lot more work to do   It needs to offer help to veterans  active duty military and their families so they have the peace of mind they deserve   I told Secretary Nicholson that the VA should start training Veterans Service Reps to help veterans  because those are the people who veterans trust and turn to for help   The VA should also increase outreach efforts  so veterans know what to do        Third  the VA needs to put safeguards in place so this never happens again   For years  the VA was warned about problems with its information security  but it did not act   We need new safeguards so this never happens again        Finally  this is going to cost money to fix   And the VA cannot take money out of veterans healthcare or benefits to deal with this mess   I want to make sure that our veterans don  t have a double whammy of not only losing their records but then also being denied services and benefits because the costs aren  t covered        That s why this week  I will introduce legislation to provide the funding the VA needs for the first phase of its response   My funding will ensure that veterans  healthcare and benefits are NOT raided as the VA addresses this problem  My legislation will also provide funding to help the VA deal with the challenges of the Iraq war   Specifically it will help    fund treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  provide more help with transition assistance by expanding Vet Centers  and help reduce waiting times at VA hospitals and clinics        New Veterans Legislation    I m introducing legislation because veterans and our military personnel deserve better   They deserve the peace of mind that their information is protected and their families are safe   I believe that this Administration has a lot of work to do to win back the trust it has squandered  and I m going to hold them to it        For those who are concerned about their identity  here are some things you can do First  carefully review all your financial statements and credit card bills  Look for anything suspicious   If you always get your bill on the first of the month  and it doesn t show up  contact your credit card company or bank  Second  get a copy of your credit report and review it closely for anything that you don t recognize  Third  you can put a  freeze  on your credit file so that others cannot open new accounts in your name  Fourth  be suspicious if anyone calls you    claiming to be from the government or VA    and asks you for your personal information          Finally  if you have questions  you can call 1 800 FED INFO  1 800 333 4636   If you believe you are a victim of identity theft  contact the Federal Trade Commission at 1 877 ID THEFT  1 877 438 4338  or the state Attorney General  s Office at 1 800 551 4636        Here in our state we re fortunate to have leaders who ve worked hard to protect veterans and the public  and I m pleased to stand with them today
