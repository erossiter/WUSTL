                                                                                  News Release          Veterans   Murray Reveals Stunning GAO Report at Veterans Hearing with the American Legion Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee    Legislative Hearing of the American Legion     For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 20  2006    Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I want to thank Commander Morin and all the American Legion members and staff   The American Legion ensures that America s veterans have a voice here in Congress   Frankly  if the Administration had listened to the American Legion over the past few years  we could have avoided the budget shortfalls that veterans have faced  I hope we learn that lesson this year   I want to especially welcome some leaders from my home state of Washington   Bob and Eva Wallace from Snohomish and Kathy Nylen from Seattle   I ve been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Legion to fight for the benefits and services our veterans have earned  and I look forward to continuing to work with all of you       GAO Report   That s why this morning I want to discuss a new report from the Government Accountability Office  I requested the report with Senators Akaka  Durbin  Salazar  and Chairman Buyer to find out why the VA was so wrong in its budget projections for FY 2005 and 2006   Frankly  the answers are damning and they cast doubt on whether or not we can rely on the VA for accurate numbers and straight answers   I want to focus on three findings       GAO s Findings   First  the GAO found that the VA knew it had serious problems with its budget  but failed to notify us in Congress   It suggests that the VA could still be sending us inaccurate information in its quarterly reports   Second  the GAO found that the VA was basing its budgets on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation  and insufficient data    Finally  the GAO found that the VA did not have a plan to meet the needs of all the service members from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  The report does not comment on the situation today  but looking at the CBO submission and other data  I m concerned this  lack of a plan  may continue to this day       VA Misled Congress   For me  I think one of the most disturbing findings is that the VA kept assuring us in Congress that everything was fine    while inside the VA it was clear that shortfalls were growing   The VA became aware it would have problems in October 2004    but didn t admit those problems until June of 2005   Veterans were telling me of long lines and delays in care  and when I proposed giving the VA more money  the Administration fought me every step of the way    And who paid the price for the VA s deceptions  America s veterans  and that s just wrong         Timeline of VA Deceptions   Let me walk through some of the deceptions that this report documents because it shows a troubling gap between what the VA knew and what the VA told us   Starting back in October 2004  the VA knew money was tight  It anticipated serious budget challenges  so it created a working group   Two months later  in December 2004  that budget group made internal recommendations like delaying new initiatives and shifting around funding to deal with the shortfall   Two months later  in February 2005  the Bush Administration released its budget proposal for 2006  which the GAO found was based on bad assumptions  bad estimates and bad data         A week later at a hearing    on February 15th  2005  I asked the VA Secretary if the President s budget was sufficient   I pointed to the Independent Budget    which called for a  3 5 billion increase    and asked him if the Independent Budget was closer to what we really needed   He told me   I have many of the same concerns  and I end up being satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget         Let me remind everyone in this room that it was in February  March  and April of 2005 that I was hearing from veterans groups like the American Legion about they were seeing on the ground    delays in care and a system stretched to capacity   But the VA continued to say everything was fine  On March 8th  Secretary Nicholson told a House committee that the president s FY 2006 budget   gives VA what it needs           I was hearing a much different story as I spoke with veterans around the country   That s why on March 10th  I offered an amendment in the Senate Budget Committee to increase veterans funding by 3    My amendment was voted down   That same month  the VA s internal monthly reports showed that demand for healthcare was exceeding projections  That was another warning sign that the VA should have shared with us  but it didn t         On March 16th  Senator Akaka and I offered an amendment on the Senate floor to increase veterans funding by  2 85 billion   That amendment was voted down   The next month  on April 5th  Secretary Nicholson wrote to Senator Hutchison saying    quote  I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005         A week later  on April 12th  I offered two amendments on the Senate floor to boost veterans funding   Senators looked at the Secretary s assurances that everything was fine  and voted against both of my amendments   Veterans didn t get the funding they needed  and the deception continued   On June 9th  I asked Secretary Nicholson at a hearing if he had enough funding to deal with the mental health challenges of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   He assured me the VA was fine        So for six months we had happy talk that everything is fine with the VA   Then  in June    just two weeks after the Secretary s latest assurance    the truth finally came out   On June 23rd  the VA revealed a massive shortfall of  3 billion   I went to work with Senator Craig  Senator Akaka and others and we came up with the funding    but we could have solved that problem much earlier and saved veterans the delays they experienced          The VA knew about a problem back in October 2004  They saw it getting worse   They kept assuring us everything was fine   They worked to defeat my amendments to provide funding  and they didn t come clean until June 2005   That is unacceptable        Veterans Deserve Answers   I think America  s veterans deserve real answers   This report shows that the VA was not telling Congress the truth and fighting those of us who were trying to help   Mr  Chairman I hope that this Committee can bring Secretary Nicholson before us and get some real answers  so we can make sure the VA does not repeat the same mistakes of the past two years   We owe that to our veterans who are sacrificing for us today          And Mr  Chairman  the report also suggests that even in its latest quarterly reports to us    the VA is slow to report and does not provide key information we required    such as the time required for veterans to get their first appointment       Phony Savings   We certainly deserve an explanation of why the VA lied to us about so called  management efficiencies  that the GAO found were nothing but hot air   This report clearly shows the VA lied to us for four fiscal years  through four budgets  and four appropriations cycles about efficiencies it was finding   And when they could not make these efficiencies a reality  they took the funds from veterans healthcare   Mr  Chairman  the people in this room deserve answers from the VA       VA Had No Plan for Iraq  Afghanistan   Finally  and most importantly  the report verifies that the VA had no plan treating veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan   The VA had no plan then    and sitting here today I fear they still don t have plan   And let s remember    we still have not seen the lion s share of Iraq War veterans come back home  separate from the Armed Forces  and seek care from the VA        Commander Morin    I think this report gives you and the Independent Budget leaders an even larger voice and an even greater measure of credibility because you were right over the past few years   The VA didn t listen to you  The Congress didn t listen to you   The White House didn t listen to you  and America s veterans    who you serve everyday    paid the price   I am committed to making sure we get to the bottom of this    and more importantly    learn from these mistakes so that every veteran can get the respect  healthcare and benefits they have earned
