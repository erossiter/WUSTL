                                                        News Release          Murray Supports Effort to End IRS Outsourcing of Debt Collection Murray says plan does not ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly or guarantee cost savings    In Report to Congress  the National Taxpayer Advocate agrees    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 10  2007     Washington  D C      Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today renewed her call for the IRS to end its program of outsourcing the collection of tax debts to private collection companies  Senator Murray has been opposed to the plan because she believes that it does not adequately protect taxpayer privacy  does not ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly and respectfully  and does not guarantee any cost savings to the U S  Treasury  Yesterday  in a report to Congress  the National Taxpayer Advocate   the chief taxpayer watchdog within the Treasury Department   agreed that the IRS could do a better job for far less money        I have been fighting this program since its inception   said Senator Murray  Because it threatens the American taxpayer s rights to privacy and fair treatment as part of the Administration  s effort to outsource essential government functions   However  as the National Taxpayer Advocate reiterated yesterday  this program doesn t guarantee the IRS any cost savings  It is time to put an end to this irresponsible and ineffective plan         In yesterday s report to Congress  Nina E  Olson  the National Taxpayer Advocate  the head of the Taxpayer Advocate Service  said she and her independent organization disagree with the outsourcing program  Ms  Olson expressed doubts about the program s protection of taxpayer s privacy rights  and said she thinks the IRS could do the same job for less money  She advised lawmakers to revoke the IRS s authority to use private collection agencies  The recommendation was included in a report to Congress that the National Taxpayer Advocate makes each year about the most pressing issues facing the IRS       The Taxpayer Advocate Service is a wholly independent organization within the IRS          On September 6th of last year  Senator Murray wrote to IRS Commissioner Mark Everson urging him to suspend this highly controversial plan  She noted that a previous attempt at private collection was terminated partly because of failures in adequately protecting private taxpayer information  Senator Murray was also particularly disturbed that the IRS went forward with the plan despite an explicit vote by the House Appropriations Committee prohibiting them from doing so  Senator Murray s letter to the IRS is below                                                               September 6  2006       The Honorable Mark W  Everson  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  Internal Revenue Building  1111 Constitution Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20224   Dear Mr  Commissioner        I am writing to urge you to immediately suspend your efforts to outsource the collection of taxpayer debt to private collection agencies  PCAs   I understand that you plan to assign thousands of cases to three private debt collection agencies as soon as this week  You are proceeding with this effort despite an explicit vote by the House Appropriations Committee prohibiting you from moving forward with it  You should suspend your efforts immediately so that the Full Senate and the Appropriations Conference Committee can review this proposal        I m deeply concerned that your plan would not adequately protect taxpayer privacy  would not ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly and respectfully  would not guarantee any cost savings to the U S  Treasury  and would pre empt the Senate s debate over outsourcing tax collection        First  your agency has an abysmal record of protecting taxpayer privacy  and this effort could further threaten taxpayer privacy  I don  t need to remind you that we have witnessed a number of instances in the recent past in which your agency has failed to protect private taxpayer information from your contractors  Unfortunately  the House Government Reform Committee gave the Treasury Department the grade of a   D     for your performance in complying with the Federal Information Security Management Act  the principal law requiring federal agencies to provide information security protections to protect data confidentiality  Unfortunately  that Committee has concluded that the Treasury Department  s performance has actually worsened in the past three years in this area  Your agency s own history offers more reasons for concern  As you know  ten years ago your agency employed private collection agencies to collect tax debts  That program was terminated after it was found to be a dismal failure  Among the failures that led to its termination was the inability of your agency to adequately protect private taxpayer information        Second  I am concerned that private debt collectors will not show the level of professionalism  sensitivity and respect that taxpayers deserve  There is no question that people who owe back taxes must pay their debt to the government  At the same time  every taxpayer should have the right to interact with a professional IRS agent when it comes to dealing with contested tax liabilities  They should not be required to deal with a private contractor who might be insensitive to a taxpayer  s individual predicament  In 2005  the Federal Trade Commission received more consumer complaints about private debt collectors than any other industry        I am also concerned that your policy could create a two class system of debt collection  The National Taxpayer Advocate has said that the nature of the debts that you intend to transfer to PCAs will result in these agencies going after   basically the most vulnerable taxpayers    in our society  We should not allow a system to emerge where better off taxpayers get the benefit of interacting with a professional IRS agent  while economically disadvantaged taxpayers are relegated to the harassing tactics of private collection agents        Third  the Taxpayer Advocate has also questioned the cost effectiveness of this initiative  You testified before the House Transportation Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee that it would be more cost effective for IRS agents to collect these debts themselves  I have seen data indicating that using private debt collection agencies will cost the Federal Government almost 25 cents for every dollar collected because of the commissions that must be paid to the collection agencies  It would cost the IRS roughly three cents for every dollar collected if these collection activities were collected in house  Initially  I am told that it will require 55 IRS personnel to oversee 75 private tax collectors  Taken as a whole  I have to wonder whether the Federal Treasury will really benefit at all from your initiative        Finally  I have to question your motives in rushing to implement this program while Congress is still debating its merits  More than 400 Members of the House of Representatives approved a bill that included a prohibition on outsourcing tax collection  Why do you find it necessary to move forward with this initiative at this time  If you insist on going forward with this potentially misguided initiative  you should at least wait until Congress has completed its debate regarding its merits  Your effort to start this initiative this week is  at best  premature  At worst  it represents a deliberately ploy to jump out ahead of Congress  s own deliberations as to the wisdom of your initiative  You should suspend this effort immediately        Sincerely        Patty Murray Ranking Member   Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies
