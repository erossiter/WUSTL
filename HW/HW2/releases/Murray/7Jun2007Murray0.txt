Signing Stem Cell Legislation Murray delivers speech as Congress sends stem cell legislation to President Bush    For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 7  2007        Washington  D C    Today  as the United States Congress sent President Bush stem cell legislation that provides hope to Americans with debilitating diseases  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling on the President to sign the legislation  In her speech  Murray discussed her father s physical deterioration at the hands of Multiple Sclerosis and the hardships it caused her family  She also spoke of her family s hope for a cure then  and the hopes of millions of families today who are desperately seeking the promise of stem cells    The stem cell bill  S  5   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  passed the House today by a vote of 247 176  Senator Murray helped pass the Senate version on April 11th  read more  by a vote of 63 34  Murray laid out the importance of the President s upcoming decision on this bill in her speech    The President has a choice   he can stand with millions of Americans who desperately need cures   or he can stand against them  Murray said  Im calling on the President to make the right choice    I have lived with someone with a serious illness  I have seen the suffering that happens personally  to their families  and to everyone around them  I know how hard it can be  said Murray  We must not block the discovery of cures for these people  We must not block their hope     The full text of Senator Murray s speech follows     I just want to commend the Senator from Iowa  Senator Harkin  for his tremendous work and advocacy that has gotten us to this day today  It s a very important day as he talked about where the House of Representatives voted to pass the embryonic stem cell research bill  joining the Senate  And that bill is now on its way to the President s desk  It is because of Senator Harkin s work over the years and his advocacy and his not giving up that we re here today  And I am very proud to join him on the floor today to urge the President now to do the right thing    The House of Representatives today  in voting for this bill  offered hope for millions of Americans in supporting embryonic stem cell research  There is now one person who can make this decision for millions of Americans  and that s the President of the United States    The President has a choice  He can stand with million of people who are looking for that desperately needed cures  or he can stand against them  I hope  like my colleague from Iowa  that the President pauses  thinks about the lives he holds in his hand  and makes the right choice and signs the bill for embryonic stem cell research  Madame President  this is an issue I know personally  I grew up in a family of nine  My dad was a wonderful  physically active human being  He served our nation in World War II and raised seven children  He was a strong man  and in my eyes when I was growing up he was indestructible     But when I turned 15 years old things changed dramatically in my life and in my family s life  My dad was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis  That is a horrific disease for anyone who s not familiar with it  It wasnt long before he could no longer walk  He was in a wheelchair and required my mom to take care of him full time    It was a very difficult time for my family  We had to watch my dad deteriorate physically  We had to watch as my mom had to return to work  She went on Welfare for a while and finally was able to get some schooling and get a job  but she had to work  take care of my dad  and raise all seven kids     We all hoped that a cure might one day be found for my dad and people like him  You never lose hope when something like this happens to you  It s essential to dealing with what you ve been handed  But we were also pretty realistic  Scientists didnt have any promising leads  Doctors said there wasn t much they could do  There was no cure on the horizon  There was nothing to hinge our hope on when I was growing up    But now we have a chance finally to offer families across this country hope  an opportunity  and a chance for a cure  It is time for President Bush to stop his obstruction  to stop saying no to cures  and to stop saying no to hope for families like mine    The President Has Hindered Progress   Unfortunately  since being elected President Bush has blocked robust federally funded research of embryonic stem cells  Originally  he told us that there would be 78 stem cell lines available for study  In truth  there were only 21    far fewer than scientists say are needed for this research     Even the Director of the National Institutes of Health  who was appointed by President Bush  said  It is clear today that American science would be better served and the nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines  Well the President refused to heed that advice from the scientific community and his own director of the National Institutes of Health  Why  To pacify the ideological views of a few in his political base  What he did by blocking that is forcing millions of Americans  who suffer from many ailments  to put their hope on hold  and to stand idly by and watch as a family member s condition worsened  Impact on Scientific Progress   Besides putting millions of peoples  hopes on hold  the President s action actually pushed stem cell research overseas  Our country  which has been known as the world leader in medicine and in scientific research  is now falling behind other countries in this field  Reuters recently reported that British scientists  with funding from an American who was upset with President Bush s actions  were using embryonic stem cell research to cure some forms of blindness  Our country must remain at the forefront of innovation  and institutions like the University if Washington in my home state  have to have the ability to compete with organizations in other countries  This President has denied that  This Bill   The bill that has been sent to the President today and is on his way to his desk   the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007    allows the Department of Health and Human Services to finally begin robust research on embryonic stem cells from frozen embryos  embryos  it is important to note  that would otherwise be discarded  This bill also promotes research into finding alternative ways to derive stem cells from embryos  And it does these things while it imposes strict ethical guidelines as all of us have insisted upon  In fact  the standards in this legislation are more stringent than even the Presidents own policy  Most importantly  though  the legislation that we want this President to sign takes hope off hold for millions of Americans  The President s Veto Threat   Now we all know the President has threatened to once again veto this bill  just as he did last year  Madame President  I m here today and hope that he hears me say  please don t do that  There are millions of sick Americans and their families who are watching and waiting and praying and hoping that he signs this bill  If he vetoes the bill  he will likely claim as he did last year  that the legislation is unnecessary since researching adult stem cells  which he supports  is as promising as studying embryonic stem cells  Well  just like last year  he would be wrong  Scientists say embryonic cells  which can be used to grow any type of human or cell tissue  show the most promise  and they offer the most hope  Conclusion So Madame President  I have lived with someone with a serious illness  I have seen the suffering that happens personally  to their families  and to everyone around them  I know how hard it can be  We must not block the discovery of cures for these people  We must not block their hope  Today   At least 17 million Americans suffer from Diabetes  At least 500 000 Americans suffer from Parkinsons  At least 250 000 Americans suffer from Multiple Sclerosis  And at least 250 000 have spinal cord injuries  including veterans of the Iraq war   All of these Americans and many others who suffer from a variety of conditions will stand to benefit from embryonic stem cell research  Finally today in sending this bill to the President  this Congress is offering a chance to families across the country to have hope  to have an opportunity  to have a chance for a cure  Madame President  I hope that President Bush hears their calls  picks up that pen  stops his obstruction  stops saying no to cures  and signs his name to the legislation  We are all watching
