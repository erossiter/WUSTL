                                                       News Release          Murray Applauds Retailers for Pulling Asbestos Contaminated Toy Following Murray s letter to group of major retailers  top stores sales stop of potentially deadly children s toy    For Immediate Release  Friday  December 21  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  applauded actions taken by the online divisions of top toy retailers including Toys R Us and KB Toys after they stopped sales of a toy that has tested positive for deadly asbestos  Senator Murray last week contacted Walgreens  KB Toys  and Toys R Us to ask that they terminate sales of the toy   Planet Toys  CSI  Crime Scene Investigation Fingerprint Examination Kit  The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization and the Environmental Working Group presented Senator Murray with solid scientific evidence that the toy contains the most deadly form of asbestos  tremolite  Senator Murray was particularly troubled that the toy  which simulates the fingerprint dusting process  encourages children to blow on the contaminated powder  Any amount of this fiber in a childrens toy  particularly in a powder that is certain to be inhaled  is completely unacceptable  Senator Murray wrote in her letter  A single exposure to tremolite is sufficient to cause fatal mesothelioma or lung cancer later in life  In addition to Senator Murray s concern  the State of Connecticut this week ordered that all retailers in that state pull the product from their shelves  Americans deserve to have their faith restored in their governments ability to protect them from preventable dangers and I intend to work with my colleagues in the Senate to make that happen  said Senator Murray  I look forward to working with a revitalized Consumer Product Safety Commission that will make sure that unsafe products  including toys  never make it to the shelf or into the hands of our children  Senator Murray helped secure  80 million for the CPSC in this years spending bill   16 8 million more than the Presidents request  Those funds will be used to enhance the agencys ability to safeguard consumers from dangerous products  particularly its efforts to keep dangerous toys and other products away from children  Senator Murray has authored legislation in the U S  Senate that prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos  That legislation passed the Senate unanimously earlier this month  read MORE  Under Senator Murray s legislation  this toy or similar toys would not be allowed in the United States or on any store shelves  Senator Murray is urging those who have purchased this potentially contaminated item to return it to the original place of purchase                                                                                       The text of the letter Senator Murray sent to Walgreens  Toys R Us and KB Toys is below    December 13  2007 I am writing in the midst of this holiday shopping season with grave concerns about potential asbestos contamination in a childrens toy  Planet Toys CSI  Crime Scene Investigation Fingerprint Examination Kit     Scientists using state of the art techniques at three different labs have presented evidence to me of the most deadly form of asbestos  tremolite  in six out of eight powders tested  Tremolite was found at percentages as high as 7 2 percent in 1 of the 5 powders contained in the kit  and in 6 out of 8 samples tested     I am aware that follow up tests by manufacturers and retailers have failed to confirm these results  but to date the industry has not released their test results making it impossible to evaluate the sensitivity of these tests and the reliability of their findings  I am writing to ask that you put the health of children first and immediately remove from sale all Planet Toys CSI  Crime Scene Investigation Fingerprint Examination Kits until independent third party testing using the most sensitive methods available can confirm or rebut the finding of significant and potentially deadly concentrations of tremolite in this product  I fully recognize that retailers are not responsible for contamination in products like this  But at the same time  retailers are uniquely positioned to take quick  proactive steps to protect the public from hazardous consumer products  In the face of strong evidence of contamination in at least a portion of this product  I urge you to act to protect children while further testing is conducted  The type of asbestos detected in these kits  tremolite  is one of the most lethal forms  and is the same deadly asbestos fiber contained in products made from ore mined at the notorious W R  Grace mine in Libby  Montana  Tremolite asbestos  like that detected in the CSI  Crime Scene Investigation Fingerprint Examination Kits  has killed scores of people in Libby  many who never worked in the mine itself  What is particularly troubling about this toy is that children are directed to blow the asbestos contaminated powder after dusting for fingerprints  which would make it much more likely that children playing with this toy would actually inhale potentially lethal asbestos fibers  Any amount of this fiber in a childrens toy  particularly in a powder that is certain to be inhaled  is completely unacceptable  A single exposure to tremolite is sufficient to cause fatal mesothelioma or lung cancer later in life  The dangers of asbestos exposure are something I take very seriously  In fact  I authored legislation that passed the Senate unanimously earlier this year that prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos  And  under my bill this toy would not be allowed inside the United States or on a single store shelve  While debate over exposures to some chemicals and toxics may still be ongoing  there is none when it comes to asbestos  Over 40 countries around the world have already banned asbestos  There is a national epidemic of asbestos related diseases that claims the lives of ten thousand Americans each year  many of whom were unwittingly exposed early in life  The possibility of exposing a single child to this deadly chemical should motivate your company to take action  I look forward to your timely response    Sincerely     Patty Murray  United States Senator
