                                                                        News Release          Murray  Democratic Leaders Call for a Renewed Emphasis on Emergency Preparedness    For Immediate Release  Monday  September 12  2005    Washington  DC    Today  two weeks following the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina and four years after the tragedy of September 11th  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   joined her colleagues  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV   Senator Hillary Clinton  D NY   and Senator Ken Salazar  D CO  in calling for a renewed emphasis on emergency preparedness   The Senators noted that now   four years after the national tragedy of September 11  2001   our government has clearly not done enough to prepare Americans for a wide scale national disaster or terrorist attack            There have been so many heroes in the Gulf Coast over the past few weeks   But our country cannot rely on heroism alone    we need to provide our responders with the resources and funding they need to do the jobs we ask them to do     Senator Murray said            This Administration has gambled by cutting emergency preparedness resources in favor of other priorities  Unfortunately  for the people of the Gulf Coast  for our economy  for the future prosperity of our nation  and for all Americans  their gamble has failed us           Senator Murray has consistently worked to provide resources for our nation  s emergency preparedness systems and first responders   When the White House eliminated funding for Project Impact   a pre disaster program that that saved lives and prevented damage during the Nisqually Earthquake    Murray led the fight along with her colleagues to restore the project          More recently  Murray fought the President  s cuts to the Emergency Management Planning Grants  EMPG    the Administration  s fiscal year 2005 budget would have cut these grants by  8 million          How can we expect to inspire new democracies around the world  if we do not make the necessary investments to inspire confidence in our communities here at home     Murray asked today       A full transcript of Senator Murray  s remarks at today  s press conference follows       There have been so many heroes in the Gulf Coast over the past few weeks            From the firefighters and the police to National Guard members who came back from Iraq only to be sent into another war zone in their own country  to neighbors helping neighbors    we have seen the American spirit shine in our darkest hours            But our country cannot rely on heroism alone    we need to provide our responders with the resources and funding they need to do the jobs we ask them to do            This Administration has gambled by cutting emergency preparedness resources in favor of other priorities          Unfortunately  for the people of the Gulf Coast  for our economy  for the future prosperity of our nation  and for all Americans  their gamble has failed us          The Administration  s very first budget showed a lack of foresight when it comes to the possibility of natural disaster or the need for emergency response           Back in 2001  I    along with many of my Senate colleagues    fought this Administration when President Bush tried to eliminate Project Impact  a pre disaster program that that saved lives and prevented damage during the worst earthquake to hit my home state of Washington in over 50 years            In the case of Project Impact  this lack of foresight  lack of planning and lack of putting the well being of Americans ahead of shortsighted economic policies would have put the safety and security of our nation at risk            Luckily  my colleagues rejected these cuts and helped put Project Impact funds back into the national budget          Project Impact is not the only example of the Administration  s experimentation with cutting our emergency management systems            As we have seen over the past two weeks  there have been major holes in our communications systems  our emergency response systems and with mobilizing search and rescue operations          How can we expect to inspire new democracies around the world  if we do not make the necessary investments to inspire confidence in our communities here at home           In order to grow our communities    from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Northwest    and in order to keep jobs here in this country  we have to inspire confidence in businesses that we have the infrastructure and workers they need to locate here and keep America strong          It is far past time to make the safety and security of Americans a national priority  and we can begin by restoring critical funding to our emergency preparedness systems          The lesson is clear  you can t cut emergency preparedness before a disaster  and then hope things will be fine after a disaster            Unfortunately  for years this Administration has had the wrong priorities          As we continue to support the workers  residents and communities who are trying to pick up the pieces from Hurricane Katrina and put their lives back together  I want to make sure that we learn lessons that will help protect all Americans    no matter where they live          One of the clear lessons we need to learn from this disaster is that    when you cut funding for emergency preparedness  and when you cut funding for disaster assistance  you put America lives at risk          I want to make sure we learn that lesson now    before another American community pays the price
