Murray  03 27 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          Washington State Soldier Faced Serious Problems with PTSD Treatment and Care for Brain Injury  Mother Testifies at Hearing with Senator Murray Murray Adds Funding to Pending Supplemental Bill to Fix Broken System    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 27  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  joined Denise Mettie of Selah            Washington at a hearing of the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee  where Ms  Mettie testified about the problems her son  Evan  faced after he was seriously injured in Iraq          Retired Army Specialist Evan Mettie served two tours of duty in Iraq   After his first tour  he tested positive for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   but he was not given medication to treat it  his mother testified          He suffered extreme PTSD  They said they could not medicate him because he would not be deployable again  so he self medicated by alcohol   He couldn t sleep at night  and this is what he did for the whole year until he was redeployed   Ms  Mettie testified      During his second tour  Specialist Mettie suffered serious brain injuries in an explosion on January 1  2006   Since then  his family has faced a series of bureaucratic obstacles in getting Evan the care he needs        Denise  our country owes you and your son an apology   Senator Murray said    Your son fought a war for our country  You shouldn t have had to fight every day to get him the care he deserves       Murray expressed frustration that the Bush Administration has not provided a full accounting of the needs facing injured service members           War is expensive and if we don t face the full costs of war   including caring for our veterans   we ll never be able to get the resources and help families like Evan s need   Murray said    We need the truth  so we can set the right budget and the right policies   But if the Administration keeps hiding the ball  we ll never be able to get this right for those who have sacrificed for us       Murray is working to hold the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon accountable for the way it treats injured service members and veterans   The Senator worked to include more than  4 billion in funding in the pending supplemental bill to improve treatment and care for wounded warriors          It s easy to whitewash a moldy wall   It s a lot harder to make sure that our veterans are taken care of every step of the way   Murray said       Senator Murray s full opening statement follows     Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing   I really want to thank all of our witnesses who are here today for their sacrifices and for speaking out   You re helping us get the truth about what veterans are really facing and helping us change the system for the better for everyone else        Denise Mettie   I want to extend a special welcome to Denise Mettie  who is from Selah  Washington  and whose son Evan is receiving treatment for a traumatic brain injury   I visited Denise and Evan at Bethesda Naval Hospital last February   Since then he s faced not just medical problems  but a bureaucratic system that has thrown up obstacles in his path toward recovery   Denise is a tremendous advocate for her son   She quit her job  so she could fight for Evan in a system that is failing far too many of our wounded warriors        Denise  our country owes you and your son an apology   Your son fought a war for our country   You shouldn t have had to fight every day to get him the care he deserves   You and Evan deserve better  and that s why your testimony here today is so important to help us hold the VA and the Pentagon accountable so that service members never fall through the cracks and are never denied vital information  and are never left in limbo when they need our help   And we ve got a long way to go because what happened to Evan is really not an isolated case        We Can t Get Answers   One of my biggest frustrations is that we ve been unable to get the facts we need to solve the problems   We hear stories of serious problems from veterans and their families  but then    when we try to get answers from the Administration    we have run into a brick wall           We can t get full answers on the number of service members treated for TBI          We can t get accurate projections on how many veterans will need inpatient mental health care        We can t even get accurate figures on the number of amputations  In fact  I m now hearing that the Administration is not counting as  amputees  veterans who lose a finger or a toe  That minimizes the scope of the problem and hides the true cost of this war        War is expensive and if we don t face the full costs of war   including caring for our veterans   we ll never be able to get the resources and help families like Evan s need   We need the truth  so we can set the right budget and the right policies   But if the Administration keeps hiding the ball  we ll never be able to get this right for those who have sacrificed for us   So I thank our witnesses for helping us get the facts we need to finally solve these problems       No More Excuses   Mr  Chairman  I ve just about had it with Administration officials who assure us everything is being taken care of   Two years ago  the VA told us everything was fine  when   in fact    it was facing a  3 billion shortfall   We re going to hear from two officials from the VA and the Pentagon on the next panel  and I want them to know one thing  I know you have tough jobs  and I know you work very hard  but we are going to judge you by the results you get for our veterans  and we re going to hold you accountable for those results          Two months ago  as the Chairman said we had a similar hearing on this committee   Officials from the VA and the Pentagon told us about all the progress they were making   They were improving communication   They were setting up seamless transition programs  Everything was on track   Well a month later we discovered that things were not fine when the Walter Reed story broke            It s easy to whitewash a moldy wall   It s a lot harder to make sure that our veterans are taken care of every step of the way   That s the challenge that we now face as a country  and that s why we re going to hold people accountable for the results   not just creating a new box on the organizational chart   but what results are you getting for our service members and our families           Are they getting benefits in a timely way        Are they getting fair disability ratings        Are they being screened and treated for both PTSD and TBI        Are they getting the best care        Are their medical records where they need to be        And are their families being informed        Because let me tell you  you can make adjustments to a bureaucracy decade after decade  but the real results are whether the men and women who have served us so well are telling us that things are changed for the better and that s what were going to be looking for            Now  I have to say that a lot of this misery could have been avoided   Many of us saw the warning signs years ago  We saw that the VA was not planning for the full cost of this war  That it was not using realistic projections  And we saw an overwhelmed and under funded VA not getting itself on wartime footing           We re not going to wait for the President to finally fix these problems   We are facing the costs of war and we re putting the money where it s needed    Mr  Chairman  as you know  right now on the Senate floor is our supplemental bill       It includes          50 million to build new poly trauma centers        100 million for mental health care        201 million to treat recent veterans   so they don t face waiting lines or delays in care        30 million for research on the best prosthetics for amputees        870 million to fix problems that we have uncovered at VA facilities across the country now     46 million to hire new claims processors so veterans don t have to wait years for their benefits        Those are the costs of war and these families know it all too well   As a nation we have to pay them  So we need to be honest about what it s going to take so that we can get it right and give our veterans  service members  and their families the care and support they deserve
