                                                                         News Release          Senator Murray s Senate Floor Remarks on Administration s Response to Walter Reed Senator Murray s Senate Floor Remarks on Administration s Response to Walter Reed    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 13  2007        Washington D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   the fourth ranking member of the Senate leadership  delivered a speech on the Senate floor on the administration s response to veterans  health care failures including Walter Reed  The Senator s remarks follow       By now  most Americans have heard about the appalling conditions at Walter Reed as exposed by the Washington Post   The stories detailed conditions which no one should have to endure  especially injured troops who have sacrificed so much for this country         The Post uncovered rooms with mice infestation  moldy walls and holes in the ceilings        The series also showed that the Administration is failing to provide adequate medical care for injured troops  who face inexcusably long waits for the most basic care       And if squalid living conditions and a lack of adequate medical care are not bad enough  troops face a daunting maze of paperwork for the simplest things       One service member had to show his purple heart to prove he served in Iraq   Others who returned from Iraq with uniforms caked in dirt and blood were forced to spend endless hours trying to secure new  clean uniforms   And a severe shortage of caseworkers means patients endlessly search for answers to routine questions       Our servicemen and women  Mr  President  aren t the only ones facing bureaucratic nightmares  We also learned of problems families face when visiting loved ones at Walter Reed   From a lack of translators for families of Hispanic soldiers  to complicated and outdated forms for hotel reimbursement  relatives are spending countless hours on paperwork        Hours that could be spent with injured sons or daughters    husbands or wives    fathers or mothers       And despite White House efforts  it was eventually revealed that members of the Administration had known for years of problems plaguing Walter Reed       Response to Walter Reed   The President s response to Walter Reed has been slow  and more media strategy than substance   Unfortunately for our troops  the Administration has tried for weeks to paper over problems instead of offering real solutions       Days after the first reports  Administration officials repeatedly attempted to play down the problems   They painted walls  held press conferences and told Americans problems were overblown       But the press and American public did not bite   They have been misled too many times by this Administration    And stories on the President s failure to care for our injured troops continued to appear       After two weeks of endless news on the horrible conditions at Walter Reed  the Administration decided fall guys were needed         First to go was Major General George W  Weightman  the head of the hospital       The second  a bit higher on the food chain  was Army Secretary Francis J  Harvey        And finally  yesterday  the Administration fired Lieutenant General Kiley  the Army Surgeon General and former head of Walter Reed       On top of the fall guys  the Administration has created numerous commissions to review the care of our injured troops and veterans    Mr  President  while firing people involved in failures and creating panels to review problems are usually positive steps in the right direction  this Administration s history  unfortunately  leads me to be skeptical        For one  while Army Secretary Harvey  Lieutenant General Kiley and Major General George W  Weightman ignored for years the problems at Walter Reed  the buck stops with the President   And as the White House Spokesperson said a few weeks ago  the Administration had been aware of the situation for some time       Real accountability isn t finding fall guys   It s publicly owning up to failures and changing course       And moreover  it is unlikely the panels are the solutions they seem to be   In the past seven years  we ve seen many recommendations from many commissions    including those from the 9 11 Commission and the Iraq Study Group    simply be ignored by the White House       What good  Mr  President  are fall guys and commissions if they produce no real change      Enlistment to Retirement   It is now undeniable that the Administration has failed our troops and veterans   What is needed  and what these men and women deserve are real solutions that will meet their needs from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between       Our forces in battle deserve adequate body and Humvee armor  They deserve communications gear and equipment to jam IEDS    What they don t need is another day in the field without these items       Our injured heroes returning from Iraq deserve adequate mental care  treatment for post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries  and less bureaucratic red tape   What they don t need is another report of the Administration s failure to care for them  or a White House media strategy to cover these failures       Our veterans of Iraq deserve benefit checks to be mailed on time so they can provide from their families and aren t forced into homelessness   What they don t need is another day without the benefits they deserve       In the end  what all of our brave men and women deserve most is an end to the Administration s excuses       Democrats know what our troops deserve   We know they deserve a Congress that won t hide this Administration s mistakes and will instead provide solutions       And last week Democrats took steps toward this goal      HEROES Program    The HEROES  Honoring and Ensuring Respect for Our Exceptional Soldiers Plan will ensure our service members no longer fall through the cracks and fail to receive the treatment they deserve   It calls for increased oversight and coordination between the various committees overseeing troops and veterans       This effort is especially important because so many of us know that the problems at Walter Reed are not unique   Instead  I fear that much of the health care system for our troops is broken   From poor facilities to long waiting lines to overwhelming red tape  the system is failing our troops          We need a comprehensive look at the problem   And we need comprehensive solutions   Our troops and their families deserve no less            Over the weekend I was stunned to see that some of these brave men and women who have been injured in Iraq are now facing the indignity of being sent back   BEFORE being cleared for duty        According to a Salon com article form March  11th  several dozen injured soldiers at Fort Benning  Georgia  are being sent back to Iraq as part of the President s escalation plan   These soldiers  the article says  have various medical problems that should prevent them from returning to battle   But they re going anyways        Let me quote directly from the article          As the military scrambles to pour more soldiers into Iraq  a unit of the Army s 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Benning  Ga   is deploying troops with serious injuries and other medical problems  including GIs who doctors have said are medically unfit for battle  Some are too injured to wear their body armor  according to medical records         On Feb  15  Master Sgt  Jenkins and 74 other soldiers with medical conditions from the 3rd Division s 3rd Brigade were summoned to a meeting with the division surgeon and brigade surgeon  These are the men responsible for handling each soldier s  physical profile   an Army document that lists for commanders an injured soldier s physical limitations because of medical problems    from being unable to fire a weapon to the inability to move and dive in three to five second increments to avoid enemy fire  Jenkins and other soldiers claim that the division and brigade surgeons summarily downgraded soldiers  profiles  without even a medical exam  in order to deploy them to Iraq  It is a claim division officials deny         This report is terribly concerning   If true  it represents a new outrage and yet another example of how the Administration s failure to plan for the war is being taken out on our brave men and women          Master Sgt  Ronald Jenkins  one of the soldiers who told Salon he was ordered to Iraq even though he has a spine problem that doctors say would be damaged by Army protective gear  said  and I quote          This is not right   This whole thing is about taking care of soldiers   If you are fit to fight you are fit to fight  If you are not fit to fight  then you are not fit to fight        I could not agree with Master Sgt  Jenkins more   This whole thing   the war  the buildup  and the aftermath  must be about taking care of our soldiers   But far too frequently  taking care of our soldiers has been little more than an after thought for this Administration         Unfortunately  Mr  President  the list of failures goes on and on   More stories emerge almost every day  And still  with this war set to enter on Monday its fifth year  this Administration has failed to make caring for our troops a priority          There has been more than enough time to address problems facing our troops  Unfortunately  but not surprisingly  the Administration has failed our Armed Forces       Mr  President  the Administration and Republicans in Congress owe our troops  their families  and our veterans more much more
