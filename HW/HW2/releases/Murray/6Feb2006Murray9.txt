security will be felt around the state  Largest deficit in history    For Immediate Release  Monday  February 6  2006       WASHINGTON  D C      Less than a week after delivering a State of the Union address in which he painted a rosy future for our nation  the President today sent Congress a fiscal year  2007 budget that takes America backwards          The President  s budget is a statement of values  unfortunately the document he delivered to Congress today shows that this Administration is out of touch with the needs of America  s working families     Senator Murray said     We need a government that reflects our priorities    that means investing in our infrastructure  caring for our veterans  and protecting our ports and borders  On issue after issue this budget comes up short  I am disappointed that the President has not provided the resources we need to move our families and communities forward             Details of the President  s budget and Senator Murray  s response follows    VETERANS    The proposed budget increase by the Bush Administration is necessary  but not sufficient to care for current and future veterans   The Administration has once again proposed short sighted user fees and increased co pays for prescription drugs that do nothing to cut back on costs  but discourage access to the VA for millions of veterans who have been promised healthcare in thanks for their service to our nation   This continues the trend from fiscal year   05 during which the Bush Administration denied VA access to 260 000 veterans           The VA health care system cannot provide quality care for our veterans at the President  s requested funding level   While this increase in funding stops the digging  we  re still in a hole     Senator Murray said     With a new generation of combat veterans deployed around the world  the federal government must meet its obligations to our veterans instead of creating more barriers to care           HANFORD    Once again  the President has failed to make Hanford cleanup a national priority   While the President  s budget request to Congress provides adequate funding for the vitrification plant  other aspects of the site    particularly the tank cleanup    have experienced significant cuts    It is time for the Administration to come clean about its plan for Hanford          The Bush Administration continues to send mixed messages about its plans for cleaning up Hanford     Senator Murray said     On one hand they have said they want to accelerate cleanup  then in their supplemental request last year they called it a lower priority federal program   Today  in his budget  the President increased funding for the vit plant  but cut funding for the tank farm   It is time for the Bush Administration to come clean about its plans for Hanford and its commitment to the people of the Tri Cities           PORT SECURITY    The Commandant of the Coast Guard has said it would take  7 3 billion over 10 years to properly secure the 361 port facilities across the country    including two of our largest cargo ports    Seattle and Tacoma   Unfortunately  the President has once again failed to provide this level of funding to protect our ports  our economy and our communities within his budget request          In Washington state  we know the potential loss to life and livelihood that could result from an attack on one of our ports  Yet despite these dangers  the President has yet to put forward a plan for securing our nation  s ports and has failed to make our ports a priority in his budget   Our national security and economic stability depend on doing better     Murray said       BPA    The President  s Fiscal Year 2007 budget would prevent certain surplus sale revenues from being used to lower power prices for BPA customers  as Bonneville has done for decades   According to budget documents  this plan could raise Northwest power rates by an estimated  924 million over the next 10 years  depending on the amount of surplus power BPA sells and the market price of power          We are just beginning to pull out of the economic damages left by the electricity crisis of the past five years and we will not stand by and allow the Administration to drag us down again  An increase in the cost of heating our homes and providing electricity to businesses will cripple the economy in the Pacific Northwest  The financial mistakes of this Administration must not be paid for on the backs of Northwest ratepayers     Murray said        EDUCATION    The President  s  2 1 billion in cuts to education represents the single largest cut to education in the 26 year history of the Department of Education  On top of underfunding No Child Left Behind and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  the budget also cuts Education Technology Grants  college preparation programs and grants to help students attend college            One week after saying education was key to securing our nation  s future  the President is now proposing to cut it more than ever before     Murray said     We should be tearing down barriers to education and building a stronger  more competitive economy  unfortunately the President  s budget request does just the opposite
