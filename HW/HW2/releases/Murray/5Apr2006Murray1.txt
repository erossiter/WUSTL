Dramatic Picture of a Dirty Bomb Exploding at a U S  Port  Cites Loss of Lives   Economic Impact in Urging Congress to Act     Innovative GreenLane Bill is on the Fast Track in Senate and House    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 5  2006     Washington  D C      Today at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged Congress to pass the Murray Collins GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  S 2459    Senator Susan Collins  R ME  chaired the hearing on the bill  which is also supported by Senators Norm Coleman  R MN  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT           By using cargo containers  terrorists can deliver a deadly one two punch to our country   Murray warned     The first punch would create an untold number of American casualties   The second punch would bring our economy to a halt   Cargo containers carry the building blocks of our economy  but they can also carry the deadly tools of a terror attack   Today  we are not doing enough to keep America safe         The bipartisan GreenLane Act would          Create tough new standards for all cargo       Create the GreenLane option  which provides an even higher level of security by tracking cargo and inspecting it overseas        Create a plan to resume trade quickly and safely   to minimize the impact on our economy         Secure America s ports through port security grants  and      Hold the Department of Homeland Security accountable for improving cargo security              Two months ago  the American people woke up and spoke out when they heard that a foreign  government owned company could be running our ports   That sparked a critical debate   Murray said    Now we need to set up a security regime that will actually make us safer   Until we do so  none of us should sleep well at night   A terrible image like a burning container ship  with a dirty bomb  in one of America s harbors could be on our TV screens tomorrow  so this Committee and this Congress must act today                                                                            Senator Murray s prepared remarks follow     I m here today because our country is vulnerable to a terrorist attack  and time is not on our side   By using cargo containers  terrorists can deliver a deadly one two punch to our country    The first punch would create an untold number of American casualties   The second punch would bring our economy to a halt   Cargo containers carry the building blocks of our economy  but they can also carry the deadly tools of a terror attack   Today  we are not doing enough to keep America safe   Sitting here in this Senate hearing room  it can feel like the dangers at our ports are a million miles away   In recent years  some in our government have said they could  never have imagined  the devastation caused by recent disasters         Picture the Consequences   So let me make this threat crystal clear   On March 21st  just 2 weeks ago  a container ship called the Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast of Yemen when an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship   About 90 containers were blown off the side of the ship  creating a debris field 5 miles long   Thankfully there were no fatalities  and the crew was rescued   They are still investigating the cause  but it does not appear to be terrorist related   Now I want you to imagine this same burning ship sitting just a few feet from our shores  in New York harbor or Puget Sound  off the coast of Los Angeles or Charleston  Miami  Portland  Hampton Roads  the Delaware Bay or the Gulf of Mexico          Now imagine that we re not just dealing with a conventional explosion   We re dealing with a dirty bomb that has exploded on America s shores   Let me walk through what would happen next  First  there would be an immediate loss of life   Many of our ports are located near major cities           If this was a nuclear device exploded at a major port  up to 1 million people could be killed   If this was a chemical weapon exploding in Seattle  the chemical plume could contaminate the rail system  Interstate 5 and SeaTac Airport  not to mention the entire downtown business and residential district  At the port  there would be tremendous confusion   People would try to contain the fire  but it s unclear who  if anyone  would be in charge   Then  when word spreads that it s a dirty bomb  panic would likely set in   There would be chaos as first responders try to react  and residents try to flee   Next  our government would shut down every port in America to make sure there weren t other bombs on other containers in other cities   That shutdown would be the equivalent of driving our economy into a brick wall   It could even spark a global recession   Day by day  we d feel the painful economic impact of the attack   American factories would not be able to get the supplies they need   They would shut their doors and lay off workers   Stores around the country would not be able to get the products they need to stock their shelves   In 2002  we saw what the closure of a few ports on the West Coast would do   It cost our economy about  1 billion a day   Imagine if we shut down all our ports   One study concluded that if U S  ports were shut down for 12 days  it would cost our economy  58 billion   Next  we d realize we have no plan for resuming trade after an attack    no protocol for what would be searched  what would be allowed in  and even who would be in charge   There would be a mad scramble to create a new system in a crisis atmosphere   Eventually  we d begin the slow process of manually inspecting all the cargo that s waiting to enter the U S   One report found it could take as long as four months to get them all inspected and moving again    Finally  we d have to set up a new regime for port security   And you can bet that any new  rushed plan would not balance strong security with efficient trade        The scenario I just outlined could happen tomorrow  and we are not prepared   Nearly five years after September 11th  we still have not closed a major loophole that threatens our lives and our economy   Time is not on our side   We must act       My Approach   I approach this as someone who understands the importance of both improving security and maintaining the flow of commerce   My home state of Washington is the most trade dependent state in the nation   We know what s at stake if there were an incident at one of our ports   That s why I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce to help us find where we re vulnerable and to evaluate the best security practices   It s why I ve worked to boost funding for the Coast Guard and have fought to keep the Port Security Grant program from being eliminated year after year   Right after 9 11  I started talking with security and trade experts to find out what we need to be doing to both improve security and keep commerce flowing   Ten months ago  I sought out Senator Collins as a partner in this effort    I approached Senator Collins because I knew she cared about the issue  I knew she d done a lot of work on it already  and I knew she was someone who could get things done   Since that day  we have worked hand in hand to develop a bill and move it forward   And I m grateful to Senators Lieberman and Coleman for their tremendous work   The GreenLane Act recognizes two facts   We must protect our country  and we must keep trade flowing         The Threat   We know we re vulnerable   Terrorists have many opportunities to introduce deadly cargo into a container   It could be tampered with anytime from when it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it arrives at a consolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port   It could be tampered with while it s en route to the U S   And there are several dangers   I outlined what would happen if terrorists exploded a container   But they could just as easily use cargo containers to transport weapons or personnel into the U S  to launch an attack anywhere on American soil       Current Efforts Are Inadequate   The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate   Last May  thanks to the insistence of Senators Collins and Coleman  the Government Accountability Office found that C TPAT was not checking to see if companies were doing what they promised in their security plans   Even when U S  Customs inspectors do find something suspicious at a foreign port  they cannot force a container to be inspected   So we have a clear and deadly threat  and we know that current programs are inadequate   What are we going to do about it   We could manually inspect every container  but that would cripple our economy         The Challenge    Security and Efficiency   The real challenge here is to make trade more secure without slowing it to a crawl   That s why Senators Collins  Coleman  Lieberman and I have been working with stakeholders and experts to strike the right balance   The result is the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act   It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security while keeping trade efficient   At its heart  this challenge is about keeping the good things about trade  speed and efficiency  without being vulnerable to the bad things about trade  the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce         How Our Bill Works   Our bill does five things   First  it creates tough new standards for all cargo   Today we don t have any standards for cargo security   Second  it creates the GreenLane option which provides an even higher level of security   Companies have the option to follow the higher standards of the GreenLane   Their cargo will be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a factory floor overseas until it the reaches the U S   We ll know everywhere that cargo has been  We ll know every person who s touched it  and we ll know if it s been tampered with   The GreenLane will push out the borders by conducting inspections overseas before cargo is ever loaded onto a ship bound for the U S   And we ll provide incentives for companies to use the highest standards of the GreenLane   Third  our bill sets up a plan to resume trade quickly and safely to minimize the impact on our economy   Fourth  our bill will secure our ports here at home by funding Port Security grants at  400 million   Finally  our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo security   DHS is long overdue in establishing cargo security standards and transportation worker credentials   We need to hold DHS accountable  and our bill provides the infrastructure to ensure accountability and coordination        Many Partners   I want to thank all of our cosponsors and partners  especially Senator Collins for her tremendous leadership   I also want to thank Senator Coleman for his leadership and work as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   Senator Coleman has helped expose our vulnerabilities and has worked to develop solutions   I also want to thank our Ranking Member  Senator Lieberman for his leadership and support  and I want to commend our cosponsors    Senators Feinstein  Snowe  and DeWine   We re also seeing tremendous progress on the House side with the SAFE Port Act  and I want to thank Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harman for their leadership   You re also going to hear from Mic Dinsmore  the CEO of the Port of Seattle   Mic s been a real leader on cargo and port security issues  and I ve been proud to work with him       Let s Act Before an Attack   Today  we have a choice in how we deal with the cargo security challenges facing us   But if we wait for a disaster  our choices will be starker   Let s make the changes now  on our terms  before there s a deadly incident   Let s not wait until a terrorist incident strikes again to protect our people and our economy   Two months ago  the American people woke up and spoke out when they heard that a foreign  government owned company could be running our ports   That sparked a critical debate   Now we need to set up a security regime that will actually make us safer   Until we do so  none of us should sleep well at night   A terrible image like a burning container ship  with a dirty bomb  in one of America s harbors could be on our TV screens tomorrow  so this Committee and this Congress must act today
