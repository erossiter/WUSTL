Contract In speech Murray calls Boeing  the best company for the contract     For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 31  2007         Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  delivered a speech at the KC 767 Advanced Tanker Supplier Conference in Washington  D C   about the importance of giving Boeing the opportunity to build and supply the Air Force s next generation of aerial refueling tankers   When I visit Fairchild Air Force Base and talk with the men and women who fly these tankers  and with their families  who worry about their safety  I want to be able to look them in the eye and say theyre getting the most advanced and safest equipment that their grateful nation can provide  Murray said in her speech  Boeing has the best planes  the best workers  the best suppliers  and its best positioned to deliver a tanker that will ensure our airmen and women can do their jobs  Its time to get those tankers into the hands of our service men and women who need them   The full text of Murray s speech follows  Thank you  Jim  And thanks to the tremendous Boeing team from Washington state  Good morning to all of you  Tanker Contract Will Help Ensure a Healthy Aerospace Industry Im excited to be here today because we share the same interest in making sure the aerospace industry stays strong and competitive and continues to grow  A healthy aerospace industry is vital to my states economy  our nations economy  and to our national security  In Washington state  the aerospace industry means Boeing and its suppliers  On July 15  1916  Bill Boeing started his airplane company in Seattle  Since that day  Boeing and Washington state have shared the ups and downs of the commercial aerospace industry  Today  Boeing employs more than 66 000 people in my home state  There are also hundreds of suppliers in Washington  who generate billions of dollars of business  I know some of them are here with us today  and I want to welcome you  This is an important time for Boeing  and for Washington  In a few months  the Air Force will decide which company will manufacture the next generation of military air tankers  It will choose between Boeing and the French company Airbus  which partnered with Northrop Grumman to bid on the contract  Im proud that the process for selecting a company to supply these tankers has been a truly open one  And Ill talk more about that in a few minutes  But Im also proud to say that I believe Boeing has proven that its the best company for the contract  Boeing has the best planes  the best workers  the best suppliers  and its best positioned to deliver a tanker that will ensure our airmen and women can do their jobs  Its time to get those tankers into the hands of our service men and women who need them  The Tanker is Vital to our Military Let me stop here and explain that the air tanker contract isnt just important to me because Boeing is a major employer and a major corporate partner in my home state  While I believe its important to support an American company  and a Washington state company the most important thing is that the taxpayers  and especially our airmen and women  get the best tanker possible  Every day  all around the world  our service members are risking their lives for our security  And Ive made it a priority to make sure our troops have the best equipment and services we can give them  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee  Im doing everything I can to make that happen  I dont need to tell you how important these tankers are to our military   Experts have called the war on terror the first aerial tanker war because of the support provided by these enormous gas stations in the sky  Here at home  American skies were kept secure for months after the September 11 terrorist attacks  thanks in part to tankers  which supplied fuel in mid air for military jets patrolling the country  That was made possible in part by the wing from Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane  Washington  And the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Army General Hugh Shelton  once said that the motto of the tanker and airlift forces should be  Try fighting without us     So air tankers are vital to making sure our military stays strong  Our current fleet of KC 135 tankers  which Boeing manufactured  have served us well  So well  in fact  we have squadron pilots now whose fathers and even grandfathers flew KC 135s  But our current fleet is old  the average age of the KC 135 is 45  and the planes are in the shop for repairs too often  We need to replace the tanker fleet now  and with the best planes we can get  When I visit Fairchild Air Force Base and talk with the men and women who fly these tankers  and with their families  who worry about their safety  I want to be able to look them in the eye and say theyre getting the most advanced and safest equipment that their grateful nation can provide  Boeing is the company that can do that  And as suppliers  you will be there to help them  Boeing Designed the Best Plane for the Job When the Air Force set out its requirements for a new tanker  Boeing listened  The competitor  Airbus  has no experience building this kind of tanker  That company has recently tried to tout themselves as providing planes that are bigger and better  But the Air Force didnt say it wanted a bigger plane  It wants a plane that meets its needs  Boeing drew on its 75 years of experience  and designed the modern  efficient KC 767  Its tailor made for the Air Force  and has already performed a successful in flight refueling this year  The KC 767 represents the best of what American innovation and hard work can do  It represents what the taxpayer needs  and what our service men and women deserve  It Would be a Mistake to Buy From a Foreign Company So I believe that Boeing has the best product  But I also think it would be a huge mistake to select a foreign company for this contract  Airbus has a history of not fighting fair on trade  Three years ago  I delivered a major speech on the Senate floor to sound an alarm and explain that Airbus was waging an unfair lobbying campaign  trying to convince the U S  government that it is essentially an American company  Let me be clear  that is still a concern  Yes  Airbus has partnered with Northrop Grumman  but if Airbus is selected for the tanker contract  it will create only half as many American jobs as Boeing  And much of the initial work would be done overseas  I have  for years  urged the Administration and Congress to fight to save Americas aerospace industry from a European takeover    For decades  Europe has provided subsidies to prop up Airbus and its parent company  EADS  Those subsidies have created an uneven playing field and have led to tens of thousands of layoffs here in the United States  Weve demanded that Europe stop the subsidies and play by the rules  So as suppliers  I think you would agree that it would be a big step in the WRONG direction for the United States to   On the one hand  accuse Europe of improperly subsidizing its aerospace industry  While  on the other hand  purchase military tankers from Airbus     Split buy Purchasing Would be a Mistake Moreover  Airbus and its supporters have tried to argue that the military should change the contract terms and purchase planes from both companies  I think its also unfortunate that some of my colleagues in Congress have been persuaded by this and want to use the split buy purchasing process  This fall  I wrote to the secretary of the Air Force  with 13 other Senators joining me  to explain why that last ditch effort would be a bad idea  And Ill continue to fight against the split buy if any of my colleagues pursue it  Buying two kinds of tankers would mean dramatically increased costs for research and development  maintenance  training and infrastructure  But it also would do something else that I think is dangerous to the future of the aerospace industry  it would give Airbus a strong foothold as a U S  defense contractor  Choosing Boeing is Also the Best Decision for Our Economy I have said  time and again  that its important to our country that we not surrender our aerospace leadership  Once our plants shut down  and our skilled workers move on to other fields  you cant recreate that overnight  It took us 100 years to build our aerospace leadership  and we need to defend it  Just look at the impact this contract will have in our communities  Boeings 767 is truly a national plane  Although Boeing was started in Seattle  it now reaches nearly every state in the nation  The 767 would support more than 44 000 American jobs  including 300 suppliers  in 40 states  About 9 000 of those would go to Washington state  for an annual economic impact of  400 million  These arent just run of the mill  low wage manufacturing jobs either  These are high wage  high skill jobs  And we need to keep them in America by keeping our aerospace companies  and their suppliers  strong  Conclusion So  as Ive said  this is a very important time for us all  The tanker contract isnt just one defense contract  its a key piece of our national and economic security  My goal is to provide the brave men and women of our military with the equipment and the help they need to finish their mission safely and successfully  This is something our Air Force needs  Its something our economy needs  And youre an important part of that  We want the best plane  and we want it into the theater as soon as possible  With your hard efforts  and with honest American ingenuity  we will do that
