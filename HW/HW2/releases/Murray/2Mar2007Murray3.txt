                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   MURRAY  We Cannot Trust the Bush Administration to Take Care of Our Troops                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  MURRAY  We Cannot Trust the Bush Administration to Take Care of Our Troops  03 02 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          MURRAY  We Cannot Trust the Bush Administration to Take Care of Our Troops    For Immediate Release  Friday  March 2  2007    Washington  DC   Today  Senate Democratic Conference Secretary Patty Murray  a member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  released the following statement on the President s plan to review medical care for injured troops          The Bush Administration has known for years of problems at Walter Reed hospital and other medical centers   It is appalling that it takes news coverage of moldy rooms and bureaucratic nightmares for the President to review the shameful treatment of our injured troops            While I welcome the President s long overdue review  the real test is whether he will ever implement the commission s findings   Given how the President ignored the 9 11 Commission and Iraq Study Group s recommendations  I will not sit idly by hoping he makes changes he should have made years ago            While the Bush Administration continues to react and play defense on issues important to our troops  I am committed to proactive steps toward fulfilling our obligation to take care of them   Democrats will proceed with aggressive oversight and investigations into the mistreatment of our troops   We will work to ensure our men and women in uniform have the care they need and deserve
