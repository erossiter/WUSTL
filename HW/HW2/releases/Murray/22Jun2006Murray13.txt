Priorities    For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 22  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell secured more than  20 million for Washington state  s agriculture priorities in the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill             Agriculture is the backbone of the Washington state economy and this funding will go towards keeping it that way in a changing economic climate   said Senator Murray   This funding will help a variety of Washington state agriculture related industries by providing financial resources for scientific and technological advances        Senator Cantwell said    As our number one employer  agriculture remains the foundation of our economy and jobs in Washington state  I am very pleased with the commitment to agriculture in Washington state that the Senate Appropriations committee has provided   This funding for research across the state is critically important to help Washington  s farmers and ranchers maintain their competitive advantage and global market share by continuing to produce commodities of the highest quality and safety             Senators Murray and Cantwell also restored over  6 5 million in proposed Bush Administration cuts specifically for Agricultural Research Service Projects  including        Agricultural Research Service Projects for which Funding was Cut by President Bush but Restored by Senators Murray and Cantwell  though some projects are based in OR  all projects benefit WA crops        Increased Funding for      Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research   Corvallis  OR increase of  250 000       Shellfish Genetics and Marine Ecology Research   Newport  OR increase of  150 000      Funded at FY06 Levels      Minor Use Pesticides in   Prosser and Wapato

other projects in the bill  some highlights include       Bioproducts   500 000    This proposed program will support the establishment of an economically competitive biodiesel industry in the Pacific Northwest by overcoming existing economic barriers through research and co product development from waste product glycerol and seed meal   Locally produced biodiesel holds great potential in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and can help alleviate air quality issues associated with petroleum diesel use   Washington State University has renowned expertise in bioenergy   bioprocessing   bioproduct utilization and is currently engaged in an initiative to work on short term  high impact research to benefit the emerging biofuels industry   This funding will be used to set up a competitive grant program directed at addressing research priorities         Canadian Cattle Tracking Initiative   250 000    Canadian Feeder Cattle Tracking Initiative will be used to track the age and identity of Canadian feeder cattle into the United States   Washington state receives a substantial amount of feeder cattle from the region of Canada where multiple cases of BSE has been discovered making it imperative to accurately separate Canadian cattle from U S  bred cattle   This funding will be critically important to the Washington State Veterinarian in working with cattle producers  feedlots and slaughter houses maintain accountability in identifying Canadian feeder cattle entering Washington state   The extra resources will greatly enhance Washington state  s ability to quickly respond to the discovery of disease and identify other animals potentially exposed       National Clean Plant Network for Fruit Trees  Nut Trees  and Grapevines   300 000    This funding will support programs at Washington State University that will conduct virus elimination and testing of material from foreign and domestic plant and tree sources   Because viruses degrade the productivity and quality of our agricultural programs  domestic and international sales can be negatively impacted by the costs to treat their products   These funds will help support clean plant programs that are providing services for our farmers in Washington state and help keep our farmers competitive      Pioneers in Conservation   200 000    This program will ensure the long term continuity of farming in the Puget Sound by encouraging the implementation of projects and practices that benefit salmon  other fish and wildlife species and water quality while sustaining the viability of farming   This funding will support competitive grants to on farm conservation projects that provide a variety of environmental benefits   This program follows the successful pilot program implemented by the Shared Strategy of Puget Sound  the American Farmland Trust  and the Nature Conservancy in 2005      Agricultural Research Service Research Laboratory Construction  2 000 000    Researchers from the Agricultural Research Service and Washington State University have enjoyed a long and effective partnership  collaborating on national and regional projects  and training students   This new facility will strengthen this federal state partnership  and is critical to the future of agriculture in the Pacific Northwest      Strengthening Organic Crops Research and Education   355 000     Washington state enjoys a rapidly growing organic foods industry  which is valued at more than  100 million  The WSU Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources is developing a comprehensive organic farming research and education program  The Center  s plans include developing organic seed protection and production technology  determining the effect of production practices on nutritional content  developing organic weed control methods  water management  and pest control       Wine Industry     319 000    This funding will help create a virus free source of rootstock to keep Washington state  s growing wine industry strong and competitive  As the industry grows  it needs a disease and virus free   motherblock    of plant material to ensure that all planted grapevine is free of diseases that could devastate the broader industry  These research dollars will help build a new foundation block for distribution to growers  ensuring that our state  s wineries always have clean rootstock for planting new vineyards        Asparagus Technology and Production   246 000     Washington State University and Michigan State University are jointly researching methods to reduce labor costs in the asparagus industry  The industry  s labor costs  combined with federal anti drug and trade policies that have led to a disproportionate increase in imported asparagus have left Washington  s asparagus at a competitive disadvantage   This project will help the industry reduce labor costs while shifting its workforce to value added employment       Small Fruits Research   439 000     The Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research conducts coordinated research for berry and grape growers in Washington  Oregon and Idaho  Breeding and genetics research have tremendous potential to enhance the productivity and profitability of the small fruits industry in the Pacific Northwest  This funding will continue the Center  s work on genetics research  plant breeding  pest management and product quality improvement methods  which are critical to the long term viability of the industry       Competitiveness of Agricultural Products   672 000    This funding supports the International Marketing Program for Agricultural Commodities and Trade at Washington State University and the Center for International Trade in Forest Products at the University of Washington  These complementary programs apply science and technology to determine new export marketing opportunities  solve technical problems that impede exports  and develop new products  processes  technologies  or strategies to increase exports  These programs receive matching state and private sector funding for specific projects      Research on TSE Strains   600 000     Pullman   This funding will support diagnostic testing research on Scrapie  Chronic Wasting Disease and BSE at the Pullman Agriculture Research Service  ARS  facility   Scrapie  a nervous system disease in sheep similar to BSE in cows  has been a targeted disease for eradication by the U S  Department of Agriculture  for decades  but the disease has been intractable   This program brought about the first practical test for diagnosing the scrapie in live animals  and may help the livestock industry gain the upper hand on    and eventually eradicate    one of its worst problems   It may also help scientists find a live test for BSE   This funding will continue to support a research partnership between WSU and ARS to help find new ways to detect and eradicate these nervous system diseases
