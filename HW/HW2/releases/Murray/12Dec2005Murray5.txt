Ads and Launches New  Demand Reduction  Program Senator Praises Washington State s Grassroots Efforts     Calls on the Federal Government to be a Stronger Partner in Anti Meth Fight    For Immediate Release  Monday  December 12  2005     SEATTLE  WA     Today at a press conference in Seattle  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  joined federal  state and local officials to unveil a series of new anti meth TV ads and to announce the launch of a new anti meth initiative           Today  we are releasing a series of federally funded TV ads targeting the meth problem   Murray said    I hope this is the start of a new federal commitment to fighting meth   one that will finally match what our local communities have been doing for so many years         The ads mark the first time the White House has dedicated part of its national media campaign to meth ads  An initiative also announced today  the Methamphetamine Demand Reduction Program  is an effort by the Partnership for a Drug Free America   The announcement was held at the Seattle Drug   Narcotic Center        In the U S  Senate  Senator Murray has pushed the federal government to devote more resources to fighting meth  which is the fastest growing drug problem in the country   This year  Murray succeeded in helping to block an attempt by the Bush Administration to cut funding for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas by 56 percent   Over the past five years  Murray helped secure  15 million for the Washington State Meth Initiative        Senator Murray oversees the budget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy  and she has worked for years to raise the profile of methamphetamine within the War on Drugs      Senator Murray s remarks as prepared follow    Announcing a New Step    Today  as federal  state and local leaders  we are standing together to announce a new step in the fight against crystal meth   For years  communities throughout our state have been working to close meth labs  to prosecute criminals and help with recovery  but they are facing a very tough enemy    Meth is the fastest growing drug problem in the country  and here in Washington  meth has torn apart families  neighborhoods  and lives        While local and state leaders have been working hard to stop meth for many years  the federal government too often has been an unsteady partner    For years  Rick Larsen  Brian Baird and I have been working to get the federal government to focus on the meth crisis  and today  we re announcing results of that effort       Releasing Ads Today    Today  we are releasing a series of federally funded TV ads targeting the meth problem   I hope this is the start of a new federal commitment to fighting meth   one that will finally match what our local communities have been doing for so many years       Launching the Demand Reduction Program    Today we are also launching the Methamphetamine Demand Reduction Program  a new effort by the Partnership for a Drug Free America   This federally funded program will help bring hard hitting ads to our communities and will enhance local and state efforts         We Need a Comprehensive Approach    To fight meth  we need a comprehensive approach that includes enforcing the law  limiting access to ingredients  treating meth users  and reducing demand   These new ads are designed to reduce the demand for meth  by raising awareness about how it impacts the whole community       A Partnership    I want to thank everyone who has made this possible   starting with Congressman Larsen   Rick is a Co chair of the House Meth Caucus  and he is a champion on meth issues in the House   I would also like to thank Bob Denniston with ONDCP and Michael Townsend with the Partnership for a Drug Free America for being here and for working to make these ads  and this program  a reality   I want to thank Nan Busby for hosting us today  and for the Center s fine work   And I want to thank Cindy Burg  who we ll hear from shortly   Cindy  your courage in sharing your own story with us today will help put a human face on this crisis  and I thank you for your leadership and your courage       Washington State is a National Model on Fighting Meth    In this room  we have leaders from across the state  and I see a lot of familiar faces   They come from different backgrounds    law enforcement  advocacy  treatment and more   but they share a commitment to stopping meth   I want you to know something   Through your hard work  you have created one of the most experienced and most effective anti meth networks in the country   You have built a national model that other states turn to for advice    And I know  that at times  your job can be frustrating   I know what you  re up against  and I know you could do a lot more if the federal government was a fuller partner       Making the Federal Government a Full Partner    Earlier this year  the President  s budget included a 56 percent cut in funding for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas   Here in the Northwest  we rely on that funding to help local law enforcement  and we know a 56 percent cut would just make our work harder   I fought those cuts in the Senate and used my position as the top ranking Democrat on the committee that funds the Office of National Drug Control Policy  to keep HDTA funding at a reasonable level        I know that Washington state is working hard  and that s why over the past five years I ve helped secure  15 million for the Washington State Meth Initiative        In addition  I ve told our Drug Czar John Walters that ONDCP needs to do more to help communities fight meth and that  s why I  m so glad that his office is represented here today          And so I m proud that today we announcing a major first step   For the first time  the White House has dedicated part of its national media campaign to meth ads     And for the first time  the Drug Czar s office is taking a major step forward with a demand reduction campaign   But there is so much more to do   As we shut down drug labs at home  we have to make sure that international drug cartels don t step in to fill the vacuum        In closing  Mr  Denniston  I want to again thank you for being here   I hope that as you head back to Washington  D C  you take a message from Washington state with you   This is a great first step  but we have a long way to go  And we need a sustained commitment from your office and other federal agencies to help community leaders like those in the room here today          I would like to thank you all for joining us and for your hard work   Today is a great step forward   Let s make sure it s the first of many steps
