                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Statement by Senator Murray on the Confirmation of Condoleezza Rice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Murray  Statement by Senator Murray on the Confirmation of Condoleezza Rice  01 26 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement by Senator Murray on the Confirmation of Condoleezza Rice    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 26  2005    Today  I voted to confirm Condoleezza Rice to be our next Secretary of State   My vote today does not excuse Dr  Rice from the responsibility she bears for her work as National Security Advisor  particularly the Administration s woefully inadequate planning for post war Iraq        Despite my concerns  I voted to confirm Dr  Rice because I generally believe a president should have a Cabinet of his choosing   I take my responsibility to provide  advice and consent  seriously and consider each nominee individually   I also believe it s important that when America s Secretary of State meets with world leaders  that person has the authority that comes from support at home        I hope that Dr  Rice will reflect on the valid concerns raised during her confirmation hearing and will adopt a more open style that welcomes all views  particularly those that she and the President do not already hold          At the end of the day  Dr  Rice will be confirmed  and when she represents our country around the world  she needs to be successful  for all our sakes   I will work with her to meet the challenges our country faces around the world
