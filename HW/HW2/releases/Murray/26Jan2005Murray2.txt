                                 News Release          Murray Works to Help America  s Veterans Joins Other Democratic Leaders to Introduce S 13  Fulfilling Our Duty To America s Veterans Act    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 26  2005         At a press conference in Washington  D C   Senator Murray stood with other Democratic leaders to discuss their efforts to keep every American safe         In her remarks  Senator Murray focused on  S 13  Fulfilling Our Duty To America  s Veterans Act  a new bill to provide help and care to America  s veterans when the return from defending our nation overseas  The bill is one of the Democrats   first 10 bills introduce in the 109th Congress                                                                BILL SUMMARY   S  13  Fulfilling Our Duty To America  s Veterans Act    Since the time of Lincoln  Americans have made and kept a commitment to those who served in the defense of freedom   As a new generation of veterans returns from Iraq and Afghanistan   Democrats are united to keep that promise     We will ensure that all veterans get access to the health care and services they need      Ensure All Veterans Get the Health Care They Deserve By 2006   The May 2003 report of The President  s Task Force To Improve Health Care Delivery For Our Nation s Veterans found a serious imbalance between demand and available funding at the VA that delays care and threatens its quality  Under the current funding process  the VA has experienced billion dollar shortfalls every year for the past several years   At a time when the number of veterans needing services is increasing daily  S  13 ensures that America keeps its promises to our veterans and they get the health care they deserve         Expand Mental Health Care to All VA Hospitals By 2006   The New England Journal of Medicine has reported that as many as 1 in 6 soldiers returning from Iraq may suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD    Yet only 86 of 163 VA Medical Centers currently have PTSD  clinical teams   S  13 would place a PTSD clinical team at every VA Medical Center  and would improve outreach to at risk veterans         Make Prescription Drugs Readily Available to Veterans   Under current regulations  a veteran receiving a prescription from a private doctor must complete a physical with a VA physician before the VA will honor that prescription   This red tape costs the VA an estimated  1 billion or more each year   S  13 will overturn this regulation  providing veterans with quick and easy access to prescription drugs          Ensure No Veteran Is Forced to Choose Between Disability Compensation and Retirement Pay By 2006   In 2003  Congress enacted a law phasing in full concurrent receipt of disability compensation and retirement pension over 10 years for all disabled military retirees with 50 percent or higher disability ratings   While such legislation constitutes an important step forward  over 400 000 veterans are still prohibited from receiving the compensation they have earned with their service and sacrifice   S  13 will revoke the   disabled veterans tax    and make certain that no veteran will have to choose between a disability check and a retirement check       Create A Seamless Transition From the Military to the VA   Many veterans have encountered  obstacles to getting the services they deserve when they leave active duty status   While the Defense and Veterans   Departments have been trying to iron out the kinks preventing a   seamless transition    from military life to the VA system  the agencies have yet to complete any of the seven recommendations for this necessity offered by the President  s Task Force   S  13 would enact each of these seven recommendations  including requiring pre separation medical examinations and disability benefits counseling  removing information sharing barriers  and requiring greater cooperation between VA and DoD in tracking disabilities resulting from occupational exposure to hazardous materials         Enact A New G I  Bill For the 21st Century   Education assistance provided under the G I  Bill and its successors has been one of the most successful federal government programs in history   S  13 revitalizes the G I  bill for the 21st Century by excluding G I  benefits from financial aid eligibility computations  thereby allowing veterans to obtain greater financial aid  and offers Montgomery G I  bill benefits to more veterans by creating a new enrollment window for Veterans Education Assistance Program participants
