Oversight  09 29 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Veterans   Senator Murray Warns Again that the Bush Administration Has NO PLAN to Care for Iraq War Veterans  Calls for Senate Oversight    For Immediate Release  Friday  September 29  2006     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke on the Senate floor about the Bush Administration s failure to plan for Iraqi War veterans and the need for stronger Congressional oversight of the Department of Veterans  Affairs  VA          Two days ago  on September 27th  Murray spoke in detail about a recent Government Accountability  GAO  report that pointed to stunning failures by the VA            Earlier today  U S  Senator Larry Craig  R ID  spoke on the Senate floor about Murray s earlier remarks              In response  Murray delivered the following speech today       The full text of Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise to discuss how we re doing in caring for America s veterans   With our country at war  with 1 5 million Americans who have served in the Global War on Terror  and with many of them coming home in need of care    it is a critical question        Last week  we got a shocking report from the Government Accountability Office  which found that the VA has misled Congress about its failure to plan for our veterans        My Speech on Tuesday    Based on that report and other research  I came here to the Senate floor two days ago and shared my concerns with the full Senate   I said that the Bush Administration has not been honest with us about its failures to plan for the needs of our veterans  and that we still have a lot of work to do to get back on track   And I warned that    three and half years into this war    the Bush Administration still does not have a plan to meet the needs of all the veterans who will be coming home        In my speech on Tuesday  I said that Congress needs to provide real oversight of the Bush Administration so that we can ensure our veterans get the care they have earned   For those who want to see my full remarks and all the evidence I cited  you can watch or read my speech on my website at http   murray senate gov      The Senator from Idaho    This morning  the Senator from Idaho came here to the Senate floor and spoke with great passion about our veterans   The distinguished chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee took issue with some of the things I said in my remarks here on Tuesday        Mr  President  I respect the Senator from Idaho   I appreciate his leadership of our committee  and I m pleased to provide more information before the full Senate   I want everyone to know that the Senator from Idaho and I have worked together on veterans issues        I want to point out that when the VA finally admitted that it was facing a  3 billion shortfall    the Chairman was first to stand beside me and find the funding to fix the problem  And I thank him for that       Areas of Agreement    I m proud to say that the Senator from Idaho and I agree on many points   We both agree that the VA provides excellent healthcare   When I was in college during the Vietnam War  I interned at the VA hospital in Seattle   I saw first hand how dedicated and talented VA employees are         Today  that ethic of service and commitment to quality beats in the heart of every VA employee   I m proud of the progress we ve made helping the VA become a model for effective  high quality healthcare        The Senator from Idaho and I also both agree that we have increased VA funding   It s been an uphill battle    and the facts tell me that we re not prepared for the many veterans coming home    but we both agree that we have increased veterans funding   I might point out that we in Congress provided those increases in spite of years of inadequate budget requests from the White House        We agree that the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee works in a bipartisan fashion under the lea dership of Senator Craig and Ranking Member Akaka   As I ve said many times on this floor    taking care of our veterans is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue   It s an American issue  and we all need to be part of the solution        And finally  I couldn t agree more with the Senator from Idaho that we should focus on the facts   Those facts should guide our budgets and our policy decisions   If the facts say everything is fine  that s great   But when the facts say there are problems  we need to hear those facts  and we need to respond based on the facts       GAO Report Found the VA Misled Us    That s why the GAO report is such a bombshell   Professional  independent government investigators found that the Bush Administration has not told us the facts about its budget and planning problems         Think about that    if the people we rely on for the facts are not telling us the truth  we ve got a real problem   If they re hiding the truth  we won t be able to provide veterans with the services they need   And one of the answers has to be more oversight and more accountability  so we can get to the truth        Let me turn to the three main points that are relevant here         First  the Bush Administration does not have a real plan to meet the needs of our Iraqi War veterans    and that failure is impacting the care we provide all veterans        Second  the Bush Administration misled this Congress and it is still not providing us with up to date  timely information       And third  we in Congress need to provide real oversight and demand real accountability    or our veterans are gonna fall behind       The Bush Administration has No Plan To Serve Iraq   Afghanistan War Veterans    Mr  President  I m very concerned that the Bush Administration still does not have a plan to meet the needs of our returning service members   And to prove that I want to point to three sets of figures hat come from the VA itself       No Plan Example  1    VA Underestimated Demand by 68 Percent for FY 2006    The first piece of evidence concerns the number of veterans the VA expected to treat this year         For FY 2006  the VA planned to take care of about 110 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan   110 000  How many are they actually treating  185 000    So in this fiscal year    that is just about to end    the VA underestimated demand by 68 percent   And that s just for those veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   If the VA had an accurate plan  they wouldn  t have been so far off       No Plan Example   2    VA Projects FEWER Iraq War Veterans Will Enroll in FY 2007    Let s go to the second piece of evidence that shows the VA has no plan   As I said  this year we re treating 185 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan   How many will we treat next year   The VA estimates that it will only be 109 000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans   We re treating 185 000 today  but the VA thinks that number is going to down dramatically next year         Given what we know about our continued involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan  that simply defies logic   And you have to wonder how the VA ever came up with those figures in the first place   It s projection for next year is even lower than it s projection for this year   Where are they getting these numbers   Why are they so wrong        Those are the questions we in Congress need to be asking   If the VA really thinks that next year we ll have fewer veterans seeking care  it clearly has no plan to deal with those who will be coming home       No Plan Example  3    We re Already Spending More than the VA Projected    Let me turn to the third piece of evidence that shows the VA has no plan to deal with Iraq War veterans  In July  the VA told us it will need  1 billion each year for the next 10 years to care for veterans from Iraq         But the fact is    for this year alone    we ve already spending MORE than  1 billion   They ve given us a ten year estimate  and they re already wrong in the very first year   And the lion s share of veterans have not separated from the Pentagon yet  so it s a safe bet that demand for VA services will go up and that will require more funding        So the VA is already wrong in the figures it provided us just a few months ago   That s because they don t have a plan           The fact that they predicted 110 000 enrolled Iraq War veterans this year    and they re already serving 185 000 shows they don t have a plan      The fact that they think demand for care will drop next year shows that they don  t have a plan       And the fact that we re already spending more than they said we would need for Iraq war vets shows they don t have a plan       Mr  President  this is unacceptable   If we tolerate it  then we are not doing our jobs here in Congress   They don t have a plan  and we better have some oversight and accountability before more veterans end up getting hurt       GAO Report Found that the Bush Administration Misled Us    Next Mr  President  I want to turn to the facts of the GAO report that I requested   This report    prepared by independent  credible government investigators    tells us what s really happening   All of us care about the facts and we all care about getting this right  and that s why we should all take this report to heart   Unless we learn from our mistakes  we re never going to do any better for America s veterans       GAO s 4 Findings    In that spirit  I want to focus on four findings   First  the GAO found that the VA knew it had serious problems with its budget  but failed to notify us in Congress   Even worse  it misled us         The report suggests that the VA could still be sending us inaccurate information in its quarterly reports         Second  the GAO found that the VA was basing its budgets on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation  and insufficient data          Third  the Pentagon failed to give the VA up to date information about how many service members would be coming down the pipeline into the VA        Finally  the GAO found that the VA did not adequately plan for the impact of service members from Iraq and Afghanistan      VA Misled Congress   For me  I think one of the most disturbing findings is that the VA kept assuring us in Congress that everything was fine    while inside the VA it was clear that shortfalls were growing          The VA became aware it would have problems in October 2004    but didn t admit those problems until June of 2005  Veterans were telling me of long lines and delays in care         For months  I tried to give the VA more money  but the Administration fought me every step of the way   And who paid the price for the VA s deceptions  America s veterans  and that s just wrong        Timeline of VA Deceptions    Let me walk through some of the deceptions found in the report   It shows a very troubling gap between what the VA knew and what the VA told us         According to the GAO report  starting back in October 2004  the VA knew money was tight  It anticipated serious budget challenges  and created a  Budget Challenges  working group         Two months later  in December 2004  the budget group made internal recommendations to deal with the shortfall  It suggested delaying new initiatives and shifting around funding        Two months later  in February 2005  the Bush Administration released its budget proposal for 2006        The GAO found that budget was based on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation and insufficient data         A week later at a hearing    on February 15th  2005  I asked the VA Secretary if the President s budget was sufficient   He told me   I have many of the same concerns  and I end up being satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget         Mr  President  let s remember what was happening back at that time   I was hearing from veterans that they were facing delays in care and that the VA system was stretched to capacity   But the VA continued to say everything was fine        On March 8th  Secretary Nicholson told a House committee that the president s FY 2006 budget  quote  gives VA what it needs          I was hearing a much different story as I spoke with veterans around the country   That s why on March 10th  I offered an amendment in the Senate Budget Committee to increase veterans funding by 3  so we could hire more doctors and provide faster care to veterans   Unfortunately  Republicans said no        That same month  the VA s internal monthly reports showed that demand for healthcare was exceeding projections  That was another warning sign that the VA should have shared with us  but it didn t        On March 16th  Senator Akaka and I offered an amendment here on the Senate floor to increase veterans funding by  2 85 billion   Once again  Republicans said no         The next month  on April 5th  Secretary Nicholson wrote to Senator Hutchison saying     I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005         A week later  on April 12th  I offered two amendments on the Senate floor to boost veterans funding  First  I asked the Senate to agree that the lack of veterans funding was an emergency and that we had to fix  Republicans said no         Then I asked the Senate to agree that supporting our veterans was a priority   Again  Republican said no  As a result  veterans didn t get the funding they needed  and the deception continued         On June 9th  I asked Secretary Nicholson at a hearing if he had enough funding to deal with the mental health challenges of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   He assured me the VA was fine        So for six months we had happy talk that everything was fine with the VA   Then  in June    just two weeks after the Secretary s latest assurance    the truth finally came out    On June 23rd  the VA revealed a massive shortfall of  3 billion         I went to work my colleagues  and we came up with the funding   But we could have solved that problem much earlier and saved veterans the delays they experienced         By misleading us  the Bush Administration hurt America s veterans   We could have provided the money when it was needed   We could have been hiring the doctors and nurses we needed   We could have been buying the medical equipment that was needed   And we could have helped keep thousands of veterans off waiting lists for care        Here s the bottom line   The Bush Administration knew about a problem back in October 2004         They saw it getting worse  but they kept assuring us everything was fine   They worked to defeat my amendments to provide funding  and they didn t come clean until June 2005   That is unacceptable       Veterans Deserve Answers    I think America  s veterans deserve real answers   This report shows that the VA was not telling Congress the truth and was fighting those of us who were trying to help  We need to bring Secretary Nicholson before the Veterans  Affairs Committee so we can get some real answers   We need to ensure the VA does not repeat the same mistakes of the past two years   We owe that to our current and future veterans who sacrifice so much for us        Phony Savings for 4 Years    We need an explanation of why the VA misled us about so called  management efficiencies   The GAO found those alleged savings were nothing but hot air   This report clearly shows the Bush Administration misrepresented the truth to us for four fiscal years  through four budgets  and four appropriations cycles about these bogus savings   And when they could not make these efficiencies a reality  they took the funds from veterans  healthcare   That is unacceptable       The VA is Still Not Telling the Truth    The report also suggests that even in its latest quarterly reports to us    the VA is slow to report and does not provide key information we required    such as the time required for veterans to get their first appointment       Pentagon Failed to Provide Updated Information    Mr  President  the GAO report also says that the Department of Defense failed to provide the VA up to date information on how many service members would be separating from service and seeking care at the VA   That is really frustrating to me because I ve been asking every general who comes up here if they re doing enough to ensure a smooth transition from the Pentagon to the VA         In fact  on February 16th of last year  I questioned Secretary Rumsfeld directly  I got him to agree that caring for veterans is part of the cost of war    but he had no real answer when I asked why his request for the war did not include funding for veterans        VA Failed to Plan    Finally  the GAO report verifies that the VA failed to plan for the impact of the veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan       Rebuttal of Comments Raised by the Senator From Idaho    Mr  President  I d like to take a moment to respond in detail to some of the points my colleague from Idaho raised   He is a very dedicated and hard working advocate for America s veterans         At times  we may disagree on policy  but it is never personal  And it is my highest hope that whatever policy disagreements we may have will result in better service for America s veterans       Best Care Yes  But It s Inaccessible    The Senator from Idaho said that VA healthcare is the best care in the world   And I certainly agree as I said earlier   But too often  veterans are barred from that receiving that care and are put on waiting lists        For example in the VA Service Network that covers Alaska  Oregon  my home state of Washington and Senator Craig  s home state of Idaho  the VA states that there are over 10 000 veterans on waiting lists for their initial appointments   There are thousands more waiting for specialty care   Veterans in need are told to wait months before they can see a doctor         In fact    of the 21 regional Service Networks    the region that covers both Washington and Idaho is the worst at getting veterans primary and specialty care appointments within 30 days of the date requested   That data comes straight out of the VA  s own quarterly budget reports   It is not my interpretation         So great care is important  but making sure veterans can actually get timely access to that care is equally important  And that s an area where the VA is falling short        Quarterly Reports Are Late and Out of Date    The Senator from Idaho pointed out that we required the VA to submit quarterly reports on budget execution   He says we ve received three such reports this year   That s accurate   But what the Chairman did not say is what the GAO found   From page 5    and I quote            However VA s reports have not included some of the measures that would assist Congress in its oversight  such as measures of patient workload that would capture the costlines of patient care  and the time required for new patients to be scheduled for their first healthcare appointment   Moreover  while VA has 12 months to execute its budget  it did not submit its first two quarterly reports to Congress until nearly 2 months after the end of each quarter  using patient workload data that were as much as 3 months old at the time of submission         That is the GAO telling us that the VA s information was late and outdated   We need to demand better       False Standard of Care    Let me comment on another statement by the Senator from Idaho   He said that we ve had great success in delivering service to veterans  Then he said this    it doesn t mean that every veteran got exactly what they wanted the moment they asked for it          Mr  President  that s never been the standard   The question is this   Can veterans who need help get it when they need it        The evidence I ve seen suggests we ve got a long way to go   On Tuesday  I shared with the Senate the story of a soldier in Virginia who is back from serving our country in Iraq    He can t sleep at night so he called the VA for an appointment   They told him he d have to wait 75 days to see a doctor   That is unacceptable   Ensuring that veterans get timely care    especially for mental health services    is a dire need        Again  don t take my word for it   Remember what a VA undersecretary said in medical journal recently    that mental health care services are  virtually inaccessible  because of long waiting lines   So when we use a reasonable standard  it s clear we are falling far short of what our veterans deserve       VA Funding    The Full Story    Mr  President  Senator Craig said that during the last 6 years  the Administration and Congress has increased VA funding by 70  percent   But let me remind him that every step of way Congress had to fight the Administration for those increases         I know that we are putting more funding into the VA than we have historically   I have worked with my colleagues to fight for that funding   But let me remind my colleague from Idaho that we still have thousands of veterans waiting for primary and secondary care    or not being allowed to access care at all        The funding that this Congress has provided for the VA still does not provide enough to ensure that every veteran who is eligible can access care    The VA takes what Congress appropriates and then limits which veterans can access care to make the care the VA provides fit within the budget box Congress provides        Time and again  proposals for increased fees and copays are presented to discourage veterans from accessing VA care   I am happy to say we have fought off this Administration s efforts to put those increased fees and copays in place   But   at the same time    the Administration has limited access to the VA for Priority 7 and 8 veterans          The VA admitted that fees and copays within its fiscal year 2007 budget would discourage 200 000 enrolled veterans from accessing care  and another 1 1 million from enrolling at all   This is wrong   We need a real budget based on the real needs   Not one based on limited access and discouraging veterans from seeking the care they were promised       Oversight    Some  but Not Enough    The Senator from Idaho wanted to be very clear that he had called hearings and exercised oversight   I agree   He did   I was one of the people who pushed for those hearings   I was at those hearing   I demanded answers at those hearings         And one thing is clear    those efforts were not enough   We are still not getting straight answers from the VA   We are still getting out of date information   We still do not have a plan from the VA to care for the veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan         So yes  there were hearings    I think we d all agree that after a  3 billion error that hurt our veterans there better be hearings    but they were not enough  And we need more oversight and more accountability if we re going to make sure veterans don ot get hurt again       I Spoke Out When the Facts Emerged    The Senator from Idaho asked   why now   Why am I calling for more oversight now   Because the GAO just released its report   I didn t tell the GAO how long to take in its investigation   When it had the facts  it released them  and I spoke up immediately   In fact  I think the Senator from Idaho will remember the morning the GAO released its report I shared the results with our Veterans Affairs Committee at a public hearing         I thought everyone on the committee needed to know immediately that government investigators found the VA had not told us about the problems it knew about and that the VA is providing quarterly reports that are late and based on old information   Simply put  I spoke out when we got the facts        I would add that if anyone believes that my remarks on Tuesday are the first time I ve stood up and spoke out for our veterans    they just haven t had their eyes open over the past few years   And I would remind my colleagues that there is no moratorium on speaking out for our veterans   Whenever we learn facts that affect America s veterans  I m going to share them  and I m not going to stop speaking out until we in Congress do the right thing        We ll Be Back    Furthermore  unless we change the path we re on  we ll be talking about this issue next September  the September after that  and every month in between   This is not going away       Conclusion    So Mr  President  we in the Senate debate a lot of issues    none more significant than the issue of going to war   Mr  President  we are at war  and this body has a responsibility to meet our obligations in prosecuting that war    that includes taking care of our veterans   Today  we are not meeting that obligation   That s not just my opinion   It s the only conclusion a reasonable person could draw from the GAO report   And however inconvenient that may be    that is a fact         Mr  President  I repeat my conclusion from my remarks here on Tuesday   Veterans deserve better  and this Senate and America can do better
