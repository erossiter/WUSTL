                                           News Release          Senator Murray Votes Against Republican Budget Cuts Reconciliation Bill Would Cut Education  Healthcare  Agriculture and Pensions Today to Give Tax Cuts to the Wealthiest Tomorrow     Murray Opposes Splitting the Ninth Circuit and Drilling in ANWR    For Immediate Release  Friday  November 4  2005     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  voted against a Republican budget reconciliation bill that would cut  35 billion from America s priorities  reduce healthcare for the poor  cut agriculture support  undermine pensions  increase the federal debt  and allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge   Despite Murray s opposition  the bill passed the Senate 52 47         This budget has the wrong priorities   Murray said    I believe we should be providing greater investments in the tools that spur economic growth and help all Americans    education  health care  transportation  and job training  Unfortunately  the package before us today does just the opposite   It cuts  35 billion from areas like healthcare and education          Murray also said Republicans were cutting the budget this week to make way for a new round of tax cuts for the wealthy         Something is clearly out of whack   The Senate Leadership wants to impose painful cuts on average families today   Why   So that in a few weeks they can give massive tax cuts to the most well off   That is wrong   Murray said        The Republican budget package would cut healthcare for the poor by  27 billion   Senator Murray tried to improve the bill by offering an amendment to ensure that vulnerable Americans don t lose their drug coverage as the new Medicare prescription drug program is implemented in the coming months      Murray s       Murray s  Thursday on a procedural vote        Senator Murray s Statement on the Republican Budget Package Follows     Mr  President  to make our country strong again  we need to invest here at home  and that is why I oppose this budget   It s a bill that will cut  35 billion from America s priorities and burden our children with massive debt   Simply put  I think America can do better        Mr  President  I will vote against this flawed budget  just as I did in the Budget Committee last week  because it starves our highest priorities  Not only that  this bill opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling  which will not solve our energy problems   And I have serious concerns about a House proposal    which could be added to the House version of this bill    to split the Ninth Circuit into two smaller circuits         We Need to Invest in America    Mr  President  a budget is a statement of priorities   As I look at the challenges facing our country    and as I listen to people in my home state of Washington    it is clear that our top priority now must be making America strong again   To do that  we need to invest here at home       People Don  t Feel Secure    Today  too many people don t feel secure   They feel like they re one step away from losing their job or their pension or their healthcare   They re worried about high gas prices and how they re going to heat their homes this winter   They re worried about the men and women in uniform  who are returning home and can t find a job or healthcare   They re worried they won t be able to afford college tuition for their children   Mr  President  many people are worried about the new prescription drug program  which will make life harder for so many vulnerable families        Today people across America worry about being safe here at home   They look around their communities and see aging and unsafe highways  roads and bridges   After what happened in the Gulf Coast with Hurricane Katrina  they re worried their own communities are not protected   Mr  President  there is a coastline  or a volcano  or a fault line  or an aging dam in every state in this nation    and this budget doesn  t make the right investments in prevention or protection       Wrong Priorities    This budget has the wrong priorities   I believe we should be providing greater investments in the tools that spur economic growth and help all Americans    education  health care  transportation  and job training   In short  we should be making Americans more secure  Unfortunately  the package before us today does just the opposite   It cuts  35 billion from areas like healthcare and education        Cuts Today   Tax Giveaway Tomorrow    And what  s more  this is only the first step in the reconciliation process   You won  t hear much about it from the other side of the aisle  but in the coming weeks  the Senate is scheduled to take up the next piece of the reconciliation process    a massive tax giveaway that s even bigger than the cuts we re considering this week             So what s happening here today is we re being asked to make painful cuts for average Americans so that in a few weeks we can turn around and give massive giveaways to the most well off   That s what s really going on here         The massive tax cut package that s coming soon would give billions away to the richest people in our country   Multi millionaires and special interests will reap the benefits from these budget busting tax breaks  including capital gains and dividends tax breaks   In fact  the upcoming tax breaks exceed the spending cuts we  re considering this week by more than  30 billion   And who benefits   53 percent of the benefits of capital gains and dividends go to those with incomes greater than  1 million  Listen to the facts   On average  those who make more than  1 million would get tax cuts of more than  35 000  But those with incomes under  50 000 would get just  6         Something is clearly out of whack   The Senate Leadership wants to impose painful cuts on average families today   Why   So that in a few weeks they can give massive tax cuts to the most well off   That is wrong        Mr  President  today people are hurting on the Gulf Coast   People are concerned for their safety    be it by terrorist attack or flu epidemic and instead of meeting these important priorities  the Senate will cut spending  give away tax cuts  and increase the amount of debt each American owes          Taken together  these efforts represent the core values and priorities of the Republican Congress  but not of the American people   America can do better   The bill before us this week cuts important programs while doing almost nothing to address the real priorities facing our nation         Medicaid Cuts    First let me talk about Medicaid    a health care program  a safety net for our country s most vulnerable and sickest  This bill cuts Medicaid spending for those least among us by  27 billion   At the same time  Republican members of this body are refusing to take up and pass bi partisan Medicaid relief for Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina  they want to slash spending on the program here today         Agriculture Cuts    What about agriculture    programs that make sure we can feed our nation   This bill also cuts agriculture investments by  3 billion  and that will have a painful impact on our family farmers who are struggling today   Just last week  I sat down with farmers from Washington state  and I can tell you they are reeling from drought and high fuel and fertilizer prices   This bill makes their lives even harder by retracting the support that helps family farms get by and will impact our country s ability to ensure we will be able to feed our nation and keep our country strong   These farm families need our help  but Republicans just say no       Pensions    This bill also undermines the pension plans of millions of hard working Americans   This is a top anxiety for people everywhere I go   Is my retirement gone   What happened to my security        Mr  President  this bill will increase the financial burden on companies and drive more employers into bankruptcy and out of the defined benefit pension system   It more than doubles the Pension Benefit Guaranty premiums  and it will index those payments in the future          This budget we are debating today undermines the carefully crafted bipartisan pension reform bill that the HELP Committee bill recently passed unanimously   America s pension policy should be driven by what is best for American workers  retirees and employers  not by the need to meet an arbitrary budget target         Drilling in ANWR    And of course  Mr  President  this budget opens ANWR up to shortsighted drilling   This misguided effort is especially troublesome  and is worth a few minutes of time here on the Senate floor   Mr  President  we are all concerned about the high cost of energy   It s a tremendous burden for families  businesses and farmers   We should use that concern to make wise choices that will actually help our country   Instead  this bill takes shortsighted steps in the wrong direction   The responsible way to address our energy problems is to focus on long term solutions like reducing our need for oil  and investing in clean  renewable energy sources        I oppose drilling in ANWR because the potential benefits do not outweigh the significant environmental impacts   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important and unique national treasure   It s the only conservation system in North America that protects a complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems  It s the most biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge  And it s an important calving ground for a large herd of caribou  which are vital to many Native Alaskans  Energy exploration in ANWR would have a significant impact on this unique ecosystem         Further  development will not provide the benefits being advertised   Proponents claim that energy exploration has become more environmentally friendly in recent years   While that may be true  there are still significant environmental impacts for this sensitive region   Exploration means a footprint for drilling  permanent roads  gravel pits  water wells  and air strips  We recognize that our economy and lifestyle require significant energy resources  and we are facing some important energy questions  However  opening ANWR to oil and gas drilling is not the answer to our energy needs         And let s keep in mind that drilling in ANWR will not make us less dependent on foreign oil   As a nation  the only way to become less dependant on foreign oil is to become less dependant on oil overall   The oil reserves in ANWR are not enough to significantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil         There are better ways meet America s energy needs    including boosting fuel efficiency  expanding the use of homegrown renewable and alternative fuels  investing in new technologies like fuel cells  developing and deploying more energy efficient technologies  and improving conservation and energy efficiency   Drilling in ANWR is not a serious answer to our country s serious energy challenges  and it should not be included in this budget bill       This Budget Could Get Even Worse in Confernce    Now Mr  President  another reason I m voting against this bill is because it will clearly get much worse in conference    through steeper cuts in critical investments  This budget bill already cuts  35 billion from America s priorities   And on the House side  leaders are working to cut an additional  15 billion from infrastructure  education and healthcare   That would move this bill even further in the wrong direction       Splitting the Ninth Circuit    Finally  Mr  President  I m very concerned about a possible attempt in the House    which we may see next week    to split the 9th Circuit  As a member of the West Coast delegation  I strongly oppose this change        The House proposal is not warranted by the facts and is not supported by the judges on the circuit   Back in 1980  when Congress split the 5th Circuit  all of the judges supported that move  But today  that is not the case   I understand that a majority of judges on the 9th Circuit oppose the split   I ve spoken with some of them  and they ve said a split could create new problems        They pointed out that splitting the circuit would impose new costs for facilities  staff and administration   The efficiency we have today would turn to duplication tomorrow if the circuit is divided   There would be significant costs to establish a new circuit headquarters and to create a duplicate administration system   In an era of limited budgets  this makes little sense   As the Ranking Member on the subcommittee that funds the Judiciary  I know we don t have extra money to spend to duplicate administrative services        Mr  President  a split would also lead to a duplication of cases   Today  by deciding cases for 9 states  the circuit provides clear  uniform guidance to district courts   That prevents a duplication of cases   If the circuit is divided  issues decided in the new 9th Circuit would have to be decided again in the new 12th Circuit  doubling the use of judicial resources and costing even more money          And in addition to the massive cost associated with splitting the 9th Circuit  the change would split the West Coast Technology Corridor into two different circuits   That could have a paralyzing effect on IT and technology growth since there would be a weaker judicial foundation        Mr  President  I share my concerns about this because next week there may be an effort in the House of Representatives to attach the judicial provision to the House version of this bill   I want House members to know that as a member of the affected delegation    and as the Ranking Member of the subcommittee that funds the Judiciary    I oppose this change       Conclusion    So Mr  President  this budget plan has the wrong priorities and that is why I m voting against it  We need to make America stronger and invest here at home   This budget does just the opposite    cutting key investments in the things that our people need  Why   To have money for tax cuts for the wealthiest   America can do better   I urge my colleagues to reject these flawed priorities and work to invest in the things that will make our country and our people strong
