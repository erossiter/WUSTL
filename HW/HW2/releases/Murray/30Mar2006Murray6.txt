                                                                                                             News Release          Immigration  Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on the floor of the U S  Senate on Her Principles for Immigration Reform    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 30  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today took to the floor of the U S  Senate to share her perspective and priorities on immigration reform          According to Murray  a comprehensive immigration reform should do seven things         It should improve enforcement        It should treat the Northern border fairly        It should include a guest worker plan  which   includes a path to citizenship        It should provide a path forward so that people who are here have an opportunity to become citizens and realize the American Dream         It should protect the rights of victims and refugees         It should not turn into criminals those compassionate souls who care for their wounds  teach their children or feed their families         And finally  it should provide the resources to help families rise above their circumstances through education and training        Murray  s full remarks follow       Mr  President  the Senate is now engaged in a spirited debate about reforming our immigration policy   I rise today to share my perspective and my priorities          Let s remember that this isn t just about immigration   It s about the type of country we want to be  what we stand for  and what type of future we all want to build   It s easy to get caught up in the specifics of one policy or another  but I would encourage my colleagues to not lose sight of the bigger picture because this debate touches nearly every aspect of American life    from our economy to our security  and from our classrooms to our workplaces   I know there s a lot of pressure to  do something  about immigration especially in an election year   But if we do the wrong thing  it will have a painful affect on millions of families  on our economy  and on our future for generations to come   Let s take the time to get it right        Perhaps the biggest mistake we could make is to think that addressing enforcement alone will create the changes we want to see   Enforcement is important  but enforcement without investments in our people and communities will do little good          Mr  President  I approach this debate with a clear understanding of what s at stake  and frankly with some skepticism that Congress can achieve this delicate balance in a heated  political environment  but I m going to keep pushing for the right policies   Those policies are based on my personal experiences  on people who have shared their life experiences with me  and on the unique perspective that Washington state provides       Washington State Perspective    Washington state has a lot at stake in the debate over immigration reform  and I have led discussions around my state with key stakeholders who have experiences in areas like border security  labor needs  agriculture  education and housing that all help inform my perspective       Border    First  Washington is a border state  and we know the dangers of an insecure border   For years  I have fought federal policies that steered critical resources away from the Northern Border to the Southern Border   Year after year  I fought budgets that were biased against the needs at our Northern border   My border communities have struggled with inadequate staff  equipment and facilities   Tragically  it took the September 11th attacks to finally get the federal government to listen to what we d been saying all along    that you can t keep America secure if you shortchange the Northern border        Since then  we ve made some progress   I worked with Chairman Gregg and others to secure the money to triple the number of agents along the Northern border   I helped fund the Northern Border Air Wing in my state to patrol our skies and provide enforcement and surveillance   I should note that we still need to extend their patrol hours beyond 40 hours a week        We ve made progress  but not nearly enough   Just this week  we learned that federal investigators were able to smuggle parts for a dirty bomb across the Northern border into Washington state   That s unacceptable        As we ve increased enforcement at the Northern Border  new challenges have emerged   Federal agents are arresting more people for smuggling and other crimes   But the feds are just handing those suspects over to local officials for holding and prosecution   As a result  communities like Whatcom County are struggling to deal with a huge new burden of federal prosecutions   Whatcom County is spending  2 million a year to process federally initiated case   Whatcom County is not being reimbursed  but communities along the Southern border are   That s not fair  and it s something I m working to correct        So Washington state understands the importance of border security  and I believe that any bill we pass has to treat the Northern border fairly   Our communities need help to combat the scourge of drugs and violence that accompany rampant smuggling operations   And we cannot wait until a terrorist tries to move a dirty bomb across our Northern border       Agriculture    Washington state also has a great stake in how immigration reform affects one of our largest industries  agriculture   We rely on immigrants to harvest the crops that put food on our table and bring our state billions of dollars a year in economic activity          Last week in Moses Lake  Washington  I heard personally from farmers and orchardists who had to leave fruit on the trees last season because they could not get enough help to pick it fast enough   This costs our farmers and our entire state economy money   Already many farmers have told me that the 2005 season was the worst season they have had in trying to get the employees they needed   It s estimated 200 000 250 000 undocumented workers are living in Washington state   Note  corrected figure  Source     That means Washington state has one of the highest per capita concentration of undocumented workers of any state in the nation   We know how important laborers are for our economy         Schools    Washington state s public schools and universities are also impacted by our nation s immigration policies  I hope we can all agree that the children of immigrants deserve a decent education  which builds our communities and our economy    For years  I ve worked to increase educational opportunities for all students living in this country   I m a proud supporter of the Dream Act  which helps make higher education more accessible to the children of immigrants  I ve been proud to celebrate with young students through the Latino Educational Achievement Project and other organizations in my home state of Washington that break down barriers to education   Our educational policies have to ensure that immigrants and the children of immigrants are not denied the opportunity to share in the American Dream       Housing    Housing is another area that s connected or our immigration policy    Many communities in Washington state are struggling with a lack of affordable housing   That can mean families are trapped living in unsafe or substandard housing   We also have to address the housing challenges in agricultural communities   For several years  I ve been working on a farmworker housing initiative to help address a tremendous shortage of safe and affordable housing for the people who work on our farms       A Comprehensive Approach    All of these experiences    the Northern border  agriculture  education  labor needs and housing help inform my view on immigration policy   And I believe from that we need a holistic approach   Enforcement is important   Securing our borders is important  but if we leave out things like education and job training  if we ignore the tools that families need to rise above their circumstances and build a better life  we ll be missing the big picture  and we will be throwing away the ladders of success that generations of Americans have relied on to make their families and subsequently our country stronger       A Reform Bill Should Include    I believe that comprehensive immigration reform should do seven things         It should improve enforcement        It should treat the Northern border fairly        It should include a guest worker plan  which   includes a path to citizenship        It should provide a path forward so that people who are here have an opportunity to become citizens and realize the American Dream         It should protect the rights of victims and refugees         It should not turn into criminals those compassionate souls who care for their wounds  teach their children or feed their families         And finally  it should provide the resources to help families rise above their circumstances through education and training        So let me take a minute to talk about each of these priorities       1       Improve Enforcement    First  we should improve our enforcement   That means providing the personnel  equipment  facilities and resources to enforce our borders  In the wake of 9 11  security at our borders and enforcement of our immigration rules is now more critical than ever   That  s why I have pushed for years to hire more Border Patrol agents  deploy more resources along the border including the new Northern Border Air Wing  and to make sure we are using the latest technology to secure our nation  s borders   We must continue to make investments in securing our borders and protecting ourselves from those who seek to do us harm       2  Treat the Northern Border Fairly    Second  we have to treat the Northern border fairly   We won t be shortchanged again as we have been in the past   If we re going to secure our borders  we can t leave the Northern border behind       3  Guest Worker Plan     Third  immigration reform should include a guest worker plan to keep our economy moving forward  We have tremendous labor needs in our country  especially in labor intensive fields like agriculture          Our economy will not survive without access to the workers we need  and a responsible guest worker program can help address our country s economic needs    As one farmer in my state put it   We need reform  but we can t commit economic suicide in the process    I am a cosponsor of the bipartisan AgJobs bill  S 359    It allows current workers to earn citizenship  while setting up a guest worker program that would really work   I hope we can follow a similar path          But whatever we do  we can no longer tolerate a system that expects our farmers to be experts in document verification   Our farmers should not be turned into criminals   One option is to provide a way to electronically verify someone s identity   If we pursue that approach  we must not put a new financial burden on our farmers  who are just trying to follow the law and do the right thing   We have to establish a realistic system that allows employers to legally hire the help they need   Agriculture is not the only sector that would be affected by these proposals   It would also affect the construction and hospitality industry among others       4  Opportunity for Earned Adjustment    Fourth  immigration reform should provide hope and a path forward for a resident to be able to earn legal status       5   Protect Victims    Fifth  any legislation must protect the rights of victims and refugees to access the courts   You know  over the years  we have worked to protect victims and refugees  but if we enact an  expedited removal  process  we could undo all that work and cause tremendous human pain   We ve worked very hard through the Violence Against Women Act to protect victims no matter where they come from or what their legal status is   The Act allows victims of domestic violence to petition to stay in the United States   We should keep those humane protections in place       6  Don t Criminalize Advocates    Sixth  we should not make felons of those who seek to help the most vulnerable   Churches and other support groups should not be threatened with jail time for showing compassion toward anyone who needs help   It s not the job of hospital workers  teachers or priests to enforce our immigration laws nor should it be   We shouldn t block any emergency room doors  any classroom or any police station to the needs of all our residents       7  Invest in the Things that Help Families Succeed    Finally  we need to invest in the things that help immigrants and all Americans rise above their circumstances   I am concerned that many important issues are being left out of this debate   As leaders  it  s our duty to protect and foster the American Dream for all of our citizens  as well as those on the path to citizenship          We need to invest in primary and secondary education   All of our children should have the opportunity to become more successful than their parents   We need to invest in adult education and literacy programs   Immigrants on the road to earned adjustment should have the opportunity to improve themselves and learn the English language   We also need to invest in workforce training   All of our citizens should have the opportunity to increase their skills and earning power and achieve a greater share of the American Dream   We need to invest in healthcare and secondary education if this path to earned citizenship will truly allow all of our neighbors to participate in the American dream  while also allowing our economy to grow   We re not talking about charity for someone else   We re talking about investments that help every American family achieve their dreams       Let s Get It Right    Mr  President  throughout our history  the United States has been a beacon of hope for people throughout the world   That light shines as bright today as it ever has   As we work here to reform our immigration policy  let s make sure our actions reflect our security  our economy  and the opportunity that America offers generations of immigrants   Let s take the time to get this right   Our future depends on it
