Immediate Release  Friday  July 7  2006    I m so excited to welcome all of you to the 11th annual Senators  Trade Conference   I want to thank Bill Center for his leadership  our speakers for their insights  and our sponsors for their support   For more than a decade  we ve come together at this conference to discuss the most pressing trade issues of the day   This year  we re focusing on China and the road ahead         Frankly  I m very concerned about what I see happening in Washington  D C   Today there are loud calls for a drastic change in our relationship with China   That could have a painful impact on our state and our country   This morning  I want to share what I see happening  what we could lose  and what we need to do about it         I think the best way to make my point is to share two experiences I had   One was a personal tragedy the other an international incident   Both involved China  and both shaped my perspective on dealing with China       In the spring of 1997  I traveled to China on a trip with about 15 local leaders  including a few of you in this room   It was an incredible experience   But while I was there  I had a personal tragedy in my family   We d left Hong Kong and when we arrived in Beijing  I got a phone call through the U S  embassy   My father had become very ill  was taken to the hospital  and had passed away         A short time later  I got a phone call that a high ranking Chinese official would be visiting me to offer his condolences   That evening  an official from the Foreign Ministry knocked on my door   His name was Mr  Yang   He offered his condolences on behalf of the government and the people of China   But there wasn t anything bureaucratic about it    I was struck by how personal and sincere he was   This wasn t  China     a country on a map on a wall in a classroom   It was one person sharing his heartfelt sympathy with another person   It was a connection I  ll never forget          Now I want you to fast forward four years   On April 1st  2001  a U S  Navy plane was intercepted by Chinese aircraft in international waters outside China   A Chinese plane made a series of very close passes  On one of those passes  it hit the American plane   The Chinese pilot was killed  and the American crew had to make an emergency landing on a Chinese island   As you know  the U S  crew of 24 was based here in Washington state at the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station   The Chinese government held our crew on that island for many days   The incident created tremendous tension and outrage here in the U S     as it should    and it required very skillful diplomacy   Unfortunately  the Bush Administration stumbled at first   They ignored the things that we all know about dealing with China    the importance of words  of relationships  of saving face   Many in Congress were issuing demands and denunciations   None of those were helpful in getting our airmen back home         Since I represented those crew members in the Senate  and since I had a history of working with China  I thought it would be helpful to have a face to face meeting with the Chinese Ambassador in Washington  D C   On April 4th  the Chinese Ambassador arrived at my office in the Capitol   And who was the ambassador     Mr  Yang    the same man I d met years earlier in Beijing   Because we had a relationship  we had a very frank and productive discussion   I was very clear that China had to release our crew and aircraft immediately   He told me about China s concerns about its lost pilot and the unapproved emergency landing   I expressed my sympathy for the pilot s family and asked him to think of the families of our 24 crew members       At a time when many in Congress had slammed their door closed to China  my door was open   At a time when politicians were shouting threats across the ocean  I was having a face to face meeting that got to the heart of the matter   I m not suggesting that my meeting brought about their release   That took tremendous work by the State Department and a carefully worded letter from the U S  Ambassador   But it worked  and on April 14th  I stood in a hanger on Whidbey Island and welcomed the crew back home         That experience proves something that I ve seen time and again in working with China  relationships matter   Having an open door matters   There are going to be tragedies  disagreements  and conflicts  but with the Chinese  the way to resolve them is through discussion  not desk pounding  which brings me to my larger point       For 34 years  the road we ve pursued with China has been one of engagement   Along the way  there have been problems  but we ve worked through them by sitting down together  talking  and listening   On balance  that path of engagement has produced good results for our state  for our country  and for the Chinese people   But today  some influential voices in Congress are calling for us to pull off the road of engagement and drive in a different direction   Instead of conversation  they propose conflict   Instead of cooperation  they seek retaliation         There have always been some who seek a harder line with China  but what s really troubling is that these views are getting an eager hearing today   I think that s because for many Americans  China has become the symbol of all our fears about globalization    jobs being moved overseas and foreign markets that are closed to our products   And that means our country faces a choice          Do we stay on the road of engagement         Or do we change direction and move toward a more hostile relationship       My standard has always been to ask what s best for the United States    what s in our economic  strategic  military  and security interests   From my work with China over the years  I m convinced that engagement is the better course  and I m sure most of you agree         So the real challenge here is not    how do we talk across the ocean to the Chinese  but how do we talk across the political spectrum here at home   How do we reach those in our own government who want to change our approach to China   How are we going to persuade them that their interests are best served through engagement   I can tell you one thing   We re not going to win them over by telling them their concerns are not valid  They re frustrated  and their constituents are frustrated         So today I want to lay out some ideas about how we can influence the debate here in the U S  to help our country remain engaged with China   I care about this relationship because there  s so much at stake for our country and especially for our state      What s at Stake for Washington State     There s an old proverb that says   When two elephants fight  the grass loses    Friends  beneath the two huge powers of the U S  and China  Washington state is the grass   We re the place where the impact of that relationship is felt first and felt strongest   If there s a trade war or a conflict  we will pay the price in lost trade and lost jobs   We have to speak up because we have a tremendous stake in this relationship   That was shown this year when President Hu made our state the first stop on his trip to America   As you know  China is Washington s third largest and fastest growing trade partner   In 2004  our total trade was more than  20 billion   On a per capita basis  Washington trades more with China than any other state in the nation        It s not just about numbers   It s about a historic relationship   Senator Warren Magnuson took the politically risky step of advocating for normalized relations with China during the 1950  s at the height of the Red Scare and McCarthyism   Our own Port of Seattle was the first U S  port to receive a Chinese merchant vessel following the normalization of relations   Many of the people in this room helped lead the charge to grant permanent normal trade relations to China in 2000  And today  Washington state has one of the only state based councils focused on our relationship with China        What s at Stake for America     Engagement is also important because of the impact China will have on our country and on the world in the coming years   One in five people on earth live in China   Its population impacts everything from the world  s food supply  to pollution and the use of natural resources   For instance  China is currently using 60  of the world s concrete and 40  of the world s steel   That s causing shortages and rising prices around the world   China  s emergence as a major player on the world stage is one of the most consequential events in our lifetime  The future direction that U S  China relations take will have consequences that reach far beyond the borders of our two countries      North Korea   Just two days ago  we saw another reason why it s so important for the U S  to be engaged with China and other countries   While most of us were celebrating Independence Day  North Korea tested several missiles    including one that could be capable of reaching the U S   While that test failed  I consider North Korea s actions a threat to the United States and to the region   I strongly condemn these provocative missile launches   We need to work with other nations and with groups like the U N  to mount a serious response   As North Korea s largest benefactor  China is critical to our efforts   Over the years  the Bush Administration has not paid enough attention to North Korea  and I hope they ll seize this opportunity to develop an effective strategy to deal with this threat   Whatever we do  China will have an important role to play  and that s why I think we re better off working with China and the international community to protect our interests      Different View on China     Unfortunately  not everyone in this country sees China in the same light   Where many of you see China as your company  s most promising growth market  others see Chinese imports as their biggest competitive threat   In communities across the U S   families and workers view China with suspicion  as an unscrupulous competitor and the source for their economic insecurity         Trade doesn t occur in a vacuum   Today Americans don t feel secure about their future   They re worried they ll lose their jobs  their pension  or won t be able to send their kids to college   Today  China is becoming what Japan was in the 1980  s  the foreign scapegoat for our nation  s economic fears        Unfortunately  this line of thinking can be heard more and more in the halls of Congress today   I see a very troubling divide between those who want to take us down a path full of acrimony and instability and those of us who want to stay on the path of engagement    so that China can become  as former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick put it   a responsible stakeholder         Five Steps     So how do we deal with those calling for more conflict   Let me offer five ideas        One  Listen     First  we ve got to approach those at home the same way we approach China    with an open door   We need to listen   We need to acknowledge that their frustrations have merit   We need to show that we share their concerns  and we do       I m concerned about China s undervalued currency and want to see it higher    I m concerned about its inadequate work protecting intellectual property   I m concerned about the massive trade deficit   I m concerned about opening China s markets   I m concerned about human rights  workers  rights  and the challenges China faces protecting the environment   And I m concerned about the alliances they are developing with regimes like Sudan and Iran as a result of their escalating energy needs   So the first step is to have a dialogue with those who are concerned and to show that we genuinely share their concerns      Two  Press China and Get Results     Second  we ve got to use our open door with China to make progress on those issues    Getting results is what will persuade skeptics that engagement is more effective than isolation   Engagement does not mean you roll over  It does not mean you pull punches   It means you make your case aggressively and that there is someone across the table from you who s listening   You can yell until you re blue in the face  but if there s no one there to listen  what can you accomplish   The truth is that China is going to grow and develop and stumble and find its way   We can be there at her side throughout that process sharing our point of view  raising our concerns  and influencing the outcome    Or we can give up our seat at the table  yell into the air  and hope for the best   From my experience  engagement is the better course   So to win over skeptics  we ve got to use our open door with China to get results on the issues people care about      Three  Hold China Accountable     Third  we need to hold China and our other trading partners accountable for the deals they make    Too often when we reach a trade deal  we open the U S  market the next day  but our trading partners take forever to open their markets   When that happens  we need to stand up for ourselves   Engagement can help us do that   Engagement makes China have to play within a rules based system   As you will all recall  we worked very hard to help China accede to the WTO   Now we have a forum to pursue our concerns about intellectual property and other trade issues that may come up in the future  The U S  has already filed a case against China on auto parts  and I expect that we could have a trade case on intellectual property in the future       Four  Make America Stronger   More Competitive     Fourth  we ve got to make America stronger so we re less threatened by foreign competition   That means investing in education  in worker training  and in jobs here at home   My background is in education  so I m very troubled to see our kids are far behind the rest of the world in reading  math and science   As Tom Friedman has said  when I was growing up  at dinnertime my parents used to tell us to clean our plates  because there were starving children in China and India   Today  American parents are more likely to tell their kids that they better do their homework after dinner because that s what the kids in China and India are doing   I think we ve got to invest in our high schools   Our high school graduation rate is 68 percent   When kids don  t graduate and aren t prepared for work or college  our country falls further behind   That s why I ve introduced a bill called the PASS Act   It targets math and reading and helps students plan for college and the workforce       We also need to invest in workforce training and apprenticeship programs so that as jobs change  we ve got local workers with the right skills to fill in demand jobs   And we need to renew and make permanent the research and development tax credit  which expired last year   All of these steps will help make America stronger at home so that we can compete around the world and so we re less vulnerable to changes in the global economy      Five  Reach Out     Finally  we ve got to reach out   As you know  Senators Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham called for retaliatory tariffs on China if it didn  t change its currency policy   In March  those two Senators visited China  and they came back with a more nuanced message   They realized it wasn t as black and white as it had seemed from their home states or from the U S  Capitol building    And I give them a great deal of credit for being willing to go to China  meet with their counterparts  and have an open discussion   Those are the types of exchanges that we need more of        My Upcoming Trip to China     In that spirit  I m going to travel to China in the coming weeks with Members of Congress from both parties to continue the open dialogue that serves our country so well       So friends  we ve got work to do   The path of engagement that we ve been on for decades is now under attack within our own government   If we sit back and assume someone else will take care of it  we re going to lose jobs  economic growth  and eventually the way of life we have come to enjoy in the Pacific Northwest        We in Washington state have a special role to play   We know what good relations with China means for our community and for our future    So I want to encourage you help me make the case by listening to those who have real concerns  by using our open door to get results  by holding China accountable for the agreements it makes  by making America stronger so we re less vulnerable to foreign competition  and by reaching out to strengthen the relationships we know are so important       And by the way  when I get to China  you can bet I m going to call upon my friend  Mr  Yang
