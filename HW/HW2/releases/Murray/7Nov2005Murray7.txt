                                      News Release          Murray Disappointed by Cuts to Hanford Cleanup Bush Administration s Targeting of Vit Plant as a  Lower Priority Project  Undermined Funding Effort in Congress   100 Million Cut Could Result in Layoffs  Higher Costs and Missed Construction Milestones    For Immediate Release  Monday  November 7  2005     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  expressed her disappointment that the federal government will cut funding for the vitrification plant by  100 million in Fiscal Year 2006          The cut was part of the FY 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill  which was passed by a joint House Senate conference committee today   Next the bill goes to the full Senate and House for final passage and will then be sent to President Bush        Murray has consistently argued that cleaning up Hanford is a national obligation given the Tri Cities  role in helping America win World War II and the Cold War   Murray expressed frustration with the Administration for proposing in February  64 million less the contractor s contract calls for and then for designating the vitrification plant a  lower priority project  in the President s Katrina Supplemental just two weeks ago         The White House and Energy Department say they support this project  but the Vit Plant was the only Energy Department project targeted for cuts in the President s supplemental two weeks ago   Actions speak louder than words   Murray said    The White House called the vit plant a  lower priority project    How can cleaning up the most polluted site in our country be deemed a low priority         First the Administration proposed under funding Hanford by  64 million in President Bush s February budget   Then on October 28th  the White House sent Congress a list of  lower priority projects  that it proposed to cut in order to fund the Administration s Katrina supplemental package   Only one project was targeted for cuts in the entire U S  Department of Energy budget     100 million from the Vit Plant        The funding cut will likely result in layoffs  construction delays  and higher costs to complete the project   The funding cut will also likely cause the project to fall behind schedule and to fail to meet Tri Party Agreement milestones        Murray said it is now up to the Administration to show it will honor its commitment by supporting funding that will get the project back on track        The Hanford budget  as approved by the conference committee today  follows       Hanford Site FY 2006  all

given the allocation and given the level of support by the Administration   I am particularly concerned about some specific levels within the bill  like funding for our nation  s Environmental Management program within the Department of Energy  s clean up responsibilities   Specifically  the Waste Treatment Plant  or Vitrification Plant  at the Hanford site is one of those nationally important projects  The Hanford Site played a critical role in support of national security efforts in WWII and the Cold War   As a result  tens of millions of gallons of radioactive waste was left behind  It is the obligation of the US government to clean up that site and the Department of Energy identified the Vit Plant as the flagship project in that clean up effort        Officials at DOE claim the administration is 100  dedicated to the project   Actions speak louder than words   The request for this fiscal year was  64 million below necessary funding  according to the Department  s own out year projections   On top of that  the supplemental package sent to Congress came with rescissions for   lower priority    programs including a  100 million cut for the Vit Plant  How can cleaning up one of the most polluted sites in our country be deemed a lower priority  Given this lack of support from the Administration  I understand how difficult the project is to defend this year  and understand the hesitation on the part of this subcommittee to go beyond the official request by this White House        And while the cuts to the funding are deep  and while I have deep concerns about what they will mean for our nation  s commitment to cleaning up this dangerous waste  it could have been worse   I  d like to specifically thank Senator Reid and his staff for his last minute assistance in limiting the cuts to the Vit Plant  and I would like to thank the Chairman for being receptive   When I met with Senator Reid last week he shared my concern for this project and together we were able to fight back additional cuts  I will continue to support the clean up efforts at the Hanford Site
