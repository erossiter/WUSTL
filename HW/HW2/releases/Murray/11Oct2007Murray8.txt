                    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 11  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  led a bipartisan group of 14 U S  Senators writing to Michael Wynne  Secretary of the Air Force  urging him to resist pressure to change the current strategy for replacing its aging fleet of aerial refueling tankers  In their letter  the Senators urged the Air Force to choose a single tanker manufacturer to ensure that the taxpayers get the best value for their money  The Senators said that an alternative policy  known as the split buy strategy  is fundamentally flawed because it is impractical and unnecessarily expensive  Through the split buy strategy  tankers would be purchased from two manufacturers  The Senators  however  say that buying two kinds of tankers would dramatically increase costs for research and development  maintenance  training and infrastructure  A process that guarantees the procurement of two tankers removes all benefits associated with a competitive process by guaranteeing business to potential manufacturers  the Senators wrote  This would eliminate any incentive for these manufacturers to maximize efficiencies in the development of a product that ensures taxpayers and the Air Force the best value  In fact  a split buy approach would likely lead to higher costs to the Air Force over time   At a time when our countrys national debt continues to grow  we must do all we can to ensure that we are utilizing taxpayer resources responsibly  Senator Murray was joined on the letter by Senator Pat Roberts  R KS

2007 The Honorable Michael Wynne  Secretary  United States Air Force  1690 Air Force Pentagon  Washington  D C  20330 Dear Secretary Wynne  As the Air Force moves forward in its selection process to replace its aging fleet of aerial refueling tankers  we write to express our strong support for your current acquisition strategy that will result in the selection of one tanker  not two  This selection process must be rigorous and represent a fair and open competition to ensure that the Air Force and the American taxpayer receive a product that provides the best value in meeting the specific needs of the warfighter  A split buy replacement strategy has been well debated as government  industry and indeed the American public strives to identify the best policy to replace our aging aerial refueling tanker fleet  Under the split buy proposal  the Air Force and the Department of Defense would simultaneously develop  test and procure two tanker aircraft  Proponents assert that this policy would reduce costs through enhanced competition and expand operational flexibility to the Air Force  We find these assertions to be fundamentally flawed  To the contrary  a process that guarantees the procurement of two tankers removes all benefits associated with a competitive process by guaranteeing business to potential manufacturers  This would eliminate any incentive for these manufacturers to maximize efficiencies in the development of a product that ensures taxpayers and the Air Force the best value  In fact  a split buy approach would likely lead to higher costs to the Air Force over time  Due to the size and duration of the planned procurement  as well as the anticipated multi decade service of the new fleet  a true cost assessment of recapitalization must include the initial purchase price as well as the lifecycle cost of operating and sustaining the tanker fleet  According to experts within the Air Force  as well as prominent industry and policy analysts  procurement of two refueling tankers would undoubtedly lead to a dramatic increase in research and development  maintenance  training and infrastructure costs  If the Air Force moves to retire aging KC 135 R and E models as well as its KC 10s  while concurrently phasing in two new tankers  the agency would be forced to shoulder the costs of maintaining five aircraft systems as opposed to four  Loren Thompson  a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute  states that Sustaining two different lineswould raise the Air Forces acquisition costs by well over a billion dollars annually compared with just running one line At a time when our countrys national debt continues to grow  we must do all we can to ensure that we are utilizing taxpayer resources responsibly  In addition to increased costs  a split buy scenario will delay delivery of these vital assets  Under the current procurement schedule  the Air Force will acquire between 12 and 14 tankers annually  While officials within the Air Force have expressed the desire to accelerate this schedule to more rapidly replace the current fleet  under a split buy  scarce resources will be divided between two systems resulting in inefficient production rates due to a loss of economies of scale  The result would mean increased tanker modernization costs and a delay in the development and delivery of new tankers  Lastly  a split buy will compromise the operational flexibility of the Air Force  Under this proposal  the Air Force would be forced to coordinate the utilization of a fleet of tankers with vastly different capabilities  operational requirements and infrastructure needs  This would exacerbate already existing logistical challenges and compromise the agility of the Air Force in responding to rapidly evolving conditions and needs  These inefficiencies would reduce the safety of our service men and women and that is simply unacceptable  For these reasons  we strongly believe that competition for a single tanker replacement represents the most appropriate approach to recapitalizing the tanker fleet  Therefore  we strenuously oppose any attempt to change the current acquisition strategy to facilitate a dual procurement or split buy approach  We appreciate your efforts  and those of Assistant Secretary Payton and General T  Michael Moseley  in working to publicly set the record straight that the on going KC X Tanker competition is for one tanker  not two  Thank you for your consideration and for your continued support and advocacy of this policy
