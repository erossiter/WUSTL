Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 21  2006     Washington  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today joined with her eight fellow Democratic female Senators on Capitol Hill to announce the    initiative  The initiative calls on Senate Republicans to focus on an agenda that reflects the priorities of average Americans over the final 50 days of the legislative session         It is not too late for the Senate to begin to actually address the critical issues that face this country   said Senator Murray   I have veterans asking what we are doing about giving them better access to heath care  and parents asking about the difficulties they face in sending their kids to college  It is high time we start focusing on their concerns and start moving the country forward  We cannot afford to spend any more time on the divisive issues that the leadership continues putting forth for purely political reasons         During the event  the nine Senators introduced a    featuring nine challenges that Congress should take up  The checklist was also prominently featured in a letter the women sent to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist            The checklist of priorities includes          Safeguarding America s pensions        Keeping good jobs in America        Making college Affordable for all        Protecting America and its military families        Preparing for future disasters        Making America energy independent        Making small business healthcare affordable        Investing in life saving science  and       Protecting our  land  air and water          Senator Murray focused her remarks on protecting America s veterans           Our military men and women and their families are sacrificing every day for all of us   added Senator Murray   But on this issue  the GOP leadership has failed miserably         Today  we challenge the Republican leadership to demand a real budget from the VA  including the real cost of caring for our veterans  Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue  it  s an American issue        Senator Murray s Full Remarks During the Announcement Follow     Our military men and women and their families are sacrificing every day for all of us  We must honor that sacrifice be it with jobs  training  support or healthcare  but on this issue  the GOP leadership has failed miserably        Today  the VA is seeing 38 percent more Iraq War veterans than they budgeted for  Those veterans are waiting over a year to get the specialty care they deserve  In Seattle alone  we have VA medical centers with over 2000 veterans on waiting lists to get an initial doctors  appointment  Some are waiting over 18 months just to get their benefits          Iraq War vets are coming home  losing their jobs  not getting medical care  living without benefits  and struggling to just get by  Recently  a VA undersecretary noted that some VA clinics don t provide mental health care  or if they do  waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible   Service members  veterans and their families deserve more than waiting lists and  virtually inaccessible  care          We all voted to make 2006 the year of transition in Iraq   I hope it is a year of change for our veterans and military families as well  I was disappointed that my amendment for emergency funding for the VA was stripped from the supplemental bill  That s why  on Monday  I introduced the amendment again as stand alone legislation and included needed dollars to cover the initial cost of helping the VA deal with its data theft  Our veterans should not face a double whammy with the VA using already scarce healthcare dollars to pay for this breach         Our service men and women deserve a new direction   So  today  we challenge the Republican leadership to demand a real budget from the VA  including the real cost of caring for our veterans and to do right by our veterans and military families by holding hearings on the holes in transition assistance and mental health programs         Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue  it  s an American issue        We call on this Congress to do the most patriotic thing we can do  fulfill our promise to care for America  s veterans and military families
