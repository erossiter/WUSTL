                                                                  News Release          Senator Murray Announces Plan to Help Schoolchildren of Military Personnel    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 1  2005         Lakewood  WA      Today at Woodbrook Middle School in Lakewood  Senator Patty  to help schoolchildren of military personnel   Murray was joined by the Mayor of Lakewood  students  teachers  parents  counselors  and the superintendents from Clover Park  Central Kitsap and Bethel school districts         As Washington s military bases gain and lose personnel due to deployments and the Pentagon s new realignment plan  schools near military bases    and the children of military personnel    are being impacted           Some school districts  including Bethel and Central Kitsap  will have to cope with a dramatic and rapid increase in enrollment   They will need to hire new teachers and find new classroom space quickly    under tight budgets and without any additional federal support   Other school districts  such as Clover Park  will lose hundreds of students and be forced to close schools  greatly disrupting local communities           In addition  studies show that children of military personnel often struggle academically while their parents are deployed overseas   These students need additional counseling and support  but many schools are not equipped to provide that support          To address those challenges  Senator Murray wrote a plan to minimize the impact of these military changes on local schools and students   Her plan will also ensure that children of military personnel get the monitoring  support and counseling they need so they don t fall behind          Senator Murray s remarks follow      I am proud to be here today to talk about an issue near to my heart and critically important to communities across our state    helping our schools and our students succeed during a time of war         While our entire country has been impacted by the effects of September 11th and our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  military children have born a unique burden   Children of military families deal with special challenges at home and at school   We know that children under the stress of deployment are affected academically  socially  and emotionally         Imagine having to study for a math test or try out for the basketball team while also dealing with the impacts of a mom or dad who has been deployed  or has come home seriously injured or with post traumatic stress disorder or   the unthinkable happens   and that parent does not come home         Since our children spend the majority of their days at school  these challenges have become the challenges of schools like Woodbrook Middle School and their teachers  academic counselors and student bodies           But many of our schools and school districts don  t have the resources or tools necessary to deal with the increased counseling  discipline and tutorial costs associated with students who fall behind academically or are dealing with the emotional effects of a military conflict          And for many of our schools these challenges are brand new          School districts across Washington state and particularly here    close to Ft  Lewis and McChord    have had to deal with these new challenges as they have seen dramatic changes in enrollment due to  deployments  force structure realignments and the continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan         For example  the 4th Stryker Brigade has been moved to Fort Lewis  bringing over 1 000 school age children into the Bethel School District           This was an unforeseen realignment and the schools don  t have the capacity to handle this influx on their own   With force realignment due to overseas base closures  both McChord Air Force Base and Fort Lewis are prime candidates for adding personnel           So  Bethel is now facing an influx of students with emotional  academic and behavioral challenges without the proper resources to help their new students          We are seeing similar impacts in the Kitsap school districts   The Kitsap school districts are the most military impacted school districts in the state   The BRAC announcement just two weeks ago told us that we will have 1 400 new positions added to Bremerton   These positions will mean more students entering Kitsap schools   We need to provide the resources to help these new students to succeed          That is why  when the Senate returns to D C   I will introduce an amendment to the Defense bill to help school districts like Bethel deal with their changing enrollments and the needs of their students         My amendment will authorize the Secretary of Defense to provide funding for school districts like Bethel to provide more counselors  tutoring  and teacher training in how to identify and respond to emotional needs common in children who have a parent in wartime deployment         My bill will also help districts who are losing students due to deployments and realignments    as is the case for Clover Park school district         When soldiers deploy for the Middle East  their families often leave the military base communities to return to their comfort zone and support network   Sometimes that means moving back to their home town    sometimes that means moving to be closer to other relatives           The end result is that schools near the military bases have their impact aid funding reduced  when many of the children are likely to return         Another issue we are facing is due to the elimination of more than 300 on base housing units at McChord Air Force Base  through the Military Housing Privatization Program           There is very little off base housing currently available within the school district that educates these children           Consequently  this single proposal is projected to         Cost the Clover Park School District over  1 million in Impact Aid funding      Cause the closure of at least one school  and      Force the remaining children    many of them military dependents    into overcrowded classrooms         My amendment will authorize funds for these school districts to make sure that they do not lose federal funding because of a sudden and dramatic decline in students from military families         We need to help bolster these schools in hard times and make sure that the students who remain are not forced into overcrowded classrooms because the school districts can no longer afford to pay enough teachers         I have been all across our state and the one thing I hear over and over again from Washington residents is    tell our troops that we support them and their families           Our communities here in Washington have been great  supportive places for our military families to be           I  ve heard stories about neighbors helping mothers who have been left alone get their grocery shopping done or watch the children           Just a few weeks ago I gave an award to a father from Yakima who had lost a son in Iraq  but he used his own tragedy to motivate to start a foundation that provides scholarships for the children of fallen service members   And tonight  I will present a Purple Heart medal to a young man from Renton who was severely injured in Iraq         There are so many ways in which individuals and communities are stepping up to help in times of stress  but our communities also need help from our federal government   The burden of our military children is one that as adults  community leaders  teachers and politicians  we must try to alleviate   That is what I will fight for with my amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill in the Senate and that is what our leaders and school administrators are trying to do here on a daily basis
