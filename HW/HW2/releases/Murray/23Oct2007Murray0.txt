Senate Spending Bill that Invests in Washington state Health Care  Education  and Workforce Priorities  Bush Threatens Veto    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  October 23  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  voted to pass the Senate Labor  Health and Human Services and Education  LHHS  Appropriations bill that funds critical health care  education  and helps build a skilled workforce in Washington state  The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 75 19  President Bush has threatened to veto the bill  In a statement  Senator Murray  a member of the LHHS Appropriations Subcommittee   urged passage of the bill  discussed the valuable investments the bill makes in Washington state  and denounced the President s threat to veto the bill  This bill is about making sure families have access to health care and that children get a good education  It supports cutting edge research  helps build a skilled workforce  and ensures that crucial services are in reach for people who need them most  Senator Murray said  Unfortunately  President Bush thinks these common sense priorities are  irresponsible and excessive   Whats  irresponsible and excessive  is the Presidents veto threat  The  11 billion increase included in this bill represents just a fraction of the  190 billion in spending he wants this year for Iraq and Afghanistan  At the same time that the President is waging a costly war overseas  he is also waging war on funding for priorities here at home  The LHHS bill contains critical funding for Washington state including funding for   Job training and technical and career education programs Early childhood education programs including Head Start Research for life saving treatments including revolutionary cancer treatments School reforms  student support systems  teacher preparation and Community health centers  To read more about critical projects included in this bill in your area click on any of the links below    Health Care       Labor        Education                                                                                                                      Senator Murray s full statement follows   Mr  President  this bill is about making sure families have access to health care and children get a good education  It supports cutting edge research  helps build a skilled workforce and ensures that crucial services are in reach for people who most need them  Most important  it gives Americans hope that their government is working for them  These programs help every family and every community  They are priorities for me  I know they are priorities back home  So I want to thank Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their leadership and important work on this bipartisan bill  Mr  President  these programs SHOULD be priorities for this Administration  too  Veto Threat  Unfortunately  President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation  He opposes this bill because it represents an increase over his requested budget  He says its irresponsible and excessive  Yet the  11 billion increase over the Presidents request represents a fraction of the  190 billion in emergency spending he wants this year for Iraq and Afghanistan  Its less than the  10 billion he spends in Iraq in one month alone  As the President has waged war overseas  our education  job training  and health systems have been left to cope with unfunded mandates and empty promises  Mr  President  that  not this bill  is whats irresponsible and excessive  This bill simply restores some of the money the President cut and takes a modest step forward after years of going in the wrong direction  Among other things  this bill boosts American competitiveness by investing  4 8 billion in job training and career  and technical education when the President would have cut these programs by more than  1 billion  It adds  1 billion to expand critical research at the National Institutes of Health  reversing years of stagnant budgets  And it strengthens education and health care by providing money for Head Start  school improvement  and community health centers  Health Care for Working Families  Mr  President  this bill recognizes how important access to quality health care is for working families  While the Presidents budget neglected the uninsured and those with limited access to health care  the Senate bill invests an additional  250 million over the Presidents request in the community health center program  This will help those families get medical care without having to seek it in the emergency room  We have all heard stories about how overburdened emergency rooms are by patients who seek care there because they dont have health insurance or are under insured  But access to a doctor can prevent a childs ear ache from turning into a serious infection  And it can make sure a father gets screening and preventive care so that he doesnt develop a serious and expensive form of cancer  Health Care Workforce  This bill also makes investments in another critical health care concern  making sure we have enough doctors and nurses and other health care professionals  Two weeks ago  I heard about it again in roundtables I held across the state  This bill provides  357 million for the Health Professions and Nursing Programs to recruit and hire new health care professionals  thats  242 million over the Presidents proposal  Of this   169 million is for nursing education  Thats  20 million over last years level  Our nurses are the front line of care in hospitals and nursing homes  And this will help address the serious nursing shortage we already face  Its also important that we provide opportunities and encouragement for students who want to go into nursing so that we can replace these retiring caregivers and meet the increasing demand for nursing care  Mr  President  I applaud the committee for recognizing this looming concern  and I repeat that the time to invest in our health care system is now  before these problems become an urgent issue  We cant afford to wait  Research  Mr  President  this bill also supports our scientists and our biotech industry by funding landmark research  The Presidents budget would have eliminated hundreds of research grants from the National Institutes of Health  money that could lead to cures or treatments for cancer  MS  and diabetes  among other diseases  This is on top of years of inadequate funding for NIH  The Senate bill adds  1 billion for NIH funding nationally  This allows scientists at prestigious universities  including the University of Washington  to continue their innovative medical and biotech research  It also will provide hope for people with serious diseases  hope that they wont have if this research is cut off because of lack of funding  Education  We have heard the President say that education is one of his top priorities  Thats why its so frustrating to me that he is threatening to veto this bill  I am committed to ensuring federal funds are there to help build and improve our nations schools  Strong schools make strong communities  We want everyone in this country to have a promising future and a promising job  and education is how you get there  The Senate bill supports increased funding for Pell Grants that help kids afford college when they might not otherwise have had a chance to get a college degree  It increases funding for school improvement by  500 million  It sends  1 billion in badly needed money to help schools in low income communities raise childrens achievement levels and provide more opportunities for learning  And it reverses the Presidents proposed  100 million cut to Head Start  As a mom  a former pre school teacher  and school board president  I saw first hand that giving kids a boost early on can pay off in the future  Reaching kids early makes them more likely to graduate and succeed  This isnt frivolous spending  The money we spend on education today will help children grow into better educated  better prepared workers  Labor  Mr  President  providing Americans with the skills they need to excel in the global economy while keeping them safe on the job are very basic needs that every working family has the right to expect from their government  Thats why I continue to be baffled by the Administrations lack of commitment to workers in our nation  With strong bi partisan support for this bill  the Senate is proud to stand with working families and support the priorities that shape their daily lives  When I travel around my home state of Washington  employers tell me theyre desperate to find workers with the skills they need to grow their businesses  And we have thousands of people on waiting lists hoping to get trained for these family wage jobs  Yet for the last seven years  the President has proposed hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts for job training programs  shutting the door to millions of dislocated workers  youth and disadvantaged adults who deserve to share in the American dream  Under his watch  worker safety on the job has also been put at risk  With OSHAs lack of enforcement  workers are unprotected  And todays miners continue to work under an Administration that values voluntary compliance above safety and enforcement  Mr  President  this is the wrong direction for working families and the wrong priority for America  How do we begin to solve it  Well  one thing is clear  it isnt by cutting  1 billion dollars in job training funds at a critical time in our economic growth  as the President has proposed  Nor is it by proposing hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to job training programs  as he has done over the last seven years  Mr  President  this bill rejects the Presidents misguided cuts goes to great lengths to maintain a viable workforce and training system  If we want our local businesses and our nation to be competitive in the global economy  we must make skills training for every worker a national priority  And this bill does that  Conclusion  Mr  President  for some here in the Senate  this might be an abstract debate about federal funding  But this debate about real people  Its about 30 kids in a classroom and a teacher struggling to make sure they succeed  Its about hardworking parents searching for a way to get health care for their families when it isnt provided by their employers  And its about workers who need training that will help them get a job that pays enough to support a family  When I travel around Washington state  people tell me they want hope and change  Whether its the war in Iraq  or gas prices  or access to health insurance  people feel a real weight on their shoulders  Theyre looking for a light at the end of the tunnel  and by vetoing these important bills  and failing to invest in the health  safety and economic future of all Americans  the President keeps putting out that light  Mr  President  in this bill  we are investing more than  7 billion over last year in the future of our country  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation on behalf of the millions of American children and families who would benefit  And I hope the President is listening
