                                                     News Release          Murray Sends Letter to President in Advance of Budget Release Senator lays out hopes for budget priorities  urges focus on veterans    nuclear waste cleanup  port security  healthcare    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 1  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today released a letter to President Bush urging him to properly fund the priorities of Washington state residents and America  s working families in his Fiscal Year 2007 budget   The President is expected to submit his budget request to Congress early next week          This budget must not repeat the mistakes of the past fiscal year and must include the priorities that are so important to my constituents     Murray said in the letter     This budget should also begin the process of restoring fiscal responsibility to the Congressional budget process   The assumptions of spending  revenue and economic growth should be honest and not used to hide the true deficit or the real costs of war           In her letter  Murray focuses on previously underfunded priorities like veterans   health care  Hanford cleanup  and port security   Murray also presses the President to increase investments in education  transportation infrastructure and housing and urges an end to short sighted Medicaid cuts          What the President said during the State of the Union matters much less than what he does next week when he sends his budget to Congress   That budget is a document of values  and it will tell us if he is investing in the future of America or just giving us more of the same     Murray said         The full text of Senator Murray  s letter to the President follows                                                                         President George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  D C   20500    Dear President Bush        As you prepare to submit your Fiscal Year 2007 Budget to Congress  I am writing to urge you to ensure that this budget meets the priorities of working families in my home state of Washington   This budget must not repeat the mistakes of the past fiscal year and must include the priorities that are so important to my constituents          This budget should also begin the process of restoring fiscal responsibility to the Congressional Budget process   The assumptions of spending  revenue and economic growth should be honest and not used to hide the true deficit or the real costs of war       Veteran  s Health Care    One of the most important things we can do for national security is to guarantee that our troops have the services and protections they have been promised while defending our country   This commitment cannot stop once these troops return home   We must honor their service and the sacrifice they made by fully funding VA health care   As you know  I have consistently fought for increased funding for the VA   I had heard from my constituents that care was delayed or even denied due to budget constraints   While I was hearing about these problems in Washington State  I was being told in Washington  DC  that there was no shortage of funds and that all veterans who needed care were receiving care   It was no surprise to me when the VA finally announced late last year that they were in fact running out of money          Once the shortage was finally acknowledged  the Senate did act quickly and in a bipartisan manner to adopt my amendment providing emergency funding to the VA   But  we must learn from this experience and fully fund our commitment to the VA   Under funding in your budget or delaying funding in your budget will only make it impossible for Congress to fully fund the VA and other important DOD quality of life programs   I urge you to send up a Budget that provides the resources for the VA to meet current future demands for quality  affordable care   Under funding this commitment or shifting greater costs to our nation  s veterans is morally offensive and will make it even harder to maintain a strong voluntary military       Hanford Clean Up    The Hanford site is one of the most polluted areas in the world   The cleanup of this area is a national priority and the Department of Energy  s Environmental Management budget request should be at a level equal to the challenge   The cleanup projects on the site are complex and function as a system   The Tank Farms  the Waste Treatment Plant  the River Corridor Closure are all examples of ongoing projects that need adequate funding to meet the federal government  s obligation to cleanup the waste and comply with the Tri Party Agreement        We cannot afford a repeat of the Fiscal Year 2006 budget process   The administration  s low budget request signaled a lack of commitment to the cleanup efforts   During the supplemental process  the only Department of Energy program singled out for a cut was the Waste Treatment Plant   It was characterized as a   lower priority federal program    and the suggested cut was  100 million   To request an inadequate level of funding and then declare the cleanup of waste left over from the Manhattan Project and the Cold War a   lower priority    is unacceptable  It is my expectation the Fiscal Year 2007 budget request will get the Hanford Site cleanup back on track        Health Care    Many of the families  businesses  and community leaders I talk to in Washington State are deeply concerned about the escalating cost of health care and the greater burden being shifted to working families          The cuts to Medicaid in the Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Reconciliation bill will force millions of low income patients to pay more for health care   These cuts will shift a greater burden of costs to those who have few resources   According to a new report from CBO  these changes will result in the loss of coverage for 45 000 enrollees   These are the most vulnerable and often those with the greatest health care challenges          Where will these people go for care   Who will pay for this care   How can we help these patients be better consumers in purchasing health care when they have no access          Instead of cutting Medicaid  we should be looking at innovative approaches to expanding access to health insurance and working to reduce health care costs   Deeper cuts in Medicaid does nothing to reduce the number of uninsured and will have no impact on reducing health care costs          Access to affordable health care is a problem for all Americans   It jeopardizes our economic competitiveness and drives down real growth in wages   It is an issue that must be addressed   We can no longer afford to ignore this crisis       Education    When I am in my home state of Washington and here in our nation  s capital  I hear a lot of concern from the business community  local governments  and families that the United States runs the risk of losing some of its global competitiveness because we are not investing in our greatest asset    our people   Last year  s budget set us on that path by weakening the federal commitment to education at all levels  and I fear the Fiscal Year 2007 budget will do the same   The FY 2006 budget so constrained education that the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill failed once in the House and almost didn  t pass at all   At a time when schools are facing increasing requirements under No Child Left Behind and families are facing rising college tuitions  this is no time to be shortchanging education          School districts are facing increasingly rigorous academic standards and must meet new requirements for highly qualified teachers   However  funding for the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB  was cut by 3 percent  or  13 1 billion below what was promised when we passed the bill          The Fiscal Year 2006 budget also led to the federal government sliding backwards on its commitment to students with disabilities for the first time in 10 years   The federal share of special education costs dropped from 18 6 percent in FY 2005 to 18 0 percent in FY 2006   Funding for disadvantaged students or Title I didn  t even keep up with the rate of inflation   The FY 2006 funding level is  9 9 billion less than what Congress and President Bush committed to spending in that law   The bill would leave behind 3 1 million students who could be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the committed level         This year   12 7 billion will be cut from student loans that help low income and middle income families pay for college   Seventy percent of those cuts will be paid for by students and their families   These cuts will not go for balancing the budget either    they will go to tax cuts for those that need them the least          Tuition and fees increased this year by 7 1 percent for four year public universities and 5 9 percent for private universities  Not only is cutting student loans the wrong priority for our country today  but it will cost our nation dearly in the long term   Currently only one third of the U S  workforce has a post secondary education  but it is estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st century will require a college education  Workers who have attended college on average have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment than those who don  t   And those with a college education also are more likely to have jobs with benefits like health care  retirement and pensions plans          We should be helping to break down the barriers to a college education  not building them up          Port Security    Since September 11  2001  I have been working to strengthen the security of our ports   We know we are vulnerable and we have much to do to ensure that terrorists do not use ports of entry as a new line of attack          The Commandant of the Coast Guard has said it would take  7 3 billion over 10 years to properly secure the 361 port facilities around the country   Yet  your Administration has requested only  46 million in port security grants since September 11  2001   In fact  last year  s budget request would have eliminated the port security grant program entirely   Fortunately  Congress has consistently provided funding and support for this critical program   It is time for the Administration to join the Congress in recognizing that port security is vital to ensuring the safety and security of our communities and our economy  and provide  400 million in funding for Fiscal Year 2007       Transportation and Housing    The budget is a statement of priorities and I believe that in order to make America stronger we need to be making investments here at home    in our people  in our infrastructure  and in our communities          Everywhere I travel in Washington state I hear from families struggling to find a safe and affordable place to live   Whether it is a young couple looking to buy their first home  a family searching for rental housing near their job  or a senior citizen who wants better access to social services  it is harder than ever to find affordable housing   Across the country public housing agencies and non profit organizations are working to help families find a place to call home   At the same time  they are contributing to community revitalization efforts that will bring new jobs and opportunities   But a lack of funding threatens the achievements that have been made and the work that is yet to be done   I urge you to include in your budget the resources necessary to address the housing affordability crisis facing our nation and ensure that our nation  s most vulnerable are not left out in the cold        It is also critical that we continue to invest in our nation  s infrastructure   Recent cuts in transportation spending threaten to weaken airline safety  impose new transportation costs on American businesses  and cost tens of thousands of construction jobs   Investing in our nation  s transportation infrastructure will help reduce congestion  improve safety  and support continued economic growth   I urge you to support these critical investments        I urge you to carefully consider these concerns and priorities as you prepare to submit your budget to Congress   These are the real priorities of working families in Washington State   I believe if you submit a realistic  fiscally sound budget  we can work in a bipartisan fashion to provide for our families  our communities and our troops serving with such honor                                                                      Sincerely                                                                    Patty Murray                                                            United States Senator
