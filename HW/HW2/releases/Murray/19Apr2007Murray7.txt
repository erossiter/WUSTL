                                                                 News Release          Senator Murray Examines Alarming Increase in Deaths on America s Highways Weak and ineffective truck safety enforcement cited as one contributor    For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 19  2007         Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing of the Senate Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  THUD  Appropriations Subcommittee to examine the alarming trend of increased highway fatalities across the country  Since 2003  the number of annual fatalities has risen by over 3 000 to an estimated 43 400 deaths a year  Additionally  for the first time in several years  the statistical likelihood that a citizen will be killed on our nation s highways has increased  Senator Murray challenged the assembled witnesses to come up with new ways to tackle the problem           If we are going to get back on track to reducing highway fatalities  it is clear that the old solutions are not going to be enough   said Senator Murray   We need some new and innovative solutions   And the Federal government needs to be a partner in these solutions        Today s hearing examined many of the causes for the increase in fatalities  While Senator Murray discussed problems commonly attributed to highway deaths including drunk driving  seat belt enforcement  and adherence to speed limits  she also spent substantial time focusing on ineffective compliance reviews for rogue trucking companies          We need to take a more aggressive posture in getting people to buckle up their seats belts and drive responsibly  but we also need a truck safety agency that will find the problems with rogue trucking companies before fatalities occur  not after   Murray said       Senator Murray illustrated the need for increased compliance reviews for trucking companies using the example of a March 19th accident that The Washington Post reported on involving a trucker who had racked up traffic citations in seven states           Read Senator Murray s opening statement here        Today we will take testimony on the tragic trend of rising fatalities on our Nation s highways   Right now  an average of 119 people dies every day in motor vehicle crashes   That means that every 12 minutes  a father  a mother  a brother  a sister  or a child is stolen from the American family   Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 3 and 33   They remain one of the top five leading causes of death for middle aged Americans        During our first Subcommittee hearing back in February  I reminded Transportation Secretary Mary Peters that  when she served as Federal Highway Administrator in 2003  she noted that there were 41 000 highway fatalities that year   She concluded that our country was facing  a National safety crisis   Unfortunately since 2003 the number of annual fatalities has now risen to 43 400   The crisis has not abated   It has worsened    And even more worrisome than the raw number of people being killed on our highways is the fact that  for the first time in several years  the fatality rate   the statistical likelihood that a citizen will be killed on our highways    has actually increased   After many years of slow but steady progress  the numbers are now going in the wrong direction          If we are going to get back on track to reducing highway fatalities  it is clear that the old solutions are not going to be enough   Only half of the states have enacted primary seat belt laws   And as we learned in the recent incident involving our former colleague  Governor Corzine  it is not enough just to enact primary seat belt laws   These laws  like the posted speed limits  need to be respected and enforced          But there are many other factors that add to our rising fatality rate  Not enough states are taking repeat drunk drivers off the road  permanently   And not enough states are requiring safe practices by our motorcyclists   We need some new and innovative solutions   And the Federal government needs to be a partner in these solutions        I am very disappointed to see that  rather than exhibiting leadership and attacking the problem  the Bush Administration appears to be retreating   A few years ago  the Bush Administration itself established the admirable goal of reducing the highway fatality rate to 1 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled by 2008   But rather than put forward bold new initiatives to reach that goal  the Bush Administration has decided instead to weaken the goal and delay it until 2011        Rather than admitting defeat  the Administration should be redoubling its efforts and putting forward proposals that will truly alter the behavior of drivers  pedestrians  and even Federal enforcers and regulators           Testifying before us this morning are the Administration s two principal point people on highway safety   Nicole Nason is the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration   John Hill serves as our chief truck safety official   the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration   I am also pleased that we are joined by Mark Rosenker Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board   This is his first appearance before this Subcommittee          The NTSB is probably best known for its work investigating aviation crashes  but its work in recommending safety improvements on our highways actually impacts a great many more travelers   The NTSB has no regulatory or enforcement functions   But they do carry extraordinarily important responsibilities in investigating accidents and making recommendations for safety improvements to federal and state agencies  and transportation operators to ensure a safer transportation network          When the NTSB makes a recommendation to a Federal agency  we expect that Federal agency to take notice   And when the NTSB puts that recommendation on its list of most wanted safety recommendations  we expect that Federal agency to act promptly   Finally  when the NTSB determines that an agency s response to one of their  most wanted  safety recommendations is unacceptable  this Subcommittee wants answers   We want to know why the agency is turning a blind eye to the NTSB          Two of the NTSB s  most wanted  safety recommendations have been directed at Mr  Hill s truck safety agency   And the NTSB has determined that Mr  Hill s response to both has been unacceptable   This morning  I want to find out why        Recently  here in the Washington D C  area  we learned the tragic results of weak and ineffective truck safety enforcement   The Washington Post recently revealed the case of a trucker who had racked up traffic citations in seven states   In one of those states  the license of the truck driver had been suspended seven times in eleven years   In fact  he was driving on a suspended license at the time that he crashed into a passenger vehicle on the Capitol Beltway  killing a 33 year old father of two          The truck driver was cited for reckless driving and he may face more serious charges as a result of that accident   That truck driver was in the employ of a trucking company called BK Trucking   Prior to the accident  BK Trucking firm was already on the watch list for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration because of an unusually high number of accidents and deficient inspections          A little more than three weeks before the beltway accident  the FMCSA did a full scale compliance review on BK trucking   They found a few problems  mostly with log books but otherwise found no violations that the agency described as  critical  or  acute           That was before the fatal accident   Three days after this awful tragedy  the FMCSA paid another call on BK trucking and discovered the following violations            improper lease agreements        lack of compliance with drug and alcohol testing procedures        using drivers with suspended commercial drivers licenses        failure to maintain records of State inspections        maintaining false log books        failure to turn in log books  and       failure to prepare driver inspection reports         So just one month after the FMCSA conducted a compliance review and found only minimal problems  the agency did another compliance review and found multiple violations and wrote up fines totaling  77 000          Now I don t doubt that the second compliance review conducted after the fatality was thorough   But I have serious doubts about the thoroughness of the compliance review that took place less than a month before the fatality   Are we really supposed to believe that the conditions at this trucking firm deteriorated so rapidly in 30 days   How is it that the first compliance review resulted in no violations and the second one  after the fatality revealed an endless list of problems  violations and fines        I suspect the answer to those questions also explains why the National Transportation Safety Board has determined that the FMCSA s compliance review process is   in their words    ineffective    I also suspect it explains why the NTSB has determined that the FMCSA responses to its recommendations in this area have been  unacceptable            Let me be clear   Our nation s economy depends on a safe  efficient and well capitalized trucking industry   In my home state of Washington our farmers depend on these trucks to get their agricultural products in Eastern Washington across the Cascade Mountains to the ports of Seattle and Tacoma in a safe and timely manner   And American consumers have come to expect a great variety of options as they peruse the shelves at retail outlets and supermarkets   Those goods don t get to those shelves by magic  they get there by truck           But just as we need to take a more aggressive posture in getting people to buckle up their seats belts and drive responsibly  we also need a truck safety agency that will find the problems with rogue trucking companies before fatalities occur  not after
