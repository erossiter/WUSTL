                                                              News Release          Murray Helps Defeat Provision to Undermine Fruit and Vegetable Growers Amendment would have stricken millions in aid to WA fruit and vegetable producers    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 3  2006          WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today helped defeat a short sighted amendment that would have stripped  74 5 million in agricultural disaster aid to fruit and vegetable producers   The measure  which Senator Murray fought against on the floor of the U S  Senate  ultimately lost on a 37 to 61 vote          Specialty crop producers have been hurt by disaster all over this country   Whether from fires or drought  or from hail storms and wind   fruit and vegetable producers have faced major challenges  We need to make a commitment to help our growers in all 50 states by providing them the assistance they desperately need     Murray said on the floor of the U S  Senate today          Senator Murray fought to include a  4 billion agriculture disaster provision in the Supplemental Appropriations bill when it came before her Committee   The provision was unanimously approved         Today  s amendment    introduced by Senator John McCain  R AZ  on the floor of the U S  Senate    would have cut the specialty crop funding out of the provision that Murray included in the overall disaster package           Along with 250 other fruits and vegetables produced in Washington state  the specialty crop industry represents a large segment of our agriculture economy which serves as the economic backbone of my state     Murray said       A full transcript of Senator Murray  s remarks in support of the disaster assistance follows       I oppose the Senator from Arizona  s effort to strike a portion of the agriculture disaster provision that will assist America  s fruit and vegetable producers  Our nation  s specialty crop producers are confronted with a number of challenges that threaten their viability and in some cases  their survival        It is no secret that Washington state is a major specialty crop state   We rank number one in the nation in the production of a number of specialty crops including  apples  pears  sweet cherries  raspberries and Concord grapes to name just a few          Along with 250 other fruits and vegetables produced in Washington state  the specialty crop industry represents a large segment of our agriculture economy which serves as the economic backbone of my state          Unlike row crops    crops like corn  wheat  soybeans and cotton    there is virtually no support by USDA for fruit and vegetable producers   Many do not even have access to crop insurance for their crops         Specialty crop producers have been hurt by disaster all over this country   Whether from fires or drought  or from hail storms and wind   fruit and vegetable producers have faced major challenges during the previous two crop years        These important industries are also being hit hard  and in some cases decimated  by the inflow of specialty crops grown overseas  a lack of access to labor  and pests and diseases   We need to make a commitment to help our growers in all 50 states by providing them the assistance they desperately need          Many Americans do not realize that specialty crops represent 51 percent of all farm cash receipts in the U S    more than  41 billion in annual farm gate value         Although our fruit and vegetable industry is as large  if not larger  than the other commodities  they have access to relatively little of the overall ag disaster program          The Section 32 grants to states to help Specialty crops will help fruit and vegetable producers survive these difficult conditions   Whether supporting research  promotion  marketing or other efforts  these funds will help keep fruit and vegetable farmers in business in every single state          Voting for the McCain amendment is voting against funds that will come to your state to help your farmers stay viable   I think everyone here thinks that the US should produce as much domestic food product as it can  and the  74 5 million that is targeted by the McCain Amendment to help keep fruit and vegetable producers in business is a modest investment and commitment to keep our farmers in business          I urge my colleagues to join in making a commitment that we will support our Specialty Crop farms and farm families  and with that  I urge that they vote against the McCain amendment
