Nation Senators urge Bush to   provide a full accounting   of the cost of caring for our veterans    For Immediate Release  Monday  June 27  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      At a press conference with local and state veterans   leaders in Seattle today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   announced a letter that will be signed by her Democratic Senate colleagues calling on President Bush to tell the American people how he plans to make up for a  1 billion VA shortfall when he addresses the nation about our efforts in Iraq on Tuesday night          It angers me that this Administration continues to deny the costs of this war   It angers me that they don  t seem to believe that caring for our veterans is a fundamental cost of war  That  s why today I am sending a letter to the President asking him to come clean with the American people about the true costs of fulfilling our promise to our veterans     Murray said at the press conference        The Department of Veterans affairs announced last week that they are facing a  1 billion health care funding shortfall for fiscal year 2005   The announcement came just two weeks after VA Secretary Jim Nicholson assured Senator Murray that he saw no need for additional funding and only two months after the administration vehemently argued against the need for more money   raising loud  consistent objections to Senator Murray  s efforts to increase funding for the VA        In their letter to President Bush  Murray and her Democratic colleagues write          Mr  President  we urge you to provide the American people with a full accounting of the cost of these conflicts  including the cost of caring for our veterans upon their return home  during your Tuesday evening address   We ask that you directly share with the nation how your administration will make up the VA s current FY 2005 budget shortfall of  1 billion  as well as the looming shortfall projected for the future  And  we stand ready to work with you to pass an emergency spending bill to address this shortfall before the July 4th Congressional recess            Immediately following the VA  s announcement last Thursday  Senator Murray introduced legislation to pay for the funding shortfall through an emergency spending package                                                                                         Full text of the letter to President Bush and Senator Murray  s remarks at today  s press conference follow       June 27  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States of America  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  DC 20500     Mr  President        As you prepare for your Tuesday evening address to the nation regarding our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan  we urge you to take this opportunity to level with the American people about a major cost of these conflicts   the care of our nation s veterans        As of January 2005  over 1 million U S  troops have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 3 and one half years   The Department of Veterans Affairs   VA  annual mid year budget review confirmed that many of these soldiers have returned home and are beginning to access the VA health care system in record numbers  placing increased demands on an already overburdened agency   Many of us saw a looming crisis and sought to take steps that would avert it        With the recent announcement that the VA is facing a shortfall of approximately  1 billion in fiscal year 2005 it seems that our concerns are well founded  Unfortunately  the VA s current shortfall  and larger shortfalls predicted for future years  has confirmed that your Administration has not prudently addressed the budget impacts of these conflicts   We urge you to do so now   Only by confronting this problem head on can we ensure that our veterans receive the support and healthcare they were both promised and deserve          Adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000   Some veterans have to wait over three years to have surgery   And some VA hospitals are only seeing veterans who have more than a 50 percent service connected disability   The evidence that the VA cannot function under your proposed budgets and needs immediate relief to provide veterans access to quality health care continues to mount        War is costly   This is a lesson we all know personally   As Senators we have dealt with legislation authorizing the use of military force  we have worked on spending bills to support our troops  and we have talked to the families of those who have lost loved ones   We also know that failing to provide for the men and women who have sacrificed for our freedom is wrong          In a September 7  2003 speech to the nation you stated   the heaviest burdens in our war on terror fall  as always  on the men and women of our Armed Forces and our intelligence services  They have removed gathering threats to America and our friends  and this nation takes great pride in their incredible achievements  We are grateful for their skill and courage  and for their acts of decency  which have shown America s character to the world  We honor the sacrifice of their families         Mr  President  we urge you to provide the American people with a full accounting of the cost of these conflicts  including the cost of caring for our veterans upon their return home  during your Tuesday evening address   We ask that you directly share with the nation how your administration will make up the VA s current FY 2005 budget shortfall of  1 billion  as well as the looming shortfall projected for the future  And  we stand ready to work with you to pass an emergency spending bill to address this shortfall before the July 4th Congressional recess        Sincerely        Senator Patty Murray                                                                                         Murray  s Remarks at Seattle press conference     Thank you all for coming out today to help raise awareness of what deserves to be a national priority    taking care of our veterans   I want to thank         The AFGE       The National Association of Black Veterans       The Paralyzed Veterans of America and       The American Legion for their presence here today       We are here today to call on the Bush Administration and Congress to step up their commitment to our veterans   I am calling on President Bush to tell the American people how he plans to address the recently announced  1 billion shortfall for the VA and reconfirm our promise to those who have served us by supporting them when they return home          Let me tell you why taking care of our veterans is so near to my heart          For me  it  s very personal  During World War II  my dad was one of the first G I   s to land on Okinawa  He was injured  sent to a hospital in Hawaii  and then immediately sent back to Okinawa  He was awarded the Purple Heart         And when I was in college at WSU  I asked to do my internship at the Seattle VA hospital    the very same one right behind us here today   I moved from Pullman to Seattle for the semester  rented a room  and spent my days in the psychiatric ward  working with veterans coming back from Vietnam  It was hard to watch what these young men my age were going through  On the street  a lot of people did not respect them  But inside the VA  I saw doctors  nurses  receptionists  and cafeteria workers who looked them in the eye  understood what they had gone through  showed them respect  and worked to help them heal         Caring for the veterans who have sacrificed for our freedom is the duty of a grateful nation  These brave men and women made a solemn promise to protect our country         Our reciprocal promise is to care for them when they return home  That is why I find last week  s admission by the VA that they will need an estimated  1 billion more in emergency funding just to get through fiscal year 2005 appalling         Unfortunately  this Administration has been unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to fulfill the promises we have made to our veterans         When I was fighting to get my veterans  healthcare amendment passed a few months ago  I warned that the VA was headed for a train wreck if we did not address their critical funding needs         And do you know what this Administration told me        They told me they didn  t need any extra funding   They told me they had the resources to provide quality  timely care to current veterans while also caring for new veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan        Well  I  d like to know what data they were looking at          I  ve been to veterans   hospitals and clinics across our state and I know that the waits are long and that doctors are working overtime to see as many patients as possible   And I know that at American Lake you can only get an appointment if you are 50 percent or more service connected disabled  In the Puget Sound alone    as of January    there was an  11 million deficit  forcing the VA hospitals to leave vacant positions unfilled and veterans waiting in lines         I introduced an amendment in April to increase funding for our veterans by nearly  2 billion based on these observations and based on a draft of the VA  s OWN mid year review   Those are the exact same numbers the Secretary of Veterans   Affairs  Jim Nicholson was looking at when he sent a letter to Congress  that said  quote          I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY2005 to continue to provide timely  quality service that is always our goal     End quote         Just two months ago this administration vehemently argued against the need for more money   raising loud  consistent objections to my efforts   And now  just two weeks after the Secretary told me their budget was fine  the VA is announcing that they are  1 billion dollars short  That s outrageous        It angers me that this Administration continues to deny the costs of this war   It angers me that they don  t seem to believe that caring for our veterans is a fundamental cost of war         That  s why today I am sending a letter to the President asking him to come clean with the American people about the true costs of fulfilling our promise to our veterans   I am asking that tomorrow night  when the President addresses the nation about the status of our efforts in Iraq  that he tells us what we need to do to provide our veterans with the care they need and how he plans to address the  1 billion shortfall        We have asked these brave men and women to sacrifice for our freedom and it is shameful that this Administration has refused to make them a priority        Every indication is that we simply do not have enough funding for our current services  and the VA is finding it difficult to handle the increased number of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan while still providing high levels of service to other veterans  This is not right  It is not what veterans were promised         I have reintroduced my legislation to provide emergency supplemental funding for the VA to make up for their shortfall         I urge the Administration to submit a supplemental request and fulfill the promise to our nation  s veterans         I very much regret that it has come to this  But now is the time to come together and provide the needed dollars so that our veterans have the quality  accessible care they need and deserve  I will work with anyone and everyone to keep this commitment to our veterans and our current service men and women         Taking care of our veterans is a fundamental cost of war    and this is a problem we can not postpone or sweep under the rug         Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue  it  s an American issue  As we prepare to celebrate the 4th of July  I call on Congress and the Administration to work with me to do the most patriotic thing we can do    fulfill our promise to care for America  s veterans
