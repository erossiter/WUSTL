                                                                News Release          Senator Murray to Vote Against Attorney General Nominee Alberto Gonzales    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 1  2005     Washington  D C     Today U S  Senator Patty Murray announced that she will vote against the confirmation of attorney general nominee Alberto Gonzales          Murray issued the following statement         After studying Alberto Gonzales  record and reviewing his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  I have concluded that he does not meet the standards required to be attorney general   I will vote against his confirmation when it comes before the full Senate        I do not relish voting against any president s cabinet nominees   In general  I believe that a president should be able to fill his cabinet with the people he wants   But the position of attorney general is unique in our system of government  and I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent seriously        The attorney general has a direct impact on the rights  lives  and liberties of every American   He is not merely an advisor to the president   He is the chief law enforcement officer of our country  He may even be called on to investigate wrongdoing by the very president who appointed him   Because of these unique responsibilities  an attorney general must meet certain standards          In addition to being honest and independent  an attorney general must actively enforce the laws and ensure the public s confidence in our legal system  The attorney general must also display the highest standards of fairness  trust  and respect for the law   Unfortunately  a review of Mr  Gonzales  record in Texas  at the White House  and before the Senate Judiciary Committee shows he falls short of those standards        First  Mr  Gonzales does not have the independence to be our next attorney general   While early in his career he showed a willingness to follow the law in the face of personal opinions and ideological pressure  the rest of his record shows a troubling pattern of  finding in the law  the answers that his superiors sought   The most troubling example is his work redefining torture in two infamous 2002 memos   Mr  Gonzales approved standards of torture that defy U S  law  international agreements  and the Constitution   That deeply flawed approach endangered American troops and weakened our standing in the world   Mr  Gonzales  unwillingness to say  no  when the law required it does not reflect the independence needed in America s attorney general          Independence is especially important to ensure accountability in the executive branch  particularly since there is no longer an independent counsel to investigate executive wrongdoing   Time and again  Mr  Gonzales has stood up for government secrecy and blocked accountability to the American people   He drafted several executive orders delaying the release of presidential papers and played a leading role in blocking the release of documents related to Vice President Cheney s secret energy meetings         I m also troubled that Mr  Gonzales will not ensure public confidence in our legal system   The attorney general must be someone that the American people can trust to vigorously protect their rights   Unfortunately  Mr  Gonzales  work on Texas death row clemency appeals is deeply troubling   As then Governor Bush  s counsel  Mr  Gonzales prepared 57 briefs summarizing the clemency requests of prisoners who were facing execution   In these briefs  Mr  Gonzales left out exculpatory evidence and key facts that might have warranted further review   Clemency was granted in only one case  and Governor Bush proceeded with 150 executions   If Mr  Gonzales was careless in protecting the due process rights of individuals as a governor s counsel  how can we expect him to be more careful as America s attorney general         While those who know him speak of his honesty  his appearance before the Judiciary Committee raises serious questions   During his seven hours of testimony  he repeatedly refused to answer questions   When he did answer  his responses were at times misleading or incomplete   One example stands out   In 1996  Governor Bush was excused from jury duty in a Texas drunk driving case   Mr  Gonzales accompanied Governor Bush to court that day in 1996   Recently  the Senate Judiciary Committee asked Mr  Gonzales in written questions to describe that court appearance  in detail    Mr  Gonzales replied    in writing   that all he did was sit in the courtroom and say he had no objection to Gov  Bush being excused   But the judge  the prosecutor  and the defense attorney all tell a different story   They have said publicly that Mr  Gonzales asked for and got a private meeting with the judge in his chambers   Further  all three say that during that off the record meeting Mr  Gonzales sought to have Governor Bush excused   When Senator Leahy asked Mr  Gonzales to explain why he didn t share this information with the Judiciary Committee in his written answer  Mr  Gonzales replied that he was only asked about what happened  in court   presumably to avoid having to explain what may have happened in the judge s chambers   Such a deceptive and incomplete answer does not reflect the honesty needed in our attorney general        Mr  Gonzales  personal story is inspiring  but I cannot overlook his record in Texas or in the White House   Because Mr  Gonzales lacks the independence and honesty to be attorney general and because his record will not ensure public confidence in the fair administration of justice  I must vote against his confirmation
