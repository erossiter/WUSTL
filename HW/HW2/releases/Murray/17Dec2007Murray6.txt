here at home  I work everyday to ensure that even though our state s residents are 2 500 miles from D C   their needs are up front and center  At a time when domestic and local needs are too often being neglected  these worthy projects are getting the support they deserve   This spending bill is expected to be cleared by the U S  House of Representatives tonight and sent to the Senate tomorrow
