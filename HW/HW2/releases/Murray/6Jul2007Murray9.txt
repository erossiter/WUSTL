Press Conference with Doctors  Patient  Advocates    For Immediate Release  Friday  July 6  2007     SEATTLE  WA   Standing with doctors  a patient  environmental experts  and advocates today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  announced that her bill to ban asbestos will take a major step forward this month when it is marked up by the Senate s Environment and Public Works Committee  The mark up will be the first time Murray s bill makes it this far before this committee and reflects the bipartisan support Murray s legislation has gathered  Murray made the announcement today at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle  Every day we waste is another day that someone else is exposed to asbestos  someone else gets a deadly diagnosis  and someone else loses a family member to a painful disease  I m committed to stopping this cycle  Murray said    Speaking in support of Murray s bill was Judy Clauson of Aberdeen  She was unknowingly exposed to asbestos by washing the dust covered clothing her former husband brought home from work each day  In August 2006  she was diagnosed with mesothelioma  and the 44 year old said she will be lucky to live another year   I want to see my sons get married and my grandkids born  I feel cheated  It is ludicrous that something as deadly as asbestos is still legal in this country  Clauson said  How many people have to die   Dr  Eric Vallieres of the Swedish Cancer Institute said the bill will help with research and public awareness  The promotion of research is very lacking  and this bill helps to rectify that  I also strongly believe we need to educate the people  I strongly support this bill  Dr  Vallieres said  We are fortunate to have our own Senator Murray as a national leader in the fight to ban asbestos  said Dr  Fred Appelbaum  head of Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutchison Center  This bill is long overdue  You have to have  legislative starters  when the system gets stuck  It s so important to have a legislator step up  said Bill Rodgers  an environmental law professor at the University of Washington  To demonstrate the availability of asbestos laden products  Murray held up a pair of brake pads that were recently purchased in the Seattle area  Murray started working to ban asbestos six years ago  This March  she re introduced her legislation  which bans asbestos  invests in research and treatment  and launches a public education campaign  Her bill  the Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007  S  742   already has 16 co sponsors  On March 1st     Then on June 12th  the bill got a hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee  at which   Senator Murray s remarks  as prepared  follow  Today I m honored to stand here with people who know that we need to do much more to protect America s workers and families from deadly asbestos  I d like to thank Fred Hutch for hosting us today and for being a leader in the fight against cancer  I d also like to thank our other speakers for sharing their unique perspectives and working to ban asbestos in America once and for all  I got involved in this fight six years ago    after reading about the deadly toll asbestos takes on our nations workers  families  homeowners and communities  Ever since that time  I ve been introducing legislation  holding hearings  and trying to get Congress to act  Unfortunately  some of the advocates who stood with me over the years lost their lives to asbestos diseases  I promised them that I would keep up this fight until we got the job done  and that s why I m here today  Banning asbestos has been an uphill battle  Many people think that asbestos is already banned in America  but we haven t  Asbestos has not been banned in America  It s still imported into the U S  in consumer products  auto parts and construction material  In fact  this week my staff purchased this box of brake pads at a local auto parts store  These brake pads contain asbestos  If a brake mechanic or car owner works on these brakes  they could be exposed to asbestos  At another mechanic shop my staff picked up a box that did not say that it contained asbestos but it did have a warning that poor ventilation may cause lung disease  When my staff member asked whether the product contained asbestos  the young mechanic there told her that  the government banned asbestos years ago  We ve got to stop using asbestos products  start warning the public and investing in research and treatment  Our region has been seriously affected by asbestos exposure  According to the Environmental Working Group  a nonprofit environmental research organization based in Washington  D C     Washington state has the 8th highest incidence of deaths from asbestos related exposures in the country    And in terms of counties    King County has the 4th highest incidence of deaths from asbestos related exposures in the US    As far as small cities go  Bremerton has the highest incidence of deaths from asbestos related cancers of any small city in the U S    So we re talking about a national problem that has a painful local impact  Studies show that asbestos exposure kills up to 10 000 Americans each year  To anyone who says  We don t need this bill  I would just pose one question  How many more Americans have to die before our government finally does the right thing and bans asbestos  More than 40 other industrialized countries have already banned asbestos  I think American citizens deserve the same protection  My bill does three things    First  my bill bans asbestos  It prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos  Unfortunately some 2 500 metric tons of asbestos was used in the US in 2005 and imports of products containing asbestos in cement pipe  tiles  brake gaskets and linings continue unabated today    Second  my bill dramatically expands research and treatment  It creates a  50 million  10 center Asbestos Related Disease Research and Treatment Network  It creates a new National Asbestos Related Disease Registry  It supports research at the Department of Defense and launches a study to determine the most promising areas for new research     Finally  my bill launches a public education campaign to better inform Americans of the dangers of asbestos in the workplace and in the environment  It will also provide helpful steps all of us can take to better protect our families    I m pleased to say that we are making progress  I ve been working on this for 6 years  and for too long Congress has had the wrong priorities  Now Congress is moving in a positive direction  In March  I introduced my bill and chaired a hearing on it  Last month  my bill got a full committee hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee  I ve been working with the stakeholders and Senators on both sides of the aisle to move the bill forward  Today  I m pleased to announce that my bill to ban asbestos will be marked up later this month  This will be the first time my bill has reached this stage before the Environment and Public Works Committee  and it represents great progress  I m proud of how far we ve come  but I m not going to stop until we turn my bill into law  Every day we waste is another day that someone else is exposed to asbestos  someone else gets a deadly diagnosis and someone else loses a family member to a painful disease  I m committed to stopping this cycle  and I thank you all for coming
