                                                                                                                                                                                                                   For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 14  2007     Washington  D C    Today  standing with veterans  service organizations and bipartisan leaders  U S  Senator Patty Murray discussed the new Wounded Warriors bill  a comprehensive proposal to eliminate the gaps in care that returning service members face  The Wounded Warrior bill provides real solutions for our troops and veterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between  Murray said  Our service members have always answered the call of duty  but for too long our government has not answered theirs  I am proud to say those days are over   On Flag Day  Murray spoke at a Capitol Hill press conference just after the bill passed the Senate Armed Services Committee  Also at the press conference were Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin  D MI   Senator John Warner  R VA   Veterans Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka  D HI   veterans  and representatives of Veterans of Foreign Wars  Paralyzed Veterans of America  Disabled American Veterans  and Veterans for America    The legislation addresses better treatment and screening for PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury  electronic medical records  disability ratings  and more  The bill is the result of a unique partnership between the Committee on Veterans Affairs and the Senate Armed Services Committee  The two committees held a  on April 12th and developed the legislation together    In her remarks  Murray noted that since Democrats have been in charge of Congress they have held dozens of oversight hearings on the War and veterans care  passed a Supplemental bill that for the first time includes funding for veterans  and  that boosts VA funding by  3 6 billion over the President s request       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Today  as Americans celebrate our flag and the values it represents  I am proud to stand with my Senate colleagues and our nation s veterans to discuss two pieces of legislation honoring those who sacrificed for our flag and for our freedom  It is clear that the steps we are here to celebrate are five years late  but I want to thank Senators Levin and Akaka for their leadership in doing the right thing now    Our troops answered the Presidents call to serve  Without hesitation  they risked their lives  Some came home without limbs  Others returned with mental scars  Many  thankfully   have escaped without injury  But all of them earned our respect and the best care possible when they come home    The Administration has failed  Democrats have done better    Unfortunately  from the shameful conditions at Walter Reed  to a lack of PTSD counselors and a benefit claims backlog of months  it is clear the Administration has failed to provide the care our heroes earned    Today  I can say that in just a few short months  this new Congress has worked to reverse these failures  and to honor the promise our government makes to care for our warriors    We have   Held dozens of oversight hearings on the War Passed a Supplemental bill that   for the first time since invading Iraq provides adequate funding for our veterans  Today we will pass a VA funding bill that provides  3 6 billion more than the President asked for to improve health care and expand services to our veterans   And today we celebrate the result of working across committee lines  and across the aisle  to do right by our veterans  This issue is far too important for anything less   Wounded Warriors Legislation    The Wounded Warrior bill  which passed Senator Levin s Committee today  provides real solutions for our troops and veterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between     The bureaucratic nightmares facing our wounded service personnel are shameful  And our heroes deserve better    I am proud that the Wounded Warriors works to reverse these problems   It requires the DOD and VA to develop a comprehensive plan to prevent  treat and diagnose TBI and PTSD  It also directs them to implement a joint electronic health record so critical medical records are not lost as our wounded troops move from battlefield doctors to medical holds and on to the VA  And that it requires the military to adopt the VA s policy that an injury is service connected when our heroes  who were healthy prior to service   have spent 6 months or more in active duty  We need to meet our service members  needs from the day they re recruited to the day they transition home  The Wounded Warriors Act does just that    Our service members have always answered the call of duty  but for too long our government has not answered theirs  I am proud to say those days are over  From the supplemental bill  to the Wounded Warriors Act and the funding bill set to pass today  this Congress is answering its duty  And on Flag Day  it is clear we are honoring the ideals our Stars and Stripes represent
