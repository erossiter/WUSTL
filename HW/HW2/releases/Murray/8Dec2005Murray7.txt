Community Resources to consolidate and  improve programs for poor and homeless    For Immediate Release  Thursday  December 8  2005     BREMERTON  WA     U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today visited Bremerton to announce that she has secured  500 000 for Kitsap Community Resources  a Bremerton nonprofit that assists low income families with poverty  hunger  and homelessness   Nearly 20 000 residents of Kitsap County currently live in poverty           I m so proud to have secured this funding for KCR s crucial work   Murray said    I know these are federal dollars very well spent           Many of KCR s services are currently housed in leased buildings  but with Bremerton s revitalization  property values are increasing and rents are becoming unaffordable   The funding secured by Senator Murray will support KCR s efforts to consolidate all its services in a new  20 000 square foot building   The building will house the Bremerton Women  Infant  Children  WIC  clinic  a commercial kitchen to prepare meals for low income seniors and children  all of KCR s employment and training programs  and KCR administration         This new building will facilitate KCR s work  and will change so many lives in Kitsap County   This new facility will be a place to get help building a better life  making an already strong community even stronger   Murray said         Today  Senator Murray toured the existing facilities  where she met families who are being helped by KCR   She was joined by Bremerton Mayor Cary Bozeman  Commissioner Patty Lent  KCR Board President Terri Washburn  State Representative Derek Kilmer  and community leaders       Senator Murray s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow       I m delighted to be in Bremerton today to show my support for Kitsap Community Resources  its employees and volunteers  and all the members of the Kitsap County Community whose lives are being changed for the better by your work        Even after so many years of coming to Bremerton  like everyone who visits Bremerton  each time I come here I m struck by how beautiful a place it is   And  in recent years  with the revitalization of downtown  it s become even more beautiful   I m so proud to have been a strong supporter of the revitalization   This community has shown through that revitalization that it cares deeply about what kind of place Bremerton is         The revitalization projects have brought increased opportunity and prosperity to Bremerton  and to all of Kitsap County   But  the fact is  even with all the benefits residents are enjoying as a result of the revitalization    as we know    there are too many people here in Kitsap County whose boats are not being lifted by the rising tide        Nearly 20 000 Kitsap County residents are living in poverty today   Too many of our neighbors  our friends  and their families are finding it hard to make ends meet  and we ve got to do more to help them get an education  find a good job  and provide for their families        But you know  I don t only love to visit Kitsap County because it s a beautiful place   For me it s about more than that   It s about how wonderful a community this is   I ve seen time and time again over the years  that this is a place where people truly care about their neighbors   And nowhere is that community spirit exemplified better than in the work being done by Kitsap Community Resources          Your hard work and dedication are essential in helping those among us who have fallen on hard times and need a little help to get food on the table  to find work  to put their lives back together  or to help their kids get a good education        In my time in the Senate  I ve seen firsthand that to truly address the challenges people face  we have to use a comprehensive approach   We have to address employment and training challenges  nutritional deficiencies  problems with literacy and education  and difficulties in finding safe  secure housing        This is the only way we can begin to give families the kinds of opportunities they deserve    and that s just what I find most encouraging about your work   Through programs like Head Start and WIC  you re helping women and children not just to get proper nutrition  but also to get educated in order to form healthy eating habits  and hit the ground running in school   Through FAST  Community Jobs  WIA  and through your Business Services Consultant  you re helping to get people trained for good careers  so they can support their families and move towards self sufficiency   And the Parenting to Employment program and The Parenting Place help strengthen families by encouraging employment while teaching better parenting skills          Through these programs  and so many others  you re addressing the full range of challenges that Kitsap County s poor are confronting  and you re helping create safe  secure homes for Kitsap County s families and children   I am deeply grateful for the work you re doing          That s why I m so proud to have secured  500 000 for your crucial work as the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee   I know these are federal dollars that are very well spent   The facility you build will facilitate your work  and will change so many lives here in Kitsap County   This new facility will be a place to get help building a better life  making an already strong community even stronger         And  it will also serve as another key part of the revitalization of downtown Bremerton  further building on all the great work that s already been done to keep this a great place to visit    and to live and raise a family          I want to thank all the public and private partners who are propelling this important project forward   I m really looking forward to the day when we break ground on the new Kitsap Community Resources building        I m so proud to support your work  and to be your partner in the United States Senate   And I want you to know that you can continue to count on my support as we work together to improve the lives of people throughout Kitsap County
