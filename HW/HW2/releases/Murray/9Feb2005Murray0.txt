                                                                     News Release          Murray Fights Bush Plan to Double Electricity Costs for Washington Ratepayers At Hearing  Bush Official Tells Murray that doubling of electricity rates is  a very modest increase      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 9  2005             Washington  D C      This morning  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  stood up for Washington  s ratepayers and refuted the White House budget director  s assessment that yearly electrical rate increases of 20 percent would be   modest     Murray vowed to   fight back    against this proposal  which would nearly double electric power rates charged by the Bonneville Power Administration  BPA   and cripple a Washington state economy that has been hit hard by energy crises in recent years         Josh Bolten  the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  OMB   appeared before the Senate Budget committee to defend the Administration  s recently released budget plan        Under direct questioning by Murray  Bolten defended President Bush  s proposal to levy what is essentially a  1 billion tax on Northwest ratepayers over the next two years alone      I think particularly the customers of BPA will find that we  re talking about a very modest increase in the subsidized rates that they now enjoy     Bolten said        Senator Murray defended Washington ratepayers and told Bolten that there was nothing   modest    about the effects this plan would have on Washington families and businesses            A twenty percent increase in the cost of heating our homes  providing electricity to many businesses who rely on it  is going to cripple the economy in the Pacific Northwest     Senator Murray said    We pay the rates for our electricity out there   And I  ll tell you what  the Northwest is not going to stand there and take this   We are going to fight back           The proposal  which is part of the Bush Administration  s Fiscal Year 2006 budget  would increase the Northwest  s power rates by 20 percent a year until they are equivalent with market rates throughout the country    The plan would upend the half century old policy that Northwestern power should be cost based    rather than market based    to ensure that the public benefits of the Columbia River are shared          Altering BPA  s current rate structure would take an additional  1 05 billion from the wallets of regional ratepayers during the first two years  and more than  2 billion over a four year period   Northwestern ratepayers  who are still hurting from the energy crisis of 2000 2001  cannot afford to take on the additional costs this proposal would incur    This is especially true for the families that are eligible for assistance in paying their energy bills through the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP            I want you to know that our region does not want to see this budget balanced on the back of our ratepayers     Murray said         Senator Murray has consistently fought for legislation to punish companies that engage in energy market manipulation  and has stood up against attempts by federal regulators to impose a Standard Market Design on the Northwest energy system          A transcript of the exchange follows    Senate Budget Committee Hearing  The President s FY 06 Budget Proposal   unofficial transcript by Murray s office    Senator Murray    Well  thank you very much  Mr  Chairman  and Mr  Director  I appreciate your being here today  You know  I listened to the President  s State of the Union address last week  and he told us he was going to send the budget  and would focus on essential priorities  so I was looking forward to seeing it   I guess I was really disappointed to find out what was not essential priorities   things like veterans  and students  and securing our ports and borders  and affordable health care  and nuclear waste cleanup  and I think that sends a very bad message to our country right now         I don  t know how we can maintain a strong defense if we  re going to cut veterans access to health care  or how we can make sure we have strong Homeland Security if we  re eliminating funding for our port security grants  and I don  t believe we can strengthen our economy if we  re going to reduce our investments in education  and job training  and infrastructure          At a time when everyone is asking    How can we be secure     I think this budget really undermines that security  And I echo the comments of Senator Conrad on what this budget really is  how real it is  and masking it         But let me  for this time  since my time is short  focus on a very parochial issue  Actually  it  s not real parochial  it  s the Pacific Northwest  which you should know is up in arms over your proposal to force our Power Marketing Administration to charge market based rates for electricity   I think there  s eight senators on this committee alone who are going to be affected by that  And I want you to know that our region does not want to see this budget balanced on the back of our rate payers         But that  s not the only legislative proposal in your budget that is going to undercut the Bonneville Power Administration   You also proposed to hold certain financial transactions  such as third party financing  against BPA  s borrowing authority   And I have to tell that that is really rich with irony because for two years  OMB opposed our efforts to raise BPA  s borrowing authority in order to make necessary investments in transmission and other capital projects that were needed   And in 2003  OMB finally supported half of BPA  s needed borrowing authority  but said that they should use other financing means  like third party financing  to meet the remainder of its investing needs         So here we are  a couple of years later  and you are proposing to undercut the ability of BPA to use third party financing by holding these  and other types of transactions  against their borrowing authority limit  These kinds of proposals are going to cripple BPA  s ability to meet their investment needs  You know  Mr  Bolten  President Bush came out to my home state  Washington state  in July of 1999  And he came out again in 2003  and stood at Ice Harbor Dam  and he promised to save the dams   I cannot believe that this budget is making two different proposals that is going to severely undermine the value of those very dams that he promised he was going to save   So  my question to you this morning is  is it the intention of President Bush to privatize BPA and other PMAs          Mr  Bolten    No  that  s not reflected in these proposals  and I don  t think these proposals in any respect undermine the value of the dams out there   All that we are asking in these proposals is that the Power Marketing Authorities charge their customers a reasonable market rate   not a subsidized rate for which the rest of the taxpayers in this country are paying             Senator Murray    The rest of the taxpayers are not subsidizing Bonneville  We pay the rates          Mr  Bolten    I think we have a disagreement on facts on that  and CBO has found that the most of the PMAs in fact do receive a subsidy from the federal government  But even beyond that  when the government is engaged in a commercial venture  I think using assets created with federal taxpayers   dollars  I think especially in these times it  s reasonable to expect that those commercial ventures charge their customers a reasonable market rate  That  s all we  re asking  and I think             Senator Murray    No  no              Mr  Bolten        I think particularly the customers of BPA will find that we  re talking about a very modest increase in the subsidized rates that they now enjoy          Senator Murray    A twenty percent increase in the cost of heating our homes  providing electricity to many businesses who rely on it  is going to cripple the economy in the Pacific Northwest   We are just beginning to drag out of the economic damages from the last four years  which started with an electricity crisis  which I won  t go into  it had to do with Enron   I believe there are a number of other members on this committee who share that viewpoint with me   But we cannot cripple the Pacific Northwest   These are not subsidized rates   We pay the rates for our electricity out there   And I  ll tell you what  the Northwest is not going to stand there and take this   We are going to fight back  Mr  Chairman  I know I  m out of time   I have a number of other questions for you  including the proposed cuts to Hanford nuclear reservation cleanup  and you  ll be hearing more from me on that in the next round  Thank you  Mr  Chairman
