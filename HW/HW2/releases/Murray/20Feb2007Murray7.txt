conditions facing returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans at the Army s flagship military hospital  Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington  D C           If conditions at Walter Reed  the

paperwork requirements for recovering soldiers       a report on the accessibility and quality of psychological counseling for Soldiers and their families       and a remediation plan  including a timeline and description of the steps the Department of Defense will take to improve outpatient care  and improve and simplify benefits for wounded military personnel      The text of their letter follows      February 20  2007        Secretary Robert Gates  1000 Defense Pentagon  Washington  DC 20301    Dear Secretary Gates        We have seen first hand the excellent medical care that our troops receive at Walter Reed Army Medical Center   In many cases Walter Reed s professional care and military expertise means the difference between life and death for our wounded combat heroes          This is why we were so shocked and outraged to read the Washington Post s weekend series on the dire conditions many of our military wounded face as they transition out of acute care and into outpatient care at Walter Reed   There is no more vivid image of the lack of planning by the Bush Administration for a prolonged military operation in Iraq than the neglect of our men and women in uniform when they come home         We are writing today to demand an end to that neglect          According to the Post series  members of our military suffering from devastating physical and mental wounds are left to navigate a system of dilapidated living quarters  bureaucratic nightmares  language barriers  inadequate and confusing benefits and neglect on virtually every level        Over 700 soldiers are living as outpatients either on post or in apartments and hotels near by    The Washington Post showed shocking pictures of Building 18   which is infested with rodents  has mold  broken doors and a broken elevator           While we understand from subsequent stories that work has begun on Building 18  these revelations raise a larger and even more concerning issue        If conditions at Walter Reed  the crown jewel of military health care facilities  have degraded to the point where mouse traps are handed out to patients  how can we feel confident that our troops and veterans truly have the care and transition assistance they have been promised at any facility across the country        We are well aware of plans by the Pentagon to close Walter Reed by 2011  but that is no excuse for atrocious conditions in 2007   As long as we have troops coming home  we demand that they be treated with the dignity and respect they have earned from a grateful nation        That is why we are calling for an immediate Inspector General investigation of conditions for outpatients at our premier military hospitals   Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital   This investigation must include         an inspection of each outpatient facility to assess the quality and safety of each facility       a report on the number of caseworkers and an assessment of their training and workload       a review of the paperwork requirements for recovering soldiers       a report of on the accessibility and quality of psychological counseling for soldiers and their families       and a remediation plan  including a timeline and description of the steps the Department of Defense will take to improve outpatient care and improve and simplify benefits for wounded military personnel        We insist that you initiate the Inspector General review immediately  to insure that recovering troops and their families are treated with the care and respect they deserve   With wounded heroes suffering every day under these unacceptable conditions  we respectfully ask that this review be given the highest priority and be completed in the shortest amount of time possible   Our wounded veterans deserve no less          Sincerely                                                                          Patty Murray  United States Senator         Barbara A  Mikulski                                                             United States Senator
