                                                             News Release          Murray Celebrates the Start of Channel Deepening Project in Vancouver Murray Commends Broad Coalition for Working to Improve Washington s Economy  Senator Outlines Three Priorities to Protect Channel s Future    For Immediate Release  Thursday  August 4  2005     VANCOUVER  WA     U S  Senator Patty Murray today joined more than 150 leaders in Southwest Washington to celebrate the start of dredging on the Columbia River channel deepening project          On a brilliant sunny morning at Frenchman s Bar Park  Murray spoke of the economic benefits of a deeper channel         We all know that the Columbia River is the economic engine of the entire region  and we  re making that engine even stronger and more powerful   Murray told the audience    A deeper channel means more trade  more jobs  and more opportunity  and that  s something we can all celebrate         Murray noted that the channel improvement will produce benefits throughout the region         A deeper channel is going to make life better for farmers in Central and Eastern Washington  for businesses up and down the Columbia  for communities in Washington and Oregon  and for families throughout the region   Murray said          Murray also congratulated the diverse coalition that came together to push for improving the channel           If you hadn  t built the consensus  if you hadn  t formed a broad coalition  and if you hadn  t kept at it  we wouldn  t be here celebrating today   Your work here is a model of how we can come together to solve problems  not only here in Southwest Washington  but throughout the state         Murray has used her position on the Energy and Water Subcommittee to secure  25 million for the project since 2001   Though President Bush has not supported Channel Deepening in previous budgets  thanks to the bipartisan work of the Washington and Oregon Congressional delegation  this year he called for  15 million in funding for the project  and Murray worked to include the entire amount in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006     In addition  both the states of Oregon and Washington have each committed their share of  27 7 million each         Murray urged participants to use the same energy and commitment to maximize the investment in the river          Now that we  ve climbed the mountain and started construction  I want to make sure that we protect this investment  and that means three things   Murray said        Repair the jetties at the mouth of the Columbia River    According to the Army Corps of Engineers  there is a 20 percent chance of a jetty failing this year   Next year  the odds of failure double to 40 percent   And the year after that  they soar to 60 percent   That is a chance no one us can afford to take   Our investment in the channel will be lost if a jetty breaks  and the mouth of the river is closed   You  re working on it  and I am too   We  ve got to convince the Administration to support us   In the meantime  I worked to secure  17 million in the Senate for jetty repair       Providing Adequate Funding for the Army Corps of Engineers     To protect our investment  we need to a Corps budget that will meet the needs throughout the entire Columbia River system   I  m fighting for a budget that protects shallow water ports  repair dams and locks  and maintains infrastructure   This system is worth protecting  and I  m proud to be your partner on that front      Improving the region s transportation infrastructure    Over the next 20 years  rail traffic will grow dramatically  and more trucks will be using the I 5 corridor   We  re trouble with congestion today  so we  ve got a lot of work ahead of us to meet those challenges   That  s why Congressman Baird and I secured  8 million to study the I 5 crossing   Like the feasibility study for Channel Deepening 10 years ago  this new bridge study will give us the blueprint we need to move forward          The program included remarks by Dave Hunt  executive director of the Columbia River Channel Coalition   Vancouver Mayor Royce Pollard  Colonel Thomas O Donavan  U S  Army Corps of Engineers   U S  Senator Gordon Smith  R Ore   U S  Rep  Brian Baird  D Vancouver   and Agriculture Undersecretary J B  Penn        On June 15th  channel deepening construction began at River Mile 3 to River Mile 16 near Astoria  Oregon   The contractor  Great Lakes Dredge and Docks  has completed deepening of the first 7 miles to date  Three feet of dredging will occur in parts of the river from Portland to the mouth of the river in Astoria  allowing newer and larger ships with deeper drafts to navigate up the Columbia River           This project will benefit the economy of our region   It will get those ships that have been light loaded for so many years actually fully loaded so they can transport Northwest cargo all over the world   said Dave Hunt  Executive Director of the Columbia River Channel Coalition       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Good morning   Today is a great day for the people  the economy  and future of Southwest Washington   I am really thrilled to help you celebrate the start of construction on the Channel Deepening project        We all know that the Columbia River is the economic engine of the entire region    and thanks to you    we  re making that engine even stronger and more powerful   A deeper channel means more trade  more jobs  and more opportunity    and that  s something we can all celebrate        This day has been a long time in the making   More than a decade ago  a group of leaders came together at Vancouver Landing to share a vision   They saw a Columbia River that could support more commerce   Today  that vision is becoming a reality   When I think about this project  I  m most excited about two things         First  you came together to make something really big happen   I talk to people all over the state who have ideas about how to help their communities  and sometimes they don  t know how to move forward   I tell them to do what you  ve done build a consensus in the community  build a broad coalition  and then don  t stop until you win        If there is one thing I can say about this group    it  s that you never give up   And I know that first hand by working with so many of you over the years   At times  it seemed like an uphill battle  but you never gave up        For many years  I can remember fighting on the Energy and Water Committee to set aside money for the channel without the support of the Administration   It wasn  t easy  but with your help  I did it all five years   And I would like to thank Senator Smith for helping to bring the Administration around to this project           We all celebrated when President Bush came out to the Port of Portland and announced his support for the Channel Deepening   And this year    for the first time    the President sent us a budget that supported Channel Deepening   He proposed  15 million  and on the Energy and Water Committee  I secured  15 million        If you hadn  t built the consensus  if you hadn  t formed a broad coalition  and if you hadn  t kept at it  we wouldn  t be here celebrating today   Your work here is a model of how we can come together to solve problems    not only here in Southwest Washington    but throughout the state        The other thing I  m really excited is the impact this project will have   A deeper channel is going to make life better for farmers in Central and Eastern Washington  for businesses up and down the Columbia  for communities in Washington and Oregon  and for families throughout the region   I want to thank all of the coalition leaders and members    on both sides of the Columbia    for your tremendous work        Everyone here played a role in helping us reach this day    and I just want to give my special thanks to Ken O  Halloren  Larry Paulson  Dave Ripp  Lanny Cawley  Dave Hunt  and I could go on all day    but we  ve got a channel to deepen   Now that we  ve climbed the mountain and started construction    I want to make sure that we protect this investment    and that means three things        First  we need to repair the jetties at the mouth of the river   According to the Army Corps of Engineers  there is a 20 percent chance of a jetty failing this year   Next year  the odds of failure double to 40 percent   And the year after that    they soar to 60 percent   That is a chance no one us can afford to take        Our investment in the channel will be lost if a jetty breaks  and the mouth of the river is closed   You  re working on it    and I am too   We  ve got to convince the Administration to support us   In the meantime  I worked to secure  17 million in the Senate for jetty repair        Second  to protect our investment  we need to a Corps budget that will meet the needs throughout the entire Columbia River system   I  m fighting for a budget that protects shallow water ports  repair dams and locks  and maintains infrastructure   This system is worth protecting  and I  m proud to be your partner on that front        Finally  to protect our investment  we need to improve the roads and rails throughout the region   Over the next 20 years  rail traffic will grow dramatically  and more trucks will be using the I 5 corridor   We  re trouble with congestion today  so we  ve got a lot of work ahead of us to meet those challenges        That  s why Congressman Baird and I secured  8 million to study the I 5 crossing   Like the feasibility study for Channel Deepening 10 years ago  this new bridge study will give us the blueprint we need to move forward   I want to thank Congressman Baird for your great leadership   Everyone in the 3rd District has a great champion in Brian  and I  m proud to work with him        In closing  all of you have shown that you know how to reach out  work together and get results for the greater good   Now let  s keep that same spirit going as we protect our investment and build a stronger future   Congratulations
