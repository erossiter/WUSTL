people        UPDATE  This bill passed the Senate 93 1 on October 20th   Senator Murray s remarks on the Senator floor follow      Mrs  MURRAY  Mr  President  I am very pleased that the Senate is now considering the Transportation Treasury bill  formally known as H R  3058  It is the appropriations bill for the Departments of Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and related agencies for fiscal year 2006          This bill covers areas such as infrastructure  public housing  and the judiciary that are critical to millions of American families and to keeping our economy strong  For our country to reach its full potential  we need to invest in the priorities that are in this bill  Today  many people do not feel very secure about the future  They feel as though they are one slip away from losing their job  or they are worried about the fact that they will not be able to retire or to pay for a trip to the doctor if their child gets sick           To make America strong again  we need to invest at home  We need to invest in our communities  in our schools  in our people  and in our infrastructure  That is what the bill now before us does           In the last few months  we have seen how important it is to have a strong and reliable infrastructure  Tonight I want to offer my colleagues an overview of what this bill funds and some of the most important investments  but first I want to note that several things have changed since last year           As my colleagues know  our Senate subcommittee has changed significantly  Last year  three separate appropriations subcommittees were responsible for funding the agencies that are now in this bill  Even so  the Senate did not have the opportunity to debate and amend any of the appropriations bills that funded these agencies  Since then  the Appropriations Committee has been restructured  As a result  this bill was crafted by one new and very much larger committee  We now have 19 members  Only the Defense Subcommittee is as large           Fortunately for all of us  we have Senator Bond as our very able chairman  Senator Bond has demonstrated his skill and fair mindedness time and again during his leadership of the former VA Subcommittee  This year  he continues to demonstrate his leadership  and the proof is in this bill  It was reported unanimously by both the subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee back in July           In addition to the changes we witnessed in the last year  we have seen dramatic changes in the 12 weeks since we marked up this bill  First and foremost has been the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  More than 1 million people were forced to evacuate the region  including low income citizens who remain eligible for housing assistance from HUD  Today  because of the devastation  even more people are eligible for Federal housing assistance           Other Federal agencies that are funded in this bill have responded to the hurricanes  In the Department of Transportation  the Maritime Administration has deployed ships from the Ready Reserve fleet to the gulf to assist in recovery efforts  DOT personnel have also been involved in the effort to obtain trucks and buses to move personnel and equipment  Amtrak assisted in the evacuation of storm victims from both New Orleans and Houston  The hurricanes showed us that we need workable plans to evacuate large numbers of low income residents who depend on public transit  I truly hope the Department of Transportation and FEMA are hard at work on those plans           In the judiciary  Hurricane Katrina has required the emergency relocation of 36 Federal judges and more than 400 staff  The New Orleans office of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has been abandoned  as have the Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts for Eastern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi           Another change since we marked up this bill in July concerns energy prices  Back in late July  the average price per gallon of regular gasoline was  2 27  Today it is more than 25 percent higher  Gas costs more than  3 a gallon in many parts of our country  High gas prices are hurting our families  our businesses  and our communities  This price spike is already causing revenues to our Federal and State transportation trust funds to diminish  That could have a serious impact on the ability of our States to finance their highest priority road projects           The recent spike in fuel prices has also further undermined the financial condition of the Nation s airlines  Since we first marked up this bill  another two major U S  carriers and one regional carrier have entered bankruptcy  That threatens the long term availability of air service to the communities across the country and to tens of thousands of jobs           Also  since we first marked up this appropriations bill  we passed the authorization bill and made significant progress on Amtrak reform  First  just prior to the August recess  thanks again to the very able work of Chairman Bond  the Congress passed the conference report on the surface transportation bill  now known as SAFETEA LU  This law will now guide the direction of our Federal highway  transit  and highway safety programs for the next 5 years           Secondly  following the markup of this bill  the Senate Commerce Committee reported a comprehensive Amtrak reform bill  That bill has yet to come before the Senate  but it is important legislation that must inform this subcommittee s deliberations going forward           So as I said earlier  we have seen some dramatic and in some cases tragic changes since the Appropriations Committee first reported this bill  But even with those changes  this bill deserves the strong bipartisan support of the Senate           This bill totals more than  141 4 billion  That is more than  11 6 billion over the President s request  I think the best feature of this bill is that it rejects many of the painful and unwise cuts that were proposed in the President s budget  Whether it is funding to continue rail service in the country or building new runways to relieve congestion at our airports  to construct new housing for low income seniors and for our disabled  whether it is to invest in community development or provide needed assistance to taxpayers or aggressively enforce our drug laws  this bill rejects the President s painful cuts  Instead  our bill invests the funds to make our world safer and advance the needs of our infrastructure and our people           I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd for providing our subcommittee with the necessary allocation so we could make these critical investments  Chairman Bond also deserves a great deal of credit for ensuring that even with so many new programs now under our jurisdiction  every program was thoroughly reviewed and considered           I thank Chairman Bond for treating me as a full partner in this endeavor  His door has always been open to me  While we do not see eye to eye on every funding level and every provision in the bill  I think the bill we are considering is truly an effort at bipartisan consensus  and I thank the chairman for that           I would like to review some of the priorities in this bill  starting with aviation  This bill rejects the administration s proposal to slash funding for our Nation s airports  It also preserves funding for the essential Air Service Program so that rural communities across the country will continue to receive air service           I am also pleased that the bill attempts to boost hiring of our air safety inspectors at the FAA  Last year this committee fully funded the President s request for safety inspectors  What happened  The FAA downsized that office by more than 300 people  With the Nation s airlines in turmoil and all the airlines seeking to cut costs  this is not the time to cut our safety inspector workforce as I described in detail on the Senate floor just a few weeks ago       For Amtrak  our bill includes  1 45 billion  That is a 20 percent increase over the current year  Now  the DOT inspector general testified that Amtrak would require between  1 4 billion and  1 5 billion next year to maintain all of its current routes and services  This funding recommendation falls right in the middle of that range  This bill also recommends some reforms for Amtrak in the interest of helping Amtrak cut costs  The President s budget asks that we throw Amtrak into bankruptcy and leave 22 million Americans stranded on the platform  This bill categorically rejects that approach and preserves all current rail routes so a meaningful debate on reform can continue without the threat of a crisis           Funding for the judiciary is up 6 6 percent  That is slightly higher than the level that was passed by the House of Representatives  and I am confident that this funding level will enable the judiciary to continue its important work without the threat of staff layoffs           Within the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the President proposed to move the Community Development Block Grant Program over to the Department of Commerce and cut its funding by more than a third  I am very pleased to say that we will continue to fund CDBG in this bill  and we limited the funding cut to just 8 percent           Some of the more damaging cuts in the President s HUD budget include cuts to new construction for housing for the disabled and cuts to funding for housing funds for AIDS patients  and those have been rejected           Within the Executive Office of the President  the White House proposed to cut funding for the drug law enforcement activities of the high intensity drug tracking areas by more than 50 percent  Our bill  however  rejects that cut entirely and fully funds the HIDTA Program           Turning to Federal workers  this bill provides a 3 1 percent pay raise for all Federal employees  It is an identical adjustment for military and civilian workers           I am also very pleased that Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski reached a compromise on competitive sourcing  It will provide a level playing field when it comes to efforts by the Federal Government to contract out Federal jobs           As I have outlined  this bill makes some critical investments in our transportation infrastructure  in our ability to house the poor and administer justice  and the pressing needs  of course  of our highways and airways and transit systems  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill so we can strengthen our local communities and our entire country           I will repeat the words of my chairman  Senator Bond  and encourage my colleagues to bring their amendments to the Senate floor  The sooner we start these amendments  the sooner we can review them and perhaps get them adopted  One thing I do know is  as of right now  there is still hope that the St  Louis Cardinals are going to reverse course and win the National League Championship Series  I cannot guarantee to any of my colleagues that Chairman Bond is going to greet their amendments warmly  but I know he will greet them less warmly if the Cardinals are eliminated this evening  so I suggest to all my colleagues they bring their amendments to the floor as soon as possible so they can be considered and we can move forward on this bill
