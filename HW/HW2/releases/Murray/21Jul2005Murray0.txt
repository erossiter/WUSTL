                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Senator Murray s Statement on TTHUD at Committee Mark Up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Murray  Senator Murray s Statement on TTHUD at Committee Mark Up  07 21 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray s Statement on TTHUD at Committee Mark Up    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 21  2005    This is the first time the Full Committee will mark up a bill that combines the Departments of Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  HUD  and several related agencies   The Subcommittee    which now has 19 Members    enthusiastically reported the bill to the Full Committee on Tuesday by a unanimous vote   Our increased membership is matched only by the expansion in the number of dollars and programs for which we are responsible   The bill that we will report this afternoon includes total budgetary resources of more than  141 4 billion   That s more than  11 6 billion over the President  s request          There are many good things to say about this bill   I think the best feature is that it rejects many of the punitive and wrong headed cuts proposed in the President  s budget   Whether it is funding to  continue rail service in our country  build new runways to alleviate congestion at our airports  construct new housing for our low income seniors and the disabled  invest in community development  or aggressively enforce our drug laws    this bill rejects the President  s painful cuts   Instead  our bill invests the funds to make our world safer and to advance the needs of our infrastructure and our people        I want to thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd for providing our Subcommittee with the necessary allocation of funds to allow us make these investments   Chairman Bond also deserves a great deal of credit for ensuring that    even with so many new programs now under our jurisdiction     every program was thoroughly reviewed and considered   I want to thank Chairman Bond for treating me as a full partner in this endeavor   His door has always been open to me   And while we don  t see eye to eye on every funding level and every provision in this bill  I think the bill we re considering is truly an effort at bipartisan consensus   I d like to review some of the priorities in this bill  starting with aviation       Aviation   This bill rejects the Administration  s proposal to slash funding for our nation  s airports   It also preserves funding for the essential air service program so that rural communities across the country will continue to receive air service          I am pleased that the bill attempts to boost hiring of air safety inspectors at the FAA   Last year  this Committee fully funded the President  s request for safety inspectors     What happened   The FAA downsized this office by more than 300 people   With the nation  s airlines in turmoil  and all the airlines seeking to cut costs  now is not the time to cut our safety inspector workforce       Amtrak   For Amtrak  once our first manager  s amendment is adopted  the bill will include  1 45 billion    a twenty percent increase over the current year  s levels   The DOT Inspector General testified to us that Amtrak would require between  1 4 and  1 5 billion next year if it is to maintain all of its current routes and services    Our funding recommendation falls right in the middle of that range         This bill also recommends some reforms for Amtrak in the interest of helping Amtrak cut costs     It would be my preference that Amtrak  s reform provisions be considered fully by the Commerce Committee  and I understand that they will be having a mark up of an Amtrak reform bill shortly         The President  s budget asks that we throw Amtrak into bankruptcy and leave 22 million Americans stranded on the platform   This bill categorically rejects that approach and preserves all current rail routes so a meaningful debate on reform can continue without the threat of a crisis           Judiciary   Funding for the Judiciary is up 6 6 percent    slightly higher than the level passed by the House of Representatives    I am confident that this funding level will continue to enable the Judiciary to continue its important work without any threat of staff layoffs        HUD   Within the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the President proposed to move the Community Development Block Grant program over to the Department of Commerce and to cut the funding by more than a third   I am pleased to say that we will continue to fund CDBG in this bill  though funding will be reduced about 8 percent once our initial amendment is adopted    Some of the more damaging cuts in the President  s HUD budget    including cuts to new construction for housing for the disabled  and cuts to funding for housing funds for AIDS patients    have been rejected         Drug Enforcement   Within the Executive Office of the President  the White House proposed to cut funding for the drug law enforcement activities of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas by more than 50 percent   Our bill  however  rejects this cut entirely and fully funds the HIDTA program   This bill provides a 3 1 percent pay raise for all Federal employees    an identical adjustment for military and civilian workers         Federal Employees   Also  on a matter relating to Federal employees  I am very pleased the Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski were able to reach a compromise on competitive sourcing to provide for a level playing field when it comes to efforts by the federal government to contract out federal jobs         Winery Fees   I m pleased that this bill rejects new fees on wineries that the President proposed   Specifically  the Administration proposed increasing taxes or creating new fees on wineries in their fiscal year 2006 budget request   These fees would impose an unfair burden on small and family run wineries  and this bill rightly rejects them         It s clear that these fees would serve no benefit of the wine industry  despite the Administration s claims   I want to thank Chairman Bond for working with me to ensure that these new wine taxes did not make it into our bill       But this is not the end of this issue   Last week  the Administration sent up this proposal to the House and Senate and is working on passing this as stand alone legislation or as part of the budget reconciliation process   On behalf of the wineries in Washington state and all across the country  I want to make it very clear that I will continue to oppose any effort to impose these illegitimate taxes on wineries          Campaign Finance Reform Provision   While I am clearly supportive of the overall bill  I do want to raise a concern about the inclusion of a campaign finance reform provision   I have raised this with Chairman Bond previously   The bill includes a permanent change in law that allows Members   leadership PACs to make direct donations to political parties   That controversial provision certainly requires sufficient debate on the Senate floor   I m fear that this debate will take the focus off the very real questions about the programs in this bill and how they are funded   So I hope  as the bill moves forward  that the bipartisan Senate leadership will take a second look at this provision and remove it         In summary  Mr  Chairman  I want to thank you and Chairman Bond  as well as the staff on both the majority and minority side  for all the work that has gone into the drafting of this bill
