                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Senator Murray Objects to  Business as Usual  Mine Safety Nominee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Murray  Senator Murray Objects to  Business as Usual  Mine Safety Nominee  06 12 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray Objects to  Business as Usual  Mine Safety Nominee      For Immediate Release  Monday  June 12  2006     I am deeply troubled that just months after 12 miners were killed in the Sago disaster  the Senate Leadership is trying to turn the enforcement of our mine safety laws over to a former coal company executive who has no background in miner health and safety          When Richard Stickler testified at his HELP Committee confirmation hearing in January  he told me that he believes current mine safety laws are  adequate    I could not disagree more  and neither could the House and Senate  which recently passed the most comprehensive set of mine safety improvements in a generation         I was so disappointed in Mr  Stickler s responses at the hearing that I asked him to answer further questions in writing   In his reply  Mr  Stickler could not suggest a single way to improve mine safety   We need a leader at the Mine Safety and Health Administration who will not accept the status quo that has cost miners their lives        I am also disappointed that the Leadership is ignoring Senate tradition and seeking to override the valid concerns of Senator Byrd  who represents the Sago families        With America s miners risking their lives everyday and a new law that must be vigorously enforced  we cannot entrust mine safety to someone who has not shown the background  passion or desire to fight for the health and safety of America s miners   When it comes to mine safety  we cannot tolerate business as usual
