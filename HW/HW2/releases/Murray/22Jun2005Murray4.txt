                                                               News Release          Murray Celebrates 33rd Anniversary of Title IX  Urges Protection of Law Senator applauds Seattle Storm  speaks of own experiences with athletics    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 22  2005     WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today joined with a bi partisan group of colleagues from the House and Senate as well as Olympic gold medalists and young female athletes to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of Title IX and discuss her concerns with recent efforts to weaken it            There is no doubt that Title IX has opened doors for women between the time I went to school and my daughter went to school  The challenge for all of us  today  is to make sure those doors of opportunity stay open for our granddaughters and great granddaughters     Senator Murray said       I urge Secretary Spellings and President Bush to protect existing Title IX policies and give every young girl in America the chance to experience the roar of a crowd   and not just cheer from the sidelines           On March 17  2005  the U S  Department of Education issued a new Title IX policy that threatens to reverse the decades of progress women and girls have made in sports   Under the Administration  s   Clarification     schools can now claim they are fully meeting women s interests in sports based simply on the responses  or lack of responses  to an e mail survey asking female students about their interests in sports   This under the radar attack on Title IX s application to athletics was issued without public notice or opportunity for public comment          The only thing this policy   clarifies   is that the Administration is willing to use stealth tactics to reverse decades of progress for young women and girls  I am committed to doing all that I can to protect Title IX and the future of every girl in Washington state and around the country who dreams of making the team  wearing a uniform  or winning an athletic scholarship     Murray said        Full transcript of Senator Murray s remarks follow     Since 1972  Title IX has opened the doors to athletics  education and success for millions of young women across America  For thirty three years the program has increased participation under Republican and Democratic administrations alike  because Title IX is not about politics   it is about helping young women realize their dreams         I am here today because I know that behind all the statistics  the lives of many women have been improved because of the changes brought about through Title IX  I ve seen how Title IX has changed the experiences of the women in my own family          The atmosphere was much different when I went to school thirty years ago  Back then at Washington State University  I could participate in just a few sports and women receiving athletic scholarships was unheard of  Fifteen years later it was amazing to watch my own daughter choose to play soccer  learning to be part of a team  cheering each other on  and learning how to be gracious in victory and defeat   The difference between my daughter s generation and my own could not be more stark   One of my favorite memories is when I watched my daughter s high school friends compete in the High School Basketball Championships when she was a junior  When they won the state championship it was a dream come true         Women of my generation never had the chance to go to college on a sports scholarship  even though many deserved them  The difference is that some of my daughter s friends have done just that          And I could not be more proud of my home state of Washington which this year not only became the first state in the nation to boast two women Senators and a woman Governor  but is also home to the reigning WNBA champions    the Seattle Storm        Let me tell you what one member of the Storm  Sue Bird  had to say about the difference Title IX has made in her own life          Title IX had a direct result with me  It s because of Title IX that I m able to play basketball now  and that I was able to play in high school and college and so on   I think it s done great things for women in sports           Now not all girls    and not all boys    will be state champions or the next Sue Bird or Olympic Stars  But all of them should have the chance to learn to work together  do their best  fight hard  and be proud of their own abilities  Isn t that what America is all about         There is no doubt that Title IX has opened doors for women between the time I went to school and my daughter went to school  The challenge for all of us  today  is to make sure those doors of opportunity stay open for our granddaughters and great granddaughters   Our civil rights laws  represent our attempt to build a nation of equal opportunity  finally guaranteeing that every child has the chance to reach her dreams         I am very concerned that the Department of Education  s new   clarification    creates a major loophole through which schools can avoid their duty to provide equal opportunity in sports    In fact  the only thing this policy clarifies is that the Administration is willing to use stealth tactics to reverse decades of progress for young women and girls  I am committed to doing all that I can to protect Title IX and the future of every girl in Washington state and around the country who dreams of making the team  wearing a uniform  or winning an athletic scholarship             I urge Secretary Spellings and President Bush to protect existing Title IX policies and give every young girl in America the chance to experience the roar of a crowd   and not just cheer from the sidelines
