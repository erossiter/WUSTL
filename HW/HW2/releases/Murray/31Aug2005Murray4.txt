                                                                                               News Release          Murray  Clinton  Dr  Wood s Resignation Tremendous Loss to FDA  Scientific Integrity and Women s Health Call for Senate Hearing on Plan B in Letter to HELP Committee Chairman Enzi    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  August 31  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Senators Patty Murray  D WA  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   were dismayed to learn that Dr  Susan Wood  Assistant Commissioner for Women  s Health and Director of the Office of Women  s Health  resigned from the FDA today citing concerns about the FDA s process for considering the Plan B application for over the counter status              The FDA and the American people lost a strong voice for scientific integrity in Dr  Wood   It is deeply disturbing that an agency long recognized for making decisions based on sound science has become so politicized that one of its most widely respected  long serving veterans would feel disillusioned enough to quit in protest   they said            Dr  Wood s statement of resignation confirms what Senators Murray and Clinton have contended for two years    that the science has taken a backseat to politics in the FDA s decisionmaking process for Plan B     I have spent the last 15 years working to ensure that science informs good health policy decisions   I can no longer serve as staff when scientific and clinical evidence  fully evaluated and recommended for approval by the professional staff here  has been overruled   said Dr  Wood in a statement released today              Unfortunately this is just the latest in a long list of examples of the Bush Administration suppressing science when it doesn t fit their political agenda   said the Senators          Senators Clinton and Murray underscored that today  s resignation only intensifies the need for the Senate to examine the extended delays surrounding the over the counter application status of Plan B emergency contraceptives   The Senators sent the following letter to Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Michael Enzi again urging him to uphold his promise to hold a hearing and calling on him to ensure that the work of the HELP Committee and Congress are not undermined by politics and ideology at the FDA                                                                                          August 31  2005            The Honorable Michael Enzi  Chairman  Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pension  Washington  D C  20510         Dear Chairman Enzi       In light of the FDA  s recently broken promise to issue a decision on the over the counter application of Plan B by September 1st  we write to ask that you fulfill the commitment you made in July to investigate the source of the agency  s continued delays            As U S  Senators we make a commitment to protect the safety and well being of the American public and we take this responsibility seriously   It is both disappointing and frustrating that our job has been hindered by the disingenuous actions of HHS and the FDA with regard to Plan B emergency contraceptives          In a July 13th letter  HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt gave you his word that a decision on Plan B  s over the counter application would be made by September 1           I have spoken to the FDA  and  based on the feedback I have received  the FDA will act on this application by September 1  2005          Based on Secretary Leavitt  s promise to you that the FDA would deliver a yes or no answer by September 1  we lifted our hold on the President  s nominee to head the agency          The President now has his FDA administrator  but the American public still does not have an answer on Plan B            Mr  Chairman  the Secretary has not only broken a promise to you and to Congress  but he broke his promise to the American people            This process has raised fundamental questions about the FDA  s drug approval practices and the future independence and credibility of the agency          The Senate HELP Committee has worked diligently to provide the FDA with the resources necessary to review pharmaceutical applications in a timely fashion while still ensuring the safety of the American public   Our Committee has taken seriously our responsibility to write and enact laws like the Prescription Drug Marketing Act to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic delays in bringing safe  effective drugs to consumers   It is critical to the future of the drug approval process that the laws Congress has worked so hard to pass not be undermined by politics and ideology          Mr  Chairman  you have been very fair and respectful in working with us on our concerns over Plan B   You also made a commitment to us that you would hold bring leaders of the FDA before our Committee if the agency dug in its heels and continued to further delay this application process            A delay is not a decision  and no amount of semantics can change that   The Secretary can play word games all he wants  but it is time for the FDA to stop playing games with the health and well being of millions of American women          We ask you now to fulfill your commitment to hold a hearing of the HELP Committee to look into the serious issues of independence and credibility that FDA Administrator Lester Crawford  s continued delays on Plan B have raised about the agency as a whole          The FDA has known since last July that the application under consideration only allowed over the counter access for girls 16 and older   Yet  it waited a year and one month to start a process for determining how to implement such an age restriction   These concerns should have been dealt with within the normal FDA review process  not at the eleventh hour          The FDA  s only criteria for approval of Plan B should be safety and efficacy  not politics or ideology            Day by day the public  s confidence in the FDA  s ability to make decisions based on scientific evidence of safety and efficacy is eroding   We urge you to honor your promise to hold a hearing and insist that action be brought swiftly on Plan B  s application          Sincerely             U S  Senator Patty Murray   U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   Cc  The Honorable Edward M  Kennedy  Ranking Member
