                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Stem Cell Bill Passes Senate with Murray s Vote  04 11 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          Stem Cell Bill Passes Senate with Murray s Vote Senator Murray Speaks Out on Expanding Stem Cell Research    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  April 11  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  voted to expand stem cell research   With Murray s support  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  S 5  passed the full Senate 63 34         During today s debate  Murray spoke in personal terms on the Senate floor  where she discussed her father s experience with Multiple Sclerosis when she was growing up   Murray said families today deserve the hope and potential cures that were not available to her family years ago         In the coming weeks  the House of Representatives is expected to take up and pass the Senate version  The President has threatened to veto the bill          Today the Senate sent a strong message that we stand with patients  doctors and scientists in favor of expanding research and offering hope for desperately needed cures   Murray said    As this bill moves closer to the President s desk  I hope he will finally decide to put science and American families above politics and ideology         Senator Murray s full remarks follow    Mr  President  I come to the floor today to speak out in strong support of promising research that can save lives and bring hope to millions of Americans   I will vote for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007  and I urge all of our colleagues to do the same   More importantly  I urge President Bush to finally hear the voices of scientists  medical leaders  patients  and more than 500 organizations who have said loud and clear   it is time for promising research to move forward in this country        It s time to take the handcuffs off of our scientists  so they can pursue the cures that Americans are waiting for   For too long  this President has allowed politics and ideology to trump life saving research   We need to correct that mistake  and this bill shows us how          Throughout the country  citizens are suffering from diseases like Parkinson s  Alzheimer s  diabetes  and MS   They and their families are looking to us for help   We have scientists and researchers who are so eager to provide that help  but today their hands are tied by arbitrary restrictions that President Bush imposed back in 2001   I believe we can allow research on embryonic stem cells  and we can do so with the strong ethical guidelines that are required under this legislation        The President s Restrictions Have Hindered Progress   In August of 2001  President Bush greatly limited the number of embryonic stem cells available for federally funded research   Those limits were based on inaccurate science and ideology  and they have restricted our ability to make progress    Now at the time  the White House said there were 78 stem cell lines available for federally funded research   But now we know that there are only 21 such lines   Researchers   those men and women that we count on to find cures for the diseases that impact so many    believe it is imperative to have access to newer  more promising stem cell lines that do not pose the risk of contamination        Impact on Scientific Progress and America s Scientific Leadership   The first consequence of the President s restrictions has been to limit hope and to limit progress for families who suffer from these diseases        The second impact has been to push embryonic stem cell research overseas   That means our country is falling behind other countries in a cutting edge field   Because the President imposed arbitrary limits  we are surrendering our scientific leadership to other countries   That can have far reaching consequences for our economy and our future          My home state of Washington is home to world class research institutions like the University of Washington  I want our country and our institutions to be at the leading edge of scientific frontiers  so our country and all of us can benefit from new advances       This Bill   The bill that we are considering today and will vote on this evening will lift the President s arbitrary restrictions and put in place expanded research under strict ethical guidelines   It would direct the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to conduct and support research on stem cells that are derived from frozen embryos now stored in fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed  This bill also promotes research into finding alternative ways to derive stem cells that do not involve the destruction of an embryo   And  as I said  this bill imposes strong ethical guidelines   In fact  the ethical standards in this bill are even stricter than the President s policy       Unique Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells   Embryonic stem cell research is a relatively young field   These cells were not even isolated in humans until 1998   Scientists believe that embryonic stems cells are more valuable than adult stem cells because they can develop into any type of cell or tissue in the body   Just think of all the veterans coming home from Iraq with spinal cord injuries   Think of all the veterans of the First Gulf War who are now being diagnosed with M S   who could be helped by promising research         My Dad   In my own family  I have seen up close and personal the impact that a disease like Multiple Sclerosis can have   When I was just 15 years old  my dad was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis   I saw him   in just a few years   going from working to being someone who was home in a wheelchair every single day  every single minute   For all of the rest of his life  my father was confined to a wheelchair   I can t tell you what a profound impact that had on my family  My mom had to stay home and raise myself and my six brothers and sisters  She had to go back to work and get a job  and she had to stay home and take care of him   all at the same time   It was a very  very difficult time for my family  The medical bills were amazing  The challenges that my family went through because of my dad s illness were incredible   I can only sit here today and imagine what it might have been like had there been a cure for MS   for my family and for thousands of others   When I was growing up  the promise of this type of research wasn t even on the horizon  Today  that potential is in our hands  We need to do everything we can to make sure that research is done so that families like mine have hope and opportunity in the future   I hope that we don t see it continually blocked by policies that put ideology over science  I think it s time to change course and put our government on the side of patients and their families and to give them hope again       NIH Director Supports Expanding Stem Cell   Last month the director of the National Institutes of Health  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  told the us  and I quote         I  it is clear today that American science would be better served and the nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines             The NIH Director said that the existing lines will not be sufficient for the research that needs to be done  and he said that adult stem cells do not have the same potential as embryonic stem cells       Now that s the scientific view of the director of the National Institutes of Health   The Senate and the President would be very wise to heed his counsel        Mr  President  I know what it s like to grow up with someone who has a serious illness  I can only imagine what it would have been like to know that there was hope and a chance for a cure   I know for many  many families out there they ve been waiting for this day in the Senate for us to vote on and pass this important stem cell research bill         I want to commend Senator Harkin for his perseverance in coming back and again pushing this as one of the first pieces of legislation we consider in this Congress   We all it has a ways to go         We know that the President has said he might veto it  but I hope that he doesn t  I hope that he sends a message to some young girl out there who dad has just been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis that we are a country of hope once again  Mr  President  I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation  I look forward to its passage today and moving through conference  and I hope it will be signed by the President of the United States
