Tip Credit  Wage Cut  Unfair Overtime Proposal  and Weakening of 40 Hour Work Week    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 24  2007    Update   Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage              Washington  D C      Today on the Senate floor  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  stood up for America s workers by pushing to raise the federal minimum wage for the first time in 10 years   Murray cited the example of Washington state  where a high minimum wage has supported jobs and economic growth          America s workers have helped our country make tremendous gains in productivity and economic growth  and they deserve to share in the prosperity they ve created   Murray said    Washington State has the highest minimum wage in the country   We are living proof that a livable minimum wage is good for our state economy  good for our small businesses  and good for our citizens       Murray spoke out against three Republican attempts to undermine working families   Murray urged the Senate to reject a  tip credit  proposal that would cost 120 000 Washington workers about  12 000 in income each year  She also spoke out against a Republican plan to force workers to accept  comp time  instead of the overtime pay they are entitled to   And she pushed back against a Republican proposal that would undermine the 40 hour work week       Senator Murray s full remarks follow     Mr  President  America s workers deserve a raise and that s why I rise in strong support of S 2   The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007           America s workers have helped our country make tremendous gains in productivity and economic growth  and they deserve to share in the prosperity they have created   I am very proud to represent a state that has a high minimum wage  and I want to share some of the lessons we ve learned about providing a living wage in my home state of Washington        Mr  President  we need to do the right thing and pass a clean minimum wage bill now without any of the anti worker amendments that may be offered by the other side       The Minimum Wage Has Not Kept Pace    As we have heard  it  s been almost 10 years since Congress last raised the minimum wage   During this time  the real value of that wage has fallen by more than 21    At the same time  the costs of health care  energy  and housing have gone up significantly   As a result  many middle class workers have been squeezed   I can only imagine the challenges that minimum wage workers face everyday while trying to maintain their families and their dignity on  10 000 a year        We can be proud that America s businesses have prospered over the last decade  thanks to a 31  increase in worker productivity and a huge 47  increase in profits   Now it  s time for the least paid of America s workers to share in those gains       Lessons from Washington State    Now during this debate  we ve heard the usual claims that raising the minimum wage hurts businesses   In my home state  that has not been our experience         Washington State has the highest minimum wage in the country   We are living proof that a livable minimum wage is good for our state economy  good for our small businesses  and good for our citizens            In 2006  our state  s average unemployment rate was 4 9     the lowest since 1999         We created 79 000 new jobs         Our poverty rate is 11 9   which is lower than the national average         And our median household income stands at  49 000  much higher than the national average         Our state minimum wage  which is indexed to inflation  has helped make for good labor productivity and a healthy economy in Washington state        We  ve heard from my esteemed colleague    Senator Kennedy  the Chairman of the HELP Committee    that states with higher minimum wages create more small businesses and more jobs   Last year  the Fiscal Policy Institute reported that states with a higher minimum wage created nearly 10 percent more jobs and 5 percent more small businesses   A May 2006 Gallup Poll found that 86  of small business owners thought that raising the minimum wage did not affect their business          Now I could cite statistics like that all day   But I think the best evidence is what continues to happen in my state compared with a neighboring state that has a much lower minimum wage   Washington s minimum wage is  7 93 per hour   Right next door to us  Idaho has a minimum wage at the federal level of  5 15 per hour          Since 1998  when Washington voters passed our minimum wage law  Washington employers have been flooded with job applications from Idaho   Now Washington companies can pick the best qualified workers from the region          On January 11th  the New York Times reported that Washington state businesses have seen great benefits  while Idaho businesses have not   Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to insert this New York Times article by Timothy Egan into the Record at the conclusion of my remarks         The article quotes Don Brunell  the president of the Association of Washington Business   He says that raising the federal minimum wage is   almost a no brainer    Washington  s strong economy is proof that even with the highest minimum wage in the U S   as Mr  Brunell put it   Washington is a great place to do business           Now  some people predicted that small businesses would be hurt in Washington state   Instead  as the article notes  they ve prospered beyond their expectations   So we have the opportunity to do a lot of good here    not just for workers  but also for businesses and for our economy         We Should Pass a Clean Bill    But to do the most good  we ve got to pass a clean bill    one that is free from unrelated tax provisions and one that rejects anti worker amendments        Now historically  Congress has not found it necessary to pair a minimum wage increase with a package of tax giveaways   In fact  since 1936  Congress has raised the minimum wage nine times  but only once has such an increase been paired with tax rollbacks   We should pass a clean bill that gives workers the raise they are long overdue         We Must Protect Workers    In addition  we should not let this bill be used to weaken the rights of America s workers   As the Chairman of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety  I m very troubled by some of the amendments being floated by my Republican colleagues        There are proposals to           attack the 40 hour work week        take away workers  overtime       and force a pay cut on workers who earn their living from tips        There is also a deeply flawed proposal that would change the treatment of professional employer organizations under the Tax code         Protect the 40 Hour Work Week and Overtime    This week    while we try to raise the wages of one group of workers  we must fend off more Republican attacks on working families and their right to earn overtime         We all know how the demands of work and family pull two career parents away from their loved ones all too often these days   For parents  getting their kids to and from school and to after school activities isn t easy  especially when you re forced to work uncertain hours   The uncertainty of having to work    say 50 or 60 hours this week    and then 20 or 30 hours next week would put incredible new strains on overburdened families   Taking away their workplace rights and their ability to collect overtime would be a cruel and unwarranted double hit on America  s working families           The Senate should once again reject these Republican comp time and 40 hour work week proposals because they would force a pay cut on millions of middle class workers   We know that for those workers who are eligible  overtime can amount to some 25  of their yearly income   We should not undermine the ability of working parents to balance their lives and share in the American dream        The Republican comp time proposal would force our workers to take comp time instead of pay   On top of the pay cut  workers would be at the mercy of their employers when it came time to asking to use their accumulated comp time  And we all know that comp time often disappears under employer pressures of deadlines and other productivity needs          I believe this Congress must protect these hard working Americans from an erosion of their quality of life and their ability to spend time with their families   We have to stop these attacks on working families and start moving in the right direction and that should include expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act        Tip Credit Proposal Would Hurt 120 000 Washington State Workers    We also need to protect workers who rely on tips   As we ve heard from my female colleagues on this floor  nearly two thirds of all minimum wage workers are women    Many of them are single parents          Raising the minimum wage can give them a small measure of economic security and the ability to better support their families   Many of these low wage workers are service workers    people like hair dressers  maids and waitresses  And many service workers in Washington State rely on tips as a significant part of their livelihood   We should not support amendments that would undermine the tips that workers rely on   In Washington State it would mean a pay cut of some  12 000 annually for over 120 000 tipped workers      Tax Change Would Undermine Worker Safety and Burden Employers    Finally  I m very concerned about the proposed tax changes for professional employer organizations  PEOs    I fear this change could undermine the fiscal stability of our state unemployment insurance and workers compensation funds  It would also put more burdens on employers who are already playing by the rules         Further  it could reduce worker health and safety protections by undermining the incentives for companies to maintain safe and healthy workplaces   It could also provide an opening for those seeking to change the well established rules of the employer employee relationship under the Fair Labor Standards Act   I believe there should be serious thought and debate in the Congress before we make such fundamental changes in labor law        Conclusion    Mr  President  in conclusion  we can do this right by passing a clean bill that finally gives America s workers the raise they have earned   Over the last 8 years  Washington State has proven that a minimum wage increase is good for our state  s economy  helps economic development  increases small business ownership  and of course helps our workers maintain their quality of life   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill to increase the minimum wage to finally give low income workers the raise they have earned and so richly deserve
