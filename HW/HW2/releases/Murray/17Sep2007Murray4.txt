17  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D  WA  wrote to Robert S  Mueller  Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   calling for an increased FBI presence in Washington state  In her letter  Murray cited recent reporting that revealed a low per capita average of FBI agents in Washington state  Murray also discussed the many unique security challenges Washington state faces including border related terrorism threats  busy seaports  and an abundance of federal land  Given the number and importance of potential targets  I am concerned that the small number of FBI agents in Washington State may have an adverse affect on the safety and security of our citizens  Senator Murray wrote  I look forward to working with you to increase the number of FBI agents to address Washington States terrorism prevention and crime fighting needs  The full text of Murray s letter to Director Mueller is below  September 17  2007 Robert S  Mueller  III  Director  Federal Bureau of Investigation  U S  Department of Justice  Washington  DC 20535 Dear Director Mueller  I write to express my concern with the number of Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  agents in Washington state  Despite Washington states vulnerabilities to terrorist attack and need for a strong federal law enforcement presence  I am troubled by recent news articles that report that Washington state ranks well below other states in terms of per capita FBI agents  and that this is having a negative effect on the safety and security of our citizens  I would like to work with you to increase the number of FBI agents in Washington state  FBI agents in the Seattle FBI office and across Washington state work hard every day to protect our citizens against an endless number of threats  As we depend upon these agents to perform an increasing number of mission functions  however  they must have adequate resources and manpower  According to recent articles in the Seattle Post Intelligencer  the national FBI average is four agents for every 100 000 people  or three per 100 000 people excluding the large FBI presence in the District of Columbia  Virginia and New York  Washington state  however  has only 2 1 agents per 100 000 people and is 35th among the states in per capita FBI agents  For its population of 6 million and numerous potential terrorist targets  Washington state has only 133 agents  53 lower than the 186 agents needed even to bring it up to the national average  I understand that the FBI has a limited number of agents with which to address its counter terrorism mission  as well as its traditional law enforcement mission  I also understand that FBI staffing levels are not subject to an easy per capita distribution or analysis  Given the terrorist threats and federal law enforcement needs in Washington state  however  the low level is troubling  Washington State is home to over six million people  industry leading companies  international seaports and important military facilities  In addition  Washington State contains a significant amount of federal land  including federal trust land for our 29 federally recognized Indian tribes  And finally  Washington state shares an international border with Canada  where terrorist Ahmed Ressam was apprehended on his way to carry out an attack on American soil  and where thousands of people will travel to attend the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics  Given the number and importance of potential targets  I am concerned that the small number of FBI agents in Washington state may have an adverse affect on the safety and security of our citizens  The FBIs low staffing level not only increases Washington states vulnerability to terrorism  it also affects the FBIs crime fighting ability in Washington state  I am very concerned about reports that the FBI may not have enough agents to adequately address the FBIs traditional law enforcement activities  leaving our citizens more vulnerable to crimes  Moreover  while the news articles focus on the staffing in the FBI office in Seattle  the lack of FBI agents makes it difficult to ensure an adequate FBI presence in Southwest Washington and other underserved areas of the state  Thank you for your service to the safety and security of our nation and your attention to this important issue  I look forward to working with you to increase the number of FBI agents to address Washington states terrorism prevention and crime fighting needs  Please do not hesitate to contact my office on this issue  Sincerely  Patty Murray  United States Senator
