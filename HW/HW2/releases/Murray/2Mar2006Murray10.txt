                                                                                                                 News Release          HOUSING   Senator Murray Warns that the President s Housing Budget Will Hurt Families and Undermine Community Development Murray Questions HUD Secretary About Budget Proposal that Cuts Funding to House the Elderly  Disabled  and Vulnerable Families    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 2  2006     Washington  D C      Today at a Senate hearing  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  warned that the President s budget proposal for the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  will hurt families and undermine community development efforts nationwide   Murray is the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees HUD funding   Today she questioned HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson about the President s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2007       Overall  the President s budget would cut HUD funding by 1 8 percent  The president s budget proposes specific cuts  including          Housing for the elderly    cut 26 percent      Housing for the disabled    cut 50 percent      Community Development Block Grants    cut by more than  1 billion      Funding for public housing authorities for utility costs    frozen again  for the 5th year in a row       Funding to keep more than 13 000 public housing properties from falling into dilapidated  decrepit and inhumane conditions    cut 11 percent   Public Housing Capital Fund         Last year  Murray helped fend off some of the most painful cuts from the President s FY 2006 budget proposal   She said that this year she will fight once again to enact a budget resolution that will  keep faith with the people who need HUD assistance the most         Murray said the President s budget reflects the wrong priorities    She noted that while the Administration is proposing to cut  620 million from HUD  it s working to boost spending for Exploration Systems in NASA by more than  860 million           I support the overall goal of space exploration   But when it comes to sending an astronaut to Mars or housing our elderly and disabled neighbors here on earth  there s no doubt where my priorities lie   Murray told Secretary Jackson       Murray has been meeting with housing leaders throughout Washington state in the past few months  In December  she toured public housing facilities in Vancouver   In January  she met with housing leaders and advocates in King County   Last month  she sat down with low income housing leaders in Spokane       Murray is a member of the Senate Budget Committee  which helps set the overall funding blueprint for the coming fiscal year   Murray said that if the funding level for housing is set to low during the current budget process  housing will face step cuts later in the year when the Senate makes specific appropriations based on the overall budget blueprint      Senator Murray s full opening statement at today s hearing with Secretary Jackson follows   Remarks by U S  Senator Patty Murray  Appropriations Committee Hearing on the President s FY 2007  HUD Budget Proposal     It s been more than six months since Hurricane Katrina reminded all of us of the ongoing poverty that grips so many American families   After the storm  millions of us gathered around our television sets and saw vulnerable Americans struggling for their dignity and struggling for their lives       One of the little known facts about Hurricane Katrina was that public housing authorities across the country made heroic efforts to find housing to relocate hurricane victims   I want to commend them for their hard work and compassion         But the sad fact is that every one of those public housing authorities already had long waiting lists of local families who had been waiting years for housing to become available   That means the efforts to house Katrina victims pushed other poor families further down a long waiting list   Those families who were pushed down the list were  in most cases  no less poor  no less desperate and  in some cases  no less homeless  than the Katrina victims   And the vast majority of them are still waiting for an available unit today       We shouldn  t be a in a position where    if we respond to a disaster    our only choice is to hurt families who have been waiting years for housing   But that s the position we find ourselves in today    and there is one reason why    years of misguided housing budgets       Now  we re once again working on a new budget for the coming fiscal year   We should not make the same mistakes again   Unfortunately  that s exactly what the President s budget would do       HUD has a critical mission    to promote home ownership  ensure safe rental housing  house the homeless  rejuvenate desolate communities  and provide hope to a great many struggling Americans   We are talking about the impoverished elderly   We are talking about disabled citizens who have unique housing needs   We are talking about helping the working poor climb the economic ladder           I have often said that budgets are about priorities   And it is clear that the Bush Administration  s priorities are not with the missions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development   The President  s budget for the coming fiscal year proposes to increase discretionary spending by 3 2 percent   But within that total  HUD is singled out for a cut of 1 8 percent   The Community Development Block Grant program  is slated for a cut of more than a billion dollars   All funds for the HOPE VI program    a program designed to demolish and replacing our most decrepit public housing units    is proposed for elimination in the Bush budget         In fact  the Administration  s budget goes even further and calls on the Congress to eliminate the funding that we have already appropriated for this program in 2006    Housing for the elderly is cut by 26 percent  while housing for the disabled is cut by 50 percent   These proposed cuts come at a time when every study tells us that these populations are growing    and growing rapidly         One thing that has been clear to every American this winter is the fact that utility costs have risen dramatically   It seems that everyone knows that    except for the Bush Administration   While utility costs have risen dramatically for public housing authorities across America  the Bush Administration wants to freeze operating funds for public housing authorities for the fifth year in a row       Funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund    which is intended to keep over 13 000 public housing properties from falling into dilapidated  decrepit and inhumane conditions    is singled out for an 11 percent cut         As I said earlier  the President  s budget proposes to increase discretionary spending by 3 2 percent  but all of the rhetoric and public statements by the President and his OMB Director have sought to divide this budget into three separate categories  funding for Defense  funding for homeland security  and funding for everything else         Their implication is clear   In the view of the Bush Administration  programs in this third category    programs that educate our children  prevent disease  or house the underprivileged    are the least worthy of public funds   Within this third category  the President proposes to cut overall spending by 0 5 percent   But for HUD  which falls entirely into this third category  this Administration is proposing a much larger cut of 1 8 percent   The message is clear  the non defense  non homeland security portion of the budget is a low priority for the President  and funding for HUD  s work is an even lower priority       It is worth noting that  while the Administration is proposing to cut the HUD budget by more than  620 million  they are proposing to boost spending for Exploration Systems in NASA by more than  860 million   Like many of my colleagues  I support the overall goal of space exploration   But when it comes to sending an astronaut to Mars or housing our elderly and disabled neighbors here on earth  there s no doubt where my priorities lie        Mr  Chairman  last year  with your strong support  we were able to fend off many of the more painful cuts included in President Bush  s budget for HUD   Unfortunately we were handed an allocation by a budget resolution that I did not support that resulted in our having to accept some of his proposed cuts   Last year  our appropriations bill did cut the Community Development Block Grant program by more than half a billion dollars   We did cut the HOPE VI program by 31 percent         I am a member of the Budget Committee  as you used to be  Mr  Chairman   If we are presented with a budget resolution that continues to cut the Community Development Block Grant program  I am going to be the first Senator out of the box offering amendments to restore those cuts   I hope that  together  you and I can work together toward ensuring that a budget resolution is adopted that will allow us to reject these ill conceived proposals so that we can keep faith with the people who need HUD assistance the most
