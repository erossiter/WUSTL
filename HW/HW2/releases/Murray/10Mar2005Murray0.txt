                                                  News Release          Senator Murray Votes Against Unfair Bankruptcy Reform Bill    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 10  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  voted against a bankruptcy reform bill that would punish ordinary American families   Murray said the bill would especially hurt military families and those struggling with massive medical bills   She expressed her disappointment that Republican leaders blocked attempts to balance the bill protecting the elderly  workers  retirees  victims of identity theft  and others         Despite Senator Murray s  no  vote  the bill  S 256  passed the full Senate 74 25      Senator Murray released the following statement      Today I voted against a bankruptcy bill that puts credit card companies and politics ahead of ordinary Americans   Rather than providing balanced reform  this bill punishes those who have fallen on hard times    particularly our military families and those who are struggling under the weight of soaring medical bills        I have heard from residents across Washington state that the cost of medical care is forcing them into bankruptcy   In fact  a report last summer by the Working for Health Coalition found that half of Washington state bankruptcies were due to rising health care costs   Most of these families are working and more than half have health insurance  but the growing cost of healthcare is so overwhelming it pushes them into bankruptcy   A national study last month found that 61 percent of bankruptcy filers did not seek the medical care they needed   These families deserve help  but instead this bill punishes them for circumstances beyond their control       This bill also fails to adequately protect our military families  particularly our Guard and Reserve members   These patriotic families have had to struggle with half their normal income during long    and often extended    deployments   Many have seen their businesses collapse at home while they ve served overseas   I ve met with Washington state Guard and Reserve families and have seen how they are struggling to meet the financial burdens of long deployments   They deserve a lifeline  not more paperwork  legal fees  and threats from collection agencies   The Senate had an opportunity to protect our soldiers through Senator Durbin s amendment  but that was rejected for a Republican amendment that falls far short   Our military families deserve better          If Republicans had been willing to make the bill less punitive toward ordinary Americans  they would have adopted a number of reasonable amendments in committee and on the Senate floor  but they refused   For example  Republicans blocked an amendment that would have protected workers and retirees if their company files for bankruptcy   Republicans also voted down amendments to ensure the elderly don t lose their homes and to discourage predatory lending   And they even failed to protect people who have had their identities stolen by criminals who then run up huge credit card bills   These are all examples of how Republicans are protecting corporate interests at the expense of vulnerable individuals         This bankruptcy bill also stacks the deck against women and children   For example  this bill will make it harder for single mothers to collect the past due child support they and their children are owed        I m also disappointed that the Senate rejected the Schumer Amendment  which would have assured that those who commit violent crimes at reproductive health facilities against women and doctors do not escape paying their debts and fines by declaring bankruptcy        Looking at the big picture  this bill fits a pattern of Republican proposals that turn the tide against average Americans   Last month  Republicans tipped the scales of justice against working families by limiting their ability to seek compensation for a death or injury caused by a company s negligence   On Monday  Republicans rejected a proposal to raise the minimum wage   Taken together  these actions will make life harder for working families and represent a dangerous trend that threatens average Americans        In the past  I have voted for bankruptcy reform legislation  but today families find themselves in a much different place financially because of the costs of healthcare and military service   Congress should not punish them for things beyond their control with this unbalanced  unfair bill   American families deserve reform  not retribution
