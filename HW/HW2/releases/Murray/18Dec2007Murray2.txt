Proposed Cuts to Homeland Security and Emergency Management Washington State emergency managers  Port of Seattle echo importance of homeland security funding    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  December 18  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  was joined by a group of twenty five Senators to call on President Bush to reject proposed funding cuts to homeland security programs in next year s budget  The letter comes after a recent document from the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  indicated that the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget will slash funds for domestic homeland security and eliminate grant programs that benefit port security  transit security and emergency management     Senator Murray has long worked to increase port security  law enforcement  and emergency responder funding  She is also the co author of the landmark SAFE Port Act which authorized  400 million for port security grants  Unfortunately  real security does not come cheap and cannot be achieved with mere words of support  Murray and the other Senators wrote in the letter  At a time when this Administration asks for hundreds of billions of dollars to conduct its war in Iraq  it should also provide adequate support to protect Americans here at home and reject these misguided cuts to vital homeland security programs  In Washington state  because of a trade reliant economy and large ports in Seattle and Tacoma  port security grants and funding are particularly important   As handlers of the vast majority of this countrys international trade  Ports are on the front line against terrorism  said Tay Yoshitani  CEO of the Port of Seattle  In order to protect against acts that would disrupt shipping  wreak havoc on our economy and harm our citizens  it is critical that Ports receive federal security grant funds to ensure the safety of our citizens and facilities  The safe and efficient flow of goods through our nations ports is essential to the US economy  We applaud Senator Murray and her continuing effort to ensure that seaports and communities throughout this nation are secure from acts of terrorism   In light of recent natural disasters funding for emergency managers is also critical to Washington state   The State of Washington is suffering through our third Presidential Disaster Declaration in the last two years  Cuts to critical federal funding programs such as the Emergency Management Performance Grants will only make it more difficult to respond and recover from these kinds of emergency events  said Steven C  Bailey  Director of Pierce County Department of Emergency Management and President of the Washington State Emergency Management Association   The text of the letter the Senators sent to President Bush follows                                                                                          December 18  2007 President George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    As you prepare your Fiscal Year 2009 Budget to Congress  we write to express our concern about reported cuts to important homeland security grant programs  Specifically  a November 26 document from the Office of Management and Budget indicates that the FY09 Budget will slash funds for domestic homeland security and eliminate grant programs that benefit port security  transit security and emergency management    The Port Security Grant Program funds security improvements at our nations ports  These grants are awarded through a competitive  risk based process to address critical vulnerabilities  conduct training and exercises  and develop the ability of our ports to be full security partners with federal  state and local agencies  Our ports are hubs of our nations economy but remain a vulnerable presence in many communities  As you know  the SAFE Port Act signed into law October 2006 authorized  400 million for port security grants     The Transit Security Grant Program helps secure high risk high consequence transit  provide a deterrent presence  train key security personnel  and conduct public awareness campaigns  The bombings of commuter trains in Madrid and the transit system in London demonstrate that mass transit continues to be a prime target for terrorist attack  Millions of Americans use mass transit every day  and we should continue to provide the funds to keep them safe  As you know  transit security grants were authorized in the 9 11 Recommendations bill signed into law August 2007     The Emergency Performance Management Grant Program allows our communities to develop emergency management plans to respond to a disaster  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the collapse of the I 35W bridge in Minneapolis  Minnesota  the California wildfires  and the recent storms in the Pacific Northwest highlight the critical importance of effective  pre incident disaster planning in all of our communities  These emergency response plans are developed at the local level  by local officials who are most familiar with the capabilities and needs of their communities  As you know  the Emergency Performance Management Grant Program was authorized in the 9 11 Recommendations bill    These homeland security programs were all authorized by legislation this Administration supported and signed into law  Unfortunately  real security does not come cheap and cannot be achieved with mere words of support  At a time when this Administration asks for hundreds of billions of dollars to conduct its war in Iraq  it should also provide adequate support to protect Americans here at home and reject these misguided cuts to vital homeland security programs     The Senators who joined Senator Murray on to the letter included
