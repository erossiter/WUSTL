                                                         News Release          Veterans  Day   Senator Murray Asks  Are We Keeping Our Promise   At a Press Conference and in a Senate Floor Speech  Murray Calls for More Healthcare Funding  PTSD Treatment and Guard and Reserve Services    For Immediate Release  Thursday  November 10  2005          Washington  D C      On the eve of Veterans  Day  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke at a press conference and on the Senate floor to honor America s veterans and to ask if our nation is keeping its promise to those who have served           When these brave men and women signed up to serve our country  we agreed to take care of them   They kept their part of the bargain  Now we need to keep ours   Murray said        Standing with veterans and fellow Democratic members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  Murray spoke about the challenges veterans face in accessing healthcare  the way the VA is treating veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   and the need to update transition and support services for Guard and Reserve members          Murray also warned that House and Senate negotiators must not reduce the VA healthcare funding she secured in the Senate this summer  a point          Senator Murray s remark on the Senate floor  follow      Mr  President  tomorrow our country will celebrate Veterans  Day   We will honor the service and sacrifice that so many Americans have made to keep all of us safe and free         Tomorrow in Washington State    Tomorrow in Washington state I m going to join with local veterans at a breakfast for the Compass Center  which provides services to homeless veterans  a  Service of Remembrance  at the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle  and with a visit to the Washington Soldiers Home in Pierce County   I m looking forward to those visits and the chance to share my thanks with those to those who have sacrificed       Veterans  Day Is Not Just a Ceremonial Holiday    But Veterans  Day is not just a ceremonial holiday   It s not just an occasion to thank others for what they have done for us  It s also a time to ask if we have done enough for those who served our country   And that s a very timely question today with so many new veterans coming home everyday from places like Iraq and Afghanistan and with an aging veterans population that needs more care       Are We Keeping the Promise     So today I want to ask            Are we keeping our promise to those who have served our country        Do our policies and budgets reflect the great debt that we owe to so many veterans        I want to try and answer that question by looking at   how we treat veterans who need healthcare  how we budget for their needs  and how we treat our Guard and Reserve members       What We Owe Our Veterans    First  we all recognize that we have an obligation to those who serve us   When they signed up to serve our country  we agreed to take care of them   They kept their part of the bargain  Now we need to keep ours       Washington State Sacrifices    Washington state has made a tremendous contribution to the war effort   I am sad to report that 102 service members from Washington state have made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our nation   They have earned a place of eternal honor in roll call of freedom           We owe them and their families a debt that can never be fully paid        Many others veterans have come home with serious injuries    both visible and invisible    and they need our help as well        Today  more than 6 500 Washington state citizens are serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom   Since 2001  more than 1 million Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   Of those  about 20 000 have been from Washington state       My Visit to Iraq    In March  I traveled to Iraq and Kuwait   I met with members of the Washington National Guard who are serving our country   I saw firsthand that they were all operating under tremendously difficult and dangerous conditions   I also saw how every person was professional and fully committed to completing their mission        We need  do right  by everyone who serves us because we made a promise and because it keeps our military strong       How We Treat Veterans Affects Recruitment    The way we treat our veterans today affects our ability to recruit new soldiers tomorrow   But don t take my word for it   Listen to what George Washington said   Quote         The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country           Those are the words of George Washington  and they are just as true today as when he said them   So let s look at how well we re keeping our promise    starting with healthcare         VA Healthcare    We can all be proud that the VA provides some of the best healthcare available anywhere in America    We have a great healthcare system in the VA  but we don t fund it like a priority           Every year it s a struggle to get Congress to provide the funding that is needed   That s why I believe we need to make veterans healthcare spending mandatory    so it is not subject to budget games every year        This year  we had a big fight to make sure veterans don t lose healthcare   Starting in February I began warning that the lines were growing at the VA and that we needed to do more   I pointed to the many veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan who needed care          Three times I offered amendments to boost VA funding  but they were voted down every time   For months  the VA and the Administration assured us that everything was fine   But then in June  we learned that VA was facing a massive shortfall of  1 billion   So once again I introduced a bill to provide  1 5 billion in supplemental VA funding  and this time it passed          Now  the House and Senate are in negotiations to set the final veterans healthcare budget for Fiscal Year 2006  I am very concerned that we will not provide enough so funding  so yesterday  I joined with leaders from six national Veterans Service Organizations to send a message   Together  we said that we are watching  and we expect the House and Senate to keep their commitment to America s veterans          Any dollar below the Senate s level of is a dollar taken away from a veteran   It s a VA clinic that is not constructed   It s a VA doctor who is not hired  It s a veteran who doesn  t get the care America promised upon their enlistment  We can t leave veterans without care  so we need to stick with the Senate budget in the final appropriations bill       PTSD    I m also concerned about how we treat those who need help with challenges like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder   Instead of focusing on getting help to those who need it  the VA is moving to scrutinize and stigmatize veterans with PTSD   That s why I worked with Senators Durbin and Obama to put language in the Senate VA bill that requires the VA to explain its plan to Congress and to hold veterans harmless except in cases of fraud   Those protections need to stay in the final bill that emerges from conference          As I think about the way we treat veterans healthcare  it s clear that we need two more things        First  the VA must provide an accurate accounting of how it s spending the money we ve provided  and it needs to give us a clear picture of the needs it is seeing throughout the country          Second  the Bush Administration needs to start sending us realistic budgets  No gimmicks  No games   Send us a 2007 budget that is based on the real numbers and the real needs  Send us a budget that takes care of both our aging veterans and our veterans of the current operations   So when I look at our budget and our priorities  I know we ve got a lot more work to do keep our promise to America s veterans       Guard and Reserve    Another area that concerns me is how we re treating our Guard and Reserve members    especially when they come home from the battlefront   In this war  we are relying on our Guard and Reserve so heavily   It s estimated that 40 percent of those on the ground in Iraq are citizen soldiers          Unfortunately  the support services for the Guard have not kept pace with the way we re relying on them today   They often don t have access to employment services  job training  family support  and healthcare        This summer I held a series of roundtables throughout Washington state   I heard from Guard and Reserve members who couldn t find a doctor who accepts Tri Care   I heard about reservists who returned home and just fell through the cracks without the payments or support they were promised   And I heard about veterans who could not find a job when they came home        Our transition services are left over from the Cold War   They do not work for a military that today relies on Guard and Reserve members   I fear that this Administration is moving the cost of war onto the businesses and families of our Guard members   I believe they are already sacrificing enough   To do our part  we must update transition and employment service we provide to returning Guard and Reserve members       Conclusion    So Mr  President  as I evaluate the way we re treating our veterans  one thing is clear   America s military personnel are providing the highest level of service to our country  but we ve got some work to do to make sure our support of them when they come home is equal to the service they ve provided   Mr  President  I am committed to keeping the promise our country has made  and I ask for the support and leadership of every member of the United States Senate   We owe our veterans nothing less
