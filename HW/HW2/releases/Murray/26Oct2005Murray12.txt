10 26 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray s Floor Statement on her Amendment to Protect America  s Most Vulnerable under the New Medicare Prescription Drug Law    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 26  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today spoke on the Senate floor on her amendment to the Labor  Health  and Human Services Appropriation bill  LHHS  to provide  2 billion in emergency funding for states to provide   stop gap    drug coverage for low income seniors and the disabled currently receiving assistance from Medicaid  State Drug Assistance Programs or AIDS drug assistance programs        This funding is provided to ensure that no one currently receiving coverage or assistance will be left uncovered as the new law is implemented          Senator Murray  who voted against the Prescription Drug Law in 2003  spent Columbus Day recess speaking with patients  doctors  pharmacists and health care advocates across Washington state about how implementation of the new law will affect Washington  s most vulnerable residents       Senator Murray  s floor speech follows      Mr  President  I call up the Murray Amendment Number 2220          Mr  President  there is a dangerous flaw in the Medicare prescription drug program that s about to take effect   This flaw is a ticking time bomb for more than six million Americans  for our communities  and for our health care providers          That fuse is set to detonate on January 1st  2006   We cannot let low income seniors and the disabled lose their drug coverage   We cannot leave doctors  hospitals and nursing homes unprepared for the biggest change in decades  and we cannot push hundreds of thousands of people who need care onto our local communities        We cannot wait   We need to fix the problem today  and that s why I m offering this amendment   I ve been working with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bingaman to address this immediate crisis  and I want to thank them for their leadership          I ve also introduced my own bill to protect our most vulnerable   It s called the Medicare HEALS Act   It is S  1822   Mr  President  I ve been traveling around my home state of Washington this month meeting with people in Seattle  Lakewood  Yakima  Aberdeen and Olympia   They are angry  confused and worried    and with good reason        Mr  President  here are some of the concerns I heard    One senior told me   Everyone I have talked to is totally confused   my doctor  my pharmacist  even the Medicare number you are supposed to call    Another said   If we can t understand this  the whole plan is going to fail         Everywhere I went people were confused   There were questions I couldn t answer  and when I turned to the doctors sitting next to me  they didn t know the answer   And neither did the pharmacists or the patient advocates   If Senators and doctors and experts don t understand this    how can we expect an 80 year old person with serious medical problems to understand this complicated program        We can t    so we need more time and more resources to make this work   One person I met with said   Please give us more time  give us the chance to understand this so we don t make a mistake when we sign up         Finally  one panelist said   Taking something away from those that need it the most       is not the American way         I couldn t agree more and that s why I m here on the Senate floor offering a solution        Mr  President  I have many concerns with the Medicare Prescription Drug Law   I voted against it in 2003 because I believe seniors deserve better  and America can do better   I m concerned about the complexity  the coverage gap  and whether needed drugs will be covered          I m concerned about retirees losing the good coverage they have today  and I m concerned about the late enrollment penalty that will punish seniors who need more time to pick the right plan   I m working with many other Senators to address all of those concerns        But today the most urgent problem is the way the new law treats our most vulnerable    people with low incomes  the disabled and those facing serious medical challenges like AIDS   This law takes away the critical drug coverage these people have today and puts them into a new program that could charge them more money in exchange for less drug coverage   If they don  t sign up for a plan  they re randomly assigned one   Either way  the prescriptions they need may not be covered          And because these Americans are living on the financial brink  an interruption of their drug coverage    or a new co payment    could keep them from getting the drugs they need to live   The people who are being affected don t know what s going to happen   Their doctors and pharmacists don t understand it either    and this entire mess is going to burst into the open on January 1st        We need to take action now to prevent this catastrophe which is just a few months away   To understand the problem  let s look at how our most vulnerable get prescription drugs today    and how that will change          Today  about 6 4 million Americans with low incomes get help from two programs    Medicare at the federal level and Medicaid at the state level   These individuals are sometimes called  dual eligibles  because they are eligible for assistance from both Medicare and Medicaid        What Medicare doesn  t cover  states usually cover   For example  since the federal program did not cover prescription drugs  the state programs filled in the gap   This state coverage    often called  wrap around coverage     is critical for vulnerable families        As a result  these individuals get the drugs they need    often without co payments or deductibles   But there s a big problem coming on January 1st   The new drug program prohibits states from providing the extra help they provide today          Instead  it moves these individuals into the Medicare program alone    which requires higher out of pocket payments and which may cover fewer drugs   To me  it doesn t make sense to    take away the good coverage vulnerable families have today  force them into a program that might not meet their needs  charge them more money in the process  and then prohibit states from helping out their most vulnerable residents          It doesn  t make sense    but that s exactly what the new drug program will do unless we fix it before January 1st   In fact  the new Medicare prescription drug program changes the coverage for our most vulnerable in five ways          It imposes higher costs  premiums  co pays and deductibles         It covers fewer drugs        It blocks states from providing extra help    as they do today        It provides no transition period to ensure low income residents don t face gaps in coverage        And it penalizes people who more need time to pick the right plan        Mr  President  these are real people we re talking about   Let me introduce you to two of them        Earlier this month in Seattle I met Kathryn Cole    Kathryn is 36 years old  disabled and living on Social Security disability   She fills about 15 prescriptions each month  and her monthly income is  757   She told me   Even if the co pay were only  5  that adds up to  75 a month   I don t have the kind of extra money to squeeze out of my budget         Kathryn asked me   Which week am I not supposed to eat         People like Kathryn are living on the financial edge    they can t afford to pay more for their medication   They need our help   In Olympia  I met William Havens   He s 50 years old and living with HIV AIDS   He takes 43 pills a day          William told me   For the first time I realize I m going to have to make a choice between pills and food    It s outrageous that this new law is going to make life so much harder for people like Kathryn and William           In addition to hurting people  the new drug program will hurt our health care system   It will have a costly impact on nursing homes  doctors  pharmacists and hospitals   Many dual eligible individuals live in nursing homes   Now nursing homes are going have to have to navigate all these new plans          In my home state of Washington  there will be at least 14 new plans    all with different costs and different formularies   Nursing home managers are going to have see which plan a resident has and if the needed drugs are covered        In Olympia  I met with Dr  David Fairbrook   He s in private practice and is also the medical director at two skilled nursing facilities  which care for 150 people   He s very concerned about patients being randomly assigned to plans that don t meet their medical needs   He said patients may be denied needed drugs  they may be forced to change their medications  and they could face a time consuming  stressful appeals process        Dr  Fairbrook predicts there will be  chaos for nursing staff regarding coordination of multiple suppliers  It further duplicates paper work and documentation requirements          Mr  President  that is a tremendous new administrative burden for understaffed and under funded nursing homes and care providers        Unless we act  the new program will make the work of pharmacists so much harder   Pharmacists will literally be on the front lines   They will be forced to deny coverage to seniors   CMS is telling us that pharmacists will be able to look up and see what plan someone was assigned to          Frankly  Mr  President given the errors and mistakes CMS has made so far  I don t have a lot of confidence this will be a flawless transition   And remember  the people that will be hurt have no financial cushion   They re living on fixed incomes and don t have an extra twenty or thirty dollars for co payments or premiums   If they re turned away at the pharmacy counter  they don t have the money to pay for drugs now and get reimbursed later when the paperwork is sorted out        Doctors will also be on the front line   Doctors will have to know which drugs are on the formulary  they may need to help patients appeal any denials  and they ll have to treat patients who have gone with out their medicine        One doctor I met with told me that  Doctors don t have the information they need on this yet   If patients pick the wrong plan and their medicine is not covered  it can have serious medical harm        Hospitals will also be affected   They re going to have to navigate all these new plans   They re also going to have to deal with patients who haven t been able to get their prescriptions   In fact  for many poor families  the only place to get needed medicine will be the emergency room   That s going to increase the cost of healthcare for all of us        In summary  this new drug law will impose an expensive and confusing administrative burden on doctors  pharmacists  hospitals and nursing homes          We can do better   My amendment says  Let s fix this problem before people realize they can t get the prescriptions they need   My amendment provides emergency funding to prevent this disaster        First  it ensures that our most vulnerable don t lose their current drug coverage   It provides  2 billion in emergency funding to make sure low income seniors don t lose benefits or suffer a gap in coverage   That money will allow states to help low income residents  people who currently get help from state drug assistance programs  and people being helped by AIDS drug assistance programs           My amendment protects our most vulnerable  including any beneficiary with income below 150  of the Federal Poverty Level  and any beneficiary currently eligible for Medicaid through  spend down  requirements   It gives states flexibility to protect their residents   States could provide coverage through Medicaid or as a separate drug assistance program   And my amendment provides accountability   States would be required to notify CMS of their plan for ensuring no lapse in benefits for low income beneficiaries         Second  my amendment ensures that everyone knows about the changes   It requires states to notify those currently eligible for Medicare and Medicaid assistance   States would also notify pharmacists  Community Health Centers  rural health clinics  hospitals  critical access hospitals  doctors  and other Medicaid eligible providers that this assistance is available   Providers would be allowed to seek reimbursement for any uncompensated costs associated with providing medically necessary drugs to this population        In summary  my amendment protects our most vulnerable and makes sure everyone involved knows what s happening        Mr  President  as I close let me just recap the main points   The new Medicare prescription drug program has a lot of problems   The most urgent problem is the way it will hurt our most vulnerable patients and the difficulty it will cause our health care providers like hospitals  nursing homes  doctors and pharmacists          For our most vulnerable    people with low incomes    the new program will take away the coverage they get today and charge them more for less access   It could also leave many with a gap in coverage        My amendment provides  2 billion in emergency funding to make sure no one falls through the cracks   The states can use that money to protect their most vulnerable with both flexibility and accountability        In addition  my amendment addresses the confusion and lack of information by helping states notify affected patients and providers        Mr  President  time is running out   On January 1st  millions of vulnerable Americans will be forced into a new system they don t understand and that does not meet their needs  We can avoid this train wreck        Senators who are concerned about the health and well being of their constituents    but who also are concerned about the cost    do have other options   We can support efforts on reconciliation to provide additional time to transition this new plan   We can also make changes to the Medicare Modernization act to let states provide coverage through Medicaid during the transition        This is a problem   Either we spend the money now to prevent a crisis  or we need to push the deadline back so we are all prepared to make the transition smoothly          People s lives are hanging in the balance        I urge my colleagues to stand up for those who today don t have a voice    and for the doctors  hospitals  pharmacists and nursing homes in your state    and give them the relief and protection my amendment provides
