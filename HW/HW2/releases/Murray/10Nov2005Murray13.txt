                                          News Release          Murray  Colleagues Sign Letter to Protect Title IX    For Immediate Release  Thursday  November 10  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today joined with six of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the House and Senate managers of the Labor  HHS and Education Appropriations conference report  to urge them to accept Senate language protecting Title IX          Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Jim Jeffords  I VT   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Joe Lieberman  D CT   Gordon Smith  R OR  and Olympia Snowe  R ME  also signed the letter           Title IX has been an extraordinary success in opening up new worlds of participation in sports by young women and girls  and it would be a serious mistake to roll back that progress     the Senators wrote in their letter     We urge you to accept the Senate language regarding Title IX and the Additional Clarification to ensure that the new guidance does not weaken enforcement of Title IX athletics            On March 17  2005  the U S  Department of Education issued a new Title IX policy that threatens to reverse the decades of progress women and girls have made in sports   Under the Administration  s   Clarification     schools can now claim they are fully meeting women  s interests in sports based simply on the responses   or lack of responses    to an e mail survey asking female students about their interests in sports   This under the radar attack on Title IX  s application to athletics was issued without public notice or opportunity for public comment          The proposed Senate report language requires the Department of Education to prepare a report on the use of surveys by institutions of higher education   The report will include what other information was considered in assessing student interest and the decisions made about athletic opportunities at these institutions   The report further directs the Department of Education not to expend funds on activities associated with this guidance until the conferees have adequate time to review the process          A full transcript of the letter to the LHHS conference managers follows                                                                                        November 10  2005     Dear Chairman Specter  Ranking Member Harkin  Chairman Regula and Ranking Member Obey        We urge you to accept the Senate language regarding Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Department of Education  s March 17  2005 policy guidance entitled   Additional Clarification of the Intercollegiate Athletic Policy  Three Part Test    Part Three    in the final 2006 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Conference Report          For over thirty years  Title IX has opened doors by giving women and girls an equal opportunity to participate in student sports  and we are concerned that the Department  s proposal could unfairly reduce their opportunities for participation in the future   Under the Department  s new guidance  schools that provide fewer sports opportunities to women can be considered to have accommodated female students and complied with Title IX  based solely on the results of a student survey   If female students do not reply to a survey emailed to them  the Department will assume that they are not interested in additional sports activities   We are concerned that a survey alone cannot reliably measure students   interest in sports   Many students may not respond to  or even open  email surveys                      The new guidance also does not require colleges to weigh other factors they have traditionally had to consider  such as coaches   and administrators   opinions  or women  s athletic participation at nearby high schools or in recreational leagues  even though these factors are important guides to female students   interest and potential   By contrast  in answering a survey  students who have been denied equal opportunity in sports may express only tentative interest in sports or confidence in their skills   Such surveys may actually do little more than reflect the current denial of equal opportunity  rather than the students   true interest and potential   We are concerned that such surveys would provide colleges an easy means of evading Title IX  s goal of equal opportunity                    The proposed Senate report language responds to these concerns by requiring the Department of Education to prepare a report on the use of surveys by institutions of higher education   The report will include what other information was considered in assessing student interest and the decisions made about athletic opportunities at these institutions   The report further directs the Department of Education not to expend funds on activities associated with this guidance until the conferees have adequate time to review the report          Title IX has been an extraordinary success in opening up new worlds of participation in sports by young women and girls  and it would be a serious mistake to roll back that progress   We urge you to accept the Senate language regarding Title IX and the Additional Clarification to ensure that the new guidance does not weaken enforcement of Title IX in athletics   Thank you        Sincerely        Senator Patty Murray  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Senator Jim Jeffords  Senator Edward Kennedy  Senator Joe Lieberman  Senator Gordon Smith  Senator Olympia Snowe
