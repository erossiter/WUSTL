                                                                                       News Release          Murray Votes Against Bill that Would Undermine America s Values and Put American Troops at Risk      For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 28  2006     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  voted against the  Military Commissions Act of 2006         Her statement follows      Make no mistake  we will win the War on Terror   And we will win it by fighting tough and fighting smart  working with our allies  and being true to our country s values          That s why today I voted against an unbalanced  politically motivated bill that puts our troops at risk  rejects our country s values  and alienates the allies we need to win the War on Terror           We can be proud that America represents a beacon of hope  justice and freedom to people around the globe  We are a nation of laws  and in troubled times we look to our common values and moral compass to guide our leaders and our policies         We all want our government to have the intelligence necessary to prevent future terrorist attacks   We all want those who have done us harm to be brought to justice and punished accordingly   And we all want the U S  to be seen as a fair  democratic and humane world power          The standards we set today will be looked to for years to come   In fact  the bill we pass today will say more about the nation we hope to be than those we hope to defeat         We are living in historic times   Each day it seems the rights of individuals and the power of government are being tested   We are war at overseas   We face threats from terrorism at home   And the current Administration is pushing the bounds of its power in remarkable ways           I support giving our military and intelligence agencies the tools they need to protect our nation   In doing their jobs  they are defending our Constitution  our rights  and our liberties from those who seek to do us harm   I want to ensure that the tools we provide will lead to convictions that are constitutional and will be upheld  so we can punish those responsible and prevent future attacks         At the same time  I believe it is also our responsibility to protect and preserve the rights that make America the greatest nation in the world   Unfortunately  the bill we voted on today falls far short of the standards that Congress should meet and that the American people demand   This bill doesn t reflect America s moral values           If we do this wrong  our international credibility is at stake   I worry that at a time that we are encouraging the growth of new democracies around the globe our words will ring hollow   We could be seen as a nation whose message to others is   Do as we say  not as we do     That would undermine our ability to fight and win the War on Terror         The United States is not alone in trying to rid the world of terrorist threats   But  unfortunately  the Bush Administration is acting that way   I m very concerned that by turning away from the Geneva Conventions we will summarily weaken the support we need to from nations around the world to fight terrorism           I also worry that this bill threatens the safety of our own troops should they fall into enemy hands  The standards of torture in this bill defy the Supreme Court s ruling and the Geneva Conventions  This deeply flawed approach could further endanger American troops and weaken our standing in the world           Unfortunately  the wars we are currently fighting both at home and abroad will not be our last   The standards we set today will influence the treatment of our military and our country now and well into the future         With all of these flaws and unanswered questions  why are we moving forward with a deeply flawed bill   The answer is politics         Defeating terrorism  protecting our citizens and upholding our American values should not be partisan issues   The most basic questions of security and democracy should not be placed in the context of trying to influence the outcome of an election           The questions of how we treat those in our custody  the extent of our moral authority  what our nation stands for  and how we hope to be viewed by the world should be placed squarely in the context of what is the right policy to achieve our nation s security goals while upholding our common values         Today  I voted to ensure that as we protect our country  we don t forget who we are as a nation and the values for which we have always stood   I ve said all along that we need to strike the right balance  and this bill still falls short   I take a backseat to no one when it comes to protecting our nation  and I know our security should be both tough and smart and should not come at the expense of the ideals of democracy upon which this nation was built   We can do better than the bill that came before the Senate today
