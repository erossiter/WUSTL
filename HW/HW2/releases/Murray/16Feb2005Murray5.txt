02 16 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          MURRAY  Bush s  5 Trillion Privatization Plan Does Nothing to Strengthen Social Security  Heaps Massive New Debt on Future Generations    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 16  2005    In a speech on the floor of the U S  Senate  Senator Patty Murray today outlined her concerns about the massive new debt President Bush s Social Security plan will heap on future generations   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  the President s privatization plan will add nearly  5 trillion in debt to our country s balance sheet       Senator Murray s full remarks follow     I m very concerned that President Bush s proposed Social Security  restructuring  will imperil the security of all Americans    from young workers retiring in decades to seniors retiring today        His plan will end the guaranteed benefit  It will do nothing to fix the long term issues the system faces   And it adds trillions of dollars to our national debt     In traveling the country to sell his privatization plan  President Bush has been saying         We have an obligation and a duty to confront problems and not pass them on to future generations         Many of us    on both sides of the aisle    agree with him   We should not create new problems for the next generation to handle   Trouble is  the president s plan actually adds to the problems of the next generation    it does nothing to solve them           But it s time for President Bush to level with the American people on what his program really is    a new recipe for a continuing fall into a black hole of debt   This plan will run up  5 trillion in debt that our generation won t pay for   It will fall squarely on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren              The President not only wants to gamble away the secure future retirees count on  he wants to burden them with a huge new 5 trillion dollar debt          There s another point worth making about the President s plan as well   He claims it won t affect anyone over 55  but let s be clear    they ll face these huge deficits as well   President Bush may say that he won t cut your benefits  but how can he guarantee that if he plans to steal trillions from the social security trust fund  This president s plan simply adds to our problems        All you have to do to understand the situation is look at the record          Last week we received a budget with the biggest deficit in our nation s history    four short years after the budget had the largest surplus in history          Days later we say cost estimates for his Medicare Prescription Drug benefit balloon from 400 Billion dollars to more than 700 Billion dollars          Now the Bush Administration plans to add trillions to our balance sheet by privatizing Social Security          As this chart shows  there s more red ink in the president s budget than we care to see   But unfortunately  if his privatization plan goes into effect  massive new debt increases are added in the years after the plan takes effect   The president  as he did with Medicare  likes to talk about costs of implementation over ten year periods   What he doesn t mention is that for five years under those projections  the plan isn t fully phased in   So rather than considering his already bloated 700 billion dollar transition projection  let s look at an outside source          The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says the borrowing numbers we ve heard from the Administration  are misleadingly low         They are generated by using a ten year budget window  2006  2015  that includes only five years of the fully phased in plan   The plan would not be launched until 2009 and not be in full effect until 2011         Over the first ten years that the plan actually was in effect  2009 18   it would add about  1 4 trillion to the debt   Over the next ten years  2019  28   it would add about  3 5 trillion more to the debt   All told  the plan would add  4 9 trillion  14 percent of GDP in 2028  to the debt over its first 20 years         That money is going to have to come from somewhere  and it s na    ve to think that huge new borrowing won t affect current retirees   It s na    ve to think massive new borrowing won t affect programs like Medicare and Medicaid that need our attention   And it s na    ve to think we ll simply go along and pass on this massive new problem to our children and grandchildren          A recent story on the front page the Washington Post was headlined   After Bush Leaves Office  His Budget s Costs Balloon    I d like to read just a few lines from that story   It warned  for instance  that  the numbers released in recent days add up to a budgetary landmine that could blow up just as the next president moves into the Oval Office           Philip G  Joyce  a professor of public policy at George Washington University  said in the piece   It s almost like you ve got a budget  and you ve got a shadow budget coming in behind that s a whole lot more expensive          And a Republican advisor to one of our colleagues said   Hopefully some very difficult decisions will be addressed between now and the time we have a new White House resident so that occupant isn t faced with some very expensive chickens coming home to roost   There are some things that we can do  but unfortunately in the political world kicking down the road is often seen as leadership   I think that says it all          But this huge new debt isn t the only bad part of privatization   In fact  this plan does nothing to extend Social Security solvency    not for a year  not for one day  not even for one hour   That s the issue we re trying to solve  and the President s plan    at least the part he s been willing to share with us    doesn t even address it   It s an ideological gamble that we in the Senate  and those who depend on Social Security around the country  will not stand for          Rather than gambling away our security and running up a huge new debt  we should promote personal savings to help every American with their retirement   And we should stop raiding the Social Security trust fund to pay for misguided priorities like massive tax cuts for the wealthy        The ideas we ve heard from the President are too dangerous for this generation of retirees and those to follow          Mr  President  as you may imagine  my office has received lots of mail on this proposal   I ve heard from current retirees  disabled workers  and the young people who this plan will supposedly benefit the most   But I think President Bush would be surprised by the comments I ve been getting   I d like to read just a small sampling of those comments here today          From a retiree on Whidbey Island     The administration should be ashamed of its effort to confuse and mislead the hard working citizens of the US        From  a twenty something who is supposedly going to benefit from privatization      I want Social Security to be left in its current form         And finally  from a 51 year old self employed fisherman     My main concern about Social Security is that it survive for my children   The risks are simply too great for the future of our citizens and our country          The president s plan is for Social In Security    a guaranteed gamble  not a guaranteed benefit   We will continue to stand up for future generations against a private solution that simply adds trillions in debt to our future generations   We re going to be proud of what we pass along to our children and grandchildren
