

                                                                                     News Release          Senator Murray Warns that Proposed White House Cuts to Airports Will Hinder American Aviation Senator Murray Tells Airport Directors that the Federal Government Must  Push the Throttle Forward  and Invest in Aviation        Senator Urges Airport Leaders To Speak Up Against The President s Cuts    For Immediate Release  Monday  May 2  2005          SEATTLE  WA    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray told                more than 2 000 airport leaders that the White House and Congress are poised to scale back federal support for airports  modern air traffic control equipment  and security infrastructure         Murray warned that if these cuts are enacted  they will hinder American aviation  inconvenience passengers  hurt economic development  and raise potential safety concerns   Murray also warned that inadequate support could squander America s leadership of the global aviation            As a country  either we re going to make the investments that ensure our success or we re going to fail to invest and suffer the consequences of crowded skies  frustrated passengers  and slower economic growth   Murray said        As I see it  the federal government can either push the throttle forward and help you succeed  or pull the throttle back and limit the success of our airports  our people and our economy   As I look at the budget so far  I can tell you that the federal government is pulling back  so we ve got to speak up             Murray spoke at the 77th annual conference of the American Association of Airport Executives  AAAE    The audience of more than 2 000 included airport managers  security directors  and airport operations chiefs            Pointing to projections that more people will use air travel in coming years  Murray said that if the federal government pulls back its support  the United States will not be able to meet the new demands for capacity and will forfeit the economic benefits that come from a resurgence in air travel            Passenger loads are growing  our skies are getting more crowded  our equipment is outdated  and our infrastructure has not kept pace   Murray said              Murray outlined three areas that President Bush wants to cut in his FY  2006 budget  airport improvement grants  air traffic control modernization  and installation of explosive detection equipment     Proposed  Cuts to Airport Improvement Program Grants      These FAA grants fund new runways  taxiways  terminal improvements  and  fire   rescue equipment  The President s budget would cut AIP grants  by  472 million  13 5 percent below the level provided in fiscal year    2005            For your airports  it could mean that your projects will take longer to complete   Murray said   It could mean you have to defer new improvements         Proposed Cuts to Air Traffic Control Modernization     Outdated air traffic control equipment fails periodically affecting safety  delays and capacity  In some cases  this equipment is more than 30 years         old  New equipment is needed to handle the expected growth in flights  Last year  the White House cut funding for modernization  376 million  below the previous year  Now  the White House wants to cut modernization  funding by  77 million below this year s spending level           I m concerned that if we don t improve our technology we re going to face more problems with safety  congestion  and capacity    Murray said   We need a plan and a budget that addresses the future  not just a plan to survive day to day   patching together   old equipment          Proposed Cuts to Installing Explosive Detection Equipment    The federal government is supposed to provide  500 million each year  for installation under the VISION 100 law  This year  however  the White  House wants to cut that funding in half    to just  250 million           That means fewer airports will get the help they need   Murray said   When Congress and the White House cut funding for  E D S  installation  they are pulling back the throttle and slowing  down your progress              Murray noted that Congress passed a budget blue print that largely follows the President s funding priorities   Murray said that airport leaders need to tell their Members of Congress how these cuts will hurt their local airports            The White House is pressuring Congress to cut airport spending  and Members of Congress need to push back   They need to hear how their bad votes are hurting their own local airports   You can help them see that this isn t just a number in a budget   It s a longer line at the airport   It s an extra 12 months in construction at the terminal   It s hundreds of voters coming up to them complaining about problems at the airport   If you can put it into local terms  Members of Congress will get it           Senator Murray s full remarks follow                                                                  Welcome to an Aviation State      Good morning   I m excited to welcome all of you to my hometown   Washington state is a place that values aviation   We know that strong airports create jobs  build our economy  and help our country   Washington state is home to 57 000 Boeing employees  and thousands more aviation workers and suppliers   We have a major international airport and the country s largest runway project    So while you re here in Washington state  please know that you are among friends          Frankly  I m not worried about this Washington   But I am worried about that other Washington   Washington  D C     and you should be worried too   That s because in Washington  D C  politicians are making decisions that could hurt your airports   And many of them don t even realize it        The White House   Congress Are Trying to Cut Airport Investments      This year  the White House and Congress will decide if the Airport Improvement Program will be cut  if you ll get help installing E D S  equipment  if you ll have a modern air traffic control system  and if America will continue to lead the world in aviation          Right now  on all those issues  Congress and the White House are headed in the wrong direction  It s a tight budget year    and there are pressures all around   I want to make sure that our airports understand what s at stake and speak out with a unified voice  and that s why I m here this morning        The Federal Government Must  Push the Throttle Forward  and Increase Investments       The theme of this conference is  taking to tomorrow s skies                 As I look at those skies  I see a lot of turbulence ahead   Passenger loads are growing  our skies are getting more crowded  our equipment is outdated  and our infrastructure has not kept pace         As a country  either we re going to make the investments that ensure our success or we re going to fail to invest and suffer the consequences of crowded skies  frustrated passengers  and slower economic growth         As I see it  the federal government can either push the throttle forward and help you succeed  or pull the throttle back and limit the success of our airports  our people and our economy   As I look at the budget so far  I can tell you that the federal government is pulling back  so we ve got to speak up          The  Evergreen State  View of Aviation       Many of my colleagues in Congress love airports  but they don t see how the decisions they re making today will affect their own local airports tomorrow   That s why we need leaders like you to stand up and speak out         Maybe I have a different perspective than other Senators because I was born and raised here in Seattle   Growing up  I saw how every major event in Washington was marked by its impact on the airline industry   It hasn t always been an easy road   In the early 1970 s  during a massive downturn in the aviation industry  I saw layoffs and economic pain   So many people were moving out of Seattle that someone put up a billboard saying   Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights          Fortunately  the airline industry recovered  but there have been other big bumps in the road   Four years ago  Seattle was rocked by a major earthquake   Just after the quake  one of the first places I visited was Boeing Field   The runway was literally torn apart   I knew we had to repair it because if cargo couldn t land  our economy couldn  t recover         Later that year  we saw the horrible events of September 11th   I remember sitting down with Boeing leaders soon afterward and hearing of the huge downturn in aviation   Airlines cancelled their plane orders  and many of my neighbors and constituents were laid off   I fought with the White House for many months and finally got some relief for our laid off aviation workers         So for me  caring about aviation is just something I was raised with   That s why I m very troubled by what I see happening today in Congress and why we need strong advocates like AAAE        AAAE is a Strong Advocate       I ve been proud to work with Chip Barclay  Todd Hauptli  and their team over the years   I can tell you that you have one of the most effective organizations on Capitol Hill   We ve stood together in important fights for your airports           In 2002  we had some real challenges   At the time  I was the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee   TSA was still in the Department of Transportation  and it needed funding and direction   Passengers were routinely missing flights because they were stuck on endless security lines   Most of the new TSA screeners were brand new on the job   Some were as helpful as a salesman at Nordstrom  but others seemed to have a bayonet between their teeth   Nearly every day  TSA was putting out new rules   Anything TSA couldn t pay for they expected your airports to pay for   It was an incredibly stressful and expensive time for your industry   During those challenging days  Chip Barclay was a desperately needed voice of reason   Every Member of Congress wanted a brand new security system overnight   Chip spoke frankly and credibly about what could be accomplished and what couldn  t be accomplished   And while Chip was testifying inside the hearing rooms  Todd was outside in the hallway buttonholing every Member of Congress reminding us that if you want security and efficiency you need to make investments            More than once  during our late night conferences with the House    long after all the other lobbyists had gone home    we would find Todd  alone in the hall  waiting to ask how he could help us move things forward          So I know firsthand how effective your team is in Washington  D C   That s important because many elected officials don t get it   They think that every airport is the same  and they think they can have security on the cheap   But we know better        Washington s Airports Show a Range of Challenges       Just look around the airports here in Washington state and you ll see the wide range of challenges you all face   Here at SeaTac  we were already launching an ambitious expansion plan when 9 11 hit    So the greatest challenge at this airport has been to adjust these plans    in the middle of construction    to meet new security demands   As you may know  we also have the largest    and the oldest    runway construction project in the country   To build our third runway  we ve had to clear many environmental hurdles   We ve also built and commissioned a brand new tower and TRACON at the same time           Our smaller airports have been facing a much different challenge   They have been struggling to hold onto their carriers and their flight frequencies   Our general aviation airports have been trying to comply with all the FAA safety rules at a time of tight revenues              Airports Under Pressure               I know that as airport leaders you are under tremendous pressures Thankfully  more and more passengers are now returning to your airports   But they show up with higher expectations   They now want to clear security as fast as they did before 9 11   They want their luggage the minute they reach baggage claim  and they want shopping and dining options   They want all of those things in facilities that were never designed to house fine retailers and five star restaurants   I understand the many pressures that you are under  and I know that you ll be more effective if the federal government is a strong partner        The Federal Government Is Pulling Back the Throttle       Unfortunately  from my view at the Transportation Appropriations committee  the White House and Congress are not providing the funding you need to handle the changes that are reshaping aviation         This is supposed to be a year when we increase funding for aviation   After all  not long ago you helped Congress pass Vision 100  and that was a victory   It set an ambitious course for future   But since he signed that law  President Bush has pulled the throttle back   In just three years  his budget requests for capital programs have been about  2 billion below the level called for in Vision 100   That s a lot of money that could have helped your airports   And again this year  the White House is pushing us in the wrong direction   Let me give you three examples AIP  air traffic modernization  and E D S        1  The White House Wants to Cut Airport Improvement Funding       First  the White House is cutting funding for the Airport Improvement Program   I don t have to tell you how important AIP is to the airport community   It funds everything from new runways and taxiways  to terminal improvements  and fire and rescue equipment   For the AIP program  we were supposed to increase funding by  100 million every year   We did that for two years  but now the White House is pulling back the throttle   If the Administration succeeds  there will be fewer dollars for projects at your airports   I raised this issue with Secretary Mineta recently   Do you know what he said   He said all of you could just raise your passenger facility charges   Well I think that s wrong   A lot of you are already charging the maximum allowed  and others aren  t even allowed to levy those charges  Congress and the President said they would provide a certain level of funding in law  and now they re walking away from that commitment         For your airports  it could mean that your projects will take longer to complete   It could mean you have to defer new improvements    When Congress and the White House cut support for the Airport Improvement Program  they are pulling back the throttle and slowing down your progress        2  The White House Wants to Cut Back on Air Traffic Control Modernization       Let me turn to another example of how we re being pushed in the wrong direction   Let s look at air traffic control modernization     All of you know that we ve got old equipment  which fails periodically         When there s an outage  we have  ground holds  and congestion at your airports   It puts a tremendous burden on our air traffic controllers and everyone in aviation   Old equipment affects safety   It affects delays  and it affects capacity   After all  we ll more planes in the same limited airspace   The way to increase capacity is through new capacity  so we need to invest in air traffic control           We were on track to do just that   Vision 100 said    we re going to spend a certain amount every year   What s happened   Last year    because of the White House    funding to modernize was cut  It was cut by  493 million below Vision 100  and  376 million below the year before   This year  the White House wants to cut modernization even more     605 million below Vision 100   That s a real cut of  77 million below last year         So in just 2 years  the Bush Administration wants to cut modernization by nearly half a billion   I know that we need to spend more on modernization  not less         I m concerned that if we don t improve our technology we re going to face more problems with safety  congestion  and capacity   And looking at the big picture  we could surrender our global leadership in aviation to Europe   We need a plan and a budget that addresses the future  not just a plan to survive day to day    patching together old equipment   When Congress and the White House cut funding for air traffic control modernization  they are pulling back the throttle and slowing down your progress        3  The White House Wants to Cut Back on Assistance Installing Detection Equipment       Let me offer a final example of how elected leaders are shortchanging your airports    explosive detection systems   You know the history here    After September            11th  TSA installed thousands of explosive and trace detection machines in airports   They have enhanced security  but I also know they ve created challenges in how your airports operate   Many of you have had to put these machines right in the ticketing lobby   That s added to the congestion and crowds   I know that for many of you  it would make much more sense to put these systems   in line     behind the ticket counter  as part of the airport  s baggage system           Vision 100 called for up to  500 million a year to help you with E D S  installation   What s happened   The President wants to cut that funding in half   That means fewer airports will get the help they need   When Congress and the White House cut funding for E D S  installation  they are pulling back the throttle and slowing down your progress        These Aviation Cuts Come in a Tight Budget Year       So we ve got all these cuts to aviation   Now if that was the only thing happening in the budget  we d have some flexibility in Congress to perhaps restore a portion of those cuts   But the White House has tied our hands by cutting the funding    not just for aviation    but for everything else we ve got to fund         Let me give you a quick view of all the problems we ve been handed    just in my subcommittee   The Administration  s budget wants to zero out Amtrak and throw the railroad into bankruptcy   The Administration wants to eliminate  2 5 billion for housing programs that serve the poor  disabled  and homeless   And the Administration wants to cut funding for community economic development program by  1 9 billion           If the airport cuts were the only ones  we d have some flexibility   But the cuts to airports come on top of many other cuts  and so we ve really got our hands tied          Congress Just Endorsed the White House Budget Blueprint       Last week  Congress endorsed the President s overall budget proposal   Congress passed a budget framework that follows the President s general spending limits   And here s the problem    to add a dollar back to aviation  you have to take a dollar out of something else   And everything else is already being shortchanged  That s going to make it a lot harder for you to get Congress to do the right thing for your airports   It will be hard  but I ve never believed in giving up  and I know how effective you ve been in the past        Airport Leaders Need to Put these Cuts in Local Terms       So before I close  I want to give you a homework assignment   I  m a former teacher  and old habits die hard   But this one s easy   In fact  I don t want any of you to start working on it until you ve taken every tour of Seattle and spent a lot of money here         Here s what I want you to do   Think about how these cuts    at the federal level    will impact your airports at the local level   What will it mean for expansion   What will it mean for capacity  What will it mean for jobs and economic growth  How will it affect your passengers         Go back to your communities and get those answers down on paper   Then share them with your elected officials  because let me tell you what s happening   The White House is pressuring Congress to cut airport spending  and Members of Congress need to push back   They need to hear how their bad votes are hurting their own local airports   You can help them see that this isn t just a number in a budget   It s a longer line at the airport   It s an extra 12 months in construction at the terminal   It s hundreds of voters coming up to them complaining about problems at the airport   If you can put it into local terms  Members of Congress will get it   Then    if they vote against their state in order to help the White House    they ll have the face the consequences from you and all your airport users   The secret is to put these national cuts into local terms  because that s what Members of Congress understand   So talk among yourselves at this conference  go back home and talk with your staff and airport partners  and then show your elected leaders what these cuts mean to your community         I have to tell you that it s a tough year  and the budget that Congress passed last week has limited our ability to help   The best chance we have to help your airports is for leaders like you to show your Members of Congress what these cuts mean to your local communities        Our Efforts Will Help Strengthen Aviation and America       In closing  friends  there is a lot at stake here   Your success will affect how productive our country is   Your success will determine if America continues to lead the world in aviation   And your success will determine if we reap the rewards of this new period in aviation   I know it s worth the effort   I know it s worth the investment  And I know that if any group can get Congress and the White House to move    it s AAAE   But it s going take a lot of work   I m committed to being your partner and standing up for you at the federal level   Together  we can urge the federal government to push that throttle forward and help push our country forward   And friends  when we do that our people  our economy  and our potential can truly take flight
