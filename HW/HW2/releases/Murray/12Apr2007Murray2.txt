                                                                                                                                              For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 12  2007    Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this hearing to examine the persistent barriers to equal pay for women in the workforce   I want to thank our witnesses for being here today and for their contribution to our discussion         For me  this is a question of fundamental fairness   No one should have to face pay discrimination in the workplace   It s unfair and unacceptable        I think it s important to recognize that the wage gap doesn t just hurt women   It hurts their children and their spouses too  so everyone has a stake in ending this discrimination   In a national study  the Institute for Women s Policy Research and the AFL CIO found that  collectively  America s working families are losing  200 billion in income each year as a result of the on going gender wage gap   And their study accounted for differences in other factors like age  education  and hours worked         That amounts to an average annual loss of  4 000 for each working woman s family   Imagine what parents and spouses could do with this lost income and the dramatic effect that equal pay would have on individual families        It s not just women who would benefit from equal pay   According to the same study  equal pay would equate to a reduction in poverty rates for women and their families   Poverty rates for single mothers would be cut in half    Imagine that   we could lift half of working single mothers out of poverty by ending gender wage discrimination   The poverty rates of married working women would fall by more than 60 percent  It s clear to me and to America s working families that this issue should be important to all of us  whether we are male or female       Throughout history  women have played a vital role in our economic prosperity although they haven t always received equal reward for their work    Since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963  women have made great strides in narrowing the wage gap   In 1963  a woman working full time  year round  earned just 58 9 percent as much as her male counterpart   Unfortunately  that number has only increased to 77 percent as of 2005        Clearly  barriers to equal pay still persist in today s labor market    It s time to confront these barriers and find out what we can do to make equal pay a reality for working women and their families        I m proud to co sponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act and the Fair Pay Act    two important pieces of legislation that will help eliminate some of these barriers   I m especially pleased that these bills enhance enforcement and encourage businesses to be forward thinking in this area        The Paycheck Fairness Act prohibits employer retaliation against employees who freely share salary information with one another   It allows women who have experienced discrimination to recover more than just back pay for lost wages   It calls for the government to enhance outreach and training efforts with employers and calls for more data about wage disparities    It also supports women as they individually confront these barriers by establishing a negotiation skills training program        Equally important  the Fair Pay Act addresses ethnic and racial discrimination encountered by women of color    It requires businesses to provide equal pay for jobs of comparable value and allows workers discriminated against because of gender  race  or national origin to file a complaint           Finally  these bills recognize exemplary employers who are making positive strides in equal pay by establishing a national award program        Unfair discrimination in the workplace should not be tolerated in any form   As a mother and a grandmother  I want my children to live in a country where my daughter can earn just as much as my son   It s time to address this issue and finally close the wage gap for working women and their families
