                                                                              News Release          IRAQ   Senator Murray Pushes Resolution to Fully Support America s Troops and Veterans      For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 15  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  offered a resolution on the Senate floor calling for Congress to fully support America s troops and veterans         We are going to give our troops everything they need  and we re not just going to be a rubber stamp for the President s war without end   Murray said    Congress has a voice to push for a new direction  and we re going to use our power to help the brave men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the United States military         Murray also spoke in favor of the Reid Resolution  which would begin to redeploy American troops       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  America s troops deserve our nation s full support every step of the way from when they enlist  to when they train  to when they deploy  to when they return home   Tragically  the Bush Administration has failed our troops every step of the way   Today Democrats are saying enough is enough   We are going to give our troops everything they need  and we re not just going to be a rubber stamp for the President s war without end   I am proud to offer the Murray Resolution in support of our troops  and I m pleased that our Majority Leader  Senator Reid  strongly supports my resolution          We have been fighting to finally have a debate in the Senate for months   Now we have that debate and today we ve got to do three things   We need to pass the Murray Resolution that supports our troops  We need to reject the Gregg Resolution that blindly follows the President  and we need to pass the Reid Resolution that sets a new direction in Iraq        The Murray Resolution affirms that we will provide our troops with everything they need to be safe and to complete their missions   We ll provide everything they need in terms of training  equipment  logistics and funding  and we ll provide everything they need when they return home        Now the Republicans have a different idea   The Gregg Resolution will tie the hands of Congress and would leave all the decisions to President Bush   Well  we all know how that turns out   If Congress surrenders its voice  our troops will get stuck with more of the same   more Americans being sent into the middle of a civil war and more veterans coming home without the care they need          We don t need more of the same   We need a new direction   The Murray Resolution shows that we can have a new direction in Iraq  and we can give our troops all of the support they need        So every Senator has a choice   either you just keep blindly following the President   or you say   we re going to stand up to our own responsibility to support our troops  and we re going to push for a new direction in Iraq        The Gregg Resolution says we have to support the President   My resolution says we have to support our troops   The Gregg Resolution would make Congress a rubber stamp for a failed policy   My resolution says that Congress has a voice and must use that voice to help our troops        I suggest to my colleagues that if you re happy with the war in Iraq   vote for the Gregg Resolution because it will keep us locked on the same path   If you re OK with returning troops waiting months in a crumbling military hold unit or waiting years for benefits  then vote for the Gregg Resolution and keep us locked on the same path         But if you think our troops deserve better   vote for the Murray resolution   If you agree that our troops deserve equipment to keep them safe  vote for the Murray resolution  If you agree that our troops deserve the training that will help them succeed in their missions  vote for the Murray resolution   If you believe that our troops deserve better when they come home  vote for the Murray resolution   And if you believe that Congress needs to use its voice and its power to give our country a new direction in Iraq  vote for the Murray Resolution        Our troops deserve better than what the Bush Administration has provided   This President sent our troops into battle without the life saving armor and equipment they need   This President left our troops on the battlefield without a plan  without a clear mission  and without being honest about the costs of this war   And this President shortchanged healthcare and benefits for our returning service members   leaving brave Americans to languish in squalor at Walter Reed          Haven t we had enough of this President s failures    Didn t Americans send us a clear message last Fall that enough is enough   It s time for a new direction        My resolution recognizes that Congress has a role to play in supporting our troops  Congress has a voice to push for a new direction  and we re going to use our power to help the brave men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the United States military        I would say to my colleagues that if you vote against my resolution  you don t really support our troops   Don t vote against our military and don t vote to tie our own hands   Use this opportunity to tell our troops that we are there for them and their families from the time they head off to battle though the rest of their lives   we are there for them  and most of all vote to change direction in Iraq
