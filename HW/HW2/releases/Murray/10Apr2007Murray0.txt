                                                                                         News Release          At Murray s Urging  Architect of the Capitol Pulls Out All Workers from Asbestos Infested Tunnels Action Follows Senator Murray s Hearing and Letter    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 10  2007     Washington  D C   Yesterday  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  received word from Acting Architect of the Capitol  AOC  Stephen Ayers that ten Capitol Hill tunnel workers   who have been exposed to deadly levels of asbestos in the Capitol tunnel complex for years   will immediately be removed from their work in the tunnels  Senator Murray has pushed for the removal of the tunnel workers since the problems where highlighted at a March 1st hearing which she called and chaired  Over the past five weeks  Murray s office has been meeting with the AOC  the Congressional Office of Compliance  and the Office of the Attending Physician to find ways to protect tunnel workers         Murray s hearing featured the    Murray also  to request information on asbestos removal plans and to get explanations of past failures in protecting tunnel workers  After Murray received information from Dr  Michael Harbut   a preeminent occupational and environmental health physician   that the workers had signs of pulmonary and respiratory disease she immediately moved toward removal of the workers from the tunnels          In 2000  the Congressional Office of Compliance filed a complaint detailing some 13 000 health and safety violations in the tunnels  Then last February  the Congressional Office of Compliance filed another complaint that the AOC knew there were numerous asbestos dangers but  effectively ignored    many potentially life threatening safety and health violations            The Architect s decision to take action is a welcome one  but does little to excuse the many years of negligence that have cost these workers their health   said Senator Murray    For far too long these workers were exposed to deadly concentrations of asbestos while the Architect s Office turned its back on their complaints       The reports of inadequate protections  a lack of asbestos training  and failures to respond to the workers  concerns have been shocking  The AOC s failure to act not only threatened workers  health  but put families at risk for asbestos exposure as workers went home with fibers on their clothes  It should never have taken this long for this injustice to come to light  But since these revelations came out  I have fought to remove our workers from the tunnels        These workers have labored for years in the recesses of our nation s Capitol providing the heating and cooling services we too often take for granted  It is inexcusable that their employer has taken there health and well being for granted for so long       My message to the AOC is that this needs to be the first step   not the last   in finally ensuring the safety of workers and protecting the Capitol Hill community  The AOC still must apologize to workers  explain why it did not provide protective equipment for years  and take responsibility for the years of damage it has inflicted on these workers        Specifically  Senator Murray has called on the AOC to         Apologize to the tunnel workers for years of avoiding the health and safety issues in the tunnels        Temporarily remove tunnel workers from the tunnels until an abatement plan is in order and medical clearance is received        Get tunnel workers full medical evaluations and determine whether or not they are medically fit to wear respirators        Secure work for tunnel workers in areas that will not affect their health   with no loss of wages  use of vacation time or other benefits   until an asbestos abatement plan can be developed and endorsed by the Congressional Office of Compliance          Institute an asbestos abatement plan that includes strategies for proper air monitoring        Ensure that AOC tunnel workers and contractors are properly trained on asbestos awareness and abatement        Abate all the asbestos as soon as possible        Keep tunnel workers informed of AOC activities and progress        Senator Murray chairs the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety  Murray has worked for six years on banning all asbestos in the U S  and has introduced legislation in the 110th Congress that prohibits the importation  manufacture  processing and distribution of products containing asbestos in the U S  Murray s bill is S  742
