Release  Wednesday  November 14  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  spoke on the Senate floor in response to a CBS News Special Report that revealed shocking new numbers on the amount of veterans who have committed suicide  Senator Murray was featured in the CBS report expressing her dismay at the findings and discussing her frustration with trying to get an accurate assessment on veterans  suicides from the Administration  CBS News  five month investigation into veteran suicides found that at least 120 Americans who served in the U S  military killed themselves every week in 2005  Thats at least 6 256 veteran suicides in one year  a rate twice that of other Americans   Senator Murray s full remarks on the Senate floor are below  The CBS Report Should be a Wake up Call Mr  President  I want to take a few moments to talk about a subject that has tragically received too little attention  and that is the number of our veterans who take their own lives because our nation has failed them  In a break through report last night  CBS News revealed that far more veterans commit suicide than has previously been reported by the Defense Department and the VA  CBS found that in 2005  at least 6 256 veterans took their own lives  a rate twice that of other Americans  And they found that veterans aged 20 to 24  those most likely to have served during the War on Terror  are taking their own lives at rates estimated between 2 and 4 times higher than non veterans in the same age group  CBS should be commended for pushing past the Administrations stonewalling and digging to find these numbers  The Administration told the network that even the VA hadnt counted the nationwide numbers  Mr  President  these findings are sad  theyre horrifying  and they should be preventable  And they are a reflection of something that many of my colleagues and I have said over and over  They reflect an Administration that has failed to plan  failed to own up to its responsibilities  and failed even to keep complete statistics on the impact of the war on its veterans  From inadequate funding to a lack of mental health professionals  to a failure to help service members make the transition from battlefield to home front the Administration has dropped the ball  The Defense Department and the VA in particular must own up to the true cost of the war and do a better job to ensure our heroes arent lost when they come home  Mr  President  we in Congress are taking steps to better understand and care for the mental health wounds our troops experience  But we  too  HAVE to do more  If these numbers that CBS is reporting dont wake up America  nothing will  Its time for all of us to wake up to the reality and consequences of this war  Its time to wake up our neighbors  our communities  employers  and schools  and ask if were doing enough for a veteran  And its time to wake up the White House and demand better care for our heroes  As I speak today  a generation of service members is slipping through the cracks because of our failure to provide for them  And that is shameful  The Administration Has Ignored Veterans Mental Health Trauma Mr  President  five years ago  when the President asked us to go to war in Iraq  He talked about weapons of mass destruction  e talked about al Qaida  he talked about the mission to fight the war on terror  But he never talked about policing a civil war  or the stress of living months without a break  constantly waiting for the next attack  And he has never talked about  in my opinion  taking care of those men and women  who have served us honorably  when they finally come home  In the past  our service members were always given a rest  time to relax and regroup from battle  But we are waging this war with an all volunteer military  Some are serving their second  third  fourth  and now even FIFTH  tours of duty  And they are stretched to the breaking point  Too many sustain traumatic brain injuries  Too many suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  Fully one third of all service members will come home with a mental health condition  When they finally return  they struggle with memories of battle  In their nightmares  they see their friends being blown apart  Some turn to drugs or alcohol to numb themselves from the pain  And the sad truth is that too often  the system we have set up to provide care doesnt help them  and we dont find out how much pain they were in until its too late  Mr  President  Ive talked to these service members and their families  and Ive heard their stories  I want to share a few with you to illustrate why we must take action  These are young men and young men and women in their early 20s  young men and women who have served our country  They are someones son  brother  and best friend  That we are losing them is shameful  Stories of heartbreak The first is Justin Bailey  Justin joined the Marines when he was 18  just a few months after graduating from high school  Justin was about to separate from the Marines in 2003  when his service was involuntarily extended for the war in Iraq  Justin was injured  and he returned home in pain and suffering from PTSD  He underwent several surgeries and  over two years  was prescribed a slew of medications  including hydrocone  xanax and methadone  and he became addicted  Justin slipped through the cracks  Despite seeking help for addiction  he was allowed to self medicate  Despite warnings from the FDA  he was prescribed drugs that were inconsistent with treatment of PTSD  Justin sought help  But after six weeks in a VA program for addicts with PTSD  he never once saw a psychiatrist  Justins parents had assumed he would get proper supervision in the VA program  But he didnt  And this January  he took too many pills  and died of an overdose soon after  The next is Joshua Omvig  Josh was an eager soldier who dreamed of being a police officer  He insisted on graduating from high school early so he could join the military and begin his career  He was sent to Iraq  But after one visit home  his parents could see he was shaken  Ordinary things made him nervous  and he was having nightmares that made him shout out in his sleep  When he completed his tour of duty  he was transitioned back into civilian life after only a few weeks  And his parents saw he just wasnt the same  Josh didnt say much about Iraq  but he talked about hearing voices and seeing faces  and he was still jittery  His parents wanted him to get care  but he refused to see a doctor for fear it would hurt his career  Despite his parents efforts to help him  Josh couldnt get over the trauma he experienced in Iraq  It got worse  and his world slowly unraveled  Mr  President  Josh took his own life at age 22  Why Didnt We Prepare for This  Mr  President  Josh and Justins stories came to light because their families sought help from Congress  We passed the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act this year because his family pushed and pushed for legislation that would require the military and the VA to better understand and treat the psychological trauma our service members experience  Are these extreme examples  Maybe  But they arent isolated examples  And the reality is that many  many others slip un noticed through the cracks  And it would be one thing if we had no idea what the mental health strains are for veterans  But thats not the case  Weve seen service members come home with mental wounds in every military conflict  Mr  President  when I was a college student  I volunteered at the Seattle VA  I was assigned to the psychiatric ward  and I worked with Vietnam veterans who had seen horrors  you and I  and most of us here could never imagine  M  President  our understanding of the impact that warfare has on the minds of service members has evolved  But one thing we know is that the mental wounds our men and women in uniform suffer from can be just as devastating as their physical injuries  So it is long past time that the military knocked down the stigma associated with mental health care  provided the care veterans desperately need  and deserve  and backed it up with adequate funding  We must acknowledge that this is a cost of war we cannot ignore  What Can We Do    So Mr  President  what can we do to prevent more stories like Josh and Justins  We have to better understand the trauma our troops are experiencing  The Joshua Omvig Act takes steps to do that  but we have to do more  We need more mental health clinics and providers  We also need the VA to be proactive and reach out to veterans who arent enrolled in the VA system and are at risk for suicide  We have to provide the money to fully fund their care  The Senate has passed a bill that would increase funding for veterans by almost  4 billion over the Presidents request  I hope we can get those improvements to our veterans as quickly as possible  And we have to provide a seamless transition for our service members when they return home  and that starts with making sure that veterans can get their disability benefits without having to fight through the system  It is unconscionable that our heroes return from the battlefield  only to have to fight a bureaucracy to get the benefits they were promised  Conclusion Mr  President  Veterans Day was last weekend  and many of us went home and took part in ceremonies to thank our service members for securing our safety and our freedom  In my own speech in Kitsap County  Washington  I said that I believe Veterans Day shouldnt just be a day for ceremonies  It should be a day to consider  whether there is something more we can do for our veterans  and what the implications are of not doing enough  As the CBS News report found  too often  the implications are that many veterans are stretched to the breaking point  And that is a tragedy  We have to wake up to the reality that we have already lost too many  Mr  President  ours is a great nation  No matter how you feel about this current conflict  our troops are serving honorably  But we owe them so much more than we have given them so far  We can do better  We MUST do better
