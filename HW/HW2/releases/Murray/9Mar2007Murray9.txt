                                                                                                            News Release          Murray Delves Into Washington State s National Security Priorities During Questioning of Homeland Security Secretary      For Immediate Release  Friday  March 9  2007     Washington D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  questioned Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on the President s Homeland Security budget and how it affects important Washington state and national security priorities  Among the subjects Senator Murray discussed with Secretary Chertoff were port security  port security grant funding  U S  Coast Guard funding  PNNL funding  and northern border security         Senator Murray has worked hard to ensure that Washington residents and the state s trade dependent economy are given the proper level of support from the federal government  Senator Murray co authored the SAFE Ports act  a comprehensive approach to port security  which was signed into law last year        Senator Murray s Opening Statement and Questions for Secretary Chertoff follow     Thank you Mr  Chairman   I want to join you  Senator Cochran  and the rest of my colleagues in welcoming Secretary Chertoff to the Subcommittee       Port Security Successes    Mr  Secretary  as a Senator from a State that depends on its seaports for its livelihood  the security of our nation s ports has been one of my top priorities          We first spoke about my plans on port security shortly after you were nominated to be Secretary of Homeland Security   These plans formed the basis of the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security legislation that I worked on with Senator Susan Collins          As you are well aware  the GreenLane bill formed the backbone of the SAFE Ports Act  which the president signed into law last October   I was pleased to hear of the progress in implementing the SAFE Ports Act outlined in your testimony  and I know we both agree the agencies involved in securing these seaports are doing an admirable job   they are working through many difficult issues          Could you speak about the Department s initiatives to implement the SAFE Ports Act to improve the security of our ports          I am particularly interested in the Secure Freight Initiative   that implements multiple pilot projects at foreign ports   and gets us closer to a goal of 100  scanning of U S  bound cargo containers          While I understand that these pilots are on going  what are some of the early results telling you  As you may know  the SAFE Ports Act required a test center to test the issue of placing radiation detectors at a port where most of the containers are loaded directly from the ship to an awaiting rail car   Can you comment on the status of this project  and specifically some of the selection criteria the Department is using       Port Security Grants    Despite our work in improving the security of our ports  we still know that there is a lot left to do   As you know  the Commandant of the Coast Guard has said it would cost  5 4 billion over 10 years for our ports to comply with the Maritime Transportation Security Act          Mr  Secretary  my ports  like so many in the country  continually tell me they need more help to comply with security requirements in the Maritime Transportation Security Act and the SAFE Ports Act          And current demand significantly outstrips available resources   In rounds 1 through 6 of the port security grant program  the Department received over  4 3 billion in requests but allocated only  836 million   And not all ports are even eligible to apply for port security grants  so the demand is undoubtedly even greater        We all know of the significant issues our large ports have   Ports like New York New Jersey and LA Long Beach have stringent security requirements          But our smaller ports also have security needs that are not being met   I constantly hear that without an increase in port security funding those security improvements will never be met          New and expensive requirements are being implemented   this year  the requirement for transportation worker identification credentials and readers will come into effect        I am heartened to see that the President included  210 million for port security grants for fiscal year 08 after eliminating them in previous years   But given the demand  we know this is not enough          The SAFE Ports Act authorized  400 million for port security grants  which is what the ports have told us is what they need to assist them with their security improvements         Are you confident that each of our 360 port facilities is secure   If so  why is your Department still receiving nearly a billion dollars in requests annually for the Port Security Grant program  The Administration has recognized the role the federal government has in helping our ports to improve the security of our nation and has finally included port security grants in its budget request   As a senator from a state with two of the largest ports in the nation at Seattle and Tacoma to very small ports  what plan does the Department have for improving the security at our smaller ports to prevent harmful materials from entering our commerce        PNNL Funding    Another area I m very concerned about not only affects people in Washington State but also has a direct effect on the Department s ability to have cutting edge technology to address homeland security threats        Mr  Secretary  as you are aware  Washington State is home to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  or PNNL        I am sure you are also aware that the Department has a sizable portfolio of research at PNNL that touches on almost every aspect of the Department s priorities from cargo and port security to border security projects          Last year  the Department invested over  100 million in critical research projects at PNNL   This included  73 million for radiation portal monitoring   6 million for high explosives research and  2 million for counter proliferation        Some of PNNL s research facilities exist in the 300 Area of the Hanford Site  which is slated to be cleaned up by the Department of Energy   To prevent disruption to the critical work the lab is conducting and to accommodate the cleanup schedule there is a PNNL capability replacement effort funded by both DOE and DHS  I don t need to remind you that any disturbance of these facilities will have a significant affect on these important Department projects          Last year  Congress appropriated  2 million in the FY07 Homeland Security appropriations bill for the PNNL capability replacement project   It was my understanding that the FY08 Department of Homeland Security budget would include funding for this project   In fact  I understand that the FY08 Department budget did include  25 million for this project but it was taken out by OMB          Mr  Secretary  we have a great facility at PNNL with a number of exciting Homeland Security science and technology projects  and I encourage you to come personally  or send your staff out to visit   If you got a chance to see the important work PNNL is doing you would understand that it cannot be put at risk        Mr  Secretary   What are your plans for ensuring that the critical Homeland Security research at PNNL proceeds without disruption by the Hanford Clean up   Do you support the addition of  25 million in the Homeland Security appropriations bill for the Area 300 facility at Hanford       Northern Border Prosecutions    Mr  Secretary  because of the increased presence and law enforcement activity on the northern border  incarcerations and prosecutions are up dramatically since September 11th          The number of border patrol officers in Washington state has increased substantially   This increased law enforcement presence is important to securing our northern border  but we need to make sure that the communities along the border have the support they need to deal with the increased requirements on them        The major border crossing between Seattle and Vancouver  BC is in Whatcom County  and it serves as the crossing point for much of the cargo between Canada and the entire West Coast   This is not just a local issue   it is an issue of national importance        I want to enlist your assistance to address some of the tremendous challenges many of our northern border communities face  We need federal support for local law enforcement efforts at the northern border         We know that at least 55 percent of all ecstasy tablets seized at the northern border into the United States have entered through Whatcom County   We know that criminals are often turned away at the Canadian border and commit crimes in Whatcom County   For example  John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were turned away at the Canadian border and stayed in Whatcom County before moving here and gaining infamy as the D C  Area Snipers        Whatcom County  however  is a very small community compared to Detroit and Buffalo and it has a very limited local tax base to cover security costs   The community already absorbs about  3 million in prosecution costs simply because it is located on the border        We know that the 2010 Olympics and the 2009 Police and Firefighters Games in Vancouver will bring thousands of visitors to the northern border and place further strain on these law enforcement resources        Mr  Secretary  this community needs some special help   they don t have the tax base or population to sustain this and even greater increases        There is a fund within the Department of Justice to help southern border communities with these costs          I believe we need to ensure that northern border communities are eligible for this fund as well  What can your Department do to help communities like Blaine along the northern border  Why should federal support for local law enforcement efforts be limited only to southern border communities  Do you think that northern border communities should be eligible for this program        Another area I m very concerned about is how the Coast Guard will use the funds appropriated to it       Coast Guard Deepwater    In the aftermath of 9 11  we have asked the Coast Guard to assume significant new roles in homeland security   But at the same time  we still depend on the Coast Guard to carry out their many traditional missions        Last November  Coast Guard helicopters rescued a number of people from flooding rivers in Washington State    the Coast Guard recently oversaw the cleanup of a small oil spill in Puget Sound    and a Coast Guard cutter towed a Seattle based fishing vessel back to port in the Bering Sea        It has been my great pleasure to work closely with the many men and women who serve in the Coast Guard in Washington State   in Seattle  in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and along the Washington coast        That is why I have been so troubled by the state of the Coast Guard Deepwater acquisition program   We are putting a serious investment in new ships  planes and systems but we may be leaving these brave men and women worse off than before          The Coast Guard has removed eight 123 foot ships from patrol in Florida  only years after they were renovated   And we have heard troubling allegations that the National Security Cutter   the crown jewel of the Deepwater program   may suffer from design flaws that would produce cracks in the hulls          Admiral Allen testified before the Senate last month to address these issues   He stated   We have to get this right     Unfortunately  we keep hearing how the Coast Guard is getting it wrong and we the taxpayers are stuck footing the bill on unusable ships        Part of the issue lies in the oversight of the Deepwater program   The Department s own Inspector General  Richard Skinner  issued a report in January that blamed a lot of the problems with Deepwater squarely on the Coast Guard for poor oversight of the design and construction of its vessels        Can you please discuss what steps the Department has taken to improve its oversight of the Integrated Coast Guard Systems and the Deepwater project  The President s budget requests  788 1 million to complete the acquisition of four National Security Cutters   Admiral Allen s testimony stated that the Coast Guard will fix Cutters 1 and 2  which are currently being built  and design a fix for future boats   What steps has the Department taken to ensure that the Coast Guard will ensure that future cutters do not include any defect   What actions are you prepared to take if these proposed fixes are inadequate  For the Fast Response Cutter  a GAO report last year stated   The Coast Guard has expended about  25 million and does not have a viable FRC design to date    How can you reassure the Committee that the next  25 million we spend on the Fast Response Cutter  which is included in the President s budget request  is spent more effectively than the first  25 million
