               For Immediate Release  Thursday  August 31  2006     Washington D C     In the wake of the tragic crash of Comair Flight 5191 in Lexington  Kentucky  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today sent a letter to Federal Aviation Administrator Marion Blakey urging the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to focus its resources on ensuring that a well trained and experienced controller workforce is in place to guarantee the safety of the flying public  Senator Murray is the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies Subcommittee  which oversees funding for the FAA          On the eve of one of the busiest travel weekends of the year  travelers need to know that they are safe  They shouldn  t have to wonder if there are enough air traffic controllers or if those controllers have had enough sleep   said Senator Murray   That s why we have strict standards that the federal government must fully enforce         Murray asked the Administrator to explain why the FAA  s latest staffing plan would have fewer trained controllers on board this year and next year  why the FAA failed to detect violations of its staffing policy  and why the agency  s November safety directive was not issued in writing  among other questions         The following is the text of the letter that was sent to Administrator Blakey                                                                                                                                                 August 31  2006          The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20591     Dear Administrator Blakey        The tragic accident of Comair Flight 5191 in Lexington  Kentucky raises a critical question of whether your agency is adequately focused and positioned to maintain a sufficiently trained and experienced controller workforce that will guarantee the safety of the flying public   The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  must move aggressively to hire sufficient controllers to ensure that facilities like Lexington Tower will not have to wait an inordinate amount of time to fill controller vacancies brought on by retirements and other causes        Your agency is to be commended for frankly and promptly admitting that  at the time of the tragedy in Lexington  the air traffic control tower was operating with only one controller  in violation of your agency  s own safety directives   As I understand it  your senior safety managers issued a verbal directive back in November of last year that control towers must have separate controllers handling the ground operations and air operations at all times   This directive was issued after a potentially catastrophic   near miss    incident occurred while a controller was stationed alone in Raleigh  North Carolina   Despite the importance of this directive  the Lexington tower has been allowed to continually violate this directive on both weekdays and weekends ever since April of this year  when the facility experienced the retirement of one controller and the medical disqualification of another           FAA management did not discover the violation of its own safety directive until after the tragedy in Lexington  when the agency discovered similar violations at six other FAA towers   Given that the policy was implemented in the wake of a recent near tragedy in North Carolina  why were violations of this policy allowed to persist at numerous facilities for an extended period of time          Let me be clear that I do not take it as a foregone conclusion that a second controller on duty at the time of the accident could have prevented the Lexington tragedy   Only the National Transportation Safety Board can tell us the true cause of the accident and the measures that your agency and the other parties will need to take in order to preclude such tragedies in the future           The fact remains  however  that the FAA  s staffing plans now call for three new controllers at the Lexington tower to adequately meet traffic demands  but those positions are not scheduled to be filled until 2007 and 2008    Such a situation raises the question of whether your agency  s hiring plans will meet the need to maintain safety across our entire national aviation system            As you know  back in December of 2004  you released the FAA  s first comprehensive staffing plan to address the large number of expected retirements in your controller workforce   At that time  you stated that this plan would be issued annually and updated each year to reflect your most recent projections of your staffing needs   Despite this public commitment  no updated report was issued in December 2005   When I asked you during hearings in early May of 2006 why we had not received the report  you assured the Subcommittee that we would be receiving it very soon   It wasn  t until last week that you formally submitted the report    some eight months late   It unfortunately required our Committee to propose large statutory fines for the late submittal of the plan to get you to release it to us          Our initial review of your updated report is worrisome   Since your initial staffing plan was released in December of 2004  it appears that you now anticipate a greater number of retirements at the same time as you plan to hire fewer controllers to fill those losses  both for this year and next year   I remain concerned that further lengthening the time it takes to fill vacant positions    like those at Lexington tower    will only undermine the essential safety work of your people in the field           I would appreciate your response to the following questions regarding the issues discussed above         Why did your agency issue its safety directive regarding minimum staffing under certain tower configurations verbally rather than in writing       Why weren  t the persistent violations of this policy detected and corrected more quickly       What circumstances have changed since December of 2004 such that you now want to have fewer trained controllers on board  both this year and next year       What explains the delay in transmitting your controller staffing plan this year       Can we assume that your next controller staffing plan will be submitted in March of 2007  consistent with the dictates included in the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill for 2007        Thank you in advance for your prompt response to these inquiries   As always  I look forward to working with you to ensure the safety of our aviation system  both domestically and internationally
