For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 13  2006     Washington  D C      A week after a surprise announcement by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson and with many questions still unanswered  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today wrote the Secretary with a series of questions about his plans for a new veterans  facility in Walla Walla         As we have discussed repeatedly  veterans  community leaders and local advocates have spent years working their hearts out to protect and enhance veterans healthcare in the Walla Walla region   Your surprise visit and secrecy shrouded announcement fell far short of the open  detailed answers they deserve   Murray wrote    Throughout this process  veterans have been rightfully worried about how they will get the healthcare they need  and your announcement has not eased those worries         On Friday  July 7th with little advance notice  Secretary Nicholson flew to Walla Walla where he made a surprise announcement that the VA would build a new outpatient facility to replace the aging Jonathan Wainwright VA Medical Center  which serves 69 000 veterans in Washington  Oregon and Idaho          During his visit  Nicholson provided few specifics about how his plan would work  how veterans would get critical services  and how it would be paid for   Murray  a senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  wrote to Nicholson seeking those answers         While I appreciate your visit to my home state  your trip has raised new questions about what services will be provided  how they will be paid for and when they will become available   I m troubled that your announcement appears to eliminate some critical services in the region  and I m concerned that veterans could be left with another empty promise if you don t provide the funding to deliver on your announcement   Murray wrote        In 2003  the center was targeted for closure by the VA Cares Commission   Murray  veterans  and local advocates worked together and removed the center from the closure list   For the past few years  they ve worked to ensure that VA services will still be available in the region   Murray secured  250 000 to allow a local task force to develop a preferred alternative  which it presented to the VA Undersecretary for Health in April          In her letter  Murray asked about the Secretary s plan for community involvement          Most importantly  how do you plan for community stakeholders and veterans to be consulted and included in these decisions   Murray asked        News reports of Nicholson s visit last week suggest that some services will be eliminated at the new clinic         I am deeply concerned that you have proposed to eliminate the VA  s nursing home care  residential rehabilitation  inpatient healthcare  and inpatient mental health services in an area that lacks these services   Murray wrote    Although you guaranteed these services to the community  how do you plan to ensure that if your own proposal eliminates them         Murray closed by saying that the local community deserves full answers         Mr  Secretary  this community has worked so hard over the years in good faith and even provided you with a detailed proposal for how care should be provided in Walla Walla  They deserve the same from you   I await your answers   the Senator wrote       The full text of Senator Murray s letter follows     July 13  2006       The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue NW  Washington  DC 20420       Dear Secretary Nicholson        As we have discussed repeatedly  veterans  community leaders and local advocates have spent years working their hearts out to protect and enhance veterans healthcare in the Walla Walla region   Your surprise visit and secrecy shrouded announcement fell far short of the open  detailed answers they deserve          Throughout this process  veterans have been rightfully

and I am concerned that veterans could be left with another empty promise if you do not provide the funding to deliver on your announcement        I am writing to you in the hope that you can give me the answers I need to fully evaluate how your proposal for the Walla Walla VA Medical Center will impact the veterans I represent          While I am pleased to learn that the VA intends to maintain a footprint in the region   something that I have been fighting for over many years    I have many questions about the details        What services will this new facility provide   How much will it cost to build   When will it open   What process will the proposal go through   What services will be provided by the current facility in the interim   And most importantly  how do you plan for community stakeholders and veterans to be consulted and included in these decisions          I am deeply concerned that you have proposed to eliminate the VA  s nursing home care  residential rehabilitation  inpatient healthcare  and inpatient mental health services in an area that lacks these services   Although you guaranteed these services to the community  how do you plan to ensure that if your own proposal eliminates them        Mr  Secretary  this community has worked so hard over the years in good faith and even provided you with a detailed proposal for how care should be provided in Walla
