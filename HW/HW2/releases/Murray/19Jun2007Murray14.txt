Backing Employee Free Choice Act      For Immediate Release  Tuesday  June 19  2007      Senator Murray s Speech     Washington  D C   Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  voiced her support for the Employee Free Choice Act  S  1041 in a speech on the Senate floor  Senator Murray is a co sponsor of the legislation    In her speech Murray called on Congress to stand with our nation s workers and give them their voice back by strengthening protections for workers to freely choose to join a union   The Employee Free Choice Act will make the promise of employee choice a reality and will restore balance to the relationship between employers and employees  Murray said    The Employee Free Choice Act allows workers to bargain for better wages  benefits and working conditions by restoring workers freedom to choose for themselves whether to join a union  Specifically  the bill   Allows employees to choose a union when a majority of workers sign cards endorsing the union  Provides a time frame around first contract negotiations to prevent employers from stalling the negotiation process  Strengthens penalties for employers that break the law when workers seek to form a union or during first contract negotiations        The following is the text  as prepared  of Senator Murray s floor speech  Mr  President  I rise today to voice my support for workers  their families  and their right to share in the prosperity they helped create for this country  As Chairwoman of the Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee  protecting workers  rights is a critical priority for me  In last year s election  we all heard the voice of America s voters calling for change  I m proud to say that Democrats have been working hard to help working Americans and their families secure a better future  and we re making progress  We recently passed legislation increasing the minimum wage  the first increase in a decade  For the first time in 10 years  many Americans have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty  We re moving in the right direction  But our work doesn t end there  Mr  President  Now it s time to help workers by ensuring that their voices are heard in the workplace      Voices for better benefits   Voices for better wages   Voices for better health care   And voices for better pensions   Unfortunately  today  in too many workplaces  workers who try to exercise their legal rights are blocked by an unbalanced system that can trap them in unacceptable working conditions  It s time for Congress to stand with our nation s workers and give them their voice back by strengthening protections for workers to freely choose to join a union  The Employee Free Choice Act will make the promise of employee choice a reality and will restore balance to the relationship between employers and employees  I am proud to be a co sponsor of this important and balanced legislation  This Bill Is Needed Mr  President  why is this bill necessary  Because workers should be able to share in the prosperity they helped create  This bill is an important step in helping millions of working families get their fair share of the economic pie  Our nation s greatest assets are our people  American workers drive our economy  Their determination for a better future bolsters our nation s prosperity  That s why I was so concerned to learn that workers feel the American Dream is slipping away from them  According to a poll conducted earlier this year by the Change to Win Federation  82 percent of those surveyed said that they believe working families are falling behind  I find this troubling  Mr  President  given that worker productivity has increased 3 1  each year between 2000 and 2004 and that corporate profits have more than doubled since 2001  It just doesn t add up for American workers and their families  They re working hard to help our country prosper but not reaping their fair share of the benefits  Unions Make a Profound Difference But unions can make a positive difference  They allow workers to collectively express their voices to employers on working conditions  healthcare  pensions  and other benefits  And the benefits lead to better lives for working Americans  Women who belong to a union earn 31  more than women workers who are not union members  That s an extra  179 a week  and  9 300 more every year  Think about itan extra  179 could help working mothers put more food on the table for her family  It could help her pay for her son or daughter s education  It could help her put a little more away for retirement  making her and her family less dependent on Social Security  Workers who are union members are twice as likely to have employer health coverage  Union families that pay insurance premiums for their coverage pay 36  less than their counterparts  saving them almost  1 300 a year  With the enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act  it s estimated that up to a quarter of a million workers and their families in my home State of Washington would participate in their employers  health insurance plans  That s a step in the right direction for the 866 000 Washington State residents who were uninsured in 2005  They are also more likely to have guaranteed pensions  68  of unionized workers are covered compared to only 14  of non union workers  The AFL CIO estimates that up to 250 000 Washington State workers would participate in their employers  defined benefit pension plans with the passage of this bill  Workers recognize the benefits that unions offer them  In fact  53  of U S  workers say they would join a union if they could   AFL CIO    Clearly  unions empower their members to access better benefits and provide a better life for their families  Unions Help All of Us But what about other workers  those who don t belong to a union  Are unions beneficial for the rest of us  The answer is an emphatic yes  Unions have forged the way for millions of working families    union and non union    to share in the prosperity they helped create  Progressive employment policies such as the minimum wage  the 8 hour work day  the 40 hour work week  employer provided health care  and pension plans emerged from the labor movement and have become the standard in today s workplace  I think we can all agree that unions benefit our society as a whole  I m sure the 60 million U S  workers who say they would join a union if they could think so  too  Why is union membership declining when so many workers want to join and unions clearly benefit all of us  As it turns out  exercising your right to organize with other workers isn t an easy task under our current system  Problems With The Current System Mr  President  the system is broken  We all know that a fair labor market can only exist when employers and employees have a respected voice in the system  I m sorry to say that s not the case today  Some unscrupulous employers are silencing employees who try to join a union to better their economic situation for their families  and that s not fair  Under current law  workers who want to join a union use the majority sign up method to let the union know they re interested  Then  employers have the power to make a choice  They can choose to recognize their employees  wishes  and many progressive employers do  or  they can demand a NLRB election  stalling the process and silencing the voices of their employees  During the election process  employers have unlimited access to workers in the workplace  They can require workers to attend mass meetings to hear anti union messages and even require one on one meetings between supervisors and employees  And  under our country s labor laws  these practices are perfectly legal  Mr  President  I think we can all understand how intimidating these tactics can be  More often than not  employers create an unfriendly work environment where employees don t feel comfortable discussing unions or their benefits  In many cases they fear for their livelihood  and rightfully so  Unlike the peer relationship between co workers  employers hold a special position of power over their employees  Employers have power over a worker s wages and benefits and  ultimately  they can fire an employee  A recent analysis from the National Labor Relations Board shows that 1 in 5 union supporters are illegally fired for union activity during the organizing campaign  Too often  workers who clearly voice their desire for representation have been silenced by their employers  On the other hand  unions do not have access to workers while on the job  They are not allowed to enter the workplace at any time to meet with employees  Employees interested in learning about union membership must meet with representatives and employees on their own time  The Employee Free Choice Act does nothing to change this relationship  It does not limit the access employers have to workers  And  it doesn t expand the union s access to employees on the job  If employees make it through this obstacle and elect to form a union  the ordeal s not over yet  Bad faith employers can drag out the initial negotiations process  often for years  using the time and their unlimited access to employees on the job to convince them that unions are a bad idea  It s easy to see who holds most of the cards in this relationship  Workers shouldn t have to risk their livelihoods to exercise their right to form a union  But it happens all the time  Hardworking Americans shouldn t have to go through such an ordeal to form a union  The Employee Free Choice Act can help eliminate some of the unfair barriers that workers face and make it easier for them to organize  How does this bill address the problem  The Employee Free Choice Act can make a difference  It can help workers gain a respected voice in the conversation with employers  and it can penalize bad faith actors who break the law  1  Gives employees the choice of using the majority sign up option First  the bill ensures that employees who want to organize can do so without interference  By allowing employees to choose majority sign up  the Employee Free Choice Act gives workers their voice back  2  Puts a timeframe around first contract negotiations Second  this bill ensures there s time for reasonable negotiations  but it does not allow one side to act in bad faith and string employees along in a never ending process that s designed to block their ability to self organize  3  Strengthens penalties for employers that break the law Third  this bill will hold bad actors accountable if they break the law  According to American Rights at Work  every 23 minutes in America  an employer fires or retaliates against a worker for their union activity  We shouldn t tolerate illegal discrimination and retaliation against workers who are just trying to exercise their rights  If an employer violates the rights of its employees and is charged by the National Labor Relations Board  this bill will impose stricter penalties  It balances the playing field by requiring that the NLRB stop bad faith employers from interfering in a union campaign or contract negotiations  It puts teeth in the current law by making employers who break the law pay three times back pay and imposes civil penalties for unfairly discriminating against pro union workers  This will ensure that breaking the law doesnt just become part of the cost of doing business  What This Bill Does Not Do Mr  President some would have us believe that the Employee Free Choice Act radically changes the rules of the game or takes away employers  rights  Nothing could be further from the truth  First  it does not eliminate the secret ballot  I m pleased that this bill gives employees the opportunity to vote by secret ballot if they so choose  For too long  some employers have had control over the balloting process  and this bill gets the balance right by making sure employees have the free choice to use a secret ballot or majority sign up  Second  it does not create a new process  Some would have us believe this bill upsets the current system by creating a new process for forming a union  But majority sign up has always been allowable under the law  Today  some progressive employers voluntarily recognize their employees  choice to organize  Third  it does not trap employees into union membership  Opponents of this bill would also have us believe that allowing employees to choose majority sign up as their preferred method for choosing a union would lead to union coercion or would trap other workers into union contracts against their will  That s not true  Let s look at the facts about coercion and intimidation  American Rights at Work found that anti union behavior is widespread among some employers  Among those employers faced with a union campaign   30  of employers fire pro union workers  49  of employers threaten to close a worksite when workers attempt to form a union  although only 2  actually do  51  of employers coerce workers into opposing unions with bribery or favoritism  Both are illegal  82  of employers faced with an organizing campaign hire union busting consultants to stop union campaigns  91  of employers force employees to attend one on one anti union meetings with their supervisors   Some would have us believe that unions can be just as bad  but the data doesn t back that up  Mr  President  In her testimony before a House committee earlier this year  Nancy Schiffer  an attorney with AFL CIO  told us that they had reviewed 113 cases cited by the HR Policy Association as involving fraud and coercion  They found that only 42 decisions actually identified coercion  fraud or misrepresentation in the signing of union authorization forms  and that s since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935  Thats less than 1 case per year  Compare that 1 case a year with the more than 31 000 cases filed in 2005 alone of employers engaging in illegal firings and other discrimination against workers for exercising their right to form a union  Clearly  unions have proven to be good faith actors in this process  Fourth  it does not change an employer s free speech or property rights  One thing this bill does not change is the access to employees that exists today  Currently  employers have full access to employees during the workday  Unions do not  This bill leaves that relationship unchanged  Finally  it does not bankrupt or harm businesses  Opponents to this bill would also have us believe allowing workers the free choice of forming a union would be bad for business or would bankrupt employers  Again  Mr  President  nothing could be further from the truth  We know that majority sign up can work for employers and employees because it s already happening for some progressive employers  Take Cingular Wireless  now known as ATT  for example  In my home state of Washington  we ve seen proof that companies can remain competitive and profitable and still follow the law and respect worker rights  Cingular Wireless gave its workers in Bothell  Washington the free choice they re entitled to  As a result  nearly 1 000 workers in my hometown decided to organize  and Cingular won praise for its responsible  respectful approach to employee choice  Today  the company continues to be one of the top wireless providers in the country  Choosing to respect their employees  choice to unionize did not bankrupt them or make them any less competitive  Mr  President  this bill helps us find the right balance in relationship between workers and management  I hope that my colleagues will join with me in raising our voices in support of workers and their families by voting yes on this bill
