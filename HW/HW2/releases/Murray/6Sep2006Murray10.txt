                                                                    News Release          IRAQ   Remarks by Senator Patty Murray on Iraq and the Broader War on Terror    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 6  2006    Mr  President  this resolution asks a simple question    Could the Bush Administration be doing things better in Iraq  the global War on Terror  and with homeland security      We Can Do Better    Mr  President  I know we can do better  and I know we need to change course if we want to be more secure   We can do better than sending our troops into war without the armor and equipment they need   We can do better than misleading the American people about the cost of war   We can do better than completely misreading the insurgency  which the Vice President told us over a year ago was in its  last throes    We can do better than a policy that leaves our troops without a clear mission and without a plan for success        Our service members deserve better  and frankly  our security demands better  and it starts with this Senate saying that we need to change course   We cannot tolerate more of the same on Iraq   We cannot tolerate an Administration that has gotten it wrong at every turn   And we need to send that message loud and clear         What s the Mission     Mr  President  we all want the same thing in Iraq    for our troops to complete their mission successfully and come home safely   But today it s not even clear why our service members are still there   What are they supposed to be accomplishing in Iraq today   Overthrowing Saddam Hussein   They already accomplished that   Looking for weapons of mass destruction   They looked  and there were no weapons to be found   Are they supposed to be setting up an Iraqi government   Well  we ve done that   The Iraqi people have created a constitution  elected their leaders  and filled their cabinet  Our troops have done everything we ve asked them to do  What is left   What are our troops supposed to be accomplishing today   And will the President s policies get us there   That s the discussion we need to be having       A Distraction from the War on Terror    This Administration s focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger War on Terror and left us vulnerable   Our country faces possible threats from terrorists around the world  and we need a security strategy that ensures we can fight those threats wherever they are          But instead  the Bush Administration has become increasingly focused on Iraq   The President took a detour from the War on Terror and has invested a majority of our resources into Iraq    seemingly forever   That weakens our ability to fight the broader War on Terror  and that is another mistake   Bin Laden is still on the loose  and our homeland security efforts are woefully inadequate       Send a Message  Get Back on Track    This resolution sends the message that we ve got to get back on track in the War on Terror   We cannot continue to  stay the course  in Iraq indefinitely and expect to make progress in the global War on Terror   The War on Terror extends far beyond the borders of Iraq    and unless we deal with all the threats we re facing  we re not going to have the security we deserve in this country   But this White House has put all our eggs in the basket of Iraq  and we re slipping behind in other challenges in places like Iran  North Korea  and Afghanistan       Afghanistan is Sliding    Yesterday the New York Times showed us how bad things have gotten in Afghanistan    quote            Across Afghanistan  roadside bomb attacks are up by 30 percent  suicide bombings have doubled  Statistically it is now nearly as dangerous to serve as an American soldier in Afghanistan as it is in Iraq         Mr  President  today  the Seattle Post Intelligencer in my home state of Washington editorialized that we need to get back to work in Afghanistan   And I want to read you what they said  quote           The central government s control is weakening as warlords and the Taliban reassert themselves  Casualties for international troops are mounting  making Afghanistan almost as risky for U S  soldiers as Iraq  Opium production is at a record  The head of the U N  Office on Drugs and Crime said Afghanistan is now supplying a  staggering  92 percent of the world s opium supply       Mr  President  we entered Afghanistan because it had harbored Al Qaeda and Bin Laden    who were responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11th which killed nearly 3 000 Americans   We still have not captured Bin Laden  and the Taliban is re emerging in Afghanistan   Iraq is not the only challenge we face   If we don  t recognize that  Americans will pay the price       They ve Gotten It Wrong    This Administration has gotten it wrong in Iraq  the War on Terror and on homeland security time and again   Continuing this status quo is unacceptable  and that s the message I m sending with my support of this resolution   The American people deserve straight answers and a real debate so we can get this right   Nothing is more important for our security and our future
