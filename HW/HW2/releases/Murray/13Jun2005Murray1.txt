                                                               News Release          Murray Calls for End to Airbus Subsidies as Air Show Kicks Off in Paris    For Immediate Release  Monday  June 13  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray today was joined by Senator Maria Cantwell  local business leaders and Boeing workers in calling for an end to illegal           European subsidies to Airbus at a press conference at the Museum of Flight in Seattle        As the 46th Annual Paris Air Show kicked off today with a focus on the A380    which has received nearly  4 billion in subsidies from the EU    Murray highlighted the need to level the playing field for American aerospace workers and applauded forward movement on a trade case at the World Trade Organization          As the Paris Air Show kicks off today  we will see many impressive displays of aviation  technology and innovation     the 787 Dreamliner and 777 Worldliner  just to name a few   But there is something else that will be on display at this year  s Air Show   the fruits of some thirty years of direct cash advances and illegal subsidies to Airbus     Murray said            I called on the Administration to move ahead with a trade case   And they have done just that   This is the right thing to do to protect American jobs and our aerospace industry well into the future           Despite Airbus   status as the current leading manufacturer of large civil aircraft with more than fifty percent of the market share  the company continues to receive market distorting subsidies and engage in unfair trade practices which are undermining the U S  aerospace industry and American jobs         Today at the Paris Air Show  Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard admitted that Airbus does not need launch aid  but will continue to accept it anyway         In any event  we have the money   Forgeard said during a press conference at the Le Bourget Air Show  but  that s not to say we would spit on any support    Forbes com  6 13 05        Airbus has received at least  15 billion in direct cash advances from European governments to develop its family of aircraft   If Airbus had had to borrow that money from commercial lenders at market rates  it is estimated that the company would have spent  35 billion to develop its aircraft models          The Europeans understand that without the subsidies  without an unfair advantage  they would have a heck of a time competing head to head with American workers  They would lose  We ve got to stop the subsidies     Murray said        Senator Murray has long called on Europe to abandon illegal subsidies  She raised the prospect of a WTO case over a year ago in a speech to the Senate and was an early advocate for the United States to withdraw from the 1992 U S   EU Agreement on Trade in Large Commercial Aircraft         In April  Murray helped introduce a resolution in the Senate that called on European governments to reject launch aid for Airbus and supported the President  s authority to take any action necessary to protect American aerospace jobs        The full text of Murray  s remarks at today  s news conference follows                                                                      Remarks by Senator Patty Murray at an Aerospace Press Conference     Thank you all for coming out today   I especially want to thank the Museum of Flight for hosting us         A New Day for Washington s Aerospace Workers    Well  it  s about 7 o  clock in the evening in Paris  but it  s a brand new day for aerospace workers here in Washington state   It  s a new day  because we are all here to stand together in support of American aerospace jobs and the best  most skilled aerospace workforce in the world    55 000 of whom call Washington state home        And today is a new day because of the bold action the Bush Administration and the USTR have taken in defense of our aerospace jobs by moving forward with a trade case against the EU at the World Trade Organization   We entered negotiations to avoid this move nearly six months ago    unfortunately the EU mocked our good faith efforts by moving ahead with new launch aid for the A350  I called on the Administration and Ambassadors Zoellick and Portman to move ahead with a trade case   And they have done just that    This is the right thing to do to protect American jobs and our aerospace industry well into the future       Paris Air Show and Subsidies    As the Paris Air Show kicks off today   we will see many impressive displays of aviation  technology and innovation     the 787 Dreamliner and 777 Worldliner  just to name a few          But there is something else that will be on display at this year  s Air Show   the fruits of some thirty years of direct cash advances and illegal subsidies to Airbus   For more than three decades the European governments who created Airbus to specifically compete with the United States have aggressively funded  protected and promoted their venture          Today Airbus is a mature company  with more than half of the market for large commercial aircraft    but Europe is still treating the company with kid gloves   Airbus has received at least  15 billion in direct cash advances from European governments to develop its family of aircraft          If Airbus had had to borrow that money from commercial lenders at market rates  it is estimated that the company would have spent  35 billion to develop its aircraft models        Such massive  market distorting subsidies are today allowing Airbus to offer incentives for airlines to buy planes like the A380    which made its Paris Air Show debut today    In fact  Airbus has received  3 7 billion in subsidies for the A380    and now they are requesting  1 7 billion for the A350        We know how much our own aerospace workers here in Washington sacrificed to land the 787   Because of those sacrifices they will build a plane that redefines aviation  and already the market is rewarding those sacrifices   But if we allow Europe to subsidize the A350  then our wins and our sacrifices will have been for nothing        Some may ask why the Europeans must subsidize their new aircraft  but we know the answer  The Europeans understand that without the subsidies  without an unfair advantage  they would have a heck of a time competing head to head with American workers  They would lose   We ve got to stop the subsidies        Airbus s False PR Campaign    We also need to expose Airbus s false PR campaign  Airbus is lying about its impact on American jobs  It says it creates them  but we know it kills them         In April  the Commerce Department released an exhaustive study done at the request of this Congress    on the U S  Jet Transport Industry    This 150 page report once again comes to the same conclusion we ve heard time and again  Airbus is not an American company  and Airbus does almost nothing to support the hundreds of thousands of American workers who depend on this important industry       Airbus is No Friend of the U S     Not only does Airbus kill American jobs  but it has shown it is no friend of the United States    Recently  NBC Nightly News went to an air show in Iran  Now we as a country have some big problems with Iran    Iran is trying to destabilize and undermine our interests in the Middle East  Iran is trying to obtain nuclear weapons  and Iran is not a friend of the United States           But guess who is at the Iran Air show    Airbus   And guess what they re doing    trying to sell their military helicopters to Iran    When a reporter confronted the Airbus rep  here is what he said   As a European company  we re not supposed to take into account embargoes from the U S          To me  that says it all  Airbus is a European company    first  last and always    and Airbus doesn t care about American workers or American security and they have no business competing for our defense contracts   And I  for one  will work to ensure that that doesn  t happen         So  I  m proud to be here today    as the Air Show kicks off in Paris    with so many friends of American aerospace jobs   We know how important these jobs are to the future of our state  our economy and the American aerospace industry   And we are partnering on a local and federal level to make sure our country does right by our aerospace workers        I now want to turn it over to great partner in the fight to protect jobs right here in the state of Washington    someone who helped me to convince our Senate colleagues to go on record in support of a trade case    my colleague  Senator Maria Cantwell
