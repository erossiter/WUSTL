2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray and Veteran Leaders Say  Don t Shortchange America s Veterans  in Fiscal Year 2006 Veterans Healthcare Budget As House Senate Committee Sets Funding Level  Senator Murray Warns that Any Cuts Will Hurt America s Veterans    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 9  2005     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   joined with officials from six national veterans organizations to urge House and Senate negotiators to keep the Senate s funding level as they develop the final VA healthcare budget for Fiscal Year 2006            I am very worried about the direction Congress is headed when it comes to veterans healthcare funding   Murray said    I am sounding the alarm that I    and veterans across the country    are watching what s happening  and we expect the House and Senate to keep their commitment to America s veterans   We are about to celebrate Veterans Day  a day that honors the bravery and sacrifices made by service men and women   It would be a great disservice to so many of our country  s veterans if this Congress provides less than adequate funding to serve its veterans           Senator Murray led a six month effort to boost VA funding  which resulted in an additional  1 5 billion for veterans healthcare in late July   Now Murray is working to ensure that the funding she secured is not cut in conference negotiations         Members of the House and Senate are trying to reconcile two different budgets for veterans healthcare   The Senate appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2006 provides  23 308 billion for VA medical services   The House budget  however  provides over  2 billion less   20 995 billion    The House budget was passed before a funding shortfall at the VA was discovered this summer   Senator Murray and veteran leaders said the higher Senate figure more accurately represents the VA s needs and should be the number in the final bill that emerges from conference negotiations   Murray is a member of that conference committee   Tomorrow  Senator Murray will question VA Secretary Jim Nicholson at a VA hearing        Senator Murray spoke on a conference call today with representatives from six national Veterans Service Organizations  VSO   the American Legion  Disabled American Veterans  Veterans of Foreign Wars  Military Officers Association of America  Blinded Veterans Association  and Paralyzed Veterans of America        Murray  a key member of the Veterans   Affairs Committee and the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran  assured the leaders that as Veteran  s Day approaches  she will continue to fight to ensure that Congress keeps its healthcare promises to those who protect our country        Let me be clear  Any dollar below the Senate s level of is a dollar taken away from a veteran   Murray said    It means a VA clinic that won  t be constructed   It means a VA doctor who won  t be hired   It means a veteran who doesn  t get the care that America promised upon their enlistment        Murray also raised her concern that VA maybe be diverting medical care dollars to pay for Hurricane Katrina related efforts  and Murray urged the Bush Administration to send Congress a realistic budget for Fiscal Year 2007       Representatives from VSOs thanked Senator Murray for her support and outlined the need for adequate veterans funding         The 2006 budget must be at a level to ensure that the VA can serve not only those veterans waiting in line at the VA today  but also the new era of veterans we create every day in Iraq and Afghanistan     Said Peter Gayton  Deputy Director for Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation  The American Legion         We believe the Senate  s numbers are where we need to be  and we  re going to do everything we can to ensure that they stay there     said Joe Violante  National Legislative Director  Disabled American Veterans         The Senate prescribed funding level for the VA must be stuck with   Just as all of the additional  1 5 billion was needed in 2005  the Senate level for health care funding in 2006 is required as well     said Dennis Cullinan  National Legislative Service Director  Veterans of Foreign Wars         Today we  ve got something like 500 000 new guard and reserve veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan  and more are in the pipeline every single day   We don  t think the VA has been including cost estimates for their care  and that  s a gross oversight   They are veterans when they come back  even as they continue to serve     said Bob Norton  Deputy Director of Government Relations  Military Officers Association of America         The VA claims there are only 34 soldiers who have been blinded in Iraq   I recently spoke with doctors at Walter Reed  Army Medical Center   who say that number is way too low  and we could be looking at 100 150 soldiers that will need blind rehabilitative services from the VA   If the system isn  t adequately funded  we won  t be able to meet the needs these young soldiers have     said Tom Zampieri  Director of Governmental Relations  Blinded Veterans Association         We live within the bounds of a very complicated process between budget and appropriations   As the process unfolds  the VA never really knows how much its going to get  or when it will get that appropriation   A hospital director can  t hire a new doctor or nurse  or replace medical equipment  because he  s waiting on Congress to get the job done   That  s one of the reasons all of our organizations have joined together to say that this process is broken     said Richard Fuller  Legislative Director  Paralyzed Veterans of America
