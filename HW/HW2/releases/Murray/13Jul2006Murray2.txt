Passes Millions for Washington  s Homeland Security Needs    For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 13  2006     WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today announced full Senate passage of the Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill  which provides critical funding for security needs in Washington state and across the nation          As a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  Murray played an integral part in adding more than  1 2 billion to the bill for increased port and border security  and programs ranging from grants for firefighter and law enforcement training to funding staff at local county emergency response call centers              Homeland security is a national issue and one that requires shared sacrifice      Senator Murray said      I am pleased that the Senate agreed to improve upon the President  s funding numbers and provide our local first responders and border patrol agents with more of the funding  training and resources they need to keep our communities safe            Murray  who helped to manage the bill as it proceeded on the Senate floor  also succeeded in securing funds for Kvichak Marine of Seattle and Safe Boats International of Port Orchard to build additional boats for the U S  Coast Guard        Senator Murray also announced  400 million in Port Security Grants  up from the  173 million appropriated in Fiscal Year 2006   Murray has been a leading voice in the Senate for increased funding for port and cargo security and her GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act    co sponsored by Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and waiting to be brought to the floor of the Senate    would authorize  fund and enforce comprehensive cargo security standards for our nation           Nearly five years after the horrific attacks of September 11th  and less than a year after the Dubai Ports World scandal  Congress should step up and pass the GreenLane act      Murray said      It is far past time that we close what security experts continually call the gaping hole in our nation   s security and fund port and cargo security   Without it  we leave our people and our economy exposed to those who would do us harm            Murray was also successful in adding an additional  2 million in funding specifically for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  PNNL  as part of the Capability Replacement Laboratory project        PNNL currently conducts WMD detection and nonproliferation research in the 300 Area of the Hanford Site and must relocate from this area to make way for the on going cleanup of the Hanford Site  These funds will help ensure the replacement facilities are constructed in a timely fashion and prevent a lapse of this critical research        Additionally  the bill provides  20 6 million in U S Coast Guard funding for the Puget Sound Region         Funding for Washington state priorities include      Providing for 20 additional FTEs at the Bellingham Northern Border Air Wing  bringing it to full staffing         20 6 million for U S  Coast Guard District 13 in Seattle         24 75 million for the Response Boat Medium program in Kvichak Shipyard in Seattle        880000 to finish the breakwater at Neah Bay         2 1 million for the U S  Coast Guard s Sector Command building in Seattle         2 million for the construction of radiological laboratories at PNNL      Funding for national programs includes       400 million in Port Security Grants    up from  173 million in FY 2006  The President s budget request would have eliminated this program        220 million for Emergency Management Performance Grants  Up from  170 million requested by President Bush        655 million for Firefighter Assistance Grants    nearly doubles the President  s  293 5 million request         350 million for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program    the President  s request would have eliminated this program         35 million for the Metropolitan Medical Response program    the President  s request would have eliminated this program         25 million for Demonstration Training Grants    the President  s request would have eliminated this program        The bill also rejects the President  s plan to place an additional tax on air travelers  and provides for an more than 1 000 additional border patrol agents
