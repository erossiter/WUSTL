At the Port of Olympia today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  joined local leaders to announce that she has secured  1 million to support the Port of Olympia s Intermodal Rail Expansion Project   This project will enable the Port to expand its cargo capacity  and will contribute to economic growth in the region          As the top Democrat on the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  Murray helped secure the funding in the Transportation Appropriations bill for 2006  which President Bush signed into law on November 30th  2005         This investment is great news for the region  s economy  for local businesses  for the port  and for our state   Senator Murray said    For the South Puget Sound  it means we  re going to grow the region  s economy   For working families  it means more jobs here at the port and more local businesses hiring workers   For our producers and importers  it means we  ll have more capacity at the Port to trade with the world   For local residents  it means you  ll have fewer trucks on residential streets  less traffic congestion on I 5  and a better quality of life         Also attending the announcement were  Port Commissioner

County           Senator Murray has provided outstanding leadership to secure federal resources in a tight budget year to support this critical project to improve the port  s intermodal capacity     said Port Commissioner Steve Pottle    This project will increase the port  s ability to handle greater volumes by shifting cargo from truck to rail  bringing new business and more jobs to our community  It will also help reduce regional truck traffic and congestion on the I 5 corridor            Senator Murray s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follow       Today is a great day for the people  the economy  and the future of Olympia   I  m thrilled to be here to celebrate with you and to announce some critical federal funding I was able to secure for transportation improvements that will help shape the region well into the future        We all know our ports and transportation infrastructure are the economic engines moving people and goods across our state and laying the foundation for continued economic growth   And  thanks to all of you  we  re making that engine even stronger and more powerful here in Olympia          All of us know how important trade and our ability to move goods quickly and efficiently through our ports is to the economy   That s why I  ve worked so hard at the federal level to make critical investments in our waterways  our highways  our railways and our ports        But in order to sustain that growth we must make other investments in our transportation infrastructure to address increased traffic and improve access to the port   That  s why I  m proud to announce that I was able to secure  1 million to support the Port of Olympia  s efforts to reduce congestion  increase capacity  and improve freight mobility          As the highest ranking Democrat on the committee that funds the Department of Transportation  I was able to use my position to make the federal government a partner in this important project   This money  along with the funds secured by Congressman Brian Baird  will fully fund the second phase of this project that will allow more cargo to leave the port on high capacity trains        This investment is great news for the region  s economy  for local businesses  for the port  and for our state   For the South Puget Sound  it means we  re going to grow the region  s economy   For working families  it means more jobs here at the port and more local businesses hiring workers   For our producers and importers  it means we  ll have more capacity at the Port to trade with the world   For local residents  it means you  ll have fewer trucks on residential streets  less traffic congestion on I 5  and a better quality of life   And for our state  it means we are moving forward    planning for the future and making sure we benefit from it        This day has been a long time in the making for many of you and your success reflects your commitment to building a better future for the entire community   I applaud your work and your foresight          I talk to people all over our state who have ideas about how to help their communities and sometimes they don  t know how to move forward   I always tell them to do exactly what you have done here    develop a vision  build a broad coalition and don  t stop until you make it happen          I m so excited about the positive impact this funding and this project will have on the future of Olympia   The investment we  re making today to improve transportation infrastructure lays the foundation for future economic growth        Everyone here played a role in helping us reach this point    and I just want to say my special thanks to the Port Commissioners and staff and to local business leaders   When we invest in our transportation infrastructure  we reduce congestion  improve safety  and build stronger communities   Today  we  re ensuring that the port and city will be ready for the future and we re confirming that we re willing to make the critical investments that will serve this community for decades to come          So  I  m proud to be here today to support this important project   Thank you for your work and dedication  and I look forward to working with you to make this project a success well into the future
