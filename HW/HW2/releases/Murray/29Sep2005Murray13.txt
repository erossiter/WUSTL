                                                      News Release          Murray Introduces  SAFE Act  to Help Domestic Violence Victims Bill Provides Economic Protections to Help Victims Escape Abusive Relationships    For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 29  2005     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  introduced legislation to knock down the economic barriers that often trap victims in violent relationships   The bill  the Security and Financial Empowerment  SAFE  Act  is S 1796       Highlights of the bill include      The SAFE Act will allow victims to take time off from work without penalty in order to make court appearances  seek legal assistance  and get help with safety planning   For too many victims  access to these essential services can mean the difference between life and death       The SAFE Act allows victims in every state access to unemployment benefits if they are fired or forced to leave their job because of abuse       The SAFE Act will strengthen the Family Violence Option in TANF  in order to protect some of the most economically vulnerable victims  The SAFE Act prohibits discrimination in employment and insurance based on domestic or sexual violence  to ensure that victims are never punished for their abusers   crimes       More information on     Senator Murray s statement from the Congressional Record    and a bill summary    follow       Statement from the Congressional Record    Mr  President  along with my colleagues  Senators Leahy  Dayton  Dodd and Corzine  I am introducing legislation that  if adopted  will protect and even save the lives of victims of domestic or sexual violence and their families   This bill  the Security and Financial Empowerment  SAFE  Act  addresses the impact of domestic and sexual violence that extends far beyond the moment the abuse occurs         Mr  President  I am introducing this legislation today as a tribute to Paul and Sheila Wellstone  who were such champions for victims of domestic violence  Senator Wellstone and I first introduced this legislation together in 1998  Paul s desk was just behind me here on the Senate floor  I can still see him behind me waving his arms and making the case for people who have no voice        Not long ago  domestic violence was considered a family problem  and many victims had nowhere to turn for help   Today  thanks to the Violence Against Women Act  VAWA  we have made great progress in fighting these violent crimes   I worked to help pass this landmark legislation in 1994 and I am proud to be a part of reauthorizing it this year   But although VAWA has been a great success in coordinating victims   advocates  social service providers and law enforcement professionals to meet immediate challenges  there is still work to be done          As someone who has spent my entire public life working with victims and experts to fight domestic violence  I am offering this bill based on what these courageous individuals have told me they need   Financial insecurity is a major factor in ongoing domestic violence   Too often  victims who are not economically self sufficient are forced to choose between protecting themselves and their children and keeping a roof over their heads   It is critical that we help guarantee the economic security of victims of domestic or sexual violence so that they can provide permanent safety for themselves and their families and so that they are not forced  because of economic dependence  to stay in an abusive relationship        In order to do this  we must ensure that victims of domestic or sexual violence can seek the help they need without the fear of losing their jobs   Too many victims have been fired for missing work in order to find shelter or get a court restraining order  even after receiving permission from their employers   Today  a woman can use the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for a sick or injured spouse  but she cannot use that act to seek protection from her abuser   The SAFE Act will allow victims to take time off from work without penalty in order to make court appearances  seek legal assistance  and get help with safety planning   For too many victims  access to these essential services can mean the difference between life and death        Unfortunately  some victims of domestic or sexual violence are forced to leave their jobs and relocate to protect themselves and their families   We must ensure the continued financial security of these victims through the use of unemployment benefits   Currently  a woman can receive unemployment benefits if she leaves her job because her husband must relocate   But if that same woman is fleeing her husband  s abuse  in many states she cannot receive the same benefits   Currently  28 states and the District of Columbia provide some type of unemployment assistance to victims of domestic or sexual violence   Our bill will ensure that assistance is available in every state  so that no woman has to make the tragic choice of risking her safety to protect her livelihood          Moreover  victims must not be made silent by the fear of discrimination in employment and insurance   Punishing victims for circumstances beyond their control is wrong and only helps abusers in their efforts to control their victims   Denying a woman employment because she is a victim of domestic violence robs her of the economic security she needs to escape a dangerous relationship   Making insurance coverage decisions based on a history of abuse only encourages women to lie about their victimization and avoid seeking help until it is too late   The SAFE Act prohibits discrimination in employment and insurance based on domestic or sexual violence  to ensure that victims are never punished for their abusers   crimes        Sadly  domestic violence and poverty are inextricably linked  and many victims of domestic or sexual violence are also recipients of Temporary Aid to Needy Families  TANF    Work requirements in this program often punish victims who must take time off to protect themselves and their children   In 1996  Senator Paul Wellstone and I offered an amendment to TANF called the Family Violence Option  which allows states to adjust TANF work requirements for victims of domestic violence   The SAFE act will strengthen the Family Violence Option  in order to protect some of the most economically vulnerable victims        Despite the great progress that has been made  domestic violence is still a serious problem in our country   Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women  and over 5 3 million incidents occur every year   Domestic or sexual violence also continues to have severe economic consequences  costing businesses between 3 and 5 billion dollars each year in lost productivity   The SAFE Act will help victims to escape dangerous situations and prevent abuse from occurring   This will not only protect the lives of countless victims  it will allow them to be more productive members of the economy        I am proud of the guidance we  ve received from advocates in crafting this legislation   I want to thank them for their efforts and their commitment to breaking the cycle of violence   I want to particularly acknowledge the efforts of the advocates in Washington State who have provided invaluable input in drafting this legislation   The support and leadership of our communities will help us take this critical next step in passing SAFE        For victims of domestic violence  an abusive relationship can seem like a hopeless situation   Through VAWA  we have already provided new hope to millions of these victims   The SAFE Act is the crucial next step in ending the cycle of abuse   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and provide victims and their families with the tools they need for productive  independent    and most importantly  safe    futures                                                                                                 Security and Financial Empowerment  SAFE  Act     BILL SUMMARY     Title I  Entitlement to Emergency Leave
