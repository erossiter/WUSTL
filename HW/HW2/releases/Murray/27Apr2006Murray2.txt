Telemarketers Access to Taxpayers  Private Financial Data Murray Criticizes Proposed Changes That Would Allow Tax Preparers to Sell Tax Information to Third Parties  Murray   The IRS should not be an accomplice in selling taxpayer information      For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 27  2006     Washington  D C      At a Senate hearing today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  told the IRS Commissioner that she strongly opposes an IRS plan that would make it easier for tax preparers to sell taxpayers  private financial records to telemarketers and other third parties   She urged IRS Commissioner Mark Everson to re examine the proposal and prohibit the sharing of taxpayer information         The IRS should not be an accomplice in selling taxpayer information   Murray told the IRS Commissioner   Taxpayers deserve more privacy  not less            What consumer really wants to have their dinner interrupted by a telemarketer who s looking at a copy of their private tax return   Murray asked    I hope the IRS will take a fresh look at these regulations and provide an outright prohibition on this information being shared with anybody           In March  the IRS proposed changes to its privacy policy that would modernize procedures for tax preparation firms to sell an individual s tax records to third parties   While a firm would need to get a taxpayer s signature  Murray noted that many Americans may not realize they are signing away their privacy rights            We know how this works   Murray said    It is 4 p m  on April 15th  you re signing the last piece of paper the tax preparer s put in front of you   You re signing everything as fast as you can         Murray  to express her concerns   Today  Murray used her position as the top Democrat on the committee that oversees the IRS to question Commissioner Everson about the proposal   The committee is the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  and Housing and Urban Development        MURRAY  Why you are providing any opportunity for tax preparers and their affiliates to use personal financial data to sell mortgages  mutual funds  IRA accounts  or life insurance   Don t taxpayers already have innumerable opportunities to shop for services like that without subjecting their personal tax returns to perusal by marketers     EVERSON  What we are trying to do here is have a balanced approach   This piece of the law has been in effect for over 30 years  but the world has changed since that time       I guess the better question is whose information is it   Is it the taxpayer s information or is it the government s information   We  at the IRS  as you know  don t share information with anybody  so it  s a question of preparers           W hat we re trying to do is provide a really clear protection       But we don  t think  that under statue now  we could say  you aren t free to share your information with that preparer      During the hearing  Murray also questioned Commissioner Everson about the agency s shortfalls in fairly collecting taxes  inaccurate assistance provided by the IRS to taxpayers  and a flawed plan to close taxpayer assistance centers         Senator Murray s opening statement and a transcript of her questioning Commissioner Everson follow                                                         Senator Murray s Opening Statement    Exactly ten days ago  millions of taxpayers scurried to the post office to file their 2005 tax return right at the deadline   American taxpayers have come to expect certain things when it comes to the way their taxes are prepared  processed  and collected in this country   First they expect honesty   They expect that  like themselves  the vast majority of their neighbors are paying what they owe and that the IRS is there to ensure that everyone pays their fair share   Second  they expect integrity   They expect that their taxes will be processed correctly  especially if they have paid a tax preparation firm to do it for them   Third  they expect privacy   They expect that the personal financial information that they share with the IRS will be kept private and will stay private whether it s in the hands of tax preparers or the IRS   Finally  they expect some help   They expect that  if they need some help understanding the very complex tax code  the IRS will be there to assist them   Those are all reasonable expectations   Unfortunately  today the IRS is falling short of meeting those expectations           Rather than everyone paying his or her fair share  it has become clear that we have a huge tax gap in this country    estimated at  345 billion   That s the difference between the amount that Americans owe and the amount that the IRS actually collects   I want to note that the IRS Commissioner deserves some credit for being outspoken on this problem          When it comes to taxes being prepared accurately  the IRS has  at times  had a spotty record in providing accurate tax advice to inquiring citizens   Now  we see more recent reports indicating that even the tax preparation professionals are doing an inadequate job preparing people  s taxes  exposing our citizens to potentially significant fines and tax debts          When it comes to keeping taxpayer information private  we have seen several instances where IRS contractors have been granted inappropriate access to taxpayers  information  access they don  t need to do their job          And now we have a new regulatory proposal from the IRS to modernize the rules that pertain to privacy   In some cases  that proposal actually makes it easier for taxpayer information to be sold to private vendors   Let me be clear   Taxpayers deserve more privacy  not less   If taxpayers really want salesmen to have access to their tax returns  they can mail it to them themselves   The IRS should not be an accomplice in selling taxpayer information          I recognize that the IRS  s new privacy proposal is complicated   Some aspects of it can be seen to improve privacy while some aspects  certainly  can be seen to degrade it   But for me  the question isn  t whether we should make it slightly harder or easier for an individual taxpayers   information to be sold   For me  the question is whether any of this taxpayer information should be sold to anybody  ever   What consumer wants to have this information available to marketing firms   What consumer really wants to have their dinner interrupted by a telemarketer who s looking at a copy of their private tax return   If those taxpayers are out there  I don  t know any of them   So  I hope the IRS will take a fresh look at these regulations and provide an outright prohibition on this information being shared with anybody          When it comes to the taxpayers getting help from the IRS  the IRS is moving in the wrong direction by trying to cut back on taxpayer services   Worse still  when the IRS tried to minimize the impact of these service cuts  they couldn t even get it right   Last year  Commissioner Everson testified to us of his desire to close almost seventy taxpayer assistance centers across the nation   He told us that these reductions would only be made after his careful analysis of the location  costs  demographics  and workloads of these centers   Many of us in Congress  including the Chairman and myself  had deep seated doubts about the wisdom of the Commissioner  s proposal   As a result  we added language to the Fiscal Year 2006 Appropriations Act that prohibited the Commissioner from closing these centers until the Inspector General completed a study on the impacts of reducing taxpayer services on compliance and assistance   The Act further directed the IRS to consult with and get approval from the Appropriations Committees prior to any such eliminations  consolidations  or reorganizations of the workforce   Well  the Inspector General has now reported that the data the IRS used to close these centers was faulty and outdated   The report makes clear that the IRS was hastily pulling together inaccurate data simply for the purpose of defending its plan to close these centers without any real regard for the needs of the local citizens   The record with this proposal raises the question as to whether this Subcommittee should believe any representation from the IRS when it comes to the availability of adequate taxpayer services          Officially  the President  s Budget for Fiscal Year 2007 does not include formal cuts to taxpayer services  though it is notable that the increase is less than the rate of inflation   However  included in this budget is more than  84 million in so called efficiencies   areas where the IRS intends to make budget cuts next year with consequences that are either unknown or unexplained          Mr  Chairman  I hope we will pursue  today  exactly what efficiencies the Commissioner intends to launch next year  so we don  t find out after the fact that the taxpayers have once again lost access to important forms of assistance in preparing their taxes   Taxpayers should not have their reasonable expectations dashed again                                                          Exchange Between Senator Murray and IRS Commissioner Everson      Unofficial  partial transcript by Murray s office       SENATOR MURRAY  Mr  Everson  I wrote to you March 22nd to express my opposition to the proposed regulations regarding the privacy of taxpayer information   In some respects  the proposed regulations tighten some of those restrictions  but in other ways they really loosen them   I know it  s with taxpayer signoff  but it would allow them to sell it to unaffiliated third parties   My view  personally  is that taxpayers are not likely to want their information going to marketers at all   I would like you to share with this committee why you are providing any opportunity for tax preparers and their affiliates to use personal financial data to sell mortgages  mutual funds  IRA accounts  or life insurance   Don t taxpayers already have innumerable opportunities to shop for services like that without subjecting their personal tax returns to perusal by marketers      EVERSON  I appreciate the question Senator   This is an important question  and I ve testified on it several times already   First thing I d like to say is  we are taking a lot of comments on this  and I ve gotten a lot of letters   We ve actually had hearings on this  which we do with important regulatory proposals   We re going to assess all of those   What we are trying to do here is have a balanced approach   This piece of the law has been in effect for over 30 years  but the world has changed since that time   The regulatory review  as prompted as much as anything  by Congress  in terms of inquiries on the outsourcing  the preparation of tax returns overseas  and in India  where no one was aware of them happening   So  we are trying to move to make better protections here   I guess the better question is whose information is it   Is it the taxpayer s information or is it the government s information   We  at the IRS  as you know  don t share information with anybody  so it  s a question of preparers   I guess we don  t think  that under current law  the IRS can say  you as individuals don t have a right to share information with  for example  Senator  Kit Bond if you want to   The question is  what we re trying to do is provide a really clear protection  so that in the event that that arrangement starts to take place  you have a clear detailed consent  a warning as to what would happen   But we don  t think  that under statue now  we could say  you aren t free to share your information with that preparer       MURRAY  Do you think there is a critical mass of people in this country who want their information sold       EVERSON  No  I don t   What I do think though is this gets to Senator Dorgan s remark   Certain firms  the big firms  they now have integrated services   And they are providing a range of services  like IRAs or advice  to taxpayers   Other smaller firms are the trusted  real financial advisors to somebody once a year   They sit down and get their health checkup  financially  if you will  They say  how are you doing   And they may be able to advise someone to get the IRA on behalf of a bank or whatever else   The other thing  I think I pointed out to your staff  we are very concerned about the possible implication of this to the VITA  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance  sites   Those are programs that  as you are aware  operate around the country   Over 2 million returns were prepared this year   They principally are very exciting to communities  because people come in  they file largely for the EITC  that money goes out into the community  but they  the coalitions that are out there  do other things  they help get the people banked or other benefit programs   You may know  in your own state  the VITA program there processed 2 8  of the returns last year  as opposed to 1 6  nationally   Our people are very concerned that if we move to an outright prohibition of any sharing that you d kill that program   And that all the good things that are happening for those people  where there is a bundling of services  wouldn t be allowed   So  it  s a complicated issue Senator       MURRAY   I am very concerned about this being abused   You know  we know how this works   It is 4 p m  on April 15th  you re signing the last piece of paper the tax preparer s put in front of you   You re signing everything as fast as you can   I ve heard that taxpayers actually want you to loosen this requirement that pertains to the way they get consent from taxpayers to sell their information   Do you think there is any chance in the world that the final rule is going to loosen consent procedures under your proposal       EVERSON  Loosen consent procedures   By that you mean change the consent form that we propose       MURRAY  Yes       EVERSON  I think that clearly the consent procedures are much tighter  but I don  t want to say anything precise   I think that would be wrong under the APA  for me to comment as to what the final rule will look like   I m not involved in that at this stage   But we are  really  honestly  looking at this and it is a tough issue       MURRAY  Well  under your proposed regulations  you require written consent from the taxpayer if the taxpayer wants to process that overseas   You justified that requirement because  as a commissioner  you don  t have any enforcement authority to prosecute abuses overseas   If you don  t have authority to protect taxpayers privacy overseas  why are you allowing this information to go overseas at all       EVERSON  I don t think that we have the authority to stop that   I think that that s something that is done by private parties   There s no law that says that people can t contract out   It  s a far broader question   It is not different from a company hiring a subcontractor to develop parts for an auto or something else       MURRAY  But the law says that you have to enforce privacy       EVERSON  Yes       MURRAY  So you are telling us you can t enforce the law   So why are we allowing these to go overseas       EVERSON  Well  I think we are attempting to strengthen control over the privacy through just this proposal   The other thing I would indicate is we have increased our promoter  or our investigations  if you will  of return preparers dramatically in the last two years   A year ago we had 125 reviews taking place   This year we have over 500 reviews taking place   My understanding is  perhaps this is a question for Mr  George  that the provisions of 7216 are actually largely enforced by TIGTA  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration    So there is a shared responsibility on this       MURRAY   My time is up   Mr  Chairman  I am deeply concerned about this privacy issue   I think that most people assume that their taxpayer information is private and goes to the IRS   I think we need to be very  very careful that is doesn  t become some kind of marketing program
