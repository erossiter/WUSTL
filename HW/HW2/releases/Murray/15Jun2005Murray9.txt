                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray  Clinton Place   Hold    on Nomination of FDA Head                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Murray  Murray  Clinton Place   Hold    on Nomination of FDA Head  06 15 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray  Clinton Place   Hold    on Nomination of FDA Head Senators unsatisfied with lack of answers  continued delays on approval of Plan B for over the counter use    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 15  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Patty Murray  D Wash   and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   members of the Senate Health Education and Labor Committee  HELP   today voted against the nomination of Dr  Lester Crawford to head the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and placed a hold on his nomination  delaying consideration by the full Senate        The Senators   hold will remain in effect until FDA issues a yes or no decision on the over the counter application of Plan B emergency contraceptives          We are asking FDA to explain why they are delaying an over the counter application for Plan B that even their own Advisory Panel overwhelmingly recommended for approval   We are not asking for a specific outcome  but for some final outcome     Senator Murray said     American consumers demand an independent FDA and American women deserve direct access to safe and effective treatments   I fear that the case of Plan B highlights a leadership problem at FDA    a leadership that can be biased or open to undue influence              Our request is simple and straightforward   We want the FDA to make a decision    yes or no  After almost two years of waiting  the American people have the right to an answer     said Senator Clinton    At a time when the FDA needs a strong leader to restore its reputation  I fear that Dr  Crawford  s record demonstrates a lack of vision and drive to ensure that the FDA upholds its gold standard of drug regulation  He has failed to address the concerns raised by his own employees about the needs of the agency  And he cannot provide assurances that the FDA will make science  not ideology or other interests  the cornerstone of its decision making           At a HELP Committee hearing in March  the Senators pressed Crawford to answer questions about a long pending application for nationwide over the counter approval of Plan B contraceptives   The FDA Advisory Committee overwhelmingly recommended over the counter approval in December of 2003  but a decision has still not been made        Unsatisfied with Crawford  s lack of answers  Murray asserted the need for a specific briefing on the status of Plan B prior to a vote on Crawford  s nomination   Crawford briefed Senators Murray  Clinton and Ted Kennedy  D MA  on April 6th  but failed to provide an answer as to when a decision on Plan B could be expected  despite having already missed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act Deadline in January 2005        Two months have passed since the Senators met with Crawford and FDA has still not moved forward with a decision on Plan B          All we are asking for today is that FDA follows procedures set out in law for drug approval   American patients deserve access to safe and effective treatments in a timely manner     Murray said     We are placing a hold on Dr  Crawford because it is time to return credibility to FDA             The law that governs the timing of FDA decisions    the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDFA     demands that the FDA make decisions on applications within ten months of the original application  s submission and within six months of an amended application   In the case of Plan B  the deadline was January 21  2005   It has been almost five months since that date   PDFUA has clearly been violated     Clinton said     I am calling upon the GAO today to expedite their review so that the Senate is able to have the best information at its disposal           A timeline of FDA  s approval process for Plan B follows                                                                                      TIMELINE  FDA Approval Process for Plan B Emergency Contraceptive    July 1999   The FDA approved  on label  use of Plan B as an emergency contraceptive available by prescription       April 2003   The manufacturer submitted an application to the FDA requesting that Plan B be approved for over the counter  OTC  use       8 months pass      December 2003   The FDA Advisory Committee overwhelmingly recommends the OTC approval  24 3      February 2004   The FDA postpones its decision on the Plan B for 90 days      3 months pass     May 2004   FDA rejects the application  stating concerns about the safe use of the drug by women under age 16      July 2004    The manufacturer submits a response to FDA asking for OTC with age restrictions      6 months pass      January 2005   The FDA delays its decision on Plan B again  indicating to the manufacturer that it will complete its review of the application in the near future      2 months pass     March 17  2005   At a HELP Committee hearing on the confirmation of FDA Nominee Lester Crawford  Senators Murray and Clinton pressed Crawford to explain the delays in approving Plan B for over the counter use   Crawford agreed to brief HELP Committee members before his confirmation hearing      April 6  2005   Nominee Crawford meets with Senators Murray  Clinton and Kennedy in Murray s Washington  D C  office      1 month passes     May 12  2005   Senators Murray and Clinton urge Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to launch an investigation into a memo sent by Dr  David Hager to Acting Commissioner Lester Crawford on Plan B      1 month passes     June 15  2005   HELP Committee votes on nomination of Crawford
