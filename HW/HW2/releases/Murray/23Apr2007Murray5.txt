                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Statement of Senator Patty Murray on the Supplemental Conference  04 23 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement of Senator Patty Murray on the Supplemental Conference      For Immediate Release  Monday  April 23  2007    Senator Byrd has asked me to fill in for him today  and I ve been around here long enough to know that when your Chairman asks you to do something  you say yes   I m looking forward to having him back here with us shortly  and I share his passion for making progress on the supplemental         The agreement before us takes the responsible path on some of the most pressing issues of our day   the War in Iraq  the needs our veterans and injured service members  homeland security  and the pressing needs of hard hit communities here at home           On Iraq  the American people want a new direction  and we are providing it   It has been four years since the President sent our troops into Iraq   More than 3 300 Americans have sacrificed their lives in Iraq  and nearly 25 000 have been wounded   Our service members have done everything we ve asked them to do   They deserve better than to be stuck in the middle of a civil war          It s clear that the conflict in Iraq requires a political solution  not a military solution   This agreement provides a new direction that will show the Iraqis that our commitment is not endless   It sets us on a path with the best chance of achieving success in Iraq  and it is the responsible thing to do   An open ended commitment of U S  troops will prevent the Iraqis from reaching the political solution that only they can reach        In addition  we are providing more funding for our troops than even the President himself has sought   This bill includes over  100 billion for the Department of Defense  which is nearly  4 billion more than the President s request for our troops   We provide critical funding for vehicles that will help protect our troops from IEDs and ambushes        With our service members fighting overseas and with their tours being extended  we have an obligation to make sure they don t have to fight for healthcare or benefits when they return home   This agreement meets the needs of our injured service members and our veterans  who have paid the price for the President s failure to plan for the war and its aftermath  It provides  1 8 billion for the VA to provide first class health care to our wounded   The President did not request any of that veterans funding  but we think it s important to meet our commitment to our veterans        As we deal with the situation overseas  we cannot neglect our needs here at home   That s why this agreement provides          6 9 billion to rebuild the Gulf Coast after   Hurricane Katrina         1 8 billion for veterans  healthcare          20 million to repair Walter Reed Hospital         650 million for the SCHIP children s health program to address the shortfall facing children in 14 states        And  2 25 billion to secure the homeland  including   port and border security  transit security  screening for explosives at airports  and screening cargo on passenger aircraft        The White House claims all these investments are somehow unnecessary   I think most Americans would disagree and want us to invest here at home           In recent weeks  we ve heard some false claims about this supplemental that I d like to correct        First  we are moving this bill to the President at a rapid pace   In fact  we re moving even faster than the Republicans did last year        Second  we are doing our job in meeting the needs here at home   Anyone who thinks that domestic needs should be ignored in a war supplemental should look at the past four war supplementals   which were all written by a Republican controlled Congress  and which the House  Senate and President all endorsed   The emergency war supplementals approved by Republican Congresses included funding for domestic needs in 2003  2004  2005 and 2006   As our government spends billions in Iraq  I believe it s our job to also meet the needs here at home        Finally  if the President vetoes this bill  he will have to explain          why he is delaying funding to our troops overseas        why he is blocking funding to care for our injured  troops       why he is ignoring the needs of hard hit communities that are struggling to recover        and why he is standing in the way of the security needs here at home at our ports  airports  and borders        I encourage all Members to approve this conference report  so we can get this bill down to the White House
