Americans from Deadly Asbestos Murray raises concerns after hearing disappointing answers from Bush Administration nominee    For Immediate Release  Friday  February 3  2006    WASHINGTON  D C      This week  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  said she was deeply disturbed that the Bush Administration s choice to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration appeared to have an inadequate understanding of the dangers American workers and consumers face everyday from deadly asbestos          Each year  more than 10 000 Americans die of asbestos related diseases   Since 2001  Murray has been working to protect workers and consumers from asbestos   She has introduced legislation to ban the importation and use of asbestos in consumer products like brake pads  roofing tiles and hairdryers    Murray is concerned that unless the next OSHA chief understands the dangers and is committed to taking action  millions of Americans will continue to die from needless asbestos exposure          On Tuesday  1 31  at a hearing of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Senator Murray questioned Edwin Foulke  Jr   who was nominated by President Bush to run OSHA as an Assistant Secretary of Labor   OSHA is the federal government s principal worker health and safety agency and is charged with protecting millions of Americans workers around the country        Murray expressed concern at the nominee s professional background  Mr  Foulke is a partner at a large national law firm that is known for defending corporate clients against workers  claims   Murray told Foulke she was concerned about  whether you are going to be advocating for workers  as OSHA s new head        Turning to asbestos  Murray asked Mr  Foulke if he believes  OSHA should propose a ban on the use of asbestos in the United States          In his answer  Mr  Foulke said it was his understanding that asbestos was not being used in the United States   Murray corrected the nominee  noting that asbestos is still imported into the U S  in consumer products          Because Senator Murray s time to question the nominee had ended  she sent the nominee a series of follow up questions to better gauge his understanding of    and commitment to    protecting workers from asbestos          Murray said she will review Mr  Foulke s answers and decide whether or not to support his nomination   The next step is for the HELP Committee to hold an executive session to discuss and vote on Mr  Foulke s nomination  A date for that meeting has not been announced         A partial transcript of the exchange follows                                                      EXCERPT OF NOMINATIONS HEARING  Unofficial Transcript     SENATE HEALTH  EDUCATION  LABOR AND PENSIONS    Tuesday  January 31  2006      Senator Murray   This country still allows the use of asbestos in the industry   Do you think that OSHA should propose a ban on the use of asbestos in the United States       Mr  Foulke   Well  Senator  I look at it from an OSHA perspective   We do have our asbestos standard in place  and I think that as long as we are assuring that that standard is being enforced  that employees and workers will not be exposed to asbestos  utilizing that        Senator Murray   So you think it is okay to have it here as long as we are just watching our workers       Mr  Foulke   It is my understanding that asbestos was no longer being utilized in        Senator Murray   Asbestos is being used in this country today       Mr  Foulke   Well  on that issue  if the Congress was going to be promulgating some type of standard or some type of regulation  I would be happy to work with you on that and provide input       Senator Murray   Well  I will submit a number of questions on the record   Asbestos still is imported and used in a number of products in this country  including brakes  and we are trying to deal with the health outcome of that   And it seems to me the first thing we should do is ban the use of it  and I will submit a number of questions to the record on that issue  and several others  Mr  Chairman
