                    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 13  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  helped steer a substantial funding increase to the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  in the annual VA spending bill  The bill  which was unveiled today in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  MilCon VA   sets total VA funding at more than  87 billion for 2008  This bill finally takes the necessary steps to recognize our veterans as a cost of war  said Senator Murray  It invests in improving health care  expanding mental health services  fixing the VA benefits process  and constructing new facilities  It will mean more qualified health care workers  reduced wait times for benefits  better prosthetics  and more accessible veteran s facilities  After years of frustration  we are now honoring the sacrifice of those who sign up to serve with funding that meets their needs   The funding included in the Veterans spending bill is more than  3 6 billion over the President s funding request and represents nearly all of the Independent Budget which is put together by Veterans Service Organizations  The bill is also an increase of nearly  10 billion over the VA spending bill approved last year by the Republican led Senate     As a senior member of both the Appropriations committee that oversees the VA budget and the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee  Senator Murray has established a long record of fighting for the needs of America s veterans  For years I called for increased veterans funding and this administration said they had what they needed  said Senator Murray  Clearly  the constant reports of long benefits waiting lines  inaccessible mental health care  and poor conditions at facilities have painted a different picture  Today  we are taking the first step to right the ship  This bill sets a new standard for supporting our veterans when they return home   Senator Murray has also included language in the 2008 spending bill that instructs the VA to take important steps to bring VA facilities closer to veterans in Washington state  The language pertains to existing and planned VA facilities in Northwest Washington  Wenatchee  and Walla Walla  We have veterans from different wars  in all different corners of our state that need a VA facility close to home that they can count on  said Senator Murray  This legislation takes important steps forward in funding and opening facilities in deserving regions of our state    The language that Senator Murray included for regional VA facilities in the bill is listed below    Northwest Washington Community Based Outpatient Clinic  CBOC     The Committee is aware of the lack of access to VA primary care in Washington state and appreciates the Departments approval of a CBOC in Northwest Washington  The Committee encourages the VA to move forward in opening the CBOC by the VAs target date of February 2008    Wenatchee Community Based Outpatient Clinic  CBOC     The Committee is concerned about repeated delays in the opening of the Wenatchee CBOC and urges the VA to open the clinic as soon as possible   Walla Walla Outpatient Facility   The Committee is aware of the substantial number of veterans served by the Walla Walla  Washington VA Medical Center and is supportive of the VA s decision to approve construction of an outpatient clinic in Walla Walla  Washington as part of the CARES process  In order to complete the construction of this project in a timely manner  the Committee urges the VA to include funding for this project in the fiscal year 2009 budget request   Walla Walla Extended Care Facility   The Committee is aware of the collaborative efforts of the Walla Walla VA Medical Center and the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs to meet the long term care needs of veterans in Southeast Washington and Northern Oregon by building a long term care facility on the Walla Walla VA Medical Center grounds  The Committee supports the creation of a jointly operated veterans home in Walla Walla  Washington  and encourages the VA to promptly review this application and place on the priority list for funding in FY 2008 from the Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities account
