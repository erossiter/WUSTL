                             For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 3  2007     Washington  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  introduced legislation yesterday  10 2  that will help ensure that families of miners are provided with timely and accurate information when their loved ones are involved in a mine accident  The legislation follows high profile accidents in Sago  West Virginia and Crandall Canyon  Utah in which inaccurate and inconsistent information compounded family tragedies  Senator Murray s legislation is closely modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board s  NTSB  highly effective family assistance program used during major aviation accidents in this country to care for victims and their families   of Senator Murray s Mine Disaster Family Assistance Act Senator Murray discussed her legislation yesterday at a hearing of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee exploring the tragedy at Crandall Canyon  Many of the family members of lost miners from Crandall Canyon attended the hearing  Senator Murray s comments follow  Miners work hard on the job every day to provide for the energy demands of our country and the needs of their families at home  As a nation  we owe them more than a debt of gratitudewe owe them our sincere efforts to ensure that each and every miner returns home safely  And we also owe their families  We owe their families a guarantee that they will be treated with respect  dignity  and consistency if they are ever faced with tragedy  As I know many of my colleagues and the witnesses here have done  I have talked with many of the families who ve lost their husbands  fathers  brothers  and sons to mining tragedies  The pain I saw in their eyes is something very few of us have had to endure  And  it s something I ll never forget  As I watched the tragedy play out at Crandall Canyon  I was angered to see that the families of victims were subject to an emotional rollercoaster caused by inaccurate and inconsistent information sharing  I think we can all agree that the families of victims deserve better than receiving life and death information from the nightly news  Tragedies like Sago and Crandall are only compounded when family members are not given the best information first  That s why I will soon be introducing the Mine Disaster Family Assistance Act of 2007 to address this problem  As Chair of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  I am very familiar with the model used by the NTSB to ensure families have the best information in the aftermath of an accident  My bill  which incorporates that model  does three things  First  it establishes a family care and support program director at MSHA who puts the concerns of the accident victims family first  Often times there is confusion about the responsibilities of the party s involved and who is communicating with the family and the public about what is happening during an emergency  This bill defines those responsibilities and delegates a family support services director to ensure family members are getting support services and accurate information from a credible source  The program would work closely with an organization that specializes in disaster assistance  such as the American Red Cross  along with the mine operators  Second  this bill requires all mine operators to develop a disaster family assistance plan that must be approved by MSHA  requiring mine operators to strategically plan for family care before an incident happens  Finally  this bill establishes a task force to provide MSHA with additional recommendations on how to support families during mining disasters  It includes vital partners in the conversation such as the Bureau of Land Management  the American Red Cross  mine operators  including operators of smaller mines  union representatives  and  most importantly  families who have lost loved ones in past mining tragedies  It is critically important that family members who have experienced similar tragedies in the past have a voice in deciding how families in the future are cared for after an incident  and this bill accomplishes that
