                                                                 News Release          Senator Murray Continues Effort to Close Wasteful Student Lender Loophole    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 2  2005     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today engaged in a Senate floor Chair of the full Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  of which Murray is also a member  to address her concerns when the Higher Education Act is considered in House Senate negotiations  Senator Murray wants to permanently close the loophole and end a runaway subsidy that some lenders are abusing today to create new loans subsidized far above prevailing interest rates  These overpriced loans were supposed to have ended more than ten years ago  but they continue today and are growing in volume  Currently  students are enjoying low interest rates on their loans  Murray said during the discussion  That was not always the case  In the 1980s  lenders were promised a rate of return at 9 5 percent on their loans when interest rates were high  but we were trying to keep costs down for students  In 1993  when interest rates were coming down  extra payments to lenders on 9 5 percent loans were supposed to phase out  However  they did not start phasing out and were rapidly increasing until I took action with my colleagues to end this practice     This is Senator Murray s third attempt to close the subsidy loophole  On September 15th   to the Labor HHS Education Appropriations bill  Her amendment failed on a party line vote  Then on September 22nd   and urged her colleagues to act  On September 29th  Murray introduced the S  She also addressed the issue during her discussion of the Higher Education Act when the HELP Committee approved the bill    I tried to close this loophole in the Appropriations Committee  I tried to get the Administration to act  Now  I m offering the Senate another opportunity to close this egregious loophole and finally put an end to this boondoggle  I simply can t understand why anyone supports continuing to ship billions of dollars out the door and out of the hands of our students  but I ll continue this fight for as long as it takes  Senator Murray said     Murray noted that the Department of Education could end the runaway subsidy with the stoke of a pen  If the loophole stays open another six months  it could cost taxpayers  2 8 billion in interest payments     On an average student loan today  with an interest rate of 3 37 percent  the government pays an SAP of  2 percent  On the 9 5 percent loans the government is paying 6 13 percent  According to GAO  two years ago this overpayment cost taxpayers  400 million  Today  it has skyrocketed to  1 billion in overpayments in fiscal year 2004     The Murray legislation is a permanent  comprehensive fix to the abuse of the 9 5 percent rate  It will produce estimated savings of  500 million over years  and Murray has demanded that any savings produced by closing the loophole be given back to America s students     The Higher Education Act passed the committee in September and is attached to the budget reconciliation being considered by the Senate now  The text of the exchange between the Senators follows  SENATOR MURRAY   Mr  President  I rise today to discuss an issue that I have been working on for the past year  ending a runaway subsidy in the student loan program  I would like to ask Unanimous Consent that Senators Durbin and Clinton be added as cosponsors to amendment number 2353  Currently  students are enjoying low interest rates on their loans  That was not always the case  In the 1980s  lenders were promised a rate of return at 9 5 percent on their loans when interest rates were high  but we were trying to keep costs down for students  In 1993  when interest rates were coming down  extra payments to lenders on 9 5 percent loans were supposed to phase out  However  they did not start phasing out and were rapidly increasing until I took action with my colleagues to end this practice  Last year  I along with my colleagues  including Senators Kennedy and Durbin  who support closing this loophole passed the Teacher Taxpayer Act  The Teacher Taxpayer Act took aim at some of the most egregious abuse of this runaway subsidy and returned that money to students pockets  However  while the Teacher Taxpayer Act took great strides forward on this issue  the federal government is still paying out  1 billion a year on the 9 5 percent loans  I believe we are far overdue in ending this practice  I have filed an amendment to fully and permanently end the remaining 9 5 percent subsidy loophole  which according to the Congressional Budget Office will provide a savings of approximately  500 million  I have stated my intent repeatedly to finally close the remaining loophole  The Higher Education Act reauthorization bill moving through the House of Representatives closes this loophole and Education Secretary Spellings have called for the ending this remaining loophole   SENATOR ENZI    Will the Senator yield   SENATOR MURRAY  Certainly   SENATOR ENZI    I thank my colleague from Washington for her work on higher education and for her passion about this issue in particular  She has been very interested in the higher education bill that we approved in committee  and was among those who supported its unanimous approval  My colleague mentioned the Taxpayer Teacher Protection Act  which I support and which the committee acted to make permanent  I would add that the Taxpayer Teacher Protection Act has reduced holdings of these loans by more than  1 2 billion in only six months since its enactment  While various estimates have been given about savings attached to ending recycling  it would also put an end to an estimated  840 million in student benefits provided by non profit lenders over the next 5 years  By some estimates  that could mean a net loss of nearly  550 million in student benefits  Because of the efforts among lenders to provide the most competitive benefits  it is likely that the net loss in student benefits would be much greater  It is also important for me to point out that the Senators amendment does not capture these savings for students  it only ends the practice of recycling  so the net loss in student benefits would likely exceed  1 billion  Mr  President  I would also note that Federal tax law prohibits non profit lenders from retaining these subsidies that the Senator has described  I would ask my colleague if she agrees with my assessment  that Federal tax law prohibits non profit lenders from retaining the 9 5 percent subsidy  and that excess funds must be returned to the Treasury  or be used to provide student benefits   SENATOR MURRAY   I would agree with that assessment  yes   SENATOR ENZI    I thank my colleague for her commitment to continue to work with me on this issue in conference and look forward to reaching a compromise on this issue  I believe it is important that we get this issue right  so we can best serve students  I yield back to the Senator from Washington   SENATOR MURRAY    Thank you  We may not fully agree on this issue but I commend my colleagues efforts to develop a bipartisan Higher Education Act reauthorization and the challenges in moving such a bill through the Senate on a reconciliation bill  I thank my colleague Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue  and I look forward to working with him and the Chairman through conference on this issue  I appreciate the Chairmans commitment to work with me through that process to make sure my voice is heard and interests are met  I think it is critical that  as we work with the House in conference on this issue and others  that we ensure protection and improvement of student benefits  and that any savings generated on this issue be returned to students  We must also work to advance and protect diversity in the lending market  which leads to the competition that provides for improving student benefits in lending  I thank my colleague for his commitment to working with me and look forward to working with him and Senator Kennedy through that process
