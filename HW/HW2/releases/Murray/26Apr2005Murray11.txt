Taxpayer Services    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 26  2005     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray questioned Treasury Secretary John Snow about Bush Administration proposals to privatize Social Security  impose new fees on Washington  s wine industry  and cut back on services that help taxpayers   Murray also questioned Secretary Snow about a series of troubled procurement projects   The discussion took place at a hearing of the Senate  s Transportation  Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee  of which Murray is the highest ranking Democrat   The hearing was called to review the President  s FY 2006 budget proposal for the Department of Treasury       Senator Murray  s opening statement follows     Secretary Snow  I want to welcome you back to this Subcommittee   Since your last appearance  we ve expanded our jurisdiction a bit  but I want you to know that your Department remains a priority for us and an area of deep concern       The President s Social Security Proposal    I know that you ve been traveling around the country trying to drum up support for the President s proposal to privatize Social Security   To me  breaking the promise of Social Security and putting millions of Americans at risk is wrong   I know that you and I aren t going to reach an agreement on that today          But I think we can both agree that this national conversation has shown many Americans just how important Social Security is   Today  more Americans understand how important Social Security s guaranteed benefit is   More Americans know that Social Security helps    not just the retired    but also provides critical income for the disabled  for widows and for surviving children   And I think more Americans appreciate the stability and certainty of their Social Security checks as we ve seen the stock market rise and fall like a roller coaster lately        While I know we ll have a chance to talk about Social Security and issues like the health of our economy and the strength of the dollar  I want to make sure this subcommittee attends to its central responsibility    reviewing the President s budget for your department and reviewing how your department has spent the money Congress has appropriated        So today I want to discuss what s in this budget  including the new initiatives the Secretary wants to launch   I also want to talk about what s not in this budget    the things the Secretary wants to terminate and the user fees the Administration wants to impose on American families and small businesses        I especially want to discuss the Department s continuing problems in managing major procurements  When it comes to addressing the agency s physical and IT infrastructure  it s clear that Treasury needs to do a better job in how it spends the dollars it collects from taxpayers       Boosting Tax Law Enforcement    Let me start with what is in this budget request   The Administration is requesting a boost of more than  446 million for tax law enforcement activities   However  this boost will not signal a new historic high in IRS enforcement activities    far from it   As the IRS Commissioner told this committee recently  the agency s enforcement efforts have been allowed to wane in the last few years   I m encouraged that the agency now wants to reverse that trend   And since the IRS fails to collect between  250    330 billion each year from tax cheats  I would say that this reversal couldn t happen soon enough         Cutting Services to Taxpayers    While the agency is finally addressing something it s allowed to languish for years  the way it s addressing it troubles me   The Administration wants to pay for more enforcement by cutting direct services to taxpayers   The President s budget would cut services that are essential in helping citizens comply with the tax laws   For example  your budget proposal would close as many as one out of every four Taxpayer Assistance Centers across the country  eliminate phone tax filing  which is used by more than five million individuals and businesses each year  shorten the number of phone hours that IRS personnel are available to answer taxpayers  questions  discontinue tax law assistance through the internet  and cut outreach efforts to high risk taxpayer groups    I don t believe that these cuts are merited if they will only heighten confusion and hassle for taxpayers and  perhaps  even make the compliance problem worse         Imposing New Fees on Washington s Wine Industry    Unfortunately  funding for these basic taxpayer service functions is not the only thing missing from this budget   I am very concerned about the Secretary s proposals to eliminate funding for many essential functions in the Alcohol  and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau   Instead of continuing to provide appropriated funding  the Secretary would impose new taxes on industry to pay for these functions        Let me give you one example of great importance to families in my state   Over the past few years  the people in Washington state have built a world renowned wine industry through hard work  research  and creativity   These vineyards are providing jobs for communities that have struggled   They re bringing tourists to many parts of our state  and they are helping our economy        Over the past decade  wine has become a  2 4 billion industry to my state   Production has doubled  and now wine grapes are the state s 4th largest fruit crop   Today there are more than 300 wineries throughout the state    nearly double the number in 2000   And Washington s wine industry supports more than 11 000 related jobs        Many of our wine producers are small  family run vineyards   They should be encouraged and supported for the progress they ve built with their own hands   Instead  this Administration wants to hit them with more taxes in the form of new user fees   Mr  Secretary  I can tell you that your proposal to fund the alcohol tax bureau with  user fees  is going to impose a hardship our small family owned vineyards   Forcing vineyards to pay a fee just to get their labels approved will hurt new entrants into this promising market   We should be encouraging their success instead of putting up more barriers to their viability   This proposal is especially puzzling coming from an Administration that claims to encourage entrepreneurship and reduced tax burdens          Major Procurement Problems    Finally  Mr  Secretary  I want to raise my concerns regarding the Treasury Department s deeply troubled record in handling major procurements  especially IT services   We receive a continuing stream of reports from the GAO and the Inspector General regarding projects that are way behind schedule  that cost more than they should  or that are not adequately secure          The Treasury Department has finally established its new human resource information system   known as  HR Connect    That system cost taxpayers  173 million   A similar system at the Coast Guard cost one seventh that amount   A similar system at the Agriculture Department cost less than one tenth that amount           The Department s renovation activities are also a concern   The initiative to repair and restore the Treasury Building and its Annex has been badly mismanaged   The cost so far will soon top a quarter of a billion dollars   But for all that money work on the Treasury Building is still not complete  and the Treasury annex has not yet been touched           Other examples of Treasury s poor management of major projects abound   Just last week  we read in the paper about an employee tuition assistance program at the IRS   More than 60 percent of the funding has gone to overhead  and less than 40 percent went to actual tuition assistance          Treasury s efforts to procure a new secure communications system was recently slowed down because the agency failed to grant all the bidders access to the relevant information   As a result  the GAO sustained a bid protest          And  speaking of the GAO  that agency informed us that  despite the progress the IRS has made in correcting information security weaknesses  more than half of the deficiencies identified three years ago are still not fixed   It s been three years  and half the improvements still haven t been made   And these aren t minor issues   Some of the vulnerabilities that still exist include the opportunity for any employee at the IRS and elsewhere in Treasury to have easy  unauthorized access to sensitive information including filings under the Bank Secrecy Act           In terms of the largest amount of taxpayer dollars lost  we could hold several days of hearings on the Business Systems Modernization program at the IRS   It might take that long to compare what has been delivered under that program compared to what was originally promised           Mr  Secretary  I recognize that you personally cannot stay on top of each and every one of these programs   But when I look at these persistent management problems at your agency  when I look at taxpayer dollars being wasted  when I look at the rapid turnover and high number of vacancies at your agency  I have to worry whether there is anyone at home minding the store          I know that we both agree that taxpayers deserve better    I hope that as we discuss some of these problems this morning you will be frank with us on how we can help you get some of these troubled programs under control
