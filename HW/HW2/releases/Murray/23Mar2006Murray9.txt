                                                         News Release          Healthcare   Senator Murray Discusses Rural Healthcare Challenges Murray Addresses 19th Annual Northwest Regional Rural Health Conference in Spokane     Urges Leaders to  Put a Human Face  on Federal Health Programs to Protect them from Budget Cuts    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 23  2006     Spokane  WA     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray told several hundred rural healthcare providers that federal support for rural healthcare is under attack in Washington  D C  and that only a strong community defense can protect vulnerable patients and communities         Murray outlined a series of recent cuts to federal health programs starting with the harsh cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that were signed into law last month   Murray said the cuts continue with the President s recent budget proposal  which would eliminate rural safety net programs   The Senator said she worked to restore some of the cuts  but that it will require a loud reaction from local communities to protect investments in healthcare        One of the reasons politicians have been able to get away with all these cuts is because they  ve taken the  human being  out of the discussion   They talk about  reducing the rate of spending  and  reigning in federal programs     But they won  t talk about the people who are hurt when a clinic closes or a doctor isn  t trained   They won  t talk about the human impact    so we have to   Murray said         Friends if we let them get away with using words that leave people behind  then we  re going to get budgets that leave people behind   If we let them make this a debate about numbers    then the numbers win   If we make this a debate about people  then people will win   So our challenge is to put a human face on Medicare  Medicaid and safety net programs to prevent more budget cuts        Murray is a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus and an advocate for rural healthcare  Murray has worked to invest in the Rural Healthcare Safety Net programs and in telemedicine efforts        I wouldn  t let politicians get away with saying that rural areas are somehow separate and different from the rest of the country    We  re all Americans  We all deserve affordable  high quality healthcare no matter where we live   Murray said      Senator Murray s full remarks follow    I  m really excited to be here to support all of you who are working on the frontlines everyday   helping people get healthcare   I know it  s not easy       Today  I want to update you on what  s happening at the federal level on rural healthcare because we have so much at stake   Our government should be a strong partner supporting your work  and frankly I  m very troubled by the way things are moving in Washington  D C         In the Senate  I  m a member of the Rural Health Caucus    a group of senators who are very concerned about rural healthcare  and let me tell you    we have good reason to be concerned   Last week  the Senate passed a budget that I think is based on the wrong priorities   A lot of the programs that your patients rely on are threatened  and we ve got to fight back   Today I want to talk about how we can do that      Healthcare Builds Strong Communities   But first  I want to share some thoughts with you about healthcare in general and rural healthcare in particular   You know  I don  t just look on healthcare as a service   I think it  s much broader  After all  good healthcare builds strong and vibrant communities         But the reverse is also true   When we fail to meet the health needs of our residents  our communities suffer  When seniors can t find a doctor  when a new mother can t get immunizations for her child  and when a person s only chance to see a doctor is in the ER  it tears at the fabric of our community   That affects not only our health but also our economy and our way of life        Many rural communities are already in pain   Agriculture has taken so many hits lately    everything from high fuel and fertilizer prices to problems with foreign markets   It  s not hard to see why so many are struggling   And that puts an added burden on the everyday challenges of providing healthcare in rural areas      It  s Easy to Feel Discouraged   With the tremendous needs in our communities    and the limited resources    it  s easy to feel discouraged   It can feel like the only link between a family    and the healthcare they need    is resting on your shoulders    and often  it is   But if any of you feel discouraged  I think you ll feel better after we give out this year s awards   Because they show that even with all those challenges  local leaders are finding creative ways to get the job done    and that s a great reminder for all of us   I think these awards are proof that some of the most innovative healthcare solutions are not coming from some Cabinet Department in Washington  D C  but from communities large and small right here in the Northwest        Rural Health Challenges   Frankly  one of the biggest challenges is to get the people in Washington  D C  to understand what you  re facing   Maybe they don  t understand the special challenges in our rural communities   For example  rural residents often face higher rates of disease than urban residents   Rates of diabetes  cancer  and infant mortality are all higher in rural areas   And so are the barriers to healthcare   Here in Washington state  for every 100 000 residents  there are 135 specialty doctors in urban areas  but only 78 in rural areas   And rural residents are much more likely to be uninsured or to rely on Medicare or Medicaid   Rural areas tend to have more seniors than urban areas and often have more residents living below the poverty line       Those are all serious challenges   But frankly I wouldn  t let politicians get away with saying that rural areas are somehow separate and different from the rest of the country    We  re all Americans  We all deserve affordable  high quality healthcare no matter where we live       On that count  the federal government has taken several steps in the wrong direction recently   and we  ve got speak up to get back on the right track   To me  it  s a question of priorities      Priorities   When I meet with families all across our state  they tell me that they don t feel secure   They re worried they ll lose their job or their health insurance or their pension   They re worried they won t be able to send their kids to college   They see us spending billions in Iraq but not making investments here at home   I think to be strong here at home  we need to invest here at home       But last week  the Senate took a wrong turn   It passed a budget plan that follows the wrong priorities   I stood up several times and introduced amendments to fix the budget so it better reflects our needs  but my amendments were rejected         So we re left with a budget that cuts community development  cuts housing for the disabled by 50 percent  doesn t help enough seniors with prescription drugs  makes it harder for veterans to see a doctor  cuts education by the largest amount in 26 years  and leaves our children with massive debt         That s just wrong   We can do better  and I m going to continue that fight in Washington  D C   When it comes to rural healthcare  I need your help because the past year has been a real low point for federal support      Recent Cuts   As you know  last month Congress enacted harsh cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in the Budget Reconciliation act   I fought against those cuts time and again    but the White House    and a majority in Congress decided that cutting taxes for the most well off was more important that caring for our most vulnerable   I think everyone who voted for those cuts should be held accountable for their vote       We know that these cuts will have a tremendous impact on rural hospitals  clinics and health care providers   That was a bad start   And the bad news continued with the President  s budget proposal last month        Bush  s Budget Cuts   Simply put  the Administration is trying to weaken the Rural Health Safety Net    We are talking about programs that invest in rural health care  like the Rural Outreach Grants  Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants  Rural Health Research and Policy  National Health Service Corps  the Healthy Community Access Program  Rural EMA  and Title VII Health Professions   Programs that train health professionals in rural health communities are being all but eliminated  That just doesn  t make any sense       Some Progress   Now in the Senate last week  we finally started to see some Members of Congress stand up to these misguided cuts   I joined with other Senators in supporting an amendment that added  7 billion to Labor  HHS and Education   That won  t begin to undo all the damage    but it  s a start   It showed that there is finally some awareness in Congress that we just can  t keep cutting these safety nets and assume no one is getting hurt   And that brings me to an area where I need your help      They Don  t Talk About the Human Impact   One of the reasons politicians have been able to get away with all these cuts is because they  ve taken the   human being    out of the discussion   They talk about   reducing the rate of spending    and   reigning in federal programs       But they won  t talk about the people who are hurt when a clinic closes or a doctor isn  t trained   They won  t talk about the human impact    so we have to      Put a Human Face on the Safety Net   I want to leave you with an assignment   Let  s spend the next few months making sure that when a politician talks about   cutting spending       someone in our community stands up and says      What you really mean is cutting healthcare for children      Or when someone in the Administration talks about   limiting entitlements       let  s have local providers stand up and say    you  re really talking about the healthcare my patients rely on          Friends if we let them get away with using words that leave people behind  then we  re going to get budgets that leave people behind   If we let them make this a debate about numbers    then the numbers win   If we make this a debate about people  then people will win   So our challenge is to put a human face on Medicare  Medicaid and safety net programs to prevent more budget cuts      Progress on Health IT   But we can  t just play defense   We also need to build a better way to reach out to patients and a better way to deliver healthcare    And one of the most promising areas is through technology   I  ve visited the Inland Northwest Health System and have seen the work they  re doing with telemedicine    and I know that  s just one example of things you  re doing throughout the region       I think technology can help reduce the disparities between urban and rural areas   Through telepharmacies we can connect a pharmacist in an urban area to patients in rural areas   But to do that  we need the right federal support         That  s why  as a member of the Senate HELP Committee  I worked to pass a new Health IT bill   It will help more communities use Health IT to reduce errors  improve efficiency and cut costs         But I knew that if we just had a law on the books  rural communities wouldn  t be able to afford the equipment and training to take advantage of the new law   So as I worked on that bill  I made sure that rural health had a role in developing the standards for Health IT   And I made sure we provided funding so small rural clinics  hospitals  and physician practices could pay for the equipment and training they need       So friends  in conclusion  we have made progress in supporting small and rural communities  but there is so much more to do   I know it can seem overwhelming   I know it can feel like there is just too much work ahead   But I also know that if you weren  t doing what you  re doing now patients would not have the access they have today   We need you on the frontlines in our communities    providing the care and being the link    for our friends and neighbors         It  s not just about health   It  s about our economy  our quality of life  and building strong communities  We need you to keep doing the important work you do everyday  but we also need you to step up and speak out when politicians try to take the   people    out of programs designed to help people  I can  t tell you how proud I am of what you manage to accomplish year after year under such difficult circumstances   But I can tell you this    when I  m sitting in a Senate hearing    and they  re trying to cut the rural safety net or when I  m standing on the Senate floor speaking out against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid  I speak with a passion that comes from knowing who I  m fighting for      all of you and the patients you serve
