                                              News Release          Murray Demands Answers on Bush Plan to Bankrupt Amtrak In letter to Mineta  Senator decries policy as   reckless and irresponsible       questions whether a functioning railroad could ever emerge from bankruptcy reorganization    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 16  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   the top Democrat and past Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  today sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta demanding answers regarding the Bush Administration  s plan to push Amtrak into bankruptcy          Citing sections of the President  s Budget calling for   the reorganization of the railroad through bankruptcy procedures     Murray asks Mineta to explain how the needs of over 25 million Amtrak riders nationwide will be protected once the railroad is run by a bankruptcy trustee    a trustee whose statutory responsibility is to the railroad  s creditors            Ceding control of the national railroad to a bankruptcy trustee is both reckless and irresponsible   This plan will put at grave risk the travel options of every Amtrak rider  not just those riding the worst performing lines     Murray writes         Murray  s letter also notes a dramatic change in the Administration  s position on Amtrak    from one of budgeting money for a reformed Amtrak to one of cutting all funding now and into the future             Last year  your budget request sought  900 million for Amtrak for fiscal year 2005 and budgeted  1 4 billion for each year thereafter     the letter states     Your new budget request seeks no funds for direct Amtrak expenses in fiscal year 2006 and no funds in any year thereafter           Murray  s letter raises questions about the future viability of Amtrak under the Administration  s new plan as well as the subjects of daily commuter rails and employee contracts        The full text of Murray  s letter follows                                                         February 16  2005       Mr  Secretary          I write to you in your capacity both as Secretary of Transportation and a Member of the Amtrak Board of Directors   I recently read with interest and concern page 243 of the President s Budget for the coming fiscal year in which the Administration states its intent to put Amtrak into bankruptcy for the purpose of reforming it   Specifically  the President  s Budget states            With no subsidies  Amtrak would quickly enter bankruptcy  which would likely lead to the elimination of inefficient operations and the reorganization of the railroad through bankruptcy procedures   Ultimately  a more rational passenger rail system would emerge  with service on routes where there is real ridership demand and support from local governments such as the Northeast Corridor            The President  s   Major Savings and Reforms    document that was delivered to our Subcommittee just last Friday  echoes these intentions   Speaking of a potential Amtrak bankruptcy  the document states that            such a scenario would likely yield restructuring and efficiencies through the auspices of a bankruptcy court              This dramatic policy change on the part of the Administration is certainly borne out by President Bush  s formal budget request   Last year  your budget request sought  900 million for Amtrak for fiscal year 2005 and budgeted  1 4 billion for each year thereafter   Your new budget request seeks no funds for direct Amtrak expenses in fiscal year 2006 and no funds in any year thereafter            This is an extraordinary and  in my view  dangerous turnaround in the Administration  s position regarding Amtrak   Ceding control of the national railroad to a bankruptcy trustee is both reckless and irresponsible   This plan will put at grave risk the travel options of every Amtrak rider  not just those riding the worst performing lines        We will undoubtedly have the opportunity to pursue it in greater detail during the Subcommittee  s upcoming hearings   But  in the interest of having a fruitful and informative dialogue  I would appreciate it if you would answer several questions regarding the Administration  s new policy at your earliest possible convenience        Do you anticipate that Amtrak will be in a position to continue operating once it enters bankruptcy   Your budget seeks  360 million so that the Surface Transportation Board can direct the continuation of operations of those commuter agencies that require the use of Amtrak property or personnel   However  the 2004 law authorizing these STB payments only allows these dollars to be provided once Amtrak has ceased operations   Is it fair to assume  therefore  that you anticipate a period during which all Amtrak services  including those on the Northeast Corridor  will cease during fiscal year 2006   What planning is your department engaged in with the nation  s governors  state transportation departments  airlines and airports to mitigate the impact of the disruption and congestion that will be triggered by this termination of Amtrak service      As you know  in recent years  a number of airlines have entered bankruptcy while continuing to operate with the benefit of protection from their creditors    However  each of these carriers entered bankruptcy with vast cash reserves so that they could continue to meet payroll and other operating costs while they reorganized   If you do anticipate that Amtrak will be able to follow this model and operate while in bankruptcy  please provide me with an estimate as to how much cash you expect Amtrak to have on hand at the beginning of fiscal year 2006 if we accept the President  s Budget request and provide no subsidies to the railroad for that year   How long do you anticipate that Amtrak will be able to operate before depleting that cash balance     As you know  Amtrak currently carries long term debt totaling more than  3 8 billion requiring annual debt service payments of more than  275 million   More than  1 5 billion of this total is associated with debt attributable to procurements over the Northeast Corridor   What do you anticipate will be the fate of these debts once Amtrak enters bankruptcy   More than  1 3 billion of Amtrak  s total debt is held by the export import banks of the nations of Canada  Germany and Japan   In addition  a considerable amount of the debt is held by financial institutions based in France   Have you alerted these entities  or their parent governments  of the Bush Administration  s intention to put Amtrak into bankruptcy and put the full or partial repayment of these debts under the control of a bankruptcy trustee   Are you at all concerned with the potential impact of a full or partial default of these debts on the ability of other U S  transportation enterprises    especially transit agencies    to gain access to affordable capital      Since your Amtrak reform plan anticipates the creation of a multi state compact of Northeastern States to address the operations and maintenance of the Northeast Corridor  do you anticipate that the Northeastern States will take on the exposure to the  1 5 billion in outstanding debt attributable to the Northeast Corridor   Similarly  your proposal to reform Amtrak would divide the railroad into three separate entities   Please identify with precision which entity would take over which portion of Amtrak  s  3 8 billion long term debt      All of Amtrak  s debt is collateralized with the lenders having the ability to repossess Amtrak  s rolling stock or take possession of other Amtrak assets in the event of default   Under your vision for an Amtrak that is placed into bankruptcy and then reformed  how will the new railroad operate if major rolling or static assets have been repossessed      You will undoubtedly recall the credit instrument that Amtrak entered into with a consortium of lenders in June of 2001   You were required to subordinate that debt early in your tenure as Transportation Secretary   Under the provisions of that instrument  the consortium of lenders led by Credit Lyonnais  their agent  took as collateral the access rights for Amtrak passengers to the platforms at Penn Station    the nation  s busiest rail station   If you are successful in putting Amtrak into bankruptcy  how will you be able to restore Northeast Corridor service at some future point if Amtrak passengers are legally barred by a creditor from the platforms      In addition to Penn Station  New York  Amtrak owns several other major downtown rail stations including Union Station in Chicago  30th Street Station in Philadelphia  Penn Station in Baltimore as well as sizeable stations in Oakland  and Wilmington   Many commuter agencies lease space from Amtrak to operate out of these stations including METRA  SEPTA  the Long Island Railroad  New Jersey Transit and others   Once Amtrak is put into bankruptcy  what confidence do you have that the bankruptcy trustee will decide that it is in the interest of the creditors to maintain these downtown properties as rail stations   Is it not possible  if not likely  that these downtown properties would instead be put up for sale by the trustee as potential commercial property to obtain the highest price for the creditors   What impact might this have on transit service in these cities and what planning has your department engaged in to address the long term continuity of transit service in these facilities      In regard to Amtrak  s employee contracts  what is the Administration  s position regarding the ability of Amtrak to demand reduced pay and benefit levels of its employees once it enters bankruptcy    Is it your view that Amtrak will continue to have exposure to so called C 2 payments to dismissed employees when Amtrak is placed into bankruptcy       Many thanks for your prompt reply to these questions   While I believe the Administration  s chosen plan for Amtrak is reckless and irresponsible  I remain hopeful  that  working together  we might develop a more logical and reasonable process for ensuring rail service as an affordable and available option for the American public        Sincerely            Patty Murray  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on
