                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Timeline of Senator Murray  s Efforts to Pay for Veterans   Health Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Murray  Timeline of Senator Murray  s Efforts to Pay for Veterans   Health Care  06 23 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Timeline of Senator Murray  s Efforts to Pay for Veterans   Health Care Senator repeatedly warned of impending VA   train wreck       For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 23  2005       6 29 05   Update                                                                                 1 14 05           With tens of thousands of servicemembers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  many of whom will return home this year  each of us has a responsibility to ensure that the VA health care system receives full appropriated funding    without reliance on increasing out of   pocket fees to veterans        1 26 05         I will offer an amendment to the President  s supplemental request to fully fund health care services and benefits for soldiers returning from Iraq and   Afghanistan and those who have served us so bravely in the past       No one can predict how long our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will last  But we do know that more soldiers are being called to duty and that today  s soldiers are tomorrow  s veterans  We must all support our troops    both while they are serving and after they return home         2 2 05         I am disappointed that tonight  he made only passing reference to caring for our nation  s veterans  I am very concerned that with tens of thousands of brave men and women serving us heroically overseas    many of whom will return home this year    the President is submitting a budget that will mean longer lines and more out of pocket costs for veterans at our VA hospitals  Supporting our troops also means keeping our commitment to care for them when they return home        2 8 05         The VA health care system simply cannot provide quality care at the President  s requested funding level  The President  s budget means longer lines and more out of pocket costs for veterans in Washington state        2 10 05         If this budget    and its misguided proposals    were enacted  it would devastate VA health care    Payroll and inflation increases for doctors  nurses  and medications cost more than  1 billion  but  the President has proposed to give VA only half of what is needed        2 15 05       Senator Murray   We know that the Independent Budget has called for a three and a half billion dollar increase for FY06  Tell me what you really think  in terms of this budget  Does it meet our needs or is the Independent Budget closer to what we really need      Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson   No  Senator  We spend a lot of time going over this  and of course asking these experts a lot of questions   I have many of the same concerns  and I end up being satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget       2 16 05        The supplemental that is in front of us is to cover the cost of war  and I will tell you  there  s not one dime in it  Now  I have to tell you  I  m a member of the veterans committee  the VA secretary was in front of us yesterday  I asked him these questions  he couldn  t provide me with an answer         When I ask you  you tell me you  re the Secretary of Defense  you can  t answer me  Well  I want to know who I  m supposed to ask       3 10 05   Murray introduces amendment to the Senate Budget Committee Resolution to fully fund the cost of veterans   health care      The responsible thing to do was to include adequate funding for the VA within the budget resolution  Unfortunately  the majority said no  I will continue to work to fully fund veterans   health care through the Supplemental bill on the floor of the Senate   With a new generation of combat veterans deployed around the world  the federal government must meet its obligations to our veterans rather than look away in favor of other priorities        3 10 05     3 15 05         I want every Senator to know that how you vote on this amendment is a test of how committed you are to helping America s veterans  With this vote  we re going to find out    Who s serious about helping our veterans and who s just talking  With this vote  every Senator will have to announce publicly    whether they re making life better for veterans or whether they re making excuses        3 16 05         Today  members of the U S  Senate had a choice  They could choose to keep the promise to our nation  s veterans and make them a priority in this budget  or they could turn their backs  I am disappointed to say that the majority party made the wrong choice     Senator Murray said      4 12 05         I am very concerned that when all of these new veterans come home and need medical care they re going to be pushed into a VA system that doesn t have the medical staff  facilities  or funding to take care of them        There is a train wreck coming in veterans   healthcare  and I m offering an amendment to deal with this emergency now    before it turns into a crisis        4 12 05   Administration  Republicans say Senate funding is unnecessary      Whenever trends indicate the need for refocusing priorities  VA  s leaders ensure prudent use of reserve funding for these purposes   That is just simply part of good management    I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY2005 to continue to provide the timely  quality service that is always our goal    but certainly for the remainder of this year  I do not foresee any challenges that are not solvable within our own management decision capability             Letter from VA Sec  Nicholson to Sen  Kay Bailey Hutchison  used on the floor of the Senate by Republicans to bolster their argument     4 12 05        First Senate Republicans said that funding for veterans   healthcare was not an emergency  Then they said it was not a priority  Our veterans  our military and our future recruits deserve better   We send these brave men and women overseas to fight for us  They should not have to fight for the healthcare they ve earned when they return home      4 28 05         Mr  President  I am extremely disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have chosen to turn their backs on our veterans  By denying the crisis at the VA  they are ignoring our responsibility to fully provide for the men and women who risk their lives for our freedom       Now  the Republicans say that we can take care of the needs of our veterans through the appropriations process  Well  I  m telling you  that with this budget before us today  there will not be enough money to take care of our veterans through appropriations alone  They will be competing with our military bases and other critical needs for precious few funds        5 10 05         I am extremely disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have decided that funding for veterans   healthcare is not an emergency and not a priority  By denying the crisis at the VA  they are ignoring our responsibility to fully provide for the men and women who are risking their lives for our freedom  Our veterans  our military and our future recruits deserve better        6 9 05   Murray questions Nicholson about funding for mental health care      Over the past month I have met with guardsmen and reserves in Washington state who have recently returned from Iraq   Many of them have commented on the need for increased resources for mental health  especially in the area of PTSD   It is vital that we provide the resources to them and the VA to help them easily integrate back into their communities and prevent the development of long term psychological and health damage      As you know  Mr  Secretary  I supported funding for this and other needs as part of my veterans funding amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan   An amendment you opposed   I am concerned that this committee is going to move forward with needed VA programs just to have the administration underfund the VA by billions of dollars limiting the ability for veterans to ever access these programs        6 9 05         Caring for the mental health needs of our veterans is about American values  If we value the strength of our families  the strength of our economy and the promises we have made to our military  then we must pass this amendment and give our veterans the care they deserve         6 23 05        Caring for the veterans who have sacrificed for our freedom is the duty of a grateful nation  These brave men and women made a solemn promise to protect our country        Our reciprocal promise is to take care of them when they return home from their missions  That is why I find today s admission by the VA that they will need an estimated  1 billion more in emergency funding just to get through fiscal year 2005 appalling  but not surprising      6 27 05         Mr  President  we urge you to provide the American people with a full accounting of the cost of these conflicts  including the cost of caring for our veterans upon their return home  during your Tuesday evening address  We ask that you directly share with the nation how your administration will make up the VA s current FY 2005 budget shortfall of  1 billion  as well as the looming shortfall projected for the future  And  we stand ready to work with you to pass an emergency spending bill to address this shortfall before the July 4th Congressional recess        6 28 05         Like all Americans  I am proud of the courage and dedication of our men and women in uniform  I join the President in his praise of the sacrifice they have made to protect our freedom  We all owe our troops a debt of gratitude for their service and heroism       But we owe our troops more than just words and photo ops  We owe them the security of knowing that we will provide them with the care and benefits they both   need and deserve when they return home      6 28 05         It would be wrong of this country to tell those members who served us so well that there are no services for them when they come home  We have a responsibility    not as Republicans or Democrats  but as Americans to be there for them  and the most responsible way to do this is through this emergency supplemental amendment     Murray said      6 29 05         Today  the Senate stands in full support of our soldiers from previous conflicts as well as those who are serving us today  It  s a powerful message and one that I am very proud to be a part of     Murray said
