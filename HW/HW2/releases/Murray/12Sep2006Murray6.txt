                                                                                  News Release          Cargo Security  Senator Murray  s Remarks on Her Amendment to Fund the Port Security Bill    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  September 12  2006    UPDATE  On 9 12 06 the Senate agreed to Senator Murray  s plan to provide dedicated funding for port   cargo security         Mr  President  this morning the Senate is considering a very important bill  It is the Port Security Bill that many members have come to the floor to talk about the importance of         I am proud to be an original sponsor of this bill and have been working on this bill for a number of years  in fact  since five years ago after September 11 when I was the Transportation Appropriations chair at the time  I began to bring stakeholders together to talk about how we can make sure that the cargo containers that are coming into this country are secure  It is a very complex issue and very difficult to do         We have a tremendous balancing act of making sure that the cargo containers are safe when they come into our ports but that we don t halt our economy as we move forward with this         I ve been very proud to work with a number of senators in getting us to this point and am hoping that this bill will move forward in an expeditious manner  Obviously there will be a number of amendments that come before us and look forward to working with other senators on both sides of the aisle to move them forward         But  Mr  President  the bill that is now before the senate has one major hole  The original bill that we ve been working on with all of the committees had a funding source in it for this bill that some members had some concerns about  The original bill that we offered had the funding source as tariff fees  The Finance Committee has objected to that  They were concerned about that  I understand that concern         But because of that objection  the bill that has come before us is an important bill  but it lacks the ability to really put in place a secure system  It is essentially an empty shell without a funding source  That is why I have sent to the desk right now an amendment that we have been working on together with a number of people to make sure that this bill is not just about rhetoric but actually has the funding behind it  If we pass this bill without funding it  we will have not done our job        The amendment that I sent to the desk extends two existing customs user fees for one year to fund this bill  Mr  President  those are fees that are collected today that are going to expire  All we are doing is extending the collection for an additional year  The fees that we are extending are the merchandise processing fee and the passenger conveyance fee  Extending those for just one year will produce close to  2 5 billion in revenue and will importantly provide a dedicated funding stream to pay for the new security initiatives authorized in this bill         By voting for this amendment  this Senate will put money behind the rhetoric of port security  This Senate will put money behind the rhetoric  That is absolutely critical in today s world  Mr  President  I sit on the appropriations committee  I sit on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  If we do not put a dedicated source of funding behind this amendment  we will simply put port security in contention with all the other functions of the Department of Homeland Security  We will be looking at Coast Guard money  FBI money  all of the important functions that we need to have within this bill and port security will just be another issue that doesn t get funded  That is why this funding amendment is so absolutely critical          Now the funding for this amendment is going to be used to hire new customs and border protection officers  We can t just simply require our customs and border officials to do more  They are important positions  and their eyes on containers  their eyes on the tracking  their eyes on the containers as they are loaded and secured is absolutely critical  Without putting in new customs and border patrol inspectors  doing the functions that we re asking for in this bill  we simply will be sending an empty promise to America         The funding also will improve the tracking and data collection of every container coming into our ports  That is essential funding that will make sure that what we put into those containers is sealed  someone is watching to make sure they haven t been tampered with  that no one has gotten into them  and that those containers haven t gone someplace that they re not supposed to  Just putting a tracking seal on isn t going to make sure that we know that a container s not been tampered with  We need the personnel in place to be tracking those  and that s an important funding requirement in this bill   The current bill before us does not have the funding for it   The amendment that I m offering will make sure that we have eyes on those tracking systems         The funding also will establish incentive program for shippers who voluntarily agree to the higher standards  That s the GreenLane section of this bill that is very important to make sure that we know that we can reduce the number of cargo containers coming into our ports that could produce a danger for American citizens and for America s economy         The funding will also establish protocols for the resumption of cargo shipments after a disruptive incident so that we put in place a system that assures that the cargo container  should an incident occur on one of our ports  that we have a resumption strategy in place so we know which cargo  which containers can begin to move off our ports in an expeditious manner  The reason this is so important is if we don t have a protocol in place  it will take weeks  if not months  to get that cargo moving again  That will have a tremendous impact to our economy not just in our port cities  but throughout the nation  as stores don t have any retail goods on their shelves  The economic impacts of that have been outlined in this debate  but it would be devastating we absolutely need to have a protocol in place  and this funding stream will assure it is not just empty rhetoric but a funding source         And finally  the funding is important for authorizing and appropriating money for a grant system for our ports  Critical funding infrastructure for gates  for fencing  for making sure that people are in place to know who s coming on to our ports  Critical infrastructure that we have known is lacking and needs a real funding stream  not just rhetoric saying we re requiring it         Mr  President  I am very pleased to bring this amendment to the senate  And I hope that it is passed overwhelmingly because it is critical we put in place not just an authorizing bill to tell the American people we are putting in place a port security bill but that we actually have the funding so we can accomplish what I think everyone believes is an important bill   So I present this amendment and ask for its consideration
