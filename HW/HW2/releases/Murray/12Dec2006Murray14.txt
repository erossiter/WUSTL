                                                                              News Release          Improving Health Care  Senator Murray Outlines New Opportunities to Improve Healthcare Remarks by Senator Patty Murray at the Washington Health Legislative Conference    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  December 12  2006    I m really excited to be here  and I m really energized   When you combine what you re doing here in the state with the new leadership in Congress we have a real opportunity to improve healthcare       For me personally  that s really exciting   One of my big frustrations over the past two years is that we have not been allowed to have a real debate in the Senate on improving healthcare   All we got was  Health Week        because if there s any problem you can fix in just a few days  it s healthcare       So we ve been denied a chance to have a real debate   I ve also had to fight tooth and nail to prevent drastic cuts in Medicaid and public health   It s been a full time job just stopping bad things from passing  so I m really excited to have a new dynamic in the Senate       So we ve got a new opportunity and a new dynamic  but no one is going to hand us anything   In fact  between what has NOT changed and some new obstacles  we re gonna have to work harder and smarter than ever       So today I want to explain how the change in Congress will change healthcare   And since we re entering some new territory  I want to give you two guides    a viewer s guide of  what you will see from the new Senate in the coming months and an action guide on how we can tailor our approach to make the most of this new environment       Before I do that  I want to thank the other speakers    Greg Vigdor from the Washington Health Foundation and Christina Hulet from the Governor s office   I really want to commend Governor Gregoire for her leadership in creating the Blue Ribbon Panel       I also want to give you a quick update on some of the last minute action in Congress        The  Do Nothing  Congress   We just finished up the final days of the 109th Congress   Overall  it has been a very disappointing session    especially for healthcare   The leadership wasted weeks on political distractions like flag burning and gay marriage  while our communities went without the help they needed         One of the biggest disappointments has been the Senate s failure to do its most basic job    passing the annual bills that fund our government   Those bills cover everything from education to healthcare to transportation   I used my seat on the Appropriations Committee to craft bills that will meet our needs here in Washington   Unfortunately  the Republican leadership made a decision to only allow 3 of those bills to pass the Senate   Instead  they passed a continuing resolution    which means the money I secured for our state will be delayed and possibly denied        The Labor  Health and Human Services Bill  LHHS    That s going to have an impact on all of you and the patients you serve   For example  the Senate never passed a Labor  Health and Human Services funding bill   It includes some critical safety net programs  Community Health Centers  Ryan White programs  prevention programs  and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant   Because Republican leaders refused to pass this bill  these programs will limp along and may face deep cuts        Health IT   I m also disappointed that we were not able to reach an agreement on the Health IT bill   Here in Washington  we ve seen how technology can reduce medical errors  lower costs  and improve outcomes       I worked on the Health IT bill on the HELP Committee  and it passed the Senate   But the House version was different  and we couldn t reach a compromise  The stumbling blocks were over protecting patient privacy and giving smaller and rural communities resources to put new systems in place   We couldn t get it done this year  but I m going to be back at it next session       In the final hours  we were able to make some important fixes      We Fixed the Children s Health Insurance Program for Washington State   I  m really excited that we were able fix the S CHIP program so it helps our state  Washington was one of the first states in the nation to expand coverage for low income kids   I helped pass a  fix  so that our state is not penalized  and it will mean millions of dollars to help us cover vulnerable children      Doctors  Payments     We stopped a scheduled cut in doctors  payments under Medicare   As you know  doctors would have faced a 5 1 percent cut in Medicare payments   We were able to block that cut and also provide a small increase for doctors who track quality         We also extended several expiring rural health provisions to ensure greater equity for rural providers       That s how the last session ended   Now I want to look ahead and talk about what s changed    and what hasn t changed   One of the things that has NOT changed is my commitment to improving affordability  accessibility and innovation         Several things have changed that will give me a larger voice in pushing for those priorities       What Has Changed   We now have a new Democratic majority in the Senate  That means we ll finally get to set the agenda   And I have a new position in the Democratic leadership as Conference Secretary  That gives me a stronger voice and a seat the table to fight for our state      What Has NOT Changed   Other things have not changed   We only have a one vote majority in the Senate   We still have a White House that s on the wrong side of these issues  and they are not going to roll over   We still have a massive deficit and a tight budget   Those will squeeze our ability to make progress   We have unfinished business in the form of the FY 2007 appropriations bills  We ll return to face a supplemental on Iraq  The President will still send us a budget in February that makes painful cuts to healthcare  which we ll have to fight       So what does it all mean   How will a Democratic Senate be different      A New Approach on Healthcare   I think you re going to see a completely different approach to healthcare in the United States Senate   When the Republican controlled Senate worked on healthcare    it tended to ask    What s best for drug companies  insurance companies and HMOs  Instead  Democrats are going to ask    What s best for patients       When we start with that approach    we re going to have a different debate  and we re going to get a different outcome   Let me give you a few examples      The Medicare Prescription Drug Program     When the Republican Senate finally got to work on a prescription drug program for Medicare    they took the wrong approach   They looked at it as    what s good for drug companies         And what did seniors get           They got a confusing  complicated program that is NOT a seamless part of Medicare         Seniors got a program that blocks Medicare from negotiating for the best price         They got a plan that has a huge coverage gap         And poor seniors and the disabled got left behind   Dual eligibles had no transition period  and many vulnerable people got hurt       The White House and Republican Congress created a bill that didn  t put seniors first  and we ve seen the result      Health Insurance Example   We saw that same approach on health insurance   In May the Senate finally focused on the high cost of health insurance   It was real opportunity to help protect patients and make sure that insurance would be more affordable and accessible   But Republicans focused on protecting insurance companies   Their proposals put insurance companies first  and patients last       What happened   We got a bill that would have denied services to nearly 2 million people in our state        That s why I was proud to stand with Governor Gregoire  Mike Kreidler  the Washington State Medical Association  and many others to defeat that bad bill       So for years we ve had a Senate that tended to look at health policy as a way to help industries   Democrats are going to put the focus back where it belongs    on helping patients         Now I m not looking to demonize stakeholders   We don t want to punish anyone   We all know that drug companies work to save lives and treat disease   And we have some great examples of HMOs who get it right    like Group Health    where it s about managing care not just managing costs         I think that if we put patients first it will be good for everyone  and that s what Democrats will do      Specific Priorities   Now let me turn to some of the specific things we ll be working on          Part D   One of the first issues we ll deal with is the Medicare Drug Program   I ve held 18 roundtables in our state where I ve sat down with seniors  doctors  pharmacists and advocates to tackle the problems with Part D    In January  one of the first things Democrats will do is push to allow Medicare to negotiate for the best prices   We re also going to tackle the coverage gap      Stem Cells   Then we re going to turn to Stem Cells   Once again we ll try to make sure that promising science is not blocked because of politics      Mental Health Parity   We re also going to push for mental health parity   Washington state has set a great example here    and I want to thank    Randy Revelle for his great leadership      Fight for Medicaid and Public Health   We re also going to fight to maintain Medicaid and our public health infrastructure      Prevention   And you ll see a new focus on prevention   We need to shift from treating diseases to preventing diseases   And we need to shift the incentives    away from encouraging overuse and toward rewarding efficiency and healthy outcomes       Those are some of the priorities you ll see from the new Democratic Senate       Finally  let me offer a few things you can do help move these healthcare solutions forward   I ve got three to share       3 Ways to Help Us Force Change on Healthcare in Congress      1  Create Models of Success   First  keep building successful models here in the state   In Washington  D C   there is strong resistance to any new healthcare care solution that sounds like a big government  big bureaucracy program   You can help show there is another way         Today the best models and success stories are not coming from Washington  D C   They re coming from places like Washington state and Massachusetts    where people are working together to make progress         As you do that  you re creating models that I can promote at the national level in Washington  D C         I m really proud of the partnerships you ve built     We ve got the Puget Sound Health Alliance bringing people together    and I want to applaud Ron Simms for his leadership  We ve got Pursuing Perfection in Whatcom County and many other partnerships throughout the state  And we ve got the Governor s Blue Ribbon Commission    bringing people together to focus on our challenges       So first  keep building the partnerships and keep creating success stories here that I can push for in Washington  D C      2  Put a Human Face on Medicaid   Second  put a human face on Medicaid  People see it as a government program for the poor  which it is   But it does so much more         It keeps our nursing homes open        It keeps emergency rooms throughout our state open         It trains pediatric specialists         It touches everyone in our state    and we ve go to get the word out       Too often    in the other Washington    they use language that makes it seem like we re just moving around numbers on a page   They talk about cutting Medicaid  by just a few percent  or  slowing its rate of growth          That sounds painless  but it s not   We ve got to show that there are real people behind those numbers       I ve got an assignment for you   In February  the President is going to release his budget proposal   And I expect it will be more of the same cuts he s proposed every year   He s going to make it sound like it s just numbers on a page   We need to show how it affects people s lives         When the Administration talks about  cutting spending  in Medicaid  we all need to stand up and say   What you really mean is cutting healthcare for children         Or when someone in the Administration talks about  limiting entitlements   let  s have local providers stand up and say   Hey  you  re really talking about the healthcare my patients rely on        Friends  if we let them get away with using words that leave people behind  then we  re going to get budgets that leave people behind   If we let them make this a debate about numbers  then the numbers win   If we make this a debate about people  then people will win         So the second thing you can do is put a human face on Medicare  Medicaid and safety net programs to prevent more budget cuts      3  Send Me Examples   Finally  keep in touch with me   Make sure my office knows what you re doing  what s working  and where you need help         As I gear up for some of these budget fights next year  I m going to need local examples that show the impact of budget cuts   I m going to need your help to show how changes in Washington  D C  will affect families here in Washington state   You re on the frontlines  and you can help me tell that story and protect our state      Join My Healthcare List Serve   So that we can keep in touch  I m creating a new healthcare list serve   If you give your business card to my staff  I ll send you updates on what s happening on healthcare and other issues   You can also  on my website  You can check the box for healthcare updates       Conclusion    Friends  in conclusion  I think we have a real opportunity to make progress   I think a lot of the stars are aligning   Just this summer  we saw a great example in Massachusetts   People from both parties  the governor  Senator Kennedy  businesses  consumers and hospitals all came together to make history with a new universal health program         They showed that we can expand access without a big government run  bureaucratic plan   And it started because they had an open and candid discussion that focused on helping patients   That s the type of effort I want to bring to Washington  D C   I m going to need your help to do it  and I m looking forward to being your partner in this new Congress
