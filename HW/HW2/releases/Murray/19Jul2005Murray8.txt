2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray s Statement at Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee Mark Up    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 19  2005    Mr  Chairman  this is the first mark up to be held by our new  expanded Subcommittee   We now have 19 Senators serving on this Subcommittee   Our increased membership is matched only by the expansion in the number of dollars and programs for which we are responsible        There are many good things to say about this bill   I think the best feature is that it rejects many of the punitive and wrong headed cuts proposed in the President  s budget          Whether it is funding to continue rail service in our country  build new runways to alleviate congestion at our airports  construct new housing for our low income seniors and the disabled  invest in community development  or aggressively enforce our drug laws  this bill rejects the President  s painful cuts   Instead  our bill invests the funds to make our world safer and to advance the needs of our infrastructure and our people        Chairman Bond deserves a great deal of credit for ensuring that  even with so many new programs now under our jurisdiction  every program was thoroughly reviewed and considered   I want to thank him for treating me as a full partner in this endeavor   His door has always been open to me   While we don  t see eye to eye on every funding level and every provision in this bill  I think the bill we re considering is truly an effort at bipartisan consensus         I d like to review some of the priorities in this bill  starting with aviation   This bill rejects the Administration  s proposal to slash funding for our nation  s airports    It also preserves funding for the essential air service program so that rural communities across the country will continue to receive air service   I am pleased that the bill attempts to boost hiring of air safety inspectors at the FAA   Last year  this Committee fully funded the President  s request for safety inspectors     What happened   The FAA downsized this office by more than 300 people   With the nation  s airlines in turmoil  and all the airlines seeking to cut costs  now is not the time to cut our safety inspector workforce        For Amtrak  the bill includes  1 4 billion    a sixteen percent increase over the current year  s levels   The DOT Inspector General testified to us that Amtrak would require between  1 4 and  1 5 billion next year if it is to maintain all of its current routes and services   The bill also recommends some reforms for Amtrak in the interest of helping Amtrak cut costs   It would be my preference that Amtrak  s reform provision be considered fully by the Commerce Committee  and I understand that they will be having a mark up of an Amtrak reform bill shortly         Funding for the Judiciary is up 6 6 percent    slightly higher than the level passed by the House of  Representatives    I am confident that this funding level will continue to enable the Judiciary to continue its important work without any threat of staff layoffs         Within the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the President proposed to move the Community Development Block Grant program over to the Department of Commerce and to cut the funding by more than a third   I am pleased to say that we will continue to fund CDBG in this bill  though funding will be reduced about 10 percent   Some of the more damaging cuts in the President  s HUD budget    including cuts to new construction for housing for the disabled and cuts to funding for housing funds for AIDS patients    have been rejected          Within the Executive Office of the President  the White House proposed to cut funding for the drug law enforcement activities of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas by more than 50 percent   Our bill  however  rejects this cut entirely and fully funds the HIDTA program        This bill provides a 3 1 percent pay raise for all Federal employees    an identical adjustment for military and civilian workers    Also  on a matter relating to Federal employees  I am very pleased the Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski were able to reach a compromise on competitive sourcing to provide for a level playing field when it comes to efforts by the federal government to contract out federal jobs          In summary  Mr  Chairman  I thank you and your staff  along with my staff  who have done an excellent job in trying to meet the highest priority needs of all Senators within the tight funding allocation we were given
