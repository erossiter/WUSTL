Making 14 of the Most Controversial Patriot Act Provisions Permanent Without Adequate Safeguards for Civil Rights     Murray Continues Effort to Improve Bill    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 2  2006     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  voted against extending the most controversial portions of the USA Patriot Act and said she would work with other Senators to update the law in a more responsible way   Despite Murray s vote  the bill passed the Senate         Today I voted to ensure that as we protect our country we also protect our civil liberties   I ve said all along that we need to strike the right balance  and this bill still falls far short   Murray said    I take a backseat to no one when it comes to protecting our nation  and I know our security should not come at the expense of the rights and liberties that make our nation strong   We can do better than the bill that came before the Senate today          I support giving law enforcement the tools they need to defend us   They are defending our rights and liberties from people who seek to harm us   It is also my responsibility to protect and preserve the rights that make this country the best country in the world   Senator Murray said         Background    Senator Murray voted for the USA Patriot Act in 2001   She did so at the time with the agreement that the most controversial provisions in that act would be reviewed by Congress in the future   Those temporary provisions were set to expire at the end of 2005   Senator Murray and many of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked to extend those measures to ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs while we protect the basic liberties of all Americans        In July 2005  the Senate crafted a bipartisan compromise that achieved those goals   Senator Murray supported that bill  and it passed the Senate unanimously   The Senate bill took several steps to protect the country while respecting individual rights   For example  instead of allowing the government to collect personal information on anyone  the government would need to convince a judge that a person it wants to investigate is somehow connected to terrorism or espionage   The Senate bill also ensured that if government agents searched a person s property and found no connection to terrorism or espionage  the government would notify the individual within seven days  If the government did find a connection  it could continue to investigate the person in secret under court supervision   Finally  the Senate bill allowed the courts to review the use of National Security Letters and the accompanying gag rule        In the Fall  the Senate bill was then conferenced with the House version   The resulting conference report left out many common sense protections for innocent Americans   In December  that unbalanced conference report came before the Senate  but failed to get the votes needed to receive an up or down vote   On December 16th  Senator Murray voted with a bipartisan majority of Senators that the Senate should not take up the flawed bill and should instead come back and pass a better bill         While Congress and the White House negotiated  Senator Murray supported short term extensions of the original Patriot Act to ensure that law enforcement could continue to use the tools authorized by the Act        In February 2006  a group of Republican Senators and the White House reached an agreement that made small improvements to the bill  but did not adequately address many of the most troubling provisions          Yesterday  Senator Murray voted to improve the conference report when she voted for a bill offered by Senator John Sununu  R NH    The Sununu bill passed and now awaits consideration in the House           Today  the Senate voted on the same conference report that a bipartisan majority rejected in December   Consistent with her vote then  Senator Murray today again said the Senate can do better and pass a bill that reflects the common sense balance of the original Senate legislation   Specifically  the conference report allows the government to obtain and track personal  medical  library and financial information about a person without having to justify to a court why that individual is being targeted   Second  the conference report would permanently extend the use of National Security Letters  which do not require the approval of a judge  grand jury or prosecutors   Third  the conference report does not adequately check the government s ability to use  sneak and peek  searches        The vast majority of the Patriot Act is already permanent law and is unaffected by today s vote
