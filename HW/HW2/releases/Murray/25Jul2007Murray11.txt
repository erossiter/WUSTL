                                        News Release          Murray Commends Passage of Wounded Warriors Bill As President Reviews Dole Shalala Study  Senate Takes Action to Improve Care for Troops and Veterans    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  July 25  2007          Senator Murray s Remarks  WASHINGTON  D C    Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  helped pass landmark legislation to improve care for wounded troops and veterans when they return home from battle  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act passed the Senate today by unanimous consent  Today  the Senate took action to provide real solutions that meet the needs of our troops and veterans from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act finally recognizes our troops as a cost of this war and reverses the trend of administration inaction that has cost them so dearly  From inexcusably long waits for basic care and claims  to squalid living conditions  to daunting mazes of paperwork  our heroes deserve better than what they have received from this administration  Under our new direction in Congress  we have made real and immediate progress in making changes  while the administration continues to lag behind  Today  as the President considers the results of a study he commissioned nearly five months ago to examine the extent of problems  we are acting to fix them  Without hesitation or complaint our men and women in uniform have answered the call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan  They have left loved ones for years  put their careers on hold  and put their lives on the line  We owe them this prompt and comprehensive response to the problems that have plagued their care  The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   Requires the Department of Defense and VA to work together to develop a comprehensive plan to prevent  treat and diagnose TBI and PTSD  Directs the two agencies to develop and implement a joint electronic health record so that critical medical records are not lost as our wounded troops move from battlefield doctors to medical holds and on to the VA  Requires the military to use VA standards for rating disabilities  only allowing deviation from VA standards when it will result in a higher disability rating for the service member  Requires the military to adopt the VA presumption that a disease or injury is service connected when our heroes  who were healthy prior to service   have spent 6 months or more in active duty  The bill also addresses   substandard facilities lack of seamless transition from DOD to the VA inadequacy of severance pay and medical care for caregivers not eligible for TRICARE                                                                                                                    Senator Murray s remarks on the Senate floor today about passage of the Wounded Warrior Bill follow  Mrs  Murray  Mr  President  earlier this morning  the Majority Leader  Senator Reid  asked unanimous consent for the Senate to pass a significant piece of legislation  the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  That was agreed to  and the Senate has now accomplished a major step that I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight this morning  Mr  President  all of us were astounded earlier this year when the Washington Post ran a series of articles about the treatment of our soldiers  our men and women at the Walter Reed facility  They outlined the horrific conditions that some of our soldiers were living in as they received treatment for their wounds from a war far away  After that  we talked to and heard about many soldiers who were in medical hold units  not only at Walter Reed but across the country  who were waiting not a few weeks  not a few months  but months on end and even almost two years to get their disability ratings  so they could be discharged from the military and continue on with their lives  What I Heard at Walter Reed I went up to Walter Reed with our Majority Leader and members of our leadership team to talk to some of the soldiers who were in Medical Hold at Walter Reed  They expressed complete frustration at what they found themselves in  And it was not just the physical part of their living conditions  but it was the fact that they had other wounded soldiers who were their advocates trying to help them work through a disability system that made no sense to them  to their advocate  or to any of us who are listening  They talked about their family members  who were literally left on hold not knowing when they would be able to come home and get a job and be back together with their family again  They talked about long  long lines  They talked about paperwork that had gotten lost  They talked about not knowing that they had Traumatic Brain Injury even a year and a half after they d been wounded and come home  No one had taken the time to ask them if they d been near an explosive device and perhaps had had some kind of brain injury  Yet  they knew that they couldn t find their keys that they set down  They couldn t remember the dates of their kids  birth  They couldn t remember what they d done a few years ago much less today  They knew something was wrong  but no one had taken the time to ask them what they had seen on the ground in Iraq or what they d been involved with that might have caused a brain in injury  What I Heard in Washington State Mr  President  I went home to the state of Washington and talked with some of our soldiers who were in medical hold at one of our facilities in Washington state  I invited anyone who would like to come  I expected maybe a dozen  maybe two dozen men and women to come over and talk to me  Over 200 showed up    angry  frustrated  story after story after story of long delays in getting their disability ratings  in being able to get their lives put back together and not being diagnosed correctly  Well  Mr  President  I m proud that the Senate in just a few short months has stood up and said not on our watch  not anymore  We Passed the Wounded Warriors Act This morning  in passing the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  we are moving forward in an aggressive way to make sure that the men and women who have served our country so honorably are treated well when they come home  We re making sure that those men and women who were asked to fight a war for this country  no matter how we felt about that war personally  went to war  fought for our country  don t have to come home and fight their country again to get the health care that they so deserve  Our Historic Joint Hearings Showed Solutions Mr  President  this Senate acted in an aggressive way  Two of our committees  the Veterans  Affairs Committee  headed by Senator Akaka  and the Armed Services Committee  headed by Senator Levin  in a bipartisan way put together a committee  a joint committee historically for the first time to bring in experts to talk to us about what the needs were and what we needed to do  Making the Pentagon and VA Work Together From those recommendations  which were excellent from that joint hearing    we worked together in a bipartisan way to put together legislation that would require the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to develop a comprehensive policy by January 1 of next year on the care  management  and transition from the military to the V A  or to civilian life  so that our service members don t fall into that trap in that transition between the D o D  and the V A  anymore and feel like they ve come home and been lost  This is critically important  Mr  President  It is an aggressive action that for the first time will require the Department of Defense and the Department of the V A  to work together  Soldiers  men and women too often feel like they re in the service  in the Army  in the Navy  in the Air Force  in the Marines    in the Armed Forces and have a completely different system that doesn t even talk to our V A  that has a totally different disability system  Their paperwork doesn t go back and forth between each  How they re rated as disabled by the Army is completely different than how they re rated by the Veterans  Affairs department  That means that their care is not adequate  It means they re frustrated  It means they re angry  and we say  No more  We re requiring now the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to jointly come back to us with a policy that makes sense for this country s men and women  who have fought for all of us  Providing Enhanced Healthcare In this legislation  we also dealt with enhanced health care for our men and women who have served us  Too often  they find themselves cut off for health care long before they re able to get back and get a job  And we authorized disability ratings of 50  or higher to receive care benefits for three years and also for some of their family members who  once their husband or spouse  wife  has been injured  they lose their own health care  We make sure that we aggressively move forward and don t allow our families to be lost without health care while their service member is being cared for at one of our medical facilities  Screening for TBI and PTSD We also focused dramatically on T B I   Traumatic Brain Injury  and Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  two significant wounds of this war  and we establish new centers of excellence within the Department of Defense for both    one for T B I  and one for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome  We require the Department of Defense to analyze soldiers  so that they don t go home and end up like one young man told me  He d been discharged from the army and for 18 months was at home  no one asked him when he was discharged whether he had been around any kind of I E D  explosion in Iraq  No one asked him how he was doing  For 18 months  he sat at home in a rural community in my state and wondered why he could no longer talk to his friends  He wondered why he couldn t remember what he learned in school a few years ago  He wondered why as a young man of 22 he felt his life had changed dramatically  and he didn t know who he was anymore  and who eventually tried to take his own life  That should not happen to a serviceman or woman who has served us honorably  Mr  President  But what happened to him has happened to many other soldiers who have served us in Iraq  He had been around not one  not five  not 20  but more than 100 explosions while he was on the ground in Iraq  And  as a result of that  had severe Traumatic Brain Injury that was not diagnosed when he left  No one asked him when he was discharged whether he was having any problems  and no one followed up when he got home to see if he was adjusting okay  We say  No more  We make sure the Department of Defense looks at every soldier when they come in and when they leave  ask them what kind of action they ve seen on the ground in Iraq and follows up with them and gives them the care so that they can perform and return back to normal life as quickly as possible  The Senate Acted Quickly Mr  President  this is the least that we can do  It has taken the Senate just a few months to aggressively go after this  to pass a bill out of committee  to bring it here to the United States Senate  And very importantly  we ve brought it here to the full Senate this morning  Hopefully it will move quickly to conference and to the desk of the President of the United States  That is what our soldiers deserve  I m sorry it happened four and a half years after this war started  It should have started before this war  I won t go into the lack of pre planning today  But I will say this  as a senator who did not vote to go to war in Iraq  I have said consistently  no matter how we felt about that war then or how we feel about it today  we have an obligation as leaders in this country to make sure that our men and women who fight for us get the care they deserve  This passage of this bill today is part of that commitment  and I m very proud of the Senate  Dole Shalala Commission To Release Report Today Later this morning  the commission that the President has put in place  the Dole Shalala commission  will also come forward with their recommendations  I m looking forward to see what they have to say  But this Senate is not going to sit around and wait for a report from anybody  We are moving and we re moving aggressively  Mr  President  And I hope that whatever recommendations come out in the Dole Shalala commission report that we see today don t end up on a dusty shelf in the White House as the 9 11 commission recommendations did or as the Iraq Study Commission recommendations did  I hope that the White House works aggressively to make sure that these recommendations from the Congress and from their commission are put into effect  Because whatever laws we pass will only be managed as efficiently and as effectively and work if the White House joins us in partnership in making this happen  Mr  President  I just wanted all of our colleagues here in the Senate to know and for the country to know we are moving aggressively forward to make sure the men and women who serve us are served well as part of this country
