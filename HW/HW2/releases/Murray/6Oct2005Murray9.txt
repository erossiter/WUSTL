Senate to Enact Economic Protections for Domestic Violence Victims Senate Passes VAWA Bill Without Unpaid Leave Protections     Murray   Without our help  economic dependency will trap victims in violent relationships      For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 6  2005          Washington  D C      Today in a Senate floor speech  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged the Senate to address the economic barriers that trap victims in abusive relationships   This week  the Senate reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act   Unfortunately  the bill that passed did not include any economic protections   Last week  Murray introduced companion legislation called the SAFE Act  S 1796   which seeks to knock down the economic barriers that victims face        In her speech  Murray shared some of the stories she heard at a roundtable discussion she held in Everett  Washington on Tuesday  October 4th        More information on    Murray s full remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the Violence Against Women Act  which the Senate this week passed by unanimous consent    For the last few months  we have been talking about reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  or VAWA  as it is better known          Back in 1994  through this historic legislation  we created a national strategy for dealing with domestic violence  establishing a community wide response   Since we took that historical step  VAWA has been a great success in coordinating victims   advocates  social service providers  and law enforcement professionals to meet the immediate challenges of combating domestic violence        So  Mr  President  we can clearly see that VAWA has been tremendously effective   But there is still work to be done to protect victims of domestic violence    particularly when it comes to helping victims break the cycle of violence   And that is what I am here to talk about today    breaking the cycle of violence          Financial insecurity is a major factor in ongoing domestic violence   Too often  victims who are not economically self sufficient are forced to choose between protecting themselves and their children on one hand  and keeping a roof over their head on the other hand          It is critical that we help guarantee the economic security of victims of domestic or sexual violence who cannot pay the rent without their abusive partner  or who have been forced to leave their job because of abuse   Without our help  economic dependency will continue to force these victims to stay in abusive relationships        Mr  President  the purpose of the Violence Against Women Act is to reduce domestic violence   The reauthorization legislation addresses several new issues that will help prevent and reduce domestic violence          One such way    as I already mentioned    is a national health care strategy   But the legislation as introduced contained another important tool to helping reduce domestic violence    it contained provisions that would have allowed victims to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per year to address domestic violence   Over 40 percent of American workers get no paid time off   They can  t use vacation time to address their abuse  and missing work puts them in danger of losing their job   This provision would have allowed these victims  and many others  to take unpaid leave to get a protective order  see a doctor  or make a safety plan to address their abuse          But sadly  amidst opposition and complaints of jurisdictional issues  these provisions were stripped from the bill during consideration in the Judiciary Committee          The legislation that was reported out of Committee    which the Senate just passed by unanimous consent    does not contain any economic protections for victims        Mr  President  I did not give up on these protections easily   After the leave provisions were dropped  I asked the managers of this bill to include another economic security provision  unemployment insurance          Specifically  I asked them to provide victims of domestic violence  dating violence  sexual assault  or stalking with unemployment insurance if they have to leave their job or are fired because of abuse   We know that a job is often the only way for victims to build up resources for themselves to eventually leave a violent relationship  but abuse and stalking can make it impossible for a victim to keep a job   We know of cases where abusers will deliberately sabotage a victim s ability to work  placing harassing phone calls  cutting off their transportation  showing up at the workplace and threatening employees   When a victim loses a job because of violence  that victim should have access to unemployment insurance compensation benefits         Mr  President  are you aware that a woman is eligible for unemployment benefits if she has to leave her job because her husband had to relocate   But in many states  if a woman has to leave her job because she is fleeing a dangerous situation  she cannot receive the same benefits   That is unacceptable  Currently  28 states plus the District of Columbia already provide some type of unemployment insurance assistance for victims of domestic violence   We can offer that same protection to victims in every State  and we have an obligation to do it   But  since this provision is not included in VAWA either  we need to do it here and now        And  Mr  President  it is important to recognize that this violence goes far beyond the home  too often following victims into the workplace  where it doesn t just hurt victims    it hurts their employers  too  In fact  from decreased workplace productivity to increased health insurance cost  the data shows that domestic violence is bad for business   It has real and painful costs on employers  So for those Members who want to weigh this measure against its economic merits  the facts are clear   Providing the tools that will allow abused women to escape abusive relationships can help offset billions of dollars in costs that domestic violence imposes on businesses         As many of my colleagues know  I have been working on the issue of economic security for victims for many years   I have spoken with victims and their advocates  and employers   In fact  just this past Tuesday in my state of Washington  I held a roundtable discussion to meet with stakeholders   I heard from an employer    and owner of a small business in Snohomish County    who talked about the importance of flexible schedules and leave policies that allow employees to address their abuse   He said that helping them address their situations helps his bottom line        I also heard from someone who works at the employment security department  who said that the numbers do not suggest that women are abusing unemployment insurance   And I heard from a survivor  who shared her story and talked about the crucial importance of these economic protections          These are the voices we must hear   And these are the stories we must learn from and let guide our work here in the Senate   I will come to the Senate floor as many times as it takes  and I will tell these stories until my colleagues realize that this is an issue that needs to be addressed   We need to provide these victims with the economic tools to help escape their dangerous situations          Mr  President  for a long time  violence against women was considered a private matter   That attitude hurt women   Today  stopping domestic violence is everyone s business  and that is in large part due to the Violence Against Women Act  which I was proud to work on and help pass   For the first time  the Violence Against Women Act recognized domestic violence as a violent crime and a national public health crisis   Economic protections are the next logical step in the progress we have been making in fighting domestic violence        Unfortunately  many of my colleagues have not realized the critical importance of providing economic protections   I brought up this issue last year when the Senate was considering the Unborn Victims of Violence Act   I tried to amend that bill with my Security and Financial Empowerment  SAFE  Act  which contains all of the economic protections I have discussed here today   I was told then that it wasn  t the right time to address preventing violence against women   My amendment was defeated on a party line vote        Now  I am here again talking about how the Senate is failing to address this issue    and failing to help prevent domestic violence by overlooking these economic protections   I want to reiterate to my colleagues that I will continue to come to the Senate floor and talk about how critical this issue is in helping victims get out of abusive relationships          I will continue to introduce legislation and offer amendments providing economic protections to victims   And I will continue to ask whether the Senators in this Chamber are serious about taking the next  crucial step to help victims of abuse        Mr  President  I urge the conferees on the Violence Against Women Act to send the powerful message to victims that they understand how important these economic protections are by including them in the conference report on VAWA
