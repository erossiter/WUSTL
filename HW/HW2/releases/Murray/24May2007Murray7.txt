for Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that Provides Funding for Troops in Harm s Way  Veterans  Farmers  Katrina Relief  and Port Security Bill provides the funding that troops currently on the ground in Iraq need  while imposing accountability as first step toward redeploying troops    For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 24  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  will vote to provide funding for the resources and equipment needed to protect American troops currently in Iraq and for critical domestic funding for veterans  farmers  Hurricane Katrina relief  and port security  The funding is included in the Fiscal Year 2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation s bill         In 2002  Senator Murray voted against authorizing the Iraq War  Since then  she has repeatedly voted to redeploy American troops from Iraq  Last week she was one of 29 Senate Democrats to vote to redeploy American troops within 120 days as part of an amendment sponsored by Senator Russell Feingold  D   WI          However  Murray has always said that she will support America s service members when they answer the call of duty  In her October 2002 speech opposing military action in Iraq  Murray concluded her remarks by saying   Despite my reservations today  I will always stand with and support those who serve our country wherever and whenever their commander in chief sends them          A BREAKDOWN OF IMPORTANT FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL BILL IS LISTED BELOW    During Senate consideration of the bill today  Senator Murray delivered a speech on the Senate floor that outlined her reasons for supporting the legislation  The text of that speech follows        Remarks of Senator Patty Murray   May  24th  2007    Mr  President  I rise today in support of the Supplemental Appropriations bill we will consider here today          Let me be clear  I strongly disagree with the President on our course in Iraq  As one of only 23 members of the U S  Senate to vote against going to war in Iraq  I am committed to changing the course  redeploying our troops and refocusing our efforts on fighting the global war on terror        I have voted time and again for resolutions and amendments to change direction  I believe the President is wrong to continue on with an open ended commitment to an Iraqi government that has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and take responsibility for their own country        I believe the President is wrong to continue to ignore the warnings of generals  experts and the will of the American people  But I also believe the President is wrong  when in his stubborn refusal to change  he also withholds money for the troops that he has sent into harms way        The President did just that on May 1st  when he vetoed a Congressionally approved supplemental that provided  4 billion more than the President himself had requested for our troops  When the President vetoed that bill  he was the one who denied our troops the resources  equipment and funding they need to do their jobs safely  The President was wrong  but the President still hasn t changed his mind        He   and a majority of Republicans in Congress   are blocking funding for our troops  As we head into Memorial Day  I will vote for this Supplemental because the President has blocked this funding for far too long   And I will vote for this supplemental because Democrats in Congress HAVE changed our course         With this bill we have taken the responsible path forward   in spite of the President   on many of our nation s most pressing issues  This bill   for the first time   funds the needs of our veterans and wounded warriors who have sacrificed for all of us and whose needs the President has refused to acknowledge as a cost of war  This bill makes our homeland more secure by investing critical funds at our ports and borders  And this bill aids the recovery of hard hit communities across the country and in the Gulf Coast  where families have continued to suffer due to neglect from this Administration        In just 5 short months  Democrats have provided a new commitment to the American people and a new direction in Iraq and we will continue on this new path to change       Iraq    From the start of the Iraq war  the Republican Congress allowed President Bush a free hand   They held few oversight hearings   They demanded no accountability   There were no wide ranging investigations into the Administration s endless mistakes  And year after year  they sent the President blank checks in the form of emergency supplementals        Now  five years into the war   after five years without accountability         3 400 of our heroes have died  and over 25 000   have been injured        Our troops are policing the Iraqi civil war        Billions of tax payer dollars are unaccounted for        The reconstruction of Iraq is far from complete        And our veterans are facing awful conditions when they return home       In November  Americans voted for an end to this   They voted for Congress to stand up  to ask difficult questions  and to hold those who make mistakes accountable for them  Democrats heard this call          Immediately after being sworn in  we began holding hearings   We heard from military and foreign affairs experts  and called Administration officials to testify   under oath   We began conducting investigations into pre war intelligence  the waste of tax payer dollars  and the treatment of our veterans  Democrats also began holding vote after vote on Iraq        We forced Republicans to make clear to Americans where they stood on the war   Are they for escalation or redeployment    Are they for allowing Iraqis to continue shirking responsibility  or for forcing them to stand up        In January  President Bush ignored calls from Congress to follow the Iraq Study Group recommendations   Instead he escalated the number of troops in Iraq   Congressional Republicans refused to criticize the escalation  They stood by the President  and attacked anyone who spoke against the surge  But Congressional Democrats stood strong        We upheld our constitutional duties and what Americans put us in office for    conducting oversight and holding the Administration accountable for their actions  This trend continued for months          Eventually  though slowly  some of my Republican colleagues began separating from the President and siding with us and the American people  And after months of this  Democrats overcame Republican opposition and passed a bill with redeployment provisions        We sent this bill  based off advice from the Iraq Study Group and military leaders  and supported by 64 percent of Americans and 65 percent of Independents  to the President  We hoped he would read the bill   We hoped he would realize it was the best way forward in Iraq        He didn t   He vetoed it           But now  finally  after months of blindly following the President  more and more of our colleagues on the other side are beginning to stand up to the President  demanding benchmarks and a timeline for change in Iraq          It is clear that despite a slim majority in the House and only a one vote margin in the Senate  Democratic efforts are working  Today is further evidence of that          The bill we will pass today is not perfect   It doesn t go nearly as far as many of us would like     We   along with the American people   have made it clear what we want   a new direction that forces Iraqis to take control over their country  Unfortunately  the President said he would veto a bill with redeployment provisions  even if he could waive them         So today we have a bill that         Takes a step toward changing course in Iraq        Forces the White House to acknowledge the will of the American people  and the role of Congress          Pressures Iraqis to stand up           And funds our troops        The hard truth is that there are not enough Democrats to override a veto in the House or the Senate          We realized that another veto would not serve our troops well   They need funds  not another White House delay   So we re moving ahead          I ll say again   this bill is not all I hoped for   But this war will not be brought to a close in a day   It will not be brought to a close with one bill   We will support the troops  and bring an end to the war in Iraq   We will continue to debate and force votes on this war week after week after week          Americans will continue to hear where Republicans stand on this war  Mr  President  we face terror threats around the world  and we must    and we will    defeat them  Unfortunately  the Iraqi civil war is not making us more secure         We need to refocus our fight back to the war on terror  and we need to rebuild our military   I support a new direction in Iraq so that we can focus on the larger security challenges our country faces  And the security challenges facing our country are big   But I know we can improve security here at home  That we can track down and eliminate terrorists around the world   And that we can take care of our service members  It s just a matter of getting our priorities straight          Redeploying our troops from Iraq is a critical first step toward getting our priorities straight   It is a step that the Senate must take   Just as passing this bill today is a step we must take         Funding Priorities    This bill  however  is about much more than just Iraq   It s about taking care of the best military in the world  both when they are deployed and when they come home          It s about rebuilding here in America  on the Gulf Coast and on family farms from coast to coast   And it s about providing hard working Americans struggling to care for their families with a desperately needed raise          I m not satisfied with the Iraq language in this bill   I disagree with Senator Warner s language   that s why I voted against it last week   But I m very proud of everything else we ve been able to accomplish         Troops   Vets    Mr  President  taking care of our troops is the most basic responsibility we have in war time   This bill does that          It includes billions more than the President requested to train and equip our fighting men and women         From body armor and secure vehicles  to improved training  this bill provides our troops with everything they need to fight and win        Sadly  in addition to the many failures of this President s overall Iraq policy  we ve seen him fail to take care of our troops when they return home   Our men and women in uniform have answered the President s call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan   Without hesitation or complaint  they have left loved ones for years and put their lives on the line   Some have come home without limbs   Others have returned with mental scars   Many   thankfully   have escaped without injury   But all of them have earned our respect  and the best care possible when they come home        Unfortunately  from the shameful conditions at Walter Reed and at VA facilities around the country  to a lack of PTSD counselors and a benefit claims backlog of months and sometimes years  it is clear the Administration has failed to provide the care our heroes earned        This bill begins to right these failures   Among other things  it provides  1 8 billion for veterans  healthcare and funding to repair Walter Reed Hospital  This is the least we can do for our heroes         Katrina    Mr  President  as we approach the second anniversary of Katrina  Americans throughout the Gulf are still suffering  and communities are still in shambles   This is a shame   It is simply unacceptable        Democrats have worked tirelessly to reverse this neglect   We have pushed and fought for funds to re build states hit by the worst natural disaster in American history          Unfortunately  until recently  Republicans controlled Congress   They ignored our suggestions and oversaw more than a year of neglect  Democrats are committed to ending this neglect  and this bill begins to do just that          It provides  6 4 billion for Katrina victims  including          1 4 billion to repair levees and other critical infrastructure damaged by Katrina       4 43 billion for FEMA disaster relief         25 3 million for drainage projects in the greater New Orleans area         181 million to provide disaster loans to business in communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita      Agriculture    For the past two years our farmers have struggled through drought and other natural disasters  suffering heavy losses to crops and livestock          Time after time  Democrats offered proposals to help these hard hit communities  and time after time  Republicans blocked these measures  Democrats understand how hard our farming communities have been hit          And as voters requested in November  and as we ve promised all along  we are here to work for every day Americans  The supplemental does just that by providing  3 billion for farmers and ranchers  These funds are vital for our country   Farmers and ranchers must be able to provide for their loved ones  and be able to produce the food Americans rely upon to feed their families   These funds will ensure that all Americans    farmers  ranchers  mechanics and teachers alike    will be able to put food on their tables       Port Security Funding     This legislation also takes steps to increase the security of our homeland   Up to  190 million is provided to speed implementation of my SAFE Ports Act  This funding will support cargo screening overseas  the hiring of new Customs officers  the establishment of new security measures across the country  and increased funding for Port Security Grants        Secure Rural Schools     The bill also helps our rural communities  by providing a one year extension of the Secure Rural Schools program   This will keep forest communities from losing funding for schools  roads  and basic services          As a parent and former teacher  I am committed to providing all children with a quality education  regardless of where they live   And this provision does just that        SCHIP    American children  regardless of income  should be able to see a doctor when they are sick   Unfortunately  8 million of them lack healthcare   Even worse  the State Children s Health Insurance Program  which provides funding to states so low income kids can receive medical care  has been shortchanged by the President and Republican Congress  This bill addresses these shortfalls by providing up to  650 million for SCHIP programs in 14 states        Minimum Wage    Today  Americans are working harder  but falling further and further behind   Wages are not keeping up with hours put in on the job  And while the richest prosper  increased tuition  health care and retirement costs are taking a toll on the middle class         This has been common knowledge for years   The data has been out in the open   But the Republican Congress refused to address it  This bill ends the blind eye turned by the Republican Congress   It raises the minimum wage to  7 25 per hour    the first increase in nine years   and provides millions of hard working Americans a real chance to provide for their families  and to get ahead        Conclusion    In total  I believe this is a good bill   It supports our troops and invests in important needs here at home          We will be back here  again and again  to discuss Iraq   To debate the next steps   And to ensure that the President is held accountable          Now  just a few days before Memorial Day  we can honor our troops and our veterans and pass this important bill   I hope that we will
