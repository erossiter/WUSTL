                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Murray  Statement of Senator Patty Murray on Judge John Roberts  09 28 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement of Senator Patty Murray on Judge John Roberts      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 28  2005            WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   announced her vote in favor of Judge John Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States          Senator Murray  s statement follows      Importance      Mr  President  today  I announce my vote on the nomination of Judge John G  Roberts  Jr  to be the 17th Chief Justice of the United States         Mr  President  I do not cast this vote lightly   I recognize how critical the courts are in protecting and advancing the rights of all Americans          I know what s at stake        I m also mindful that John Roberts has been nominated for a lifetime appointment to the highest seat on the highest court in our country          In our system  there is no backstop or review of a Supreme Court justice once he or she is confirmed          That means  under the Constitution  we in the United States Senate have the responsibility to fully evaluate each nominee before voting  and that is exactly what I ve done       Personal Significance    For me  personally  casting a vote on a nominee to the Supreme Court carries special meaning          Thirteen years ago  the nomination of another Supreme Court justice  Clarence Thomas  helped launch my own path from a kitchen table in Shoreline  Washington to this historic desk on the floor of the United States Senate          During the Thomas confirmation  I was deeply frustrated that the questions I believed needed to be answered were never even raised          I was troubled that average Americans    moms and dads    had no voice in a process that would affect their rights and liberties        This time  I had the opportunity to ask those questions directly to the nominee  and I was pleased to work with my Democratic women colleagues to open the process up and empower people across the country to submit questions to the nominee via a website that Senator Barbara Mikulski created        Not only did I have the opportunity to ask those questions directly  but the weight has also been on my shoulders        M  President  for days I have struggled with whether or not this nominee represents the fear I have of the worst motives of this Administration or whether he represents the best hopes of a country for wise decisions that protect our rights and freedoms and responsibilities        No one of us can know for sure         There is no doubt that anyone I would have nominated would have come from a different background with a different history  but that was not my choice          M  President  there is much I do not know about how Judge Roberts will rule  but as history has shown  none of us can predict that        And without a crystal globe  I must make this very difficult decision based on what I do know and upon the criteria I have long used to evaluate nominees for judicial appointments         The Washington State Example    Mr  President  this evening I want to talk about how I ve applied my standards to other nominees for the federal bench          I m especially pleased that in Washington State  we do judicial nominations the right way    through a careful bipartisan process that helps us select qualified candidates without regard to politics        In Washington State  I have worked with different administrations to craft a process that helps us identify and confirm qualified individuals for the federal bench          We solicit input from a wide variety of respected individuals within the Washington state legal community   Then we personally interview each recommended candidate prior to submitting his or her name to the White House for consideration        During the Clinton Administration my colleague  Senator Gorton  and I worked together to recommend and support individuals for appointment to the federal bench          Senator Gorton and I disagreed on a lot of issues  but we did agree  that when it came to our duties in confirming individuals to the third  and co equal branch of our government  we should set aside partisanship  and focus on qualifications        That tradition has continued with my colleague  Senator Cantwell   We got off to a rough start on this approach because the Bush Administration at first did not want to continue the fair process that Senator Gorton and I had established   But  eventually  the wisdom of our process prevailed        While there have been hiccups along the way  we ve used it to confirm qualified people to serve on the bench        Through this fair and deliberative process  I ve supported nominees with a wide variety of backgrounds   I have supported people who have come from privileged backgrounds and those that beat the odds to realize their achievements   I have supported Democrats and Republicans          Each time  though  I was confident that I was supporting an individual who would serve every American who came before them well  and I have not been disappointed       The White House Should Learn from Washington State s Example    Mr  President  my home state of Washington is 2 500 miles away from Washington  D C    and in many ways it is even further than that in terms of our independence of thought          I think the White House would do well to learn from the example we set in Washington state  and I hope the Bush Administration will do a better job of consulting with the Senate on its next nominee and providing a more complete record of that nominee s background and writings       This Is About Evaluating an Individual    Not Registering Frustration    Now  Mr  President  some have suggested that I use my vote to register my disapproval at things the Bush Administration has done or that I use my vote to send a message to the President            And  while I am angry about the mistakes  miscalculations  misrepresentations and misdirected priorities of the Bush Administration  this vote is not the place to vent those frustrations          Fairness requires that I evaluate each nominee on his or her own merits without a pre determined outcome    just as I expect every judge to do when a case comes before them        My vote is based on the same standards I ve used for years    not on anger or on sending messages or ignoring a nominee s actual record       The Process is Broken    This would be an easier decision if we had a complete record   The White House has refused to provide more recent memos from Judge Roberts  work in the Solicitor General s office  which would have provided us with a clearer picture of the nominee          I frankly think the White House  s position is a reflection of a general breakdown in the process we use to select and confirm judges today          With this Administration  consultation with the Senate is cursory  at best  and from the very beginning there has often been a   spoils of war    approach to how they view appointments to the federal bench          I believe that this approach has resulted in unqualified individuals being forwarded by the Administration to the Senate for consideration and I think this approach has contributed to the partisan rancor regarding nominations to the Court        These actions are even more concerning in light of the second vacancy the Bush Administration is set to fill in the coming weeks          I do not believe that an honest  fair evaluation could be completed with any less material and information than we were provided during this confirmation process          I believe that the Bush Administration is attempting to set a dangerous precedent with its words and actions    or lack thereof    and I fear that future Court nominations could be even more contentious as a result         My Criteria    Mr  President  in looking at nominees for a court  I always follow a deliberate process of having a set of standards and comparing individuals who come before us as nominees  to that set of standards        I examine their record  and their experience and their testimony  and see if they meet the basic standards of honesty  ethics  qualifications  and fairness          Then I evaluate if they will be independent  even handed in deciding cases  and if they will uphold our rights and our liberties        Those standards help me ensure that when any American    regardless of background    comes before the Court  he or she receives a fair hearing and that the resulting decision renders justice according to the law      Applying These Standards to Roberts    In reaching a decision on Judge Roberts  I reviewed all of the information that was available  and then examined how Judge Roberts measured up to my criteria for judicial nominees        I followed the Judiciary Committee hearings closely   I read the transcripts   And I ve spoken directly with Judge Roberts twice   once in a meeting in my office and once by phone          Looking at my standards  I found Judge Roberts to be honest  ethical  qualified and fair   I believe he will be even handed in deciding cases   On those criteria  Judge Roberts clearly met my test        Mr  President  it was my last criteria    upholding the rights and liberties of all Americans    where I had a harder time evaluating Judge Roberts          I wish the White House had been more forthcoming in making available more documents that would have shed light on some of his more recent work and opinions          I wish the nominee himself had been more responsive to questions in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee          Through this process  I have concluded that Judge Roberts is a decent person with keen intellect and high ethical standards          I believe he does know the difference between the role of advocacy  which he has held in the past  and the role of judge          I think he has the capacity to be fair  and I think he aims to serve all of the American people          On the question of upholding the hard won rights and liberties of the American people  I believe Judge Roberts has a healthy regard for precedent and intends to apply a thoughtful approach to interpreting the law        This is not to say that I would expect    or even hope    to agree with every decision that he might make or every opinion that a Chief Justice Roberts might author          In making my decision  I recognize that history has shown that no one can accurately anticipate what type of justice a nominee may ultimately become         How Applying these standards Informs my Vote    Mr  President  for many weeks I  ve known some people in Washington state will be disappointed in my decision    regardless of what that decision may be          I  ve heard from friends  colleagues  constituents and strangers on all sides of the question   Many of them have surprised me in their candor and in their position   All of this has led me to struggle with the decision for many days now          I  ve read up on Judge Roberts  listened to the thoughts of others  and talked with the Judge himself   All the while it  s been an extremely close call in my mind  for I know the gravity and consequences of this most important vote          I  ve had deep  lasting concerns          But I have had strong  heartfelt hopes as well          In the end  I  ve returned to the basic criteria I use on any tough question  and to the values that the people of Washington state sent me here to protect          In examining that criteria and those most important values  I  ve made a decision that I hope everyone can understand  and appreciate  and even be proud of          I am satisfied that John Roberts meets my long held criteria  and therefore I will vote to confirm his nomination        Mr  President  I believe Judge Roberts is well qualified to serve   I believe that he is intelligent  honest and fair           Is he wise   Only time can answer that        I cast this vote with the hope that John Roberts will be an individual who will combine common sense and decency with a real respect for how the law affects each American as he serves out his tenure on the Supreme Court          In spending time with him and reviewing the available record  I believe John Roberts has the capacity to be that kind of Justice        Mr  President  throughout our history  America has always had to confront challenges and enjoyed a lively debate in how to meet them   Today is no different          Our great nation is confronting enormous challenges    and the debate over how to address those challenges has caused great divisions in our country          Many people  as I do  fear the direction our country is headed in    they fear for our security  they fear that we are not doing enough at home to secure a stronger future  and they fear that the progress we have made in the last several generations is being eroded by a political agenda   Those fears are well founded  and they are real        But Mr  President  our country was founded on hope    hope that by securing individual liberty a free people could govern themselves in the interest of promoting the common good          Hope  that despite our differences  we could band together to create strong communities and a better future for generations of Americans to come          That spirit of hope is alive today  and should help guide us at least as much as our fears        My vote is a vote for hope          Hope that  despite our differences  we can unite around the common good    hope that equal justice under the law means something powerful to every American  regardless of background or political persuasion          And hope that John Roberts responds to the need of the nation to have a Supreme Court that honors our past and helps secure the rights and liberties    of every American    into the future        When I asked Judge Roberts what kind of judge he wanted to be he said    A justice for all Americans           I hope that my vote along with a diverse group of my Senate colleagues  reminds him every day that he must be a judge for ALL Americans
