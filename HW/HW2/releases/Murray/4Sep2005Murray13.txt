                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Statement on Chief Justice Rehnquist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Murray  Statement on Chief Justice Rehnquist  09 04 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement on Chief Justice Rehnquist    For Immediate Release  Sunday  September 4  2005     Chief Justice Rehnquist served honorably on our nation s highest court for over three decades  His extraordinary career was marked by historic milestones and decisions that will shape the lives of the American people for generations to come       While I often disagreed with his decisions  I admired Chief Justice Rehnquist s dedication to our country  to the seriousness of the job with which he was entrusted and his ability to work with and respect the views of his fellow justices   no matter what their personal leanings       The great range of issues on which the Supreme Court ruled during Justice Rehnquist s tenure   from Roe v  Wade to capital punishment to Miranda rights to the conclusion of a presidential election   informs the American public of just how closely the Court touches our daily lives       Today  our country faces many challenges  While we mourn the passing of Justice Rehnquist  we face the solemn and significant task of not only filling two Court vacancies  but confirming a new Chief Justice       I take seriously the constitutional role of the Senate to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court nominees  and I look forward to the start of that process       In the coming months  as the nomination and confirmation process moves forward  I will work to ensure that the President s nominee to fill this position will be fair and impartial  even handed in administering justice  and will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans
