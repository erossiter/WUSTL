                                                                                       News Release          Mount St  Helens   Senator Murray Speaks on the   25th Anniversary of the May 18  1980 Eruption    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  May 17  2005    Mr  President  I rise to mark the 25th anniversary of the day that Mount St  Helens erupted in my home state              of Washington   Senator Cantwell and I have a resolution on this        For anyone who lived in the Pacific Northwest at the time  May 18  1980 is a day they will never forget   It was a day that changed lives and the landscape of Washington state forever   It imposed a heavy toll in lost lives and lost habitat   Fifty seven people were killed   More than 230 acres of forest were leveled in an instant          The story of Mount St  Helens is a story of destruction   But it is also a story of renewal  a story of science  and a story of the importance of preparation   I rise today to share that story and the lessons it holds for us 25 years later       Before the Blast    Perhaps the best place to start is before the eruption  when Mount St  Helens was a beautiful and striking feature of our landscape   This photo shows what the mountain looked like beforehand   As you can see  it had a nearly perfect dome   It was recognized as one of the most symmetrical mountains in the world   Mount St  Helens was surrounded by lush forests and beautiful streams and rivers   The area was filled with wildlife of all kinds  but danger lurked beneath that tranquil landscape       That Fateful Day    May 18  1980 began as a beautiful  sunny Sunday morning in the Northwest   Below the surface  however  Mount St  Helens was anything but calm   At 8 32am  a 5 1 magnitude earthquake occurred  That earthquake sparked a massive eruption  which would last for nine hours   This photo shows some of what followed          Within minutes  a massive cloud of ash and toxic gas spouted 15 miles into the air   A 300 mile per hour blast shot from the mountain    knocking down stands of evergreens as if they were matchsticks   The entire north face of the mountain gave way into a massive mudslide   The mudslide carried hot water and debris over the surrounding landscape   The eruption released 24 megatons of energy   It destroyed all forms of life within the 18  mile blast zone  including roughly 7 000 bears  elk  and deer        The scope of the devastation was enormous   The hot ash from the eruption combined with melting snow at the mountaintop  creating massive mud flows         Wide Impact    This was not just a local event   More than 500 million tons of ash were blown eastward across the United States   250 miles away in Spokane  Washington  the traveling ash turned day into night   By June  ash could be found on the other side of the world         Honoring Those Who Died    As we mark this 25th anniversary  I want to pay tribute to the 57 men and women who died on that fateful day   Some were there enjoying the area  s beautiful scenery   Some were drawn to the mountain for scientific study   And others were long time residents who refused to give up the only homes they  d ever known         The Aftermath    When the dust settled and the mountain quieted  nearly 150 000 acres of public and private land had been destroyed   This photo shows some of the destruction    This stand of trees was blown down          The mountain s nearly perfect dome was turned into a crater   The Toutle River  which had been vibrant and green  was now a dark  grey expanse   President Jimmy Carter toured the site   He later remarked   Someone said this area looked like a moonscape   But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to what  s up there        Road to Recovery    Everyone knew that wildlife restoration would be a major challenge   Within weeks of the eruption  however  many dedicated foresters and biologists returned to the area to assess the damage and help with the recovery        One of the strongest leaders in the revitalization has been the Weyerhaeuser Company    Weyerhaeuser lost nearly 68 000 acres of forest  making the company the largest private landowner impacted by the eruption   The company was able to replant over 45 500 acres with more than 18 million seedlings   Weyerhaeuser has been committed to restoring the area through sustainable forestry   25 years later  many of the trees planted in the wake of the eruption are now ready for thinning   Final harvesting will begin in another 20 years  paving way for the forest cycle to recommence   The U S  Forest Service made similar efforts   On 14 000 acres of National Forest land  the Forest Service has planted nearly 10 million trees since 1980         The Monument    In August 1982  Congress established the 110 000 acre Mount St  Helens National Volcanic Monument   The monument allows unhindered natural growth and serves as a resource for visitors and academics       Signs of Life    Within weeks of the eruption  signs of life literally sprouted through the layers of destruction   As forests were replanted and vegetation again took root  the wildlife also began to return   Roosevelt elk and Columbia black tailed deer  for example  along with small birds and mammals  reestablished their habitats   Today the area is a testament to the enduring circle of life  as green hills surround the crater  and blue waters flow through the valley once again       A Wealth of Knowledge    As the ecosystem rebuilds  we are constantly reminded of the wealth of knowledge available from the monument itself   Thousands of people have been drawn to the mountain to bear witness to the evidence of this power and to learn from its effects   For many  the eruption sparked a new interest in the earth sciences   It has provided new insight on seismology and volcanology  helping students and scientists to better understand the earth  s natural movement   Representatives of the U S  Geological Survey have teamed with researchers at local and national universities to process the data and to continue monitoring movement beneath the ground   Teachers from across the country have brought hundreds of student groups to the Forest Service s three visitor centers   There  students study the eruption and the reemerging wildlife   What was once a bleak scene of destruction is now a living monument and an educational resource       Need to Improve Monitoring    Although 25 years have passed  there is still much we can learn from the eruption of Mount St  Helens           Just last fall  we were reminded that we haven t heard the last from this mountain   After 18 years of relative quiet  a series of small quakes have occurred in October   And in March  just two months ago  the mountain released a 36 000 foot plume of steam   Today  inside the crater  the lava dome continues to grow   That is a sure sign that there is far more activity to come          The most important lesson we can learn from the eruption is the need to improve our warning and response systems   While we may never be able to fully protect surrounding communities  we can help reduce the risk   For months before the 1980 blast  scientists from the USGS had monitored Mount St  Helens and were able to predict that an eruption was likely in the near future   As a result  most people stayed away from the mountain   We must continue to support the efforts of the scientists and local officials who keep us all safe       High Risk Volcanoes    Unfortunately  according to a   monitoring of high risk volcanoes in the U S  leaves much to be desired   Of the 169 volcanoes  55 qualify as being a  high risk  for eruption   After Kilauea in Hawaii  Mount St  Helens ranks second on the list of high risk peaks   Mount Rainier  also in Washington state  is ranked third  followed by Mount Hood in Oregon and Mount Shasta in California   Millions of people live near these mountains  making their monitoring and study a critical undertaking          I want to personally commend the hundreds of dedicated scientists and local  state and federal officials who are keeping a close eye on these mountains in Washington state   Their work is helping to ensure that the public is better prepared for any future disaster          We can honor those who died 25 years ago by learning from the eruption and improving our ability to predict and respond to natural disasters   While we have been fortunate not to have a major eruption in the U S  since Mount St  Helens  the tsunami tragedy in Asia once again reminded us of the power of events beyond our control   We know there is more to come  so together  let s make sure we are well prepared  and our communities are well protected
