                                                         News Release          Senator Murray Calls for Change in Iraq in National Radio Address    For Immediate Release  Saturday  March 17  2007        Washington  DC     U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  delivered the Democratic Radio Address this week  calling for a new direction in Iraq and looking forward to the continued Democratic effort to hold the President and Congressional Republicans accountable for change  Monday  3 19  is the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq  but while our soldiers have fought bravely the President s failed policies have left them policing an open ended civil war  Senate Republicans have chosen to ignore the will of the American people and endorse President Bush s policies  but Democrats will not stop fighting for change       The text of Senator Murray s radio address  as delivered  is below     Good morning   This is Senator Patty Murray from Washington State        Next week  our country will mark a solemn day   the beginning of the fifth year of the war in Iraq   Five years  3 200 Americans killed  nearly 30 000 wounded  over  400 billion spent     and still no end in sight         In Congress  my fellow Democrats and I believe it is time to bring this war to a close   Our troops   who have served bravely under difficult conditions   have done everything we have asked   As we enter the fifth year  it is time for the Iraqis to step up  secure their own country  and finally take responsibility for their own future        The war raging in the streets of Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq is a civil war   It can t be won by military force alone   It can only be resolved by Iraqis talking to Iraqis  and forging the political settlements that will end the violence        Unfortunately  this is a reality President Bush and a majority of Congressional Republicans still refuse to recognize   They want to stay the course   They want to ignore the lessons of the last four years  They want to commit America to an open ended civil war          I did not support the war in 2002  and I do not support escalating it now   We need a new direction  not more of the same failures        This week  Democrats voted to give our troops the best chance to succeed in Iraq and to defeat Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups   We voted to narrow the mission of U S  forces in Iraq  and to begin the redeployment of our troops within the next four months  We voted for Iraqis to take responsibility for their country   Regrettably  our effort was blocked by Senate Republicans and a President who stubbornly refused to listen        But we will not give up on this debate   Democrats will keep pushing in Congress until there is a change of course in Iraq   American lives  American security  and America s future are all on the line        While we fight for a new direction in Iraq  Democrats are also fighting for the troops who have come home  Too many of our returning troops are bearing the burden of the administration s failure in Iraq    When my father served in World War II with the Greatest Generation  veterans had everything they needed to succeed in life after war   That unfortunately is not the case these days          We ve heard horrific tales of wounded soldiers recovering among mold at Walter Reed  We ve heard of injured troops being sent back into battle before they re healed   Meeting the needs of our brave men and women in uniform should be the first order of business   But for this President  it has been only an afterthought  and our troops are paying the price          We need a comprehensive look at the problem  and we need comprehensive solutions   Our troops and their families deserve immediate attention and access to resources that meet their needs from the battlefield to the VA and everywhere in between        Our injured heroes returning from Iraq deserve access to quality mental care  treatment for post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries  and less bureaucratic red tape         Our veterans of Iraq deserve their benefits in a timely manner  so they can provide for their families and aren t forced into homelessness         And our troops in battle deserve proper armor  and a strategy that will help them complete the mission  so they can come home        This is what Democrats are working to deliver in Congress   As we enter the fifth year of the war in Iraq  we pray Congressional Republicans and President Bush will finally join us        I m Patty Murray   Thank you for listening
