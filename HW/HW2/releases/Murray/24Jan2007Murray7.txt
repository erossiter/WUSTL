                                                                                                                                 For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 24  2007    Washington  D C     A bipartisan coalition of West Coast Senators today announced the introduction of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Reauthorization Act of 2007  legislation that would restore funding for the critical   county payments    law by reauthorizing the successful program for seven years   U S  Senator Ron Wyden  D OR   Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests  introduced a bill with U S  Senators Ted Stevens  R AK   Patty Murray  D WA   Gordon Smith  R OR   Diane Feinstein  D CA   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Jon Tester  D MT          Over 700 counties in 39 states received funding under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000  which was allowed to expire in September 2006   Despite repeated efforts by the Senators to reauthorize the bill last year  the Congress and Administration could not agree on a funding source for the legislation          Without county payments funding  there is a real question as to whether or not these communities can survive     Wyden said    Schools and sheriffs   departments are already looking at lay offs to balance their budgets  and libraries are preparing to close   With the U S  government owning the majority of land in some of these counties  the Federal Government must meet its commitment to these communities                 As a former educator  I am committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to learn  regardless of where they live     Murray said    This bill will provide our rural communities with the revenue they need to ensure those opportunities for our children  and make certain that vital county services continue to operate              The county payment safety net was pulled from underneath rural counties     Smith said     Now these counties are dangling from an economic tightrope   Oregon already lives with devastating federal restrictions on our forests  but we cannot live without public services and without funding for schools   That must not be the rural legacy of this Congress            The County Payments program is a vital lifeline supporting schools  roads  and law enforcement in more than 700 rural counties nationwide   said Cantwell    I am committed to working with my colleagues to do all I can to continue these indispensable public services in Pacific Northwest forest communities   Congress must find the funding necessary to support this bipartisan initiative and keep our rural counties afloat        Boxer said    In California alone  4 535 schools are facing imminent teacher and administrator layoffs   I am pleased to be a part of this bipartisan effort  which will provide vitally needed school funds for California  s rural areas   I urge the Senate leadership to move swiftly on this legislation  our teachers  administrators  and most importantly our students cannot afford to wait another day for this urgently needed education funding           Before the county payments law passed in September 2000  many rural counties were receiving payments as the result of 1908 and 1937 laws specifying that the government share 25 percent of U S  Forest Service  USFS  receipts and 50 percent of Bureau of Land Management  BLM  receipts with counties in any state that hosts Federal land from which timber is cut   These payments had been used to help finance rural schools and roads   Toward the mid  to late nineties  however  the principal source of those revenues  federal timber sales  declined by over 70 percent nationwide   Consequently  the corresponding revenues shared with rural counties throughout the country declined precipitously  hurting school and transportation funding          In 2000  legislation authored by Senator Wyden to provide an alternative source of county funding was enacted into law  establishing a six year payment formula for counties that receive revenue sharing payments for USFS and BLM lands   The formula established a stable source of revenue  a safety net or   full payment amount     to be used for education  roads and county services in rural areas   The legislation also provided funding for ecosystem restoration  infrastructure maintenance and stewardship projects on national forests  fostering all too rare cooperation between counties  timber interests  and environmentalists  The safety net amount was based on historical timber receipts          In 2000  we hailed passage of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act as a victory for rural school children across the country     Wyden said     Today  it is the most important issue facing rural communities in Oregon   We must act now in order to get these counties off the fiscal roller coaster and back to stable funding for schools and public safety
