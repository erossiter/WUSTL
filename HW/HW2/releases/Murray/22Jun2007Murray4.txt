                                                              News Release          Statement by Senator Patty Murray on Senate Passage of the Energy Bill    For Immediate Release  Friday  June 22  2007     Washington  D C    Tonight U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  voted for comprehensive energy legislation  The Senate version of H R 6 passed the Senate and now goes to conference with the House of Representatives  Senator Murrays full statement from the Congressional Record follows    MRS  MURRAY  Mr  President  I rise today to discuss our efforts to address the energy challenges that are facing our nation today and the solutions we need for tomorrow  I am pleased that the Senate last night passed a comprehensive energy bill that moves our nation forward    Impact of High Energy Prices   Mr  President  we all know how important energy is to our economy  our families and our quality of life  The high cost of energy is putting a painful squeeze on every sector of my home state  Commuters notice every time they fill up the tank  businesses are struggling with the higher costs of transportation  industry is feeling the impact of higher energy costs  and farmers feel the pain both in the price of fuel and fertilizer    The question is  What are we doing to do about it  It s clear there are no silver bullets     It s going to take smart policies  carried out consistently over many years  to begin to change the way we use and save energy     Overall  I believe we must focus on several priorities  including   Making America more self reliant so we re less dependent on foreign sources of energy  Using innovation to meet our energy needs in creative ways  Supporting conservation to reduce our energy demands  Investing in education so can cultivate the scientists esearchers  and workers of the new energy future  And protecting consumers from unscrupulous energy manipulators    Washington State Innovation   Before I turn to those specific priorities  I want to share with the Senate some of the innovative things that leaders in Washington state are doing to meet our energy needs  Washington state is moving forward on renewable sources of energy like wind energy    I n April  I had an opportunity to visit the Hopkins Ridge Wind Farm in Columbia County  Washington  This is a Puget Sound Energy facility that has 83 wind turbines  When they re running at peak capacity  they can generate enough energy on an average basis to supply about 50 000 homes    In fact  the Ports of Longview and Vancouver in Southwest Washington have become a gateway for bringing wind energy components into the U S  I ve been able to support their work through the wind energy tax credit  Last year  I got to visit the Port of Longview and see how our longshoremen expertly handle these massive turbines    Washington s agriculture community is stepping up and embracing renewable sources of energy  This Spring  I was in Colfax  Washington for a roundtable discussion with farmers  and energy was a big part of the discussion     I can tell you that Washington state farmers are poised to become active players in the renewable energy market  We talked about ways to help them make the transition into bio fuel crops     And there are other innovative projects  In Gray s Harbor  we re moving forward with a Biodiesel Plant  It will be a new home for Washington state bio fuel production  a new source of jobs for the people of Grays Harbor County  and a new way to combat high gas prices  And in the Tri Cities  we re moving forward with a new research center on biofuels and bioproducts         Smart Appliances   In my home state of Washington  we ve also been testing some cutting edge technology that puts information into the hands of consumers so they can make informed decisions about how  and when  they use energy     With the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and other partners  I helped kick of a GridWise demonstration project to test smart appliances  These appliances give consumers the power to decide when to run them based on the cost of energy  For example  your thermostat could indicate to you when heat costs are at a premium  Or you could set your dryer to run only when energy is a certain price     We all know that the cost of energy fluctuates throughout the day  Unfortunately  todays consumers don t know the real cost of energy at any given time  So it s hard for them to make informed energy choices    These innovative appliances were tested for a year in 150 homes  a water pumping station and a commercial building  The results are impressive  Researchers found that giving consumers these tools helps save energy and reduce demand on the electricity grid  They found that real time pricing can also alleviate the need to build a new substation    So I m really proud of the innovative work thats already underway in Washington state  and both Senator Cantwell and I believe it can serve as a model for the progress we can make in the rest of the country    My Energy Priorities   Mr  President  now I d like to turn to my energy priorities and some of the positive steps that this bill takes         1  Making America Self Reliant   My first priority is to help make America more energy self reliant  Here at home we have tremendous demand for energy and that demand is growing     Unfortunately  today we are still too dependent on foreign sources of energy  particularly oil  That dependence affects our security and our relations with other countries  We need to reduce our dependence  and we can do that through some of the measures in this bill    This bill includes a Renewable Fuels Standard that will increase our use of renewable fuels  including biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biogas     It also includes tighter CAFE standard for our auto industry  and it increases the number of bioresearch centers focused on biofuel  This bill will also help us diversify our fuel sources by promoting alternative fuels  such as ethanol  biogas  and biodiesel     I am disappointed that important tax incentives  which would spur the development of renewable electricity  increase the production of alternative transportation fuels  and help homeowners who make their properties more energy efficient  were blocked in a procedural effort by the minority  I am hopeful that these important investments will be restored as this legislation moves forward        2  Innovation   Second  we need to use innovation to help meet our energy needs  This bill will help move forward our innovation agenda by increasing research and development funding for new technologies     It authorizes funding for research in states with low rates of ethanol production  This investment could help Washington get off the ground in the area of cellulosic ethanol  This bill also boosts research in Carbon capture and storage  We re doing some interesting work on that at PNNL in my home state  and I m pleased to support further research        3  Conservation   Third  we need to be more aggressive about conserving energy  It s everything from choosing compact fluorescent light bulbs and energy efficient appliances to consolidating errands so you make fewer trips in your car     Through this bill  the federal government will lead by example by using energy efficiently and employing conservation practices  It includes  as I mentioned  higher CAFE standards on our vehicles will help conserve gasoline  It will promote efficient lighting technologies  efficient vehicles and advanced batteries        4  Education   Fourth  we need to expand education so we have the scientists  researchers  and workers to help us reach a new generation of energy innovation    The existing and new technologies that we will deploy to increase our self reliance are complicated  and we need to make sure we have a well trained workforce that is able to implement these forward thinking technologies  This entails both continuing education for our current workforce  but also training the workers of tomorrow  We must provide these training programs while our young people are still in our educational system    In my home state of Washington  several universities are addressing these needs by offering curriculum in this area  For example  Gonzaga University in Spokane has a transmission line worker training program     Central Washington University in Ellensburg wants to teach its students how to operate the efficiency technologies of the future  I think we should support these efforts by ensuring funding for programs like these  Im pleased that this legislation calls out this important issue    In Washington state  we re also working to educate the next generation of energy innovators     Washington State University  the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  and the state of Washington have worked together to create the Bioproducts  Sciences  and Engineering Laboratory in Richland     This is a pioneering research center where researchers will develop technology to turn biomass into energy and products  It will have teaching laboratories and classrooms and is located on WSU s Tri Cities campus  I ve been pleased to support this project from its inception  and I will continue to do so         5  Protect consumers from energy manipulators   Finally  we need to protect consumers from those who would manipulate the price of energy to take advantage of high demand  One of the things that the Enron scandal revealed is that some people were happy to create false shortages of energy in order to drive up the price     This bill helps us fight energy manipulators through a price gouging bill that I co sponsored  which is including in the underlying bill    Mr  President  we have a lot of challenges in front of us as individuals and as a country when it comes to energy  But we also have the ability to craft responsible  smart legislation that will help move us in the right direction     I m pleased to be working to make our country more self reliant  to invest in innovation  conservation and education and to help protect consumers     I m honored to come from a state that is producing some of the most innovative energy ideas anywhere  and I m excited about moving this bill forward so we can use that progress to benefit our entire country
