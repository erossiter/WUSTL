                                                                                                                                                                                           For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 8  2007    Today we re examining cross border  long haul trucking with Mexico  and I want to thank all of our witnesses for sharing their insights with us this morning         I m disappointed that one of our scheduled witnesses is not here today   The Transportation Undersecretary of Mexico will not be testifying this morning   The Mexican Government has now decided that his appearance would not be appropriate   That s unfortunate because I believe he could have provided important insights this morning    The government of Mexico has offered to make the Undersecretary available for private meetings with Senators on this topic at some future time        This subcommittee has a long history with this issue  as does the full Senate   When we debated the 2002 Transportation Appropriations Bill  the entire Senate was tied up with this issue for almost half a month          I want to offer some quick background on how we got here  and what I hope we ll learn today   Back in 2001  after a ruling by a NAFTA panel  the Bush Administration announced its plan to implement the cross border trucking provisions of NAFTA and to open our Southern border to Mexican trucks to travel anywhere within the United States          The Bush Administration took this stand despite numerous findings by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   the DOT Inspector General  and others that there were numerous and significant safety risks that needed to be addressed   Those safety risks included  findings that         Insspecting Mexican trucks coming across the border       The DOT did not have an adequate number of safety inspectors  and the inspectors they did have were not adequately trained       There was not adequate property at the southern border to allow DOT inspectors to place Mexican trucks out of service for safety deficiencies       There was no mechanism in place to ensure that Mexican truckers were complying with U S  hours of service laws       There was no way to validate whether the commercial drivers licenses used by Mexican truckers were authentic and up to date        There were not adequate facilities at the Mexican border for the DOT to conduct an adequate number of truck inspections       There were not scales at the Mexican border to determine whether Mexican trucks were adhering to U S  truck weight limits       There was not adequate data available to inspectors to determine whether Mexican trucking companies crossing the border had an acceptable safety record  and       The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was years behind in publishing numerous rules that were absolutely essential if an adequate safety regime was ever going to be enforced                    In the wake of the Bush Administration s announcement  the House of Representatives    which was then under Republican control    voted by a 2 to 1 margin to place an amendment on the Transportation Appropriations bill that prohibited any long haul Mexican trucks from coming across the border   President Bush quickly threatened to veto the bill                    So  in the wake of President Bush s veto threat  Senator Shelby and I drafted a very comprehensive provision to address the many critical safety concerns surrounding Mexican trucks without including an outright prohibition on Mexican trucks entering our country   Our provision included dozens of reasonable safety requirements that the DOT and the Mexican authorities would have to meet before long haul Mexican trucks could have access to our entire interstate highway system   We sought to address each of the many concerns raised by the DOT Inspector General  the Government Accountability Office and others          We were on the Senate Floor for two weeks  During that time  the Senate took four cloture votes and voted on eight separate amendments dealing with the issue of Mexican trucks   In the end  we succeeded in getting the Murray Shelby compromise off the Senate floor because our provision was balanced and addressed the problems head on   Rarely has the Senate debated an aspect of a Senate Transportation Appropriations bill so thoroughly                    Tragically just weeks after our bill got off the Senate floor  the Nation experienced another event that would greatly inform our debate   We experienced the horror of September 11  2001   When we got to conference much later that year  our compromise was included with slight modification as section 350 of the final Transportation Appropriations bill    And from that day forward  the Department of Transportation and the Mexican authorities began working to comply with each of the provisions in Section 350                      Two weeks ago  the Bush Administration announced that  in their view  they had now fulfilled every aspect of Section 350  and they were ready to open the Southern border to long haul cross border trucking   However  they did not announce that they would be opening the border to each and every Mexican commercial vehicle seeking to operate throughout the United States   Instead  they announced a one year pilot project with special restrictions          Under this pilot project  certain safety precautions would be even more stringent than those required under Section 350   Certain commercial vehicles  namely buses and trucks carrying hazardous materials  would not be allowed to participate   As I look at how this pilot project is structured  I m concerned that DOT may be deliberately allowing only the top Mexican truck companies to participate in a pilot project simply to skew the results so the outcome looks better        If you re only looking at the  best of the best   you might not get an accurate picture of what full cross border trucking will look like   That makes me wonder if this pilot project is really designed just to produce a pre ordained conclusion   It also excludes some categories of motor carriers like buses and trucks carrying hazardous materials  We need to hear exactly how DOT eventually plans to ensure the safety of these cross border vehicles as well         A meaningful discussion of safety and security cannot begin and end with Section 350    That legislation was written more than five years ago   In our new post 911 world  we have learned a lot more about terrorist treats and how to prevent them   We have also learned a lot more about illegal immigration and the methods used to smuggle citizens into the U S   For example  in May of 2003 70 illegal immigrants were stuffed inside a tractor trailer and were being transported to Houston   19 of the 80 people suffocated   Less than three weeks ago  40 people were discovered in the back of a tractor trailer in Texas   Thankfully  they were all alive                    This morning s hearing will also focus on the economics of cross border trucking   We need to explore why U S  trucking firms are facing delays in accessing Mexico   We are told that Mexican firms will have full access to the U S  market in just a few weeks  but that U S  firms will have to wait until half of the year long pilot project is over before they can enter Mexico   That doesn t sound like equal access to me        Perhaps the most important question we need to address this   What happens after the Administration s proposed one year pilot project   Should we assume that after one year the border will be opened to all long haul Mexican trucks   Is one year an adequate period of time to determine whether there has or has not been unacceptable safety risks          The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is not famous for doing anything quickly    Is that the agency that will be evaluating the success of this pilot program   If so  what criteria will they be using   There is certainly reason to question whether this agency can adequately evaluate a one year pilot project when you consider the fact that certain requirements of Section 350 do not kick in until 18 months after the first truck crosses the border          In the course of learning more about the Administration s pilot project  I received a copy of the official Record of Discussion that was initialed by both Mexican and U S  authorities   It spells out broad parameters of the anticipated pilot project   And there s one very revealing section  which makes it crystal clear that the new agreement anticipates that  after one full year cross border trucking without any restrictions will commence   If the purpose of the pilot project is to determine if we can do this safely  why is the result already agreed to by both governments   Again  it leaves me to wonder if the demonstration project is more  show  than scrutiny        While some witnesses today might like to keep us focused just on the Administration s so called one year pilot project  this subcommittee needs to get the full picture of what happens one year from now when the border is fully opened   I will be asking some detailed questions about this document and what the Administration intends to do after the pilot project is completed  and I expect to hear complete answers                    I  like many of my colleagues in the Senate  voted for NAFTA   I believe in the economic benefits that expanded trade can provide to our country   I see those benefits first hand every day in my home state of Washington   I know how trade supports and creates jobs  but I also know that safety must never take a back seat to economic prosperity   When we first debated this issue in the Senate back in 2001  I argued that we could have both safety and economic growth   Today s hearing will hopefully reveal whether the Bush Administration and Mexican officials have done what they need to do to make that possible
