                                                    News Release          Murray Stands Up for Veterans and for Dedicated VA Employees Murray Calls Attempt to Outsource Heroic VA Employees a  Slap in the Face   Says Veterans Healthcare Dollars Should Not Be Wasted on Privatization Study  Murray Also Says Senate Should Do More for Veterans Impacted By Hurricane Katrina    For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 15  2005        Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  used her position on the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee to fight for veterans who need healthcare  for veterans impacted by Hurricane Katrina  and for dedicated VA employees who provide first rate service to America s veterans          Murray stood her ground and voted against a bill that would waste millions of VA healthcare dollars on a privatization study        Today  the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee met to mark up two veterans  healthcare proposals   Murray supported one proposal  S 716  because it will expand and improve Vet Centers  which provide convenient and confidential readjustment counseling to returning veterans         But Murray voted against the second proposal  S 1182  because it would waste scarce healthcare dollars on a study to explore outsourcing dedicated VA employees   It also failed to provide adequate support for veterans who have been affected by Hurricane Katrina      Katrina Veterans Deserve More Help    Throughout today s hearing  Murray worked to make the bill more helpful to veterans who were impacted by Hurricane Katrina   She supported an amendment by Ranking Member Daniel Akaka  D HI  that would help middle income veterans who reside in regions affected by Hurricane Katrina   Unfortunately  that amendment was weakened during the markup so that it only provides affected veterans with a token level of assistance        Murray will continue to advocate for displaced veterans   She is also a cosponsor of a bill  S 1646  that mirrors the Akaka amendment   It would eliminate co payments for some Priority 8 veterans  middle income  low priority veterans  who were already in the VA system and who were impacted by Hurricane Katrina       Murray Supports VA Employees  Opposes Privatization Study    In today s markup  Murray also worked to block a wasteful study to explore outsourcing the jobs of dedicated VA employees        Murray noted that VA employees have been praised for their outstanding work protecting and caring for veterans who were impacted by Hurricane Katrina   A recent report by VA Secretary Jim Nicholson called the efforts of VA employees  heroic          Now  three weeks after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast    and a week after Secretary Nicholson spoke so highly of the sacrifices of our VA employees    this Committee stands ready to slap those employees in the face   Instead of saying thank you for their dedication to the mission  we are moving forward with privatizing those employees   Murray told the Committee    I don  t think there is a Senator in this room who believes that contracted employees are as dedicated to the core mission as VA employees or would have been as dedicated to saving those lives in Louisiana and Mississippi         Murray noted that based on similar privatization studies  the VA study could cost  300 million   Murray said it is wrong to waste scarce healthcare dollars on a study         Recent damage caused by Hurricane Katrina to VA facilities  combined with severe budget shortfalls on top of rising health care costs  make it more and more difficult for the VA to provide veterans with access to medical care   Moving forward with this very expensive study instead of providing care to veterans is wrong   Murray said       Murray has been fighting the privatization plan since it first emerged   In July 2005  she sent a letter with three other committee members to Committee Chairman Larry Craig  R ID   calling for the controversial study to be removed        In today s hearing  Murray worked with Senator Akaka to remove the study from the bill   That effort failed   When the bill  including the study  was brought up for a vote  Murray voted against it   Despite Murray s opposition  the bill passed out of the Veterans Affairs Committee and will next head to Senate floor for debate   A date has not yet been scheduled
