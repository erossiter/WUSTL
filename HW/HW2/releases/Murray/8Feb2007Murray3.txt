Transportation   Safety Progress at First Hearing with Transportation Secretary Mary Peters At hearing on the President s FY 2008 Budget Request  Murray Outlines Need to Pass Joint Funding Resolution and Address Rising Highway Fatalities    For Immediate Release  Thursday  February 8  2007             Washington  D C     Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  chaired the session s first      Senator Murray Greets Secretary Peters hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development   Related Agencies   The witness was U S  Transportation Secretary Mary Peters  who testified on the President s FY 2008 budget proposal for the Department of Transportation       Senator Murray s opening statement follows     Today  the Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies holds its first hearing of the year   Before we begin  I want to welcome four new members to the Subcommittee  Senators Alexander  Feinstein  Johnson and Lautenberg   I also want to give a warm welcome to our principal witness today  Transportation Secretary Mary Peters        The Joint Funding Resolution   Today s hearing comes at a very important time   While the official purpose of this hearing is to review the President s Transportation budget for 2008  the reality is that the Congress has not yet enacted a transportation budget for 2007          Currently pending in the Senate is H J  Res  20  the Joint Funding Resolution   That bill was developed by the both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees on a bipartisan basis   Its goal is to finalize the funding levels for the Department of Transportation and most other departments for the remainder of this year   It was made necessary by the fact that the last Congress never completed the appropriations process before adjourning          The Joint Funding Resolution  for the most part  freezes programs across the government at their 2006 funding level   Importantly  however  the bill also makes necessary funding adjustments to deal with critical programs that cannot and should not endure a funding freeze          In the case of the Transportation Department  we were not prepared to ignore our responsibility to ensure safety in our skies  on our highways and on our railways   The bill provides funding increases totaling more than a quarter billion dollars to ensure that there are adequate numbers of personnel to control air traffic  as well as inspect and enforce safety rules governing commercial airliners  trucks  railroads and pipelines          Without this additional funding  the FAA Administrator told us that she would be required to put every air traffic controller and every aviation inspector on the street for two weeks without pay between now and the end of September          The Joint Funding Resolution currently before the Senate also boosts funding for AMTRAK to  1 3 billion   Under the current Continuing Resolution  AMTRAK s funding would remain  200 million lower than it was last year  That would endanger passenger rail service across the country as well as the annual maintenance expenses that must be made to ensure safe operations in the Northeast Corridor          Finally the bill pending before the Senate provides an additional  3 75 billion in additional formula funding for our nation s highway and transit systems   That funding will serve to create almost 160 000 new jobs  while alleviating congestion   It will be an important infusion of cash to the States to help them address their most pressing bridge replacements  highway widenings  and safety enhancements   When you look at all the highway needs across my State of Washington  the additional  71 million the State will receive is urgently needed and can be put to work right away        The Department of Transportation  like most of the rest of the government  is operating under the terms of Continuing Resolution that makes none of the funding adjustments I just discussed   It simply freezes all programs or cuts them to reflect the cuts that were passed in the House of Representatives during the last Congress   That CR will expire a week from today   February 15th          Now  some of our Senate colleagues have suggested that we should not adopt the new Joint Funding Resolution   Instead  they have advocated that we extend the existing CR through the remainder of the year   They are saying that we should forgo these desperately needed funds for highways and transit   That we should allow the FAA to furlough all its safety personnel for two weeks   That we should allow our aviation  truck  railroad and pipeline inspection workforce to dwindle          As part of this hearing  we will learn Secretary Peters  views on this question   And tomorrow  Senators will have their first opportunity to vote on this question  one way or another   Are we going to debate and pass the new Joint Funding Resolution   Or are we going to ignore our responsibility to transportation safety and investment for an entire fiscal year      The President s FY 2008 Budget    For 2008  the President has sent us a transportation budget totaling just under  67 billion   That represents an increase of  4 6 billion above the FY 2007 level that we hope to achieve by enacting the Joint Funding Resolution   This 7 3 percent increase is a substantial boost given the tight funding we find across the rest of the President s budget   My biggest concern with this budget proposal is not what it does do  but what it doesn t do   It seeks substantial new resources for one critical need   alleviating highway congestion  while providing little growth and even less emphasis on an equally critical need   reducing highway fatalities        Reducing Traffic Congestion   As a resident of the Puget Sound region  I can attest to the critical national need to address congestion   Congestion is keeping parents from their children and workers from their jobs   My state serves as a critical cargo gateway from Asia   Our future prosperity requires that we can get cargo out of our ports and onto highways and railways that are moving   not clogged with congestion        The Administration s budget proposes  175 million for a series of new programs designed to relieve congestion   We are told that this investment is part of a new  comprehensive  department wide National Strategy to Reduce Congestion    The Secretary is serious about this initiative  and I am willing to give it a careful look         A Retreat on Safety as Highway Deaths Increase   But I also have to ask  where is the new  comprehensive  department wide  National Strategy to Reduce Highway Deaths    Back in early 2003 when she was serving as our Federal Highway Administrator  Mary Peters noted that there were 41 000 highway related fatalities annually and said that we were facing  a national safety crisis    She was right   Tragically  however  the only thing that has happened since then is that the number of highway fatalities has increased   And it s not just the number of deaths that have increased  The fatality rate has increased as well   The numbers are all going in the wrong direction   The 41 000 fatalities that alarmed the Secretary back in 2003 have now grown to more than 43 400    That is the highest number recorded in 15 years   The Bush Administration established a performance goal for the Department of Transportation to reduce highway fatalities to 1 fatality per 100 million vehicle miles traveled by 2008   Unfortunately  for 2005 the most recent year for which we have data  the rate was 45 percent higher than that   1 45 fatalities          The Administration s budget documents indicate that the Department  instead of redoubling itself to achieving its goal  is now pushing off this goal until 2011   The Bush Administration is lowering the bar when it comes to saving lives  and I find it deeply disappointing   The growing carnage on our highways cries out for national attention and national leadership   Instead  the President s budget offers resignation and retreat            The Department of Transportation has many different responsibilities   One of the jobs of this subcommittee is to make sure that the policy direction and funding we provide is balanced between all the transportation modes and all the challenges that the Department faces   I commend the Department for trying to seriously address congestion on a department wide basis and asking for some innovative funding to back it up   But the Department needs to bring an equally serious focus to reducing highway deaths   With the statistics moving in the wrong direction  one thing that is clear is that the current strategies aren t working          In the next few weeks  our subcommittee will have a special hearing on just this topic with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  the NTSB and other officials to address this problem   I encourage all subcommittee members to attend
