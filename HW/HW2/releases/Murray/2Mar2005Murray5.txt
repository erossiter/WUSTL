                                                    News Release          Murray Addresses the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  March 2  2005         Good morning   It  s great to see so many familiar faces here in Washington  D C   We work together in the state often  but I want to thank you for once again making the annual trip here        And the truth is we need you here in Congress to keep the delegation informed and to keep the pressure up on Congress and the Administration   Our waterways are economic engines  Your communities rely on them for jobs and commerce   And we need to make sure the federal government is a strong partner with all of you   That  s why it  s so important that you  re here        Before I talk about some of the issues  I want to congratulate Kristin on becoming your government relations director   She  s a great choice   She knows how to get things done in Congress   She  s earned my trust and respect  and when she says something  s important  we know it really is   Kristin follows Louise Bray   who I always enjoyed working with and who now advises Governor Gregoire on transportation policy        And with Glenn Vanselow as your executive director   you  ve got a very effective team   Last week  I had two meetings that focused on transportation issues related to trade   One meeting was in Spokane and the other in Vancouver   I particularly want to express my appreciation to Larry Paulson for hosting the event at the Port of Vancouver        Two obvious principles developed from these meetings   First  for our goods to compete successfully overseas  they must get to market in a low cost and timely manner   Second  there are increasing challenges to getting our goods to market        The Spokane meeting raised a number of issues related to rail transportation  including the lack of rail cars and federal funding for infrastructure improvements   Also  the need to dredge the Snake River came up at both the Spokane and Vancouver meetings   This fact nicely illustrates the importance of the Columbia and Snake river transportation system for the entire region   In Vancouver  we focused on container issues  but also discussed the maintenance of the locks on the river system  channel deepening and the Mouth of the Columbia jetties        As I mentioned in Vancouver  it seems this country needs to have a much more vigorous dialogue about the infrastructure of this country    which brings me to some of the issues you  re here to address        TEA 21 is up for reauthorization and the Administration is threatening a veto for any bill that contains enough funding to make any real difference in our deteriorating surface transportation system   We have a Corps budget that once again leaves us limping along and trying to add funding for projects that were amazingly left out of the budget   Investment in our transportation system is one of the few guaranteed economic drivers we have available to us        The initial construction jobs bring an immediate boost to our economy   The resulting improvements in the transportation system help our people and goods move more efficiently and compete better in the world market   But despite the obvious short  and long term benefits of investment in transportation we have budget policies that create an uncertainty that affects us all        Some things in the President  s budget just don  t make sense        For example  the Administration  s budget has  15 million for Channel Deepening and yet has zero dollars for jetty repair work at the Mouth   The value of those additional three feet will be meaningless if the mouth is closed due to a breach in the jetties          And the lack of consistent funding for our smaller  shallow draft ports leaves them and their customers guessing year to year whether they will be open for business   We simply must get budgets out of the Administration that make sense and make a commitment to the future of our transportation system        I am once again ready to work with you on meeting the immediate needs of our ports and businesses in Washington state   This must be done   But I believe we need to all be working with our counterparts from around the country to bring greater focus and commitment to our transportation budgets   Again  thank you for coming back to D C   It is wonderful to see all of you    I want to take a few questions
