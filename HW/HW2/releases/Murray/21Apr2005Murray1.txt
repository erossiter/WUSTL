                                                                 News Release          Murray Calls on Administration to   Come Clean   about Amtrak  s Needs Amtrak Board requests a 50  increase over current funding levels  proves that rail reform is not possible under Bush  s budget request of zero    For Immediate Release  Thursday  April 21  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  Amtrak  s Board of Directors    all of whom are Bush Administration appointees    requested a  1 82 billion federal subsidy for the coming fiscal year in order to continue passenger rail service across the country    This request for dramatically increased federal dollars    a 50 percent increase over current funding levels   comes two months after the Board failed to submit a grant request to Congress and despite the fact that the President included no funding for Amtrak in his fiscal year 2006 budget        Today  s request by Amtrak  s Board of Directors proves that neither the continuation of passenger rail service nor Amtrak reform is possible without significant federal investment          At a hearing of the Transportation  Treasury  Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee of which she is the ranking Democrat  Senator Patty Murray today pressed OMB Director Josh Bolten  to submit a budget amendment to Congress that realistically addresses the funding needs of Amtrak            It is time for the Administration to come clean about the true funding needs of Amtrak     Murray said     Whether we adopt the Administration  s plan for reform  the Board  s plan  or any other plan  the fact remains that passenger rail service costs money   If the Administration doesn  t agree with the request of the board made up entirely of its own appointees  they need to present some alternative plan that clearly tells Amtrak  s 25 million riders who will have rail service come October and who will be left standing on the platform            Even Ken Mead  Inspector General of the Department of Transportation  today said that Amtrak would require a  200 to  300 million dollar increase over current funding levels just to continue current service levels            In just over six months  Amtrak will run out of money   If the Acela trains can  t be fixed rapidly  that day may come even sooner     Murray said     The Bush Administration needs to come forward with a realistic funding request that maintains service while Congress and the Administration have a meaningful debate over how best to protect and expand passenger rail options for America   By continuing to bury its head in the sand over Amtrak  s true financial needs  the Bush Administration is putting rail service at risk in every State where Amtrak operates                                                                                       In February  Murray  a long time supporter of Amtrak  rebuked the Amtrak Board for their unprecedented action in failing to submit a subsidy request   Full text of her letter to the Board follows        February 18  2005        The Honorable David M  Laney  Chairman  Board of Directors  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  60 Massachusetts Ave  N E   Washington  D C  20002    Dear Chairman Laney         We write to you today having just received your letter dated February 17 and the accompanying reports regarding Amtrak  s financial condition as mandated under Subtitle V of Title 49  United States Code  Each and every year since Amtrak  s creation  the Board of Directors has submitted these reports to Congress  providing us with a vital and independent assessment of Amtrak  s Federal subsidy needs for the coming fiscal year  That is  until this year         This year  s report as submitted by a largely new Board deliberately evades the question of the railroad  s subsidy needs and instead praises the President  s irresponsible proposal to bankrupt Amtrak as   the right message     Such an approach undermines Congress  s ability to assess Amtrak  s needs and is a disservice to the Corporation that you are charged with governing  The law mandating these reports calls on the Amtrak Board to   submit recommendations for legislation  including the amount of financial assistance needed for operations and capital improvements    and every one of your predecessor Boards has done so  In just two weeks  the Congress is scheduled to begin drafting a Budget Resolution for the coming fiscal year  By not submitting a grant request prior to our budget considerations  you deliberately leave uncontested the Administration  s request to eliminate all funding for Amtrak and push the railroad into bankruptcy         These actions on the part of the Board are irresponsible  In fiscal year 2004  some 37 percent of all of Amtrak  s revenues were derived through Federal grants  By not specifying Amtrak  s federal funding needs to Congress prior to our budget deliberations  the Board is failing to serve as independent stewards of the Corporation  s assets  operations  and employees and is ignoring its legal responsibility to Amtrak  s financial condition  We must question whether these actions are consistent with your fiduciary duties as Directors as stipulated under Title 29 of the Code of the District of Columbia and other applicable laws         The Congress and Amtrak  s 25 million annual riders expect the Amtrak Board to responsibly and independently work to improve and sustain a safe and efficient passenger railroad    not to dutifully line up behind the reckless policies of the President that appointed them  In explaining why the Board has failed to submit a grant request  your letter states that the Board is going through a   strategic planning process    and that a grant request might be submitted   as the planning process permits     No date is supplied as to when  if ever  this grant request might be forthcoming  We must respectfully point out that Amtrak  s Board has often engaged in critical planning processes regarding the railroad  s operations and infrastructure  but such endeavors have never kept any prior Board from submitting a grant request         We hope that  in the future  the Amtrak Board will be attentive to these responsibilities so that we can all work cooperatively toward a sound rail transportation policy for the nation         Sincerely            Patty Murray  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  and General Government  Committee on Appropriations      Daniel K  Inouye  Ranking Member  Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation    cc  The Honorable Floyd Hall  The Honorable Enrique Sosa  The Honorable Norman Mineta  Mr  David Gunn  Ex Officio
