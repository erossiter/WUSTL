                                                         News Release          Senator Murray s Plan to Help Schoolchildren of Military Families    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 1  2005      The Problem   As Washington s military bases gain and lose personnel due to deployments and the Pentagon s new realignment plan  schools near military bases and the children of military personnel are being impacted         Impact on Schools   Some school districts  including Bethel and Central Kitsap  will have to cope with a dramatic and rapid increase in enrollment  They will need to hire new teachers and find new classroom space quickly    under tight budgets and without any additional federal support   Other school districts  such as Clover Park  will lose hundreds of students and be forced to close schools  greatly disrupting local communities         Impact on Students   Studies show that children of military personnel often struggle academically while their parents are deployed overseas   These students need additional counseling and support  but many schools are not equipped to provide that support       Senator Murray s Proposal     Senator Murray has met with local superintendents  teachers  counselors  parents and students  and developed a plan to         minimize the impact of these military changes on local schools and students      and ensure that children of military personnel get the monitoring  support and counseling they need so they don t fall behind       Senator Murray will introduce her proposal as an amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill  FY 2006   which the Senate is expected to take up shortly         Importantly  Senator Murray s funding is separate from    and in addition to    federal Impact Aid assistance  Murray s also funding helps schools that may not qualify for Impact Aid but are still affected by military base changes      SUMMARY  Senator Murray s Proposal  1   Helps schools facing a DROP in enrollment      The Murray amendment will provide a cushion for Impact Aid school districts like Clover Park  which is experiencing a drop in enrollment  and therefore a drop in Impact Aid funding  due to extended deployments and military housing privatization at McChord AFB         2  Helps schools facing an INCREASE in enrollment  whether or not they get Impact Aid       The Murray amendment will provide funding for school districts like Bethel  which does not receive Impact Aid funding  but is experiencing a significant  unexpected increase in enrollment due to the 4th Stryker Brigades move to Fort Lewis          The Murray amendment will provide additional funding for highly impacted school districts such as those on the Kitsap Peninsula   Those schools will see an even greater influx of students due to the ongoing Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC    process   For example  the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is expected to gain 1 400 new jobs      3  Helps schools meet the emotional  academic and counseling needs of military children       The Murray amendment will provide funding for school districts all over the State that do not receive Impact Aid funding but are in need of counseling services and teacher education to better assist the students in coping with National Guard and Reserve deployments      FURTHER DETAILS  Senator Murray s Proposal  Proposal   The Murray Amendment authorizes such sums as may be necessary to the Secretary of Defense to make education assistance available to school districts serving large numbers of military children affected by the war or other military personnel decisions   Funds are for additional tutoring  counseling  and teacher training in how to identify and respond to emotional needs common in children who have a parent in a wartime deployment   Funds are separate from and in addition to basic DoD Impact Aid appropriations      Distribution   Appropriated funds will be allocated on a pro rata basis to school districts that   1  serve a large number of military children  and  2  are designated by the Secretary of Defense as impacted by the war or DoD military personnel decisions   Funds in excess of  20 million will used to hold harmless under the Impact Aid program districts facing a sudden and dramatic decline in military child population   Up to 10 percent of total funding may be set aside by the Secretary for districts that confront an emergency influx of military families      Rationale Evidence   School districts serving large numbers of military children confront substantial additional education costs associated with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars     During past military actions  public school districts confronted increased counseling  discipline  and tutorial costs associated with military children who fell behind academically while their parents engaged in armed conflict   Source  Military Impacted Schools Association  June 2003   According to Dr  Dennis Embry of the Paxis Institute  on a widespread basis during the first Iraq war  military children fell behind academically  withdrew emotionally  disassociated from others  and became aggressive and disruptive in school
