                                   News Release          Murray  President  s Budget Fails Veterans    For Immediate Release  Thursday  February 10  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today slammed a budget proposal by President Bush that treats our nation  s veterans as   non essential priorities      In a speech on the floor of the U S  Senate  Murray    a key member of the Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee    promised to fight the cuts and provide veterans in Washington state and across the country with the care and benefits they deserve       Senator Murray  s floor speech follows      Mr  President  one week ago we walked across the Capitol to hear President Bush outline his priorities for the nation during the State of the Union address   On that night  President Bush told all of us that the document reflecting his priorities    his Fiscal Year 2006 budget         substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results  or duplicate current efforts  or do not fulfill essential priorities           Less than a week after delivering that address the President unveiled a budget that defines exactly what he sees as those   non essential priorities             students ports and borders accessible health care nuclear waste cleanup    In addition  the budget has not one dollar    that s right Mr  President  not one single dollar    for the two top priorities that the President talked about that night   Social Security transition costs and making the tax cuts permanent are ignored in this budget   It s a camouflage budget meant to hide the truth from American families          What the President should know is that families in Washington state and across the country are concerned about the security of their jobs  their communities  and access to affordable health care and quality education   Unfortunately  rather than inspiring confidence  the President  s budget leaves too many Americans questioning the future   On issue after issue  this budget falls short of what our communities need to move forward        But what I d like to focus on here this morning is this budget s impact on one group we absolutely must take care of  our nation s veterans          We have no greater obligation as elected officials than to take care of those who have taken care of us   Unfortunately  I fear this Administration is failing in this most important responsibility   Unfortunately  after asking thousands of soldiers to serve us overseas  this Administration is not making their health care and well being a priority when they cease being soldiers and become veterans          Access to first class care should be a reality for all veterans    especially while our nation is at war   The President  s budget may have a few small steps in the right direction  but sadly  he does not go far enough to meet the needs of all veterans   If this budget    and its misguided proposals    were enacted  it would devastate VA health care         Payroll and inflation increases for doctors  nurses  and medications cost more than  1 billion  but the President has proposed to give VA only half of what is needed   To make up for this shortfall  the budget forces more than 2 million   middle income    veterans to pay more than double for their needed medications and to pay a  250 enrollment fee        In addition  the President  s budget actually continues to ban some veterans from coming to the VA for care   So far  under this flawed policy  192 260 veterans have been turned away across the country  including more than 3 000 Washington state veterans   This sends the wrong message to our troops overseas   They need to know that we are there for them when they return home        The budget also destroys the relationship between VA and the States   Following the Civil War  VA has supported the cost of veterans residing in State VA Nursing Homes   Yet  this budget calls on States to cover the entire cost of care for many veterans in these cost effective nursing homes         To make this budget add up  the President calls for  590 million in unspecified   efficiencies       Thousands of nurses and other providers would be cut    Thousands of nursing home beds would be shuttered  And more than a million veterans could no longer afford to come to VA for care          But you don t only have to take my word for it   Listen to the head of the VFW  who addressed this issue in yesterday s Congress Daily       John Furgess  who heads the Veterans of Foreign Wars  said the administration s proposed  880 million increase in veterans  health care only amounts to an increase of about  100 million because the budget proposes that veterans shoulder a  250 enrollment fee and an increased co pay on prescription drugs  in addition to nursing home cuts    Part of the federal government s deficit will be balanced on the backs of military veterans  because it s clear that the proper funding of veterans  health care and other programs is not an administration priority   Furgess said       And there s more   Before the budget was even sent to Congress  I read this in the New York Times      Richard B  Fuller  legislative director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America  said   The proposed increase in health spending is not sufficient at a time when the number of patients is increasing and there has been a huge increase in health care costs  It will not cover the need  The enrollment fee is a health care tax  designed to raise revenue and to discourage people from enrolling       The story went on to say that there are already some hospitals with waiting lists for Iraqi veterans       In Michigan  for example  thousands of veterans are on waiting lists for medical services  and some reservists returning from Iraq say they have been unable to obtain the care they were promised  A veterans   clinic in Pontiac  Mich   put a limit on new enrollment  Cutbacks at a veterans   hospital in Altoona  Pa   are forcing some veterans to seek treatment elsewhere          And yesterday  in an editorial titled  Penalizing veterans   the Boston Globe said       IT IS a sign of how desperate the Bush administration is to protect tax cuts for the wealthy while also trying to reduce runaway deficits that it would call for veterans to pay more for their health benefits  Congress should reject this proposal out of hand and put enough money into veterans  health care to end the inexcusable waiting lists at many veterans  facilities         Mr  President  as you can see  I am not alone in my concern for this budget s impact on veterans   Unfortunately  the widespread outrage at this budget is not limited to its impact on veterans           I could speak for hours more on this budget s harmful effects on other programs like healthcare  education and nuclear waste clean up   As a member of the Budget Committee  I raised some of these concerns with the director of the Office of Management and Budget yesterday   I was disappointed with O M B Director Bolten s responses to questions on Energy policy  veterans  and other issues before the Budget Committee yesterday   I hope that Treasury Secretary Snow has more answers for the Committee this morning             But a more detailed critique of these cuts will have to wait for another day   Today  all I have time for is this budget s harsh impact on veterans           Apparently  President Bush believes that veterans are a  non essential priority    That s an insult to them  and an insult to their service and sacrifice   I know that I  along with many of my colleagues  will not stand for this assault on our veterans   They deserve better
