                                                                                                     News Release          Cargo Security  Floor Remarks by Senator Patty Murray Introducing the GreenLane Bill for Senate Consideration    For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 7  2006    UPDATE  The Senate Passed Senator Murray  s Bill on 9 14 06        Mr  President  it s been five years since the September 11th attacks  and our country is still dangerously vulnerable   We have huge loopholes at our ports and in our cargo container system   None of us should sleep well at night  until we close those security holes and protect our country   That s why I m here on the Senate floor once again pushing for us to pass the bipartisan GreenLane bill          I  m excited that after working on this for several years  we are on the verge of making our country more secure   The full House of Representatives passed our bill   The Senate Homeland Security Committee passed our bill   We have worked with the Commerce and Finance Committees to address issues in the bill they had raised   Now it s up to us in the Senate to finally pass this bill         Today  I want to explain            why our ports are so vulnerable        how an attack would affect our people and our economy        and finally  how this bill will make us more secure and keep trade flowing      We Are Still Vulnerable    To understand why our ports are so vulnerable  you just have to look at something that happened in my home state of Washington three weeks ago         On August 16  there was a big scare at the Port of Seattle   Two containers originating in Pakistan were offloaded at Terminal 18 and targeted for closer inspection   They were first scanned by a gamma imaging machine  which is essentially a giant X ray machine for cargo containers   The initial images suggested that what was supposed to be in the container was different than what an x ray scan showed   Next  port officials brought in two security dogs   Both of the dogs detected what they thought were explosives in a cargo container on Terminal 18          To understand why this was such a scary incident  you just have to look at the Port of Seattle and what surrounds it   This photograph shows the Port of Seattle in the foreground and downtown Seattle in the background   This view shows that once a bomb reaches the port  it s too late   That s because in many cities like Seattle  our ports are very close to downtown areas   That means a lot of people and a lot of economic activity could be threatened if there s an incident at one of our ports   Here s Terminal 18   You can see just a short distance away is downtown Seattle   Here s Interstate 5    our most important north south route in western Washington   During this scare  officials had to close the terminal  establish a 500 yard safety zone surrounding the terminal and create a 300 yard safety zone along the Seattle waterfront        Now fortunately  further testing showed that this was just a false alarm  I want to commend everyone on the ground for doing an excellent job of responding to the incident       We Didn t Know What s In Many Containers    Here s the problem    we didn t know this container could have posed a problem until it was sitting on the dock in Washington state   By the time a cargo container is sitting on American soil  it is too late          The main idea behind this bill is to push our borders out    to do the screening and testing overseas    so that a container never even gets close to our shores if we think it might be dangerous   But today  too often  we wait until a container is sitting on American soil    dangerously close to our cities    before we find out whether or not it could pose a danger   Fortunately  the Seattle incident ended well  but that same week  we got a very stark warning about how it could have ended differently       New Report Shows the Catastrophic Impact of an Attack    In August  the RAND Center for Terrorism and Risk Management Policy issued a very troubling report that showed what would happen if there had been a nuclear device in that cargo container   The RAND Corporation looked at the following scenario   Terrorists put a 10 kiloton nuclear bomb inside a cargo container and detonate it at the Port of Long Beach in California   The researchers chose that scenario because as they put it   analysts consider it feasible  it is highly likely to have a catastrophic effect  and the target is both a key part of the U S  economic infrastructure and a critical global shipping center         Mr  President  here s what would happen         Up to 60 000 people would be killed instantly from the blast or from radiation poisoning         150 000 people would be injured by radiation exposure       Up to 6 million people would flee Los Angeles        Two to three million people would need to be relocated because their land would be contaminated by radiation        Finally  the economic losses would be about  1 trillion    that is ten times worse than September 11th  Those costs would include medical care  insurance claims  workers   compensation  evacuation  and construction        Imagine that    the economic damage would be 10 times worse than what happened on September 11th  How many more reports like that is it going to take   How many more port evacuations and scares is it going to take before we get serious about port security  Time is not on our side   Each year  six million cargo containers enter U S  seaports   And that number is expected to quadruple in the next twenty years   These cargo containers carry the building blocks of our economy         The One Two Punch of an Attack    But without adequate security  they can also provide an opportunity for terrorists to deliver a deadly one two punch to our country   The first punch would create an untold number of American casualties   The second punch would bring our economy to a halt   Today  we are not doing enough to keep America safe           Standing in this Chamber  it can feel like the dangers at our ports are a distant concern   But given that our ports are connected to our nation  s transportation system and are often close to major population centers  the threat is never far away          Example  The Hyundai Fortune    Mr  President  I want to share a disturbing photo that shows us what a terrorist attack could look like   On March 21st  a container ship called the Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast of Yemen when an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship          Here is a photo of what happened next   About 90 containers were blown off the side of the ship  creating a debris field 5 miles long   Thankfully there were no fatalities  and the crew was rescued    Fortunately  this incident does not appear to be terrorist related  but it gives us an idea of what a terrorist incident on a container ship could look like         Now I want you to imagine this same burning ship sitting just a few feet from our shores    in New York harbor or Puget Sound  off the coast of Los Angeles or Charleston  Miami  Portland  Hampton Roads  the Delaware Bay or the Gulf of Mexico          Now imagine that we re not just dealing with a conventional explosion   We re dealing with a dirty bomb that has exploded on America s shores      After an Incident    Let me walk through what would happen next   First  there would be an immediate loss of life   Many of our ports are located near major cities          If this was a chemical weapon exploding in Seattle  the chemical plume could contaminate the rail system  Interstate 5 and SeaTac Airport  not to mention the entire downtown business and residential district   At the port  there would be tremendous confusion   People would try to contain the fire  but it s unclear who    if anyone    would be in charge        Then when word spreads that it s a dirty bomb  panic would likely set in   There would be chaos as first responders try to react  and residents try to flee         Next  our government would shut down every port in America to make sure there weren t other bombs on other containers in other cities   That shutdown would be the equivalent of driving our economy into a brick wall   It could even spark a global recession         Economic Shutdown    Day by day  we d feel the painful economic impact of the attack   American factories would not be able to get the supplies they need   They would shut their doors and lay off workers   Stores around the country would not be able to get the products they need to stock their shelves   Prices for these goods would spike  as demand began to outweigh the supply   And consumers would not be able afford the items they rely on every day          In 2002  we saw what the closure of a few ports on the West Coast would do   It cost our economy about  1 billion a day   Imagine if we shut down all our ports   One study concluded that if U S  ports were shut down for just 9 days  it would cost our economy  58 billion        The RAND report that I mentioned earlier found that the economic damage could top more than  1 trillion        Next  we d realize we have no plan for resuming trade after an attack    no protocol for what would be searched  what would be allowed in  and even who would be in charge   There would be a mad scramble to create a new system in a crisis atmosphere          Eventually  we d begin the slow process of manually inspecting all the cargo that s waiting to enter the U S   One report found it could take as long as four months to get them all inspected and moving again        Finally  we d have to set up a new regime for port security   And you can bet that any new  rushed plan would not balance strong security with efficient trade        Unfortunately  the scenario I just outlined is not the stuff of fantasy   Rather  it is a realistic portrayal of events that could happen tomorrow   Five years after September 11th  we still have not closed a major loophole that threatens our lives and our economy   Time is not on our side   We must act  and we must act now       My Approach    Security   Commerce    I approach this as someone who understands the importance of both improving security and maintaining the flow of commerce   My home state of Washington is the most trade dependent state in the nation   We know what s at stake if there were an incident at one of our ports        That s why I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce to help us find where we re vulnerable and to evaluate the best security practices         It s why I ve worked to boost funding for the Coast Guard and have fought to keep the Port Security Grant program from being eliminated year after year          Right after 9 11  I started talking with security and trade experts to find out what we need to be doing to both improve security and keep commerce flowing          Last year  I sought out Senator Collins as a partner in this effort    I approached Senator Collins because I knew she cared about the issue  I knew she d done a lot of work on it already  and I knew she was someone who could get things done   Since that day  we have worked hand in hand to develop a bill and move it forward         The Threat    And the reason we ve worked so hard on this is because we know how vulnerable we are   Terrorists have many opportunities to introduce deadly cargo into a container          It could be tampered with anytime from when it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it arrives at a consolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port   It could even be tampered with while it s en route to the U S          And there are several dangers   I outlined what would happen if terrorists exploded a container   But they could just as easily use cargo containers to transport weapons or personnel into the U S  to launch an attack anywhere on American soil        In April  22 Chinese stowaways were found at the Port of Seattle  They reached the U S  inside a cargo container   In that case  they were stowaways  but they could have been terrorists sneaking into our country       Current Efforts Are Inadequate    The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate   Last year    thanks to the insistence of Senators Collins and Coleman    the Government Accountability Office found that C TPAT was not even checking to see if companies were doing what they promised in their security plans          Even when U S  Customs inspectors do find something suspicious at a foreign port  they cannot force a container to be inspected          So we have a clear and deadly threat  and we know that current programs are inadequate   What are we going to do about it   We could manually inspect every container  but that would cripple our economy         The Challenge    Security and Efficiency    The real challenge here is to make trade more secure without slowing it to a crawl   That s why the Homeland Security  Commerce  and Finance Committees    through the leadership of Senators Collins  Lieberman  Stevens  Inouye  Grassley  Baucus  and I have worked with stakeholders and experts to strike the right balance          The result is the bill now before us   It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security while keeping trade efficient   At its heart  this challenge is about keeping the good things about trade    speed and efficiency    without being vulnerable to the bad things about trade    the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce         How the Bill Works    The GreenLane bill does five things   First  it creates tough new standards for all cargo   Today we don t have any standards for cargo security         Second  it creates the GreenLane option  which provides an even higher level of security   Companies have the option to follow the higher standards of the GreenLane          Their cargo will be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a factory floor overseas until it the reaches the U S   We ll know everywhere that cargo has been   We ll know every person who s touched it  and we ll know if it s been tampered with          The GreenLane will push out the borders by conducting inspections overseas before cargo is ever loaded onto a ship bound for the U S   And we ll provide incentives for companies to use the highest standards of the GreenLane        Third  our bill sets up a plan to resume trade quickly and safely to minimize the impact of a terrorist attack on our economy        Fourth  our bill will secure our ports here at home by authorizing and funding Port Security grants          This funding will help ports and port operators develop and implement security plans   They could use this funding to strengthen perimeter security  which could help prevent a number of security lapses that were highlighted in a recent Seattle Times article in which a reporter was able to enter a port and walk around the containers there         Finally  our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo security   DHS is long overdue in establishing cargo security standards and transportation worker credentials   We need to hold DHS accountable  and our bill provides the infrastructure to ensure accountability and coordination        Our Bill Makes Us Safer    Let me share some ways that our bill will make America safer   First  we close the loopholes that leave us vulnerable today   Senator Collins and I have studied the 9 11 Commission report and the various GAO reports  and we ve worked hard to put their recommendations into our bill       Follows the 9 11 Commission s Recommendations    Mr  President  the 9 11 Commission examined what went wrong five years ago and how we can prevent another terrorist attack   We listened to the 9 11 Commission  and we worked hard to incorporate their recommendations and to close the loopholes the commission identified       Implements Layered Security    The 9 11 Commission said we need a  layered  security system   Our bill adopts that layered approach   Here s what we envision as the Secretary of Homeland Security implements the bill   Each step in the GreenLane system will have multiple and redundant security layers   Cargo would be monitored and secured starting at a foreign factory overseas  In addition  containers will be sealed with high tech container security devices  such as e seals  to protect against tampering or compromise   Then  before the container is loaded onto a ship  its manifest is reviewed  and the container is inspected for radiation  seal tampering  and x rayed  And finally  the cargo will be secured with access controls  ensuring everyone with access to GreenLane cargo has undergone a background check and possess verifiable identification   These multiple layers provide the type of layered security that the 9 11 Commission called for       Centralizes Authority    The 9 11 Commission also said we need to centralize authority and responsibility so there is finally some accountability in our government     Our bill centralizes authority by establishing the Office of Cargo Security Policy within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate federal cargo security programs and to advance security research and development          Implements Information Sharing    The 9 11 Commission also said we need to do a better job sharing information throughout our government   Our bill promotes coordination by establishing regional Interagency Operational Centers to enhance cooperation between federal agencies   So our bill is responsive to the problems and the loopholes that the 9 11 Commission identified       New Tools to Secure America    Our bill gives us new tools so we can approach cargo security in new ways   It gives U S  officials in foreign ports the authority to inspect suspicious containers before they are loaded for departure to the United States   Our bill makes the haystack that we must search smaller   It allows the U S  government to focus on suspicious cargo   It ensures that we are inspecting and stopping cargo that poses a threat  It cuts down on smuggling of weapons  people  drugs or other illegal cargo          This bill will also protect America  s economy in the event of a terror attack   That s because it provides a secure  organized way to quickly resume cargo operations after any emergency shut down   Because any shut down of ports has the potential to cost the U S  economy billions of dollars a day  our bill will minimize the economic impact of a terror attack           I m very proud of this bill and I want to thank all of our partners and supporters  I want to thank Senator Collins for her tremendous leadership   I want to thank Senator Coleman for his work as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   I want to thank Senator Lieberman and all our co sponsors   And I want to thank the Commerce and Finance Committees    especially Senators Stevens  Inouye  Grassley  and Baucus        We ve seen tremendous progress on the House side with the SAFE Port Act  and I want to thank Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harman for their leadership          Finally  I  d like to thank the numerous federal  state and local officials  as well as industry representatives  for their tremendous assistance in crafting this legislation   They truly are at the front lines of securing our nation  s ports  and I ve been proud to work with them all        Today We Have a Choice    Today  we have a choice in how we deal with the cargo security challenges facing us   But if we wait for a disaster  our choices will be starker   Let s make the changes now on our terms before there s a deadly incident   Let s protect America before an image like this is on our TV screens   Let s not wait until a terrorist incident strikes again to protect our people and our economy         Earlier this year  the American people woke up and spoke out when they heard that a foreign  government owned company could be running our ports   That sparked a critical debate         Now we need to set up a security regime that will actually make us safer   Until we do so  none of us should sleep well at night   A terrible image like this one    a burning container ship  with a dirty bomb  in one of America s harbors    could be on our TV screens tomorrow  so this Congress must act today   We only have a few days to get this right   Let s pass the GreenLane bill before it s too late
