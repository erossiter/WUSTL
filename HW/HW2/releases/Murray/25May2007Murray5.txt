                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Senator Murray s Statement on the Passing of Norm Maleng                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Murray  Senator Murray s Statement on the Passing of Norm Maleng  05 25 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray s Statement on the Passing of Norm Maleng      For Immediate Release  Friday  May 25  2007     Seattle  King County  and the entire Pacific Northwest have lost a fine statesman in the passing of Norm Maleng   My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time         Norm was known by all who knew him as a fair  honest and thoughtful leader   Like most people  I am hard pressed to recall who else held his position   the King County Prosecutor was always Norm Maleng         For all who held public office  Norm was an icon   And for me personally   despite our party differences   he was a constant voice of reason and evenhandedness           King County residents could count on the knowledge that whatever issue came before him  Norm would handle it with integrity   No matter the scope or profile of the case  we all breathed easier knowing that Norm Maleng was in charge and that justice would be served         Norm was a role model for all of us   He treated everyone equally and fairly   He approached every case and every challenge with wisdom and dignity   His voice will be missed   For me  he will always be the King County Prosecutor
