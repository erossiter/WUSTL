in Capitol Hill Tunnels In sharply worded letter to Architect of the Capitol  Murray Seeks Answers to Ongoing Safety Problems Revealed at her March 1st Hearing    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 20  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  released a letter she wrote last week to Acting Architect of the Capitol  AOC  Stephen Ayers seeking answers on ongoing safety violations in the miles of utility tunnels under the U S  Capitol complex         In 2000  the Office of Compliance cited thousands of health and safety violations by the Architect of the Capitol  AOC    The AOC s inattentiveness and seeming indifference to those violations came to light this month when tunnel worker John Thayer testified at a hearing Murray held on March 1st    Murray  who chairs the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety  called the hearing to examine her bill to ban asbestos   Mr  Thayer testified that AOC employees were exposed to asbestos  were denied safety equipment and training  were pressured to not report problems  and were not reimbursed for an independent medical evaluation         It was a shock to all of us to hear about inadequate asbestos abatement methods and the asbestos exposures to Architect of the Capitol  AOC  workers and possibly to the staff and residents of the Capitol Hill community   Murray wrote    The defensive posture of your office and its seeming indifference to address the issues raised by the Office of Compliance a year ago has not served anyone well   most importantly the innocent tunnel workers         Specifically  Murray sought answers on the lack of training for workers  the lack of protective equipment  the AOC s failure to inform workers of the dangers they faced in the tunnels  and the pressure put on workers to not report these problems        In addition  Murray asked the Architect to explain his plans for removing the remaining asbestos in the utility tunnels  for training workers and contractors to safely handle asbestos  and for providing personal protective equipment for tunnel workers        Finally  Murray said that the Architect should personally apologize to tunnel workers for the way they ve been treated   Murray wrote that the AOC s failure to pay for an independent medical evaluation   tells me that you may have been more worried about your legal liabilities in this matter than providing the best care possible for these men                                                             The text of Senator Murray s letter follows     March 16  2007        Stephen Ayers  Acting Architect of the Capitol  Washington  DC  20515    Dear Mr  Ayers        I am writing to you to express my deep concerns about the ongoing hazardous working conditions in the US Capitol Power Plant Utilities Tunnels        On March 1st I chaired a hearing in the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety focusing on the critical importance of banning the use of asbestos in America   During that hearing I was very troubled to learn from Mr  John Thayer about the lack of attention to asbestos control in the Capitol Hill utility tunnels   It was a shock to all of us to hear about inadequate asbestos abatement methods and the asbestos exposures to Architect of the Capitol  AOC  workers and possibly to the staff and residents of the Capitol Hill community          I was also concerned about the lack of training provided to the workers  apparently they were also not informed about the potential dangers to their health of working around asbestos  Lastly  we heard about pressure put on workers to not report these problems to Congress and efforts to restrict their access to evaluation by a physician of their choice          This letter is to request information on your specific plans to remove the remaining asbestos in the utility tunnels  including criteria for selection and monitoring asbestos abatement contractors  containment strategies  and training of both AOC and contract workers   I am also interested in your plans to provide proper personal protective equipment for AOC workers as well as adequate awareness training          Lastly  I want to know why you were only willing to pay for the doctors you referred to the men  I have known and worked with Dr  Harbut for a number of years  He is one of the foremost specialists in the field of detecting occupationally related asbestos cancers in patients  including mesothelioma         Given what the AOC s office has put these men through  I would have thought you would have wanted to do whatever your office could to begin to correct this horrible situation involving these dedicated public servants  Your decision does make me wonder whether you are willing to provide the best possible care for these men         It also tells me that you may have been more worried about your legal liabilities in this matter than providing the best care possible for these men  Are the physicians you referred the men to board certified pulmonologists or otherwise credentialed in occupational medicine or respiratory diseases  particularly mesothelioma          Reducing and ultimately eliminating asbestos exposure in the US is of utmost importance to me and I hope you will join me in doing everything we can to protect the health of our AOC utility tunnel workers  The defensive posture of your office and its seeming indifference to address the issues raised by the Office of Compliance a year ago has not served anyone well   most importantly the innocent tunnel workers         I trust you will meet with all of the tunnel workers in the very near future to offer your apologies for the way they have been treated up till now         I look forward to receiving your responses by March 31st        Sincerely         Senator Patty Murray  Chairwoman  HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety
