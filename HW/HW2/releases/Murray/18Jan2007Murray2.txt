                                                         News Release          Senator Murray Stands with Veterans in Opposing Escalation of War Veterans are already facing long delays for healthcare  benefits    For Immediate Release  Thursday  January 18  2007             WASHINGTON  D C      At a Capitol Hill press conference today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  stood with nine veterans of the war in Iraq and four Senators in speaking out against the President s plan to escalate the war in Iraq         We have got to do a better job meeting the needs of the men and women who have served our country so honorably   Murray said    Today    without the surge    veterans are waiting for the services they ve been promised            If we re not meeting the needs of the veterans today  how can we keep the promise to troops who are sent in to an escalated war    Murray asked    It is our job to make sure we take care of the veterans who served us  The Senate Veterans committee and the House Veterans committee are going to demand hearings and hold the VA s feet to the fire         Senator Murray was joined by a bipartisan group of nine Iraq war veterans who visited members of Congress today to argue against the President s proposed surge   Also speaking at the press conference were Senators Ted Kennedy  D MA   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Sherrod Brown  D OH  and Bernie Sanders  I VT        Senator Murray s remarks follow         I want to thank Jon Soltz  who you ll have a chance to hear from in just a few minutes  a veteran from Iraq who has some very compelling stories to talk about        We are here today to address the President s surge in Iraq and how some of our veterans feel about it  We will be joined by several of them as they work their way into the room in a few minutes   I m also joined by Senator Kennedy who s been very passionate about this issue as well as several members of our Veterans Committee and Senator Danny Akaka  our chair who is hoping to be here shortly as well        I want to start by thanking the veterans who are with us today for serving our country and for speaking out for so many men and women who are serving us today who can t be here in Washington  D C        We are here today in this room because our troops are doing a great job for us overseas   I was on the ground in Baghdad with our troops   I saw firsthand the tremendous sacrifice they made  what a commitment they had to our country and our future  and they have my full support   In fact all of us want us to be successful in Iraq   every senator  every service member  every citizen   But we also have an obligation to meet their needs when they come home whether it s for healthcare  or for job training or benefits or making the transition back home          We have got to do a better job meeting the needs of the men and women who have served our country so honorably   Today    without the surge    veterans are waiting for the services they ve been promised          Many of our veterans are facing long delays to see a doctor when they return    six months or more   Some of our soldiers now are being told   we re going to deploy you early  Well when they come home they re going to be waiting as much as two years for the benefits they ve been promised        Unemployment is a serious problem for our young men and women when the come home after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   Our Guard and Reserve members are coming home from war  and many of them are falling through the cracks whether they need job training or transition assistance or other support services        And we are not doing the job we need to meet the mental health needs that so many of our soldiers face  and you will hear about that today as well        So today without a surge we are not meeting the needs of our men and women who have served us so honorably overseas   And I m delighting that they are now joining us today and I want to thank all of them        So we re here today to say an escalation in troops is going to have terrific demands that we all have to understand   But who the demand is going to fall most on are the men and women who serve us   They have some pretty strong opinions about that  and they re going to be talking to you about that today        But if we re not meeting the needs of the veterans today  how can we have an escalation in this war and promise those who we are sending early or keeping there longer or sending anew that we re going to be there for them   It is our job to make sure we take care of the veterans who served us  The Senate Veterans committee and the House Veterans committee are going to demand hold hearings and hold the VA s feet to the fire
