                                             News Release          Murray Examines Employment Barriers Faced by Veterans Murray outlines critical needs  looks at efforts by the VA  DoD  and DoL to address veteran employment problems    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 13  2007     Senator Murray s opening statement from today s hearing      Washington D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  took part in a Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee hearing that examined the federal government s efforts to assist veterans in securing employment  Unemployment among veterans has been a serious area of concern in their transition back to civilian life  According to the Department of Labor  the unemployment rate among 20 24 year olds is consistently higher than the rate among non veterans of the same age  Senator Murray has worked to address this issue in her Employment and Workplace Safety Committee and through veteran employment events she has hosted in Washington state  Our nation s veterans have all the character necessary to succeed in the working world  they are disciplined team players who have proven that they can perform under pressure  Murray said during today s hearing  All they need is someone to provide a helping hand  We need to ensure that the VA  DoD  and DoL are there to give that support   Senator Murray heard from officials from the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   the Department of Defense  DoD   and the Department of Labor  DoL  on their efforts to help find veterans employment  She also heard from private sector organizations that are working to match employers with veterans and from veterans who have personally struggled to find employment after returning home  of any of these witnesses    The following is Senator Murray s opening statement  as prepared  from today s hearing     Thank you Mr  Chairman  I would like to thank you and Ranking Member Craig for holding this hearing on the employment benefits provided to our men and women in uniform as they transition from the military to civilian life     I want to start by saying that as Chairman of the Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee  I am glad that we are holding this hearing today  I have worked to explore this issue in my own committee and have spoken with many of the men and women who are facing employment challenges when they return home  Those hearings and conversations have allowed me to get an idea of some of our most critical needs    Civilian and veteran organizations need to work together to reach out to returning soldiers  Across our nation we have trained professionals that are willing and able to serve returning service members but they face barriers in accessing information about these soldiers directly  We need to think creatively about connecting these providers with soldiers who need their help        2  We need to provide job information and resources at a better time  Soldiers returning from war have so much on their mind while demobilizing  We need to find a better way to communicate important job information to them at a time when they are not already overburdened         3  We need to address the challenges small business owners face in hiring vets  Because of unpredictable tours of duty  small business owners bear the high cost of turnover and training when soldiers deploy  Tax credits to help cover these costs would help them do the right thing and employ soldiers and veterans        4  We need to ensure that the skills service members are learning in the field are transferable to the jobs they seek when they return home  I have spoken with returning service members whose only restrictions in performing a comparable job to one they performed in the military is learning the language of that trade here at home  We need to help provide them with that critical link         5  Finally  we need to strengthen training and education support  Returning soldiers often need salary and benefits during a transitional year to help support their families pursue career training  The credits they receive for this training need to be transferable and recognizable   In Washington state  I m proud to say that we are moving proactively toward addressing some of these needs  Our Employment Security Commissioner has worked tirelessly to promote the Hire A Vet Challenge  an initiative that encourages businesses to hire returning National Guard and Reservists  Last year  the State legislature created the Veterans Innovation Program board to work with Washington s Department of Veteran Affairs in meeting the needs of returning Reservists and National Guard members  And I am sure there are similar efforts happening in states all across the country     Our nation s veterans have all the character necessary to succeed in the working world  they are disciplined team players who have proven that they can perform under pressure  All they need is someone to provide a helping hand  We need to ensure that the VA  DoD and DoL are there to give that support  Whether it is assistance in basic job skills  access to information and services  support for businesses who want to hire veterans  or a safety net during their transition  the federal government needs to step up to the plate     Our men and women who are fighting overseas face incredibly dangerous and stressful situations on the battlefield  It is imperative that we not add to the stress by burdening them with worries about their job  their business  or their spouse and children  We know that helping our service members transition into civilian life is a fundamental cost of war    As I have said countless times  I believe how we treat our veterans when they come home is an indication of the character of our nation  We have to find a way to make the transition from soldier to citizen a smoother one     Thank you Mr  Chairman
