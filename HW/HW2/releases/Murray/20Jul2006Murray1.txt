million in federal defense work for Washington state companies in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill   Murray  who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee  voted for the Senate bill today at a meeting of the full committee   The full Senate is expected to take up the bill later this month          Washington state companies are creating innovative products to help our military men and women complete their missions safely and successfully   Murray said   I m proud to provide the funding that will support our troops in the field and create more than 500 high skill  high wage here at home  Washington state companies are already seeing their technologies save lives in Iraq and Afghanistan  With this funding  we ll be able to do even more to bring more of our soldiers  sailors and airmen home safely to their families         The following Washington state projects received funding in the Senate FY 2007 Defense Appropriations bill   High Pressure Microwave Processing for Meals Ready to Eat  MRE   Avure Technologies Inc   Kent  and Washington State University  Pullman   6 million   The Combat Feeding Directorate  U S  Army Soldier Systems Center  in partnership with a consortium of industry and academic partners  develops advanced food preservation and processing technologies to improve combat ration quality and variety  and extend their shelf life for improved supply chain management  The use of high hydrostatic pressure  Avure  and microwave sterilization  WSU  has proven to be a very effective means of controlling spoilage and disease causing microorganisms   The processes have minimal effects on food chemistry compared to those imparted by traditional food processing methods such as canning  which exposes foods to high temperatures for extended periods of time  High pressure and microwave sterilized foods meet consumer demands for minimally processed  additive free foods with fresh like characteristics while providing the ultimate in safety   Successful transition of this technology will permit the introduction of extended shelf life  stable food products in support of the Department of Defense goals of providing fresher  high quality food to deployed forces worldwide         Air Force Weather Systems  Coastal Environmental Systems  Seattle   6 million                                                   The Air Force is currently purchasing weather stations built by Coastal Environmental Systems in order to replace obsolete  broken or inaccurate instrumentation at U S  Air Force bases worldwide   However  the original requirement for 199 stations has been limited to 114 due to funding   These Weather Stations are necessary to land pilots and aircraft safely at all times and under all weather conditions by providing a much more accurate picture of weather conditions at the most crucial points of flight  during take off and landing  when flight crews depend most on accurate weather data   This funding will allow the Air Force to purchase approximately 20 additional FMQ 19 weather stations      Lightweight Multi purpose Laser  nLight Corporation  Vancouver   6 million   This program will develop and demonstrate an efficient and directly eye safe laser technology that can be quickly inserted into military platforms   Currently  military laser systems operated at a wavelength near one micron are used for a broad range of missions  including range finding  target designation  illumination and imaging  and weapons systems   At this wavelength  the laser power required to accomplish these missions often precludes the possibility of eye safe operation   This program will mature the appropriate laser technology and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling a new class of eye safe military lasers      Intelligent Graphic Data Distribution Training   Dimension 4  Bremerton   5 million   This tool allows the Navy to retrieve information such as ship configuration data  job requirements  crewmember skill sets and a technical data repository   It will create work packages that are tailored to specific tasks and crewmember skills   This effort will significantly increase readiness by shortening the time required to address shipboard maintenance      Real Time Weight and Balance Measurement System for C 130s  Crane Aerospace  Lynnwood   4 5 million   This project will allow the Air Force to install onboard weights and balance system that can improve aircraft safety  dispatch speed and cost savings by measuring the actual aircraft weight and center of gravity of an aircraft  Current dispatching procedures   calculate    the aircraft weight based on historical survey data such as average troop weight  Investigators have determined that inaccurate weight assumptions had led to overloaded aircraft and military airplane crashes  This funding will allow Crane Aerospace to complete the development and to qualify the Real Time Measurement Weight and Balance system for the C 130 fleet      Long Shelf Life Fruits and Vegetables for Military Rations   Arcadia Biosciences  formerly Anawah  Inc    Seattle   3 million    This project will help our troops in the field get fresh tomatoes  lettuce and other produce  especially in areas where soldiers can t get frequent food deliveries  This funding will allow the company to continue its development of non genetically modified organism varieties of tomato and lettuce with at least 30 days of fresh shelf life  and to establish and evaluate variant populations of bell pepper  cantaloupe and strawberry using their advanced molecular biology techniques  This will improve nutrition for soldiers on the frontlines and improved morale of sailors  soldiers and marines deployed on ships  submarines or in field environment where provisioning is infrequent      Individual Water Purification System  Cascade Designs  Seattle   3 million   This project will allow the Marine Corps to purchase and field approximately 20 000 individual water purifier system  IWPS   developed and manufactured by Cascade Designs  Conventional water purification systems use chlorine  iodine pills or pump filtration devices that are costly and heavy  and produce water with bad taste and residual untreated contaminants  This new system is essentially integrated into a   camel back    water carrying device  and produces drinking water that meets Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  standards within 30 minutes  This technology was field tested by the Marine Corps in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom  and was shown to offer safe  palatable drinking water in a lightweight  reduced footprint      ScanEagle Advanced Concepts Development                                   Insitu  Bingen   3 million    The ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV  has been successful as a low cost  small  tactical platform for collecting intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance imagery for the U S  Marine Corps in Iraq  Senator Murray previously provided funding for the U S  Marine Corps to purchase ScanEagle UAVs  which have been used to fly very low and close to roads and other threat areas searching for Improvised Explosive Devices  Military commanders now want to expand the role of this class of UAV making ScanEagle the only small UAV supporting all four services  a true joint asset   This funding would allow the Air Force to provide further testing that will fully exploit ScanEagle capabilities      Warfighter Pocket XP Project   Itronix  General Dynamics   Spokane   3 million   Current commercially available computers are bulky  too slow  require too much battery power and are often incompatible with various military application requirements  This project will allow the Department of Defense to field approximately 500 extremely durable  ultra small  lightweight  personal   hand top    computers  developed by Vulcan  Inc  of Seattle and Itronix Corp  of Spokane  that meet both the current needs outlined in the DOD programs but also future needs as network computing evolves within the US military forces      Mounted Warrior Command and Control Heads Up Display  Microvision  Bothell   3 million   The Mounted Warrior Command and Control Head Up Display  C2HUD   an integral part of the Mounted Warrior system  will increase force protection by enablling vehicle crewmen to view non see through tactical maps and vehicle sensors and when complete  return to a see through mode of operation   Additionally  with a fused night vision capability  soldiers will need a single device on helmet  whether day or night in order to view the immediate environment   Fusing night vision capability with tactical displays provides a significant leap in capability from current operations   The requested funding is essential to fully develop the electronic occluder and a night vision capability into a color Helmet Mounted Display      SEAFOX Remote Controlled Surface Vessel  Northwind Marine  Seattle   3 million   The SEAFOX unmanned  remote controlled  surface vehicle was developed under contract with the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center  Two prototypes were built and extensive U S  Navy testing and proof of concept demonstrations with various payload mission packages showed that the vehicle is effective for anti terrorism force protection activities such as area patrol  route survey  vessel interrogation and escort  swimmer detection  underwater survey of piers and docks  bottom surveys  operational test range monitoring and clearance  Consequently  SEAFOX USV was selected in summer 2005 for immediate deployment by the office of the Chief of Naval Operations to provide added capability and safety for U S  Navy maritime interdiction operations   Other SEAFOX vehicles with a variety of mission packages have been fielded for security uses in direct response to operational commanders   needs worldwide   This request would fund the construction of 5 vehicles      Navy Boat Lifts  Sunstream Corporation  Kent   3 million   The Navy has now identified the need for 143 boat lifts to prevent premature aging of the boat inventory and optimize boat supportability   This request would purchase approximately 75 advanced boat lifts for the Navy  which will expand boat life cycles and provide easy boat access  reduce maintenance costs  and permit safe docking and boarding by Navy personnel   In order to meet the increasingly challenging boat missions that are required of Special Operations units and fleet wide Navy personnel  these advanced lifts will be configured to support multiple missions at multiple commands  which will expand capability and provide the greatest possible savings Navy wide        Floating Area Network  Mobilisa  Port Townsend   2 million   Currently  the U S  Navy uses satellite systems to communicate between ships at sea  even if ships are only a few miles apart  This typically includes relaying messages through a network operations center  NOC  and using satellites that are over tasked  the result being communication links with limited access and limited bandwidth  This project will allow Mobilisa to install secure  wireless communications equipment to connect six ships in a battle group so that they are able to communicate wirelessly  point to point  without satellite relay  at high bandwidth speeds of greater than 10Mbps  Advanced networking software is required to allow the Floating Area Network to adapt to the constantly changing topology of the network  Senator Murray previously provided funding to allow the Washington State Ferries to pilot test this technology  These funds will complete development of the FAN system by making the technology more rugged and to certify the technology with the Navy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST   as well as install FAN aboard Navy vessels to demonstrate in a live Intra Battle Group communications exercise  It is expected that this technology will improve the battle group  s communication capabilities over 100 fold       P3 Micro Power Devices  Washington State University  Pullman   2 million   Small scale power devices are essential for the development of next generation command  control  communication  computing and intelligence  C4I  sensors  Scientists at Washington State University will use this funding to complete development of the Palouse piezoelectric power  P3  micro power devices that   harvest    mechanical vibration to generate electrical power and possess a power density well beyond that available from conventional batteries  With the ability to operate from the combustion of a variety of fuels  or from waste heat  the P3 micro power source is an attractive choice for commercial products such as cell phones  Global Positioning System  GPS  receivers  radios  personal digital assistants  PDAs   laptop computers and other portable electronic devices      Marine Corps Flame Resistant Contact Glove   Outdoor Research  Seattle   1 5 million   Most current clothing and glove systems used by Marine Air Ground Task Forces employ textiles and designs consistent with 1960  s technology   Unfortunately  the emerging threat of improvised explosive devices  IED  s  necessitates that gloves worn by Marines be constructed to withstand the secondary effects of explosives and electrical traps  specifically flame and heat threats   This funding will allow Outdoor Research to manufacture and provide the U S  Marine Corps with approximately 10 000 pair of new gloves that offer improved tactility  warmth to weight ratio  and flame resistance  This technology offers substantial advancements that will meet the increasing demands on the military      Braided Rope for U S  Navy Ship Salvage   Puget Sound Rope  Anacortes   1 million   For many years the U S  Navy Emergency Ship Salvage Material System  ESSM  has used only one type of rope for lifting  mooring and rigging during salvage operations  This project will allow the Navy test and evaluate the performance of twelve strand braided rope that is   torque balanced     does not twist  and not susceptible to   hockling     forming loops and kinks   This twelve strand braided rope can be easily spliced without distorting or damaging its structure  thus allowing any length of rope to be manufactured with uniform properties  This would allow the Navy to store bulk lengths long enough to reach full ocean depth
