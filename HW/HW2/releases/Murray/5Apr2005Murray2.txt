                                                                                News Release          Senator Murray Works to Help Women in Developing Nations by Ending the  Global Gag Rule     For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 5  2005     Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  stood up for women s access to healthcare around the world by speaking out against the Bush Administration s global gag rule   The policy  imposed by President Bush in January 2001  limits women s access to safe reproductive healthcare in the world s poorest countries         Murray spoke on the Senate floor in support of an amendment offered by Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA  to the pending State Department Reauthorization bill   A vote on the amendment is expected later today         Today  women around the world are being denied the care they need because of an ideological policy  and they are dying as a result   Murray said    We cannot tolerate that as Americans  and that s why I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer Amendment         Senator Murray s remarks on the Senate floor follow        Mr  President  I believe that women around the world should have access to safe healthcare  especially those who are struggling in some of the world s poorest nations   That is why I rise to support the Boxer Amendment   I want to thank Senator Boxer for standing up on an issue that affects women around the globe  and I m proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment         Mr  President  this is about ensuring women around the world have access to the healthcare they need especially reproductive healthcare   It doesn t get much attention  but in the developing world  complications from pregnancy  is one of the leading causes of death for women   It s up there with tuberculosis   According to the World Health Organization  more than half a million women die each year of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth   That is more than one woman dying every minute of every day   That is certainly a crisis        Now when there s a medical crisis    something that kills hundreds of thousands of people every year    we don t just stand by   We work to make things better   And in poor countries around the world  medical professionals and non governmental organizations are trying to making things better   They ve set up clinics   They re reaching out to poor communities  And they re opening the doors of access to women and families who desperately need healthcare        They are doing great work  but today their hands are tied   And even worse  their hands are tied because the Bush Administration has imposed its political ideology on the world   We cannot allow this undemocratic policy to deny women and their children healthcare and ultimately sentence them to die         As my colleagues know  when President George W  Bush took office in 2001  he signed an executive order known as the global gag rule   It denies U S  funds to any overseas health clinic unless it agrees not to use its own  private  non U S  funds for anything related to abortion          If you re a medical professional living in an impoverished country trying to help people s lives  you are gagged from even talking about certain reproductive healthcare services        Mr  President  we wouldn t stand for that in the United States   We know how important the doctor patient relationship is   When we go to a doctor  we want to know that the doctor is giving us all the advice we need    not holding something back because of a gag rule   But that s exactly what the global gag rule forces on women in poor countries around the world  and that s wrong        Mr  President  I m not going to go into detail on all of the reasons why this gag rule is wrong  but let me mention a few    The gag rule undermines reproductive healthcare   The gag rule hurts our efforts to prevent HIV and AIDS   The gag rule limits access to contraceptives   The gag rule places limits on women and doctors that we would never accept here in the United States        But here s the bottom line   This is about protecting women s lives   Today  women around the world are being denied the care they need because of an ideological policy  and they are dying as a result   We cannot tolerate that as Americans  and that s why I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer Amendment
