Murray  D WA  helped pass the 2007 Farm Bill  which will provide much needed help for Washington states farmers  This is the best farm bill in years for Washington state farmers  largely because of the  2 2 billion it includes to help farmers who grow fruits and vegetables  which are referred to in the bill as specialty crops  Washington ranks third in the nation for specialty crop production overall  It is first in the nation in the production of several individual specialty crops  including apples  red raspberries  sweet cherries  pears  and Concord grapes   Theres so much in this bill that will help all of Washingtons farmers  Im thrilled that for the first time the Farm Bill includes specialty crops in a comprehensive and meaningful way  said Senator Murray  Specialty crop growers contribute greatly to making agriculture Washingtons largest industry  Im pleased that our efforts to include specialty crops were successful  and that we were also able to ensure that a safety net for Washingtons wheat and pulse crop growers remains in place   The Farm Bill also contains important nutrition provisions to ensure that families and children receive the food assistance they need  The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 79 14  With its important increases in funding for nutrition programs  this bill will help low income Washingtonians struggling to put a full  nutritious meal on the table for their family each day  Murray said  More than half of the spending in this bill goes to improve and increase funds for nutrition programs  These programs help food banks provide

Portions of the Farm Bill reflect legislation introduced earlier this year in the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act  S  1160   which Murray co sponsored  Key provisions for Washington agricultural producers include a market loss assistance program for asparagus growers  and mandatory funding for the National Clean Plant Network  which will ensure safe  virus free plant materials are available

Nutrition Program  formerly the Food Stamp Program   Increased funding for the Food Stamp Program will strengthen the food purchasing power of low income Americans  The bill also eliminates the existing cap on child care costs that can be deducted for Food and Nutrition Program beneficiaries  This is especially important to low income recipients in Washington  which has the nations third highest cost of infant care and the fifth highest cost of preschool care  The bills additional funding for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable  Snack  program will dramatically expand the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables available to children in school  The Farm Bill also increases funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program  TEFAP  to help food banks  soup kitchens  and other providers
