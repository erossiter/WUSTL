                                                                                                  News Release          Republicans Block Transportation Funding as Americans Head to Highways and Runways for Thanksgiving Travel      For Immediate Release  Friday  November 16  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   Chairman of the Senate Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee today slammed the Senate Republican Leadership and President Bush for blocking critical transportation and housing dollars on the eve of the busiest travel season of the year  Unfortunately  the Grinch came early this year in the form of a Republican minority who put their loyalty to the President ahead of the safety of our travelers and the security of our homeowners  Murray said after the Senate Republican Leadership blocked the conference report from coming up for a vote  Amtrak is poised to serve 650 000 riders just this coming holiday weekend  And just yesterday  President Bush complained about runway congestion and airline delays  What he failed to say is that his budget proposed to slash funding for airport capacity and cut Amtrak subsidies so severely that the railroad would be forced into bankruptcy  Our bill restored every penny of those cuts  And that is why the Senate Republican Leadership is refusing to allow us to send it to the President  In addition to saying  no  to rebuilding the Minnesota bridge and ensuring the stability of Amtrak  Republicans refused to move ahead with millions in dollars for housing for the homeless  elderly and disabled  so much for the Thanksgiving spirit  The bill  which 88 members of the Senate have already agreed to  would provide    195 million to complete the reconstruction of the collapsed I 35W Minneapolis bridge as well as an additional  1 billion to help all 50 states conduct bridge inspections and rebuild or renovate their most deficient bridges   200 million to dramatically boost housing counseling and education efforts to help keep struggling mortgage holders in their homes  75 million for additional housing vouchers for our veterans  Just last week  it was revealed that one in every four homeless citizens are veterans  including veterans just returned from Iraq and Afghanistan   Senator Murray s full remarks on the need for Republicans to stop obstructing the Transportation Housing and Urban Development spending bill follow  Mr  President  we are about to begin one of the busiest travel seasons of the year  the week of our Thanksgiving holiday  The millions of Americans who will take to our nations roads  rails  and airways probably wont have the countrys transportation budget on their minds  But we had them in mind as we put together this bipartisan Transportation Housing appropriations bill and negotiated the Conference agreement before us today  Unfortunately  the Senate Republican Leadership has now formally blocked our ability to have a vote on this Conference agreement and move it to the White House  And that is shameful  Our Conference report invests in rebuilding our infrastructure and modernizing our safety systems  It spends the money needed to adequately staff our air traffic control towers and hire the safety inspectors for aircraft  pipelines  and railroads that are needed to protect us  It rejects misguided budget cuts proposed by the White House to slash the number of safety inspectors  underfund our highway needs  and throw Amtrak into bankruptcy  This bill also keeps faith with another American Thanksgiving tradition    giving back to those who are less fortunate  It rejects the Presidents proposals to slash housing funds for the elderly and the disabled and provides necessary increases to shelter the homeless and keep federally subsidized tenants in their homes  Finally  Mr  President  this holiday  millions of families will worry that they wont be able to keep their homes for another year  Millions are facing foreclosure on their homes in the coming months as their mortgage payments rise to unaffordable levels  This agreement helps address that crisis by targeting a quarter of a billion dollars to ensure these families get counseling that will allow them to stay in their homes  We re working to stop the rising number of foreclosures and increasing despair among the millions of citizens who pursued the American dream of homeownership  Throughout this process  I have worked closely with a very able partner  my Ranking Member  Senator Bond of Missouri  We held numerous hearings together  We negotiated every line of a very complicated spending bill together  and we negotiated the details of a conference report with the House together  Senator Bond and I didn t agree on every issue or every funding level  but we continued to make compromises so that we could keep the team together press forward with our joint responsibilities  We were able to put together an Appropriations bill that was reported by our Committee without one dissenting vote  That bill passed the Senate with 88 votes  We then negotiated a Conference agreement that earned the signature of every single conferee  on both sides of the aisle  on both sides of Capitol  I m so proud of how well we were able to work together to get this important bill done  This is truly a bipartisan bill  Sadly  President Bush threatened to veto this agreement    despite the years of neglect it seeks to reverse    and even though it has strong bipartisan support  The President says he opposes this bill because it spends about  3 billion more than the levels he requested for these programs back in February  Mr  President  I think its unconscionable that he wants to spend  196 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  in this year alone  Yet he refuses to invest just  3 billion on some of the basic needs of every American  transportation and housing  And Mr  President  what s even worse is that instead of standing up for programs they believe in    that they supported already    the Republican Leadership here in the Senate has decided to stand in the way in order to protect President Bush from having to veto these important projects  The Senate Republican Leadership put their loyalty to this failed presidency above all the good this bill can do    and above the fact that 88 members of the Senate supported it  Clearly  when the Senate Republican Leadership calls for bipartisanship    as they have several times since they became the Minority    they don t necessarily mean it  When we have a truly bipartisan agreement    they might still kill it just to score a political point  And that is a tragedy for the Senate and for Americans  So  Mr  President  I think its important to point out why this bill spends more than the Presidents request  Its because all the conferees  Democrats and Republicans alike refused to let our bridges and highways crumble  They refused to go into the busiest travel week of the year by slashing funding for airports and railways  They refused to let our families lose their homes without an opportunity to work with their lender and professional counselors to keep it  And they refused to let our returning heroes lie homeless on the street in need of shelter and mental health services  Now Mr  President  let me share some examples of why this bill should move forward  Mr  President  we have all heard the stories this year about record flight delays that have disrupted peoples travel plans across the country  Customer service complaints are at an all time high  Our airports and runways are now more congested than they have ever been  And that is on a normal non holiday week  some 27 million Americans will take to the airways this Thanksgiving  Mr  President  we also face a huge challenge as we work to replace the thousands of air traffic controllers and safety inspectors who are scheduled to retire over the next several years  The void they will leave threatens the safety and reliability of our airlines  Many of our controllers are still using equipment that is two decades old or older  But if the President had his way  we would cut funding to modernize our air traffic control system by more than  50 million  Well  Mr  President  not one Democratic or Republican conferee on our bill stood up for the Presidents dramatic cuts in airport investment  And no one agreed that the cutting our investment in modernized equipment was a good idea  The President just doesnt get it  Just yesterday  he voiced concern about flight delays even as he continued to threaten to veto this bill  Only someone who flies on Air Force One could make those two statements at the same time  Travelers will have President Bush and the Senate Republican Leadership to thank as they wait at the gate and on the runway  this holiday weekend  Mr  President  the next is train travel  This coming Wednesday  the day before Thanksgiving  more than 125 000 Americans will use the Amtrak system in just one day  Our overcrowded highways and runways arent able to absorb those travelers  We have to keep up our investments in options like Amtrak  which will cut down on highway congestion and air pollution caused by cars stalled in traffic  Yet the President proposed to decimate Amtraks funding  which would have thrown the railroad into certain bankruptcy  Well  Mr  President  all the conferees  House and Senate  Democrats and Republicans  refused to slash funding for Amtrak by nearly 40 percent  or almost  500 million  Not one wanted to lose our nations passenger rail service to the Presidents misguided budget priorities  Thirdly  Mr  President  we agreed to spend more than the President requested because the conferees recognized that the millions of holiday travelers who take to the highways next week will cross over 600 000 bridges that the Federal Highway Administration has rated as Deficient  Mr  President  80 000 of those bridges have been deemed to be functionally obsolete  meaning they dont meet todays design standards for safety  and theyre handling traffic far beyond what they are designed for  These are not just remote bridges in sparse parts of the country  either  6 000 of those deficient bridges are on the National Highway System  the core network of highways that connect our major cities and towns  Mr  President  we still have a tragic reminder of the cost of neglecting our highways and bridges  In the City of Minneapolis  tens of thousands of Thanksgiving travelers will be required to take alternative routes due to the collapse of Interstate 35W bridge  This Conference report includes  195 million to help complete the reconstruction of the I 35W bridge  It also includes additional spending authority of  1 billion dollars from the Highway Trust Fund to allow all 50 states to beef up bridge inspections and rebuild or renovate their most deficient bridges  That additional spending authority came about as a result of my amendment  which passed on the floor back in early September  I want to thank the many Republican Senators who supported me on that vote  Now the Presidents budget was formulated and delivered to Congress before the Minneapolis tragedy  But I just think its wrong that the President hasnt altered his budget priorities one penny in the wake of that reality  Both sides of the aisle in Congress have heard the wake up call on the need to address our most critical  deteriorating infrastructure  Yet the President would rather spend  196 billion on the war than help our communities ensure their safety  Mr  President  our conference agreement also helps protect homeowners who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads  It spends more than the Presidents request because the conferees  Democrats and Republicans alike  didnt hide from the sub prime mortgage crisis that is threatening to destroy many middle income communities across the nation  In the next two quarters  more than two million homeowners throughout the nation will see their mortgage payments rise  Many of them will struggle or fail to meet these new  higher payments  We are now seeing communities where every other home  or every third home  is being abandoned by homeowners who cant meet their payments  Whole communities are having their economic under pinnings ripped from beneath them  Many of these near ghost towns have been concentrated in the industrial Midwest  But Senators must know  if something isnt done to address this crisis soon  we will find these communities all across the country  Our Conference agreement includes a special infusion of  200 million to boost housing counseling efforts to help keep struggling mortgage holders in their homes  Its the same level that was included in the Senate version of the bill  a 500 percent increase over the current level  And rather than send this additional funding into the HUD bureaucracy  we have sent it out for competitive grants through the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation  a Federally chartered corporation that specializes in this area  Mr  President  Im especially proud that this agreement helps protect our veterans  who  tragically  now make up a quarter of the homeless population  Veterans Day just passed  In the speech I delivered in my home state  I said we ought to be asking what we can do  as a community  a state  and a nation  for our veterans  Mr  President the conferees on our Transportation Housing bill  Democrats and Republicans alike  refused to turn their back on the realities facing our returning heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan and all past conflicts  So our bill took one step in the right direction for our veterans  It includes  75 million for additional housing vouchers  which provide housing assistance through HUD  as well as supportive services through the VA to help get our heroes back on their feet  Mr  President  this isnt the first year the President has tried to underfund our nations housing and transportation system  The cuts this Congress refused to adopt this year are the very same reckless cuts proposed by the Bush Administration in 2007  in 2006  in 2005  and every other year  The President has been proposing to slash funding for the CDBG Program  for elderly and disabled housing  for Amtrak  and for airports  year  after year  after year  This year was no different  and Congress responded the same way  The only difference between this year and prior years is that this year President Bush is threatening to veto the bill  And the Senate Republican Leadership is determined to protect him from having to make that hard decision  But the American people dont care about party politics  They care about whether their bridges are safe enough to travel on  They care about whether they will have to sit for hours in the airport because their flights were delayed  They care  when theyre sitting on a train platform  about whether the train is actually going to arrive  And they care about our homeless veterans  and the need to keep struggling mortgage holders in their homes  Our Conference Committee addressed those realities head on and came up with a bipartisan solution  I only wish the Senate Republican Leadership had these concerns of the American people on their minds rather than their need to protect a misguided President who is so out of touch with the American people  Mr  President  we learned today where bipartisanship begins and ends for the Senate Republican Leadership  It begins with empty  insincere rhetoric on the Senate floor  And it ends when it comes to the need to protect President Bush  When the American people wonder why important legislation is not passing out of the Senate  they should look at this example  One where the Senate Republican Leadership is blocking progress on a bill that bears the signature of every Republican that worked on it    one where the needs of the American people are thrown out the window in favor of the need to protect a failed President
