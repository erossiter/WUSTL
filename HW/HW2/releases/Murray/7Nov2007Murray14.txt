Ensure Americans Have Access to Lifesaving Care Bill would provide much needed support for Harboview Medical Center which is the only level I trauma center serving Washington  Alaska  Montana  and Idaho     Provides federal support for trauma centers struggling with the increased cost of charity care    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 7  2007         Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Murray  D WA  introduced the National Trauma Care Stabilization Act which provides federal grants for trauma care centers across the nation that are struggling and often closing their doors because of the increased costs of providing health care and uncompensated charity care  Trauma can happen at any time and to anyone  whether it s a family in a highway crash  a gunshot victim  or a construction worker in an accident  trauma centers must be available to provide immediate care  Senator Murray said at a press conference announcing the bill  My bill will ensure that increased health care costs and charity care doesnt block access to the trauma care Americans rely on  This bill also ensures that by opening the doors of trauma care to all we are not causing the doors of some facilities to close for good  Because accidents don t discriminate among rich and poor and neither should our trauma care centers  David Jaffe  Chairman of the National Foundation for Trauma Care Board commented that  We must do whatever possible to avoid further downgrades or closures of our nations trauma centers and this legislation goes a long way towards helping to stabilize the situation  The National Trauma Center Stabilization Act will provide assistance for economically distressed trauma centers by reauthorizing federal funding for centers facing the highest uncompensated costs  provide emergency funding to help prevent trauma center closures or downgrades  and provide financial support for core mission services  The bi partisan bill is co sponsored by Senator Johnny Isakson  R OK   Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson  R TX   Harborview  Crisis in the Northwest  The crisis in trauma care funding is a particularly urgent problem in the Northwest where Harborview Medical Center has the only level one trauma center serving four states  Washington  Alaska  Montana  and Idaho  Harborview has the highest occupancy rate of any hospital in the region  has logged more than 81 000 emergency department visits  and had over  110 million in charity care last year  which represents 21  of their total expenditures  The funding in the bill will be provided to trauma centers using three different grants  Types of Grants  Substantial Uncompensated Care Grants  These grants will assist those trauma centers with the highest levels of charity care to help defray some of their uncompensated costs and help to prevent further closures or downgrades of trauma levels  Core Mission Grants These grants support the costs associated with day to day running of a trauma center including patient stabilization and transfer  trauma related medical education  and coordination with other trauma centers and the state trauma system  Emergency Grants  These grants provide emergency relief to trauma centers at risk of closing or to remaining trauma centers in a region where another trauma center has closed or downgraded levels   Grant Information   Total Grant Amounts  There is  100 million authorized for the program in Fiscal Year 2009 and such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2010 2014  Grants Lengths  Grants will be for three years and may be extended for an additional year as long as qualifying conditions are met  Individual Grant Amounts  Individual grants may not exceed  2 000 000 nor exceed the level of uncompensated care provided by the trauma center in its emergency department   Senator Murray s remarks from today s press conference follow  Trauma is the leading cause of death for children and adults under the age of 34  and kills more Americans than stroke and AIDS combined  Trauma can happen at any time and to anyone  whether it s a family in a highway crash  a gunshot victim or a construction worker who falls on a work site  trauma centers must be available to provide care  Getting a trauma victim to a trauma center right away is the first step in saving his or her life  What doctors call the golden hour is the first 60 minutes after a traumatic injury  It is widely believed that the victims chances of survival are greatest if he or she receives critical and specialized trauma care within that time  Trauma centers provide care to all trauma victims regardless of their ability to pay  When a trauma patient cannot afford treatment  the trauma center absorbs the cost of care  And this is putting many trauma centers at serious risk  In fact  the National Trauma Care Foundation estimates that trauma centers collectively face  230 million each year in losses for treating victims who are either uninsured or whose care is reimbursed well below the cost of providing care  So while our trauma care centers mend our country s most critically injured  they  themselves  are hemorrhaging funding  Since 2000     twenty hospitals have closed their trauma centers and six have downgraded one or two levels  These closures have real consequences for real Americans  Ask yourselves  what would it be like if your local fire station or police station was suddenly shut down  Or if you called 911 and nobody came  Unfortunately  this is just what it s like if you or a family member is a trauma victim and your local trauma center has been shut down  Terrorism And this issue is also critical in the current age of terrorism and bioterrorism  After September 11th  St  Vincent s Trauma Care Center in New York City saw 842 patients  most in the first two hours after the attacks  And trauma care centers played a critical role last April after the Virginia Tech shootings  What happens if there is another catastrophic event and nowhere to seek care  What Bill Does My bill will ensure that the strain of increased costs and charity care doesn t block the trauma care Americans rely on  It will ensure that by opening the doors of trauma care to all we are not causing the doors of some facilities to close for good  My bill will provide critical funding to help stabilize existing trauma centers  particularly those with the highest levels of charity care and will help ensure that trauma centers continue to be there for all who need life saving care  regardless of their ability to pay  Because accidents don t discriminate among rich and poor and neither should our trauma care centers  Harborview This issue hits home for me  because it is a particularly urgent problem in the Northwest where Harborview Medical Center has the only level one trauma center serving four states  Washington  Alaska  Montana  and Idaho  This means that about one fourth of the entire land mass of the United States is currently being covered by ONE level one trauma care center  From Spokane  to Boise  to Billings and everywhere in between  our region relies on Harborview when residents are faced with life threatening injuries  This means that Harborview has the highest occupancy rate of any hospital in the region  has logged more than 81 000 emergency department visits  and had over  110 million in charity care last year  which represents 21  of their total expenditures  We can t afford to let it continue to lose the funding it desperately needs to serve our region  I was reminded yesterday of the importance of trauma centers access  particularly at Harborview  when I read the story of a young women who recently received care there  This young women was on her way home from a party three years ago when she was involved in a terrible car wreck  She was found seven days after the accident in a ravine next to the road  She was brought to Harborview where she received the capable  competent care that level one trauma care facilities are know for  She recovered from her horrible accident and is thriving today thanks to the doctors and nurses that took care of her  She described her experience by saying that she must have had angles watching over her  It is simply unconscionable that we would ever let these doctors  nurses  and critical facilities suffer from a lack of federal support
