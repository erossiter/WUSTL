2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  announced critical federal funding for Tri Cities priorities in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill  Due to the threat of Presidential vetoes of Americas domestic spending priorities  Congress combined several appropriations bills into one large Omnibus bill  which should pass both houses this week  The Omnibus package contains critical funding for national needs like transportation  homeland security  education  labor and health  This federal support is the seed money that helps our communities grow  said Senator Murray  I am proud to have helped steer this funding to community supported projects here at home  I work everyday to ensure that even though our state s residents are 2 500 miles from D C   their needs are up front and center  At a time when domestic and local needs are too often being neglected  these worthy projects are getting the support they deserve   This spending bill is expected to be cleared by the U S  House of Representatives tonight and sent to the Senate tomorrow  Below are the projects included for the Tri Cities

used for the Big Pasco Industrial Center Intermodal Rail Hub Development Project  The loss of barge service in Portland has forced the Port of Pasco to transform its freight center away from barge service and expand their rail and truck infrastructure  This project will install 3 400 feet of new rail and rehabilitate 18 500 feet of existing rail to handle the current and expected volumes of intermodal and mixed source freight coming to the Port of Pasco  This funding will complete Phase 4 of the project    Benton Franklin Transit  BFT    686 000  Senator Murray has included this funding for the BFT Vehicle Fleet Expansion and Modernization Project  Many of the vehicles in the current fleet at BFT have gone beyond their FTA rated life and are adding operating costs due to increased maintenance needs  Safety concerns are also starting to arise with some of the vehicles  BFT is the sole provider of public transportation in the Tri Cities and mid Columbia region and has experienced ridership growth of 10 percent since 2006  Interior Projects City of West Richland    295 320  The City of West Richland is in the third and final phase to expand the North Waste Water Treatment Plant  NWWTP  to handle redirected wastewater flow from a non compliant sewer lagoon and to comply with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit  NPDEP   Currently the NWWTP is operating at 85 percent capacity  and the city must immediately expand the facility to meet its NPDEP requirements  Upon completion of this expansion  West Richland will have adequate wastewater treatment capacity for the next twenty years
