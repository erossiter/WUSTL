the High Rate of MS Among Veterans    Wins Endorsement of MSVETS and National Gulf War Resource Center     Murray s Legislation Lifts the VA s Arbitrary 7 year Limit to Qualify for Automatic VA Benefits    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  December 20  2005     Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  introduced new legislation to help more veterans who have Multiple Sclerosis  MS  qualify for disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA    A growing number of veterans from the first Gulf War are now developing symptoms of MS  but they often face an uphill battle in obtaining disability benefits from the VA         Too many veterans with MS are having trouble getting the care and the benefits they deserve   Murray said    These men and women served our nation bravely  and they should not be denied care because of arbitrary rules   My bill will ensure that veterans get the care they have earned no matter when their symptoms emerge   It will provide relief for veterans of the first Gulf War and will ensure adequate care for current service members who may develop MS in the future         Under current law  veterans have seven years after being honorably discharged to connect their MS to their military service   Unfortunately  many veterans don t develop the symptoms of MS until after seven years  making them ineligible for automatic disability benefits from the Veterans Administration   These veterans must then go through a lengthy appeals process to prove that their disability is service connected        Senator Murray s bill is supported by a number of organizations that represent veterans with MS  including the National Gulf War Resource Center  NGWRC  and MS Vets           Senator Murray s bill validates the significant health care crisis of veterans who served our nation during the Persian Gulf War   said Julie Mock  President of NGWRC and a veteran of the first Gulf War who has MS    Approximately 500 Persian Gulf War veterans have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with service connections presumably related to exposures received during the Gulf War  Many more veterans are suffering the debilitating symptoms of MS but have yet to have their illnesses properly diagnosed with appropriate and necessary medical tests            All of us at MSVETS would like to thank Senator Murray for introducing the MS Bill   said Ed Butler  co founder of MSVETS and a board member of NGWRC    We applaud her efforts to bring much needed relief and compensation to hundreds of Gulf War Veterans and their families that have fallen through the cracks of the VA s seven year presumptive rule for service connecting Multiple Sclerosis         In September 2005  the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that    of the 700 000 U S  troops who served  in Iraq  in 1991  a disproportionate number experienced serious neurological disorders    Whereas nationally  1 in 700 people suffers from MS   1    the Post Intelligencer reports that 3 in 36  8   soldiers who served near Julie Mock s battalion in Iraq have been diagnosed with MS  and one is suffering from an undiagnosed condition        Background information on veterans benefits  MS  and Senator Murray s bill  follows    WHAT DOES SENATOR MURRAY S BILL DO     The bill would remove the seven year limitation for veterans trying to gain service connected status for their multiple sclerosis   This legislation would ensure that a person diagnosed seven years and one day after their honorable discharge from the U S  military will still get access to the VA treatment they need   Some veterans with MS have difficulty receiving care since the MS is not seen as service related   Veterans with MS should not be penalized because their symptoms were diagnosed more than 7 years after separation   Scientists aren  t 100  certain whether exposure to combat stress  experimental vaccines  toxins released from oil well fires  sarin from the destruction of weapons caches  pesticides  pyridostigmine bromide pills  to protect against nerve gas   or some combination of any of these causes Multiple Sclerosis   There is a general consensus that MS is higher among Gulf War veterans than the general population   This bill will help veterans access the care they need by making MS a presumptive disability  no matter when its symptoms emerge       WHAT IS A PRESUMPTIVE DISABILITY     Sometimes veterans return from military service with physical and mental conditions that the VA presumes are linked to military service   This means that science hasn  t been able to connect a disease with service without a doubt  but there is sound scientific evidence that suggests there is a connection between exposures veterans experienced and a disease they developed later   The VA recognizes 41 chronic diseases for service connected benefits  and Multiple Sclerosis  MS  is one of those diseases    but only for 7 years after a veterans separated from service   This means that a veteran diagnosed with MS after the seven year window  has to prove their multiple sclerosis was directly connected to their service   Presumptive service connection is important to our veterans because it helps them qualify for the benefits they deserve so they can get appropriate treatment through the VA  s medical system         WHAT DOES SCIENCE SAY     Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease with symptoms ranging from clumsiness to blindness to numbness   The problem with the seven year limit for Multiple Sclerosis is that a person with MS may not show symptoms for years even though they have the disease   According to the VA  s MS Center of Excellence    there is considerable evidence that MS precedes symptoms in most patients  Most patients with MS have several lesions  shown on an  MRI at the time of their first symptom            WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AFFECTED VETERANS     Approximately 700 000 U S  service members were deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War   According to a 2000 VA study  Gulf veterans report being not as healthy as their military peers who were not deployed in the Persian Gulf   A September 2005 Seattle Post Intelligencer article reported that    of the 700 000 U S  troops who served there in 1991  a disproportionate number experienced serious neurological disorders  More than 65 percent have sought health care for service related ailments  Nearly 200 000 are receiving disability compensation    twice the rate as vets from World War II  Korea and Vietnam      Numbers of Persian Gulf War veterans diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis range  but according to the National Gulf War Resource Center    the rate of multiple sclerosis is rising among Gulf War veterans
