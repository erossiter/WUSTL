Demands a Change of Course in Iraq  Meets Needs of America s Troops and Veterans Emergency Spending legislation ensures that America s troops have what they need  Includes over  4 billion for the care of veterans and returning service members     Washington State to receive emergency funding for repairs to roads damaged by flooding  port security  and rural school funding    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 29  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  helped pass a  121 billion emergency supplemental spending bill that changes course in Iraq  ensures that service members who are there have the resources they need  and provides veterans and service members with increased funding for their care when they return home  The legislation was passed by a vote of 51 47  The bill will now be reconciled with the House passed version  President Bush has threatened to veto the legislation        Iraq   To change Iraq policy  the bill calls for the President to start redeploying troops from Iraq within 120 days and sets the goal of having most U S  troops out of Iraq by March 31  2008   The bill says that Congress supports the troops  says that circumstances have changed since the 2002 force authorization  sets benchmarks to be met by the Iraqi government  and says that U S  troops should not be policing a civil war          After four years and more than 3 000 American lives  it s time for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country   Our troops have done everything we ve asked them to do  and now it s time to start bringing them home   Murray said   This bill recognizes that it s going to take a political solution to solve Iraq s civil war     Caring for our Troops                              To support veterans and injured service members  the  including  1 76 billion for veterans programs and  2 5 billion for the Department of Defense  DoD   The funding will go toward programs and services that Senator Murray has worked to include in prior funding legislation including increased mental health care treatment  increased investment for the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   improvements to VA and DoD facilities  and additional claims processors to eliminate long waiting lines for benefits          For the last four years the Bush administration has conducted this war with little regard for the tremendous strains it is placing on the VA  our veterans and their families   Today  we are putting an end to their neglect   said Murray   The days of ignoring our troops as a cost of this war are over      This bill ensures that the lessons of Walter Reed are not forgotten    Murray added   We have a moral obligation to ensure that when our troops get back from the battlefront they are given first class care every step of the way      In the wake of a VA report that detailed dilapidated facilities across the country  Senator Murray also included language in the bill that  to Congress detailing facility deficiencies and the agency s plan to correct them       Emergency Flood Repairs   The emergency appropriations bill also included  in federal funding to help Washington state repair roads and highways that were damaged by record flooding in November 2006          Last year s record floods devastated communities and destroyed roads throughout the region   This funding will help communities recover and will help rebuild roads that are vital for transportation and public safety   Murray said       Port Security Funding   The legislation passed today also includes  to speed implementation of Senator Murray s landmark SAFE Ports Act  This funding will support cargo screening overseas  hire new Customs officers  establish new security measures across the country  and fully fund Port Security Grants       Last year  we enacted a comprehensive new cargo security system to protect our country from terror attacks  but the President has failed to fully fund it   We can t delay implementing the SAFE Ports Act  and that s why I fought for the funding it requires   Murray said      Secure Rural Schools    A five year extension of the Secure Rural Schools program that will keep forest communities from losing irreplaceable funds for schools  roads  and basic services was also included in today s legislation  Senator Murray  and other Northwest lawmakers  of this critical program        As a former educator  I am committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to learn  regardless of where they live   said Murray    By establishing a five year extension of this critical program  our amendment gives rural counties the peace of mind that comes with sustained support   Our rural communities can now move forward with plans to improve education  upgrade roads  and provide critical public services                                                                   Senator Murray spoke on the Senate floor immediately after the supplemental passed  Her comments follow         Mr  President  the Senate has just made a tremendous effort in moving forward to make sure that we support our troops in every sense of the word  and I want to thank all of my colleagues who voted aye in moving this forward         It is important to remember that this is an emergency supplemental bill  I ve heard others on the other side call it a war supplemental  It is true  indeed  that over the last several years the President has insisted that we pay for the war in Iraq on an emergency supplemental  but I would remind everyone that there are countless emergencies across this country  We  as Democrats  believe that it is critical that we address those concerns         whether it s our agricultural industry which has faced drought and severe weather        family farms who have been just inundated  unable to continue to provide the crops that each one of us rely on to feed our families        or whether it s our veterans who  Mr  President  as you well know as a member of the Veterans Committee  have been left behind time and time again        We all know of the Walter Reed issue that hit the paper several weeks ago  but this is not a new issue for many of us who have been following this for sometime  We have men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  who are coming home with severe Traumatic Brain Injury  They have been lost in the system  We are now starting the fifth year of this war  and to date  this President has not planned and supported funding to make sure that those men and women   whether it s Traumatic Brain Injury  whether they ve lost a limb  whether it s Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  or whether it s just coming home and being able to find another job  are being paid attention to  In this supplemental  we say we re going to pay for all costs of the war and certainly paying for those men and women who have paid the ultimate price and their families and taking care of them is part of that cost of war  And Mr  President  in this critical bill that Democrats voted for  we make sure that they are part of this        So we provide funding to repair the facilities at Walter Reed and also make sure that across the country  the Walter Reed syndrome is paid attention to and those veterans  facilities that we ve gotten the report from   1100 citings of mold on the walls  of bats that are not being gotten rid of in the VA facility  of peeling paint and mold on the walls  These kind of conditions are not ones that we  as Americans  should allow   Mr  President  in the supplemental bill we say we re going to take care of those and we require specifically that the VA come back to us in 60 days and identify every one of those 1100 citings and say whether they have fixed those facilities or not and if they have not  We want to know the exact costs because we re not going to let those men and women sit in those deplorable conditions         Mr  President  under this bill  we address the issue that has faced many of our soldiers who have returned home  who have Traumatic Brain Injury  Many of us saw the Bob Woodruff special several weeks ago  A reporter who was in Iraq suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury  He has struggled with his recovery and now did an amazing story on the news to let all of us know what is happening  not just to him but to men and women across this country as they come home         Mr  President  it is true that when a soldier is in a vehicle that is immediately affected by a blast  they often know that they have Traumatic Brain Injury  But it is also true that soldiers who may have been 100 or 150 yards away from that blast may also receive an injury and not know it         Mr  President  you and I both know that we talked to these men and women when we go home and their wives normally say us to  my husband can t remember where he put a piece of paper that I just handed to him  not knowing that he has been a victim of a blast and that injury has caused brain damage  We need to make sure that those soldiers are treated and are treated well and that we have the research and the capability to make sure they re not lost when they come home from service to this country  That funding is in this bill  and that funding was just voted on by a majority of Senators in this body  and we re going to keep working to make sure it s there         We also have in this bill money for Katrina  Mr  President  it was    it seems like a long time ago now that our country was stunned by the impact of Katrina and other hurricanes on the Gulf Coast  And Americans across the country said  what are we going to do  And we know that since that time there have been major stumbles  As Democrats  we are not stepping back from this  We believe that that is as much an emergency as what the President has asked for when he calls this an emergency supplemental and only focuses on Iraq  the war and the reconstruction effort there  We have a reconstruction effort that is absolutely critical here in this country  Democrats are standing up and saying  we re going to take responsibility and pay for it  There is  6 7 billion in here for the victims of      Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita  Mr  President  I believe that that is just as much critical emergency spending as the reconstruction dollars that the President has asked for in the supplemental  and that s why we are supporting this bill         This bill also addresses the issue of homeland security  Now  we have heard a lot of rhetoric  Mr  President  about homeland security and protecting our own  That it is an emergency  when it comes to the fact that that funding has not been there  Rhetoric protects no one here at home  We provide  2 billion  critical infrastructure dollars  for port security  mass transit security and explosive detection equipment at our airports  We are putting this into this bill because it has not yet been funded  and across this country Americans are at risk without the funding that we re putting in here         We ve heard a lot of talk on this floor over the last several days about extra pork barrel spending  Well  I would say to all of my colleagues that the  4 2 billion that is provided here for Americans  here at home  not for reconstruction efforts out in the world but for right here at home   4 2 billion         And Senator Boxer from California was out here just yesterday showing tremendous pictures of the agriculture disasters that have occurred in California  These are farmers who we rely on as Americans  who we rely on when we go to our groceries stores to be able to buy food to feed our families  If their farms are lost because they don t have the support after a disaster here at home that has affected them  every one us suffers  As Democrats  we say that is as much as an emergency as what we re putting into this bill for reconstruction in Iraq  We need to reconstruct here at home        Mr  President  on this side  we re playing catch up  For a number of years now we have seen emergency supplementals that are just war supplementals  We are saying across the country  as Democrats  we know we have to invest in ourselves  We have to invest in our future  We can only be as strong abroad as we are at home  And if we abandon our farmers and we abandon our children because they don t have healthcare    and there s SCHIP funding in this  and if we abandon our Gulf Coast residents  who have not yet been able to rebuild their homes and their infrastructure     And if we abandon our veterans when they come home and don t take care of them   And if we abandon our military personnel and don t provide the proper equipment and supplies  then we are not doing the job that we ve been sent here to do           We are proud of the supplemental bill that we re putting forward   In addition  we are taking a major step forward and saying that we are no longer going to idly stand by without any debates  without any discussion  without any consequences and move continuously to increase the War in Iraq  We have said it is time for us as a nation to tell the Iraqi people they need to stand up for themselves   That language is critical in this bill  Mr  President  we have worked with colleagues on all sides to put together what I think is a very important and critical bill for us here in America  here at home         We are going to work very hard now in conference with our House colleagues to come together with a bill to bring back to the Senate and send to the President   Now  I understand that the President is saying he s going to veto the bill  But I ask the President to listen to us and to sit down in a way that we re supposed to do here in Congress and work with us to find an agreement to move this bill forward that we can all agree to   Mr  President that is my hope for us here  It is my hope for Americans across this country   I m proud of the bill that we ve put before us   It addresses critical infrastructure investments here at home  And I hope that as we move forward in this process  in a few weeks we ll be able to have a conference committee bill that will be sent to the President that he will agree to and that we can then move on to the other issues facing this nation         Mr  President  I also want to take this opportunity to thank a number of people who worked on this bill  particularly Chairman Byrd  who has led us throughout this debate  I want to thank Senator Cochran  my ranking member  who s been out here on the floor during late  late nights working with us to help us keep an orderly process  I also want to thank all of our full committee staffs    Terry Sauvain  Bruce Evans  all of their staffs who have just worked countless hours  I m not sure they even went home last night before they came in this morning to help us work to the point that we are today  And I want to thank all the staff of all the appropriations subcommittees that have worked very  very hard on this bill   Mr  President  I also want to thank our floor staff because without their work and their support none of us would be able to complete the work they do  They are the silent workers who sit in front of us  and they have done a tremendous job to help get us through this process         At the end of the day  Mr  President  I want my colleagues and I want America to know  we in the majority here in the United States Senate believe that an emergency spending bill should be just that  There are numerous emergencies across this country  investing in Americans that have suffered tremendously  We are working hard to make sure their issues are finally addressed   And importantly  we are telling the President that our veterans and those who serve us in Iraq and Afghanistan  when they come home  their issues are going to be addressed as part of the cost to the war and as part of this emergency supplemental
