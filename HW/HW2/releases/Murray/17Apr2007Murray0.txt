                                                                      News Release          Murray Holds Hearing and Introduces Bill on Domestic Violence in the Workplace Hearing follows several instances of domestic violence attacks at workplaces across the country  Focuses on Murray legislation that  unlocks the doors  that trap victims in abusive situations    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 17  2007           Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  introduced legislation and chaired a hearing that focused on domestic violence in the workplace  Senator Murray called the hearing to examine ways to end domestic violence in the workplace and to address the economic barriers that trap victims in abusive relationships  The hearing of the Senate HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety was the first Senate hearing on domestic violence in the workplace in 5 years         Each day we get terrible reminders that domestic violence doesn t stay at home   It follows people into their workplace   posing safety  financial  and legal problems for victims  employers and other workers   Murray said   If we ignore it  the horrible toll of domestic violence in the workplace will continue unchecked   But if we confront it  I believe we can make progress        Today s hearing also coincided with Senator Murray s introduction of legislation that addresses financial security issues that sometimes keep victims in violent relationships   Her legislation  entitled The Survivors  Empowerment and Economic Security Act   S 1136          Allows victims to take time off from work without penalty in order to make court appearances  seek legal assistance  and get help with safety planning         Allows victims in every state access to unemployment benefits if they are fired or forced to leave their job because of abuse        Prohibits discrimination in employment and insurance based on domestic or sexual violence  to ensure that victims are never punished for their abusers  crimes        Strengthens the Family Violence Option in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  program  TANF   in order to protect some of the most economically vulnerable victims        The hearing follows several horrific instances of domestic violence spilling out into the workplace  including the campus shooting death of a 26 year old University of Washington employee and a shooting the following day at the CNN building in Atlanta  in which a hotel employee was also killed by an ex boyfriend         The hearing also featured compelling testimony from a series of witnesses familiar with the problems of domestic violence in the workplace  One witness was Yvette Cade  a survivor of a horrific example of domestic violence in the workplace that drew national attention in October 2005   about Cade s experience            I survived to tell the story of what happened to me in hopes that things could be different for other victims   said Yvette Cade  who suffered third degree burns over 60  of her body after her attack   I think that employers have a significant role to play in helping victims of domestic violence and sexual violence obtain and maintain their independence         Other witnesses included         Kathy Rodgers  president of Legal Momentum        Laura Fortman   Commissioner of the State of Maine Department of Labor        Sue Willman  Attorney  Spencer  Fane Britt   Browne        Murray described the challenges survivors of abuse face as a series of locked doors          A victim wants to leave an abuser  but she can t support herself so the economic door is locked   A survivor wants to go to court to get a protection order  but she can t get time off of work  so another door is locked   A survivor needs medical insurance or a job  but she s discriminated against   yet more locked doors   Murray said   My bill will unlock the doors that trap victims in abusive relationships   It will lift the economic barriers that allow abuse to continue      Senator Murray s full opening statement follows     We re here this morning to focus on domestic violence in the workplace  and before we begin I just want to say that yesterday a tragedy that is difficult to fathom took many young lives at Virginia Tech   So many families will never be the same  and as they mourn  we mourn with them    They re in our thoughts and in our prayers  Their loss hangs over everything we re doing in the Senate today and will for a very long time        We need to do everything we can here in Congress to save lives and prevent violence from reaching into our schools  homes and workplaces  and that s why we re holding this hearing today        Two weeks ago in my home state  a 26 year old woman who worked at the University of Washington was killed at her workplace by an ex boyfriend   She had filed a restraining order and warned friends and co workers to be on the lookout for him   The following day  at the CNN building in Atlanta  a hotel employee was killed by an ex boyfriend          Many other cases of abuse  stalking  harassment and homicide don t make the nightly news  but they do end lives  hurt businesses  and alarm communities   Each day we get terrible reminders that domestic violence doesn t stay at home   It follows people into their workplace   posing safety  financial  and legal problems for victims  employers and other workers   If we ignore it  the horrible toll of domestic violence in the workplace will continue unchecked   But if we confront it  I believe we can make progress          And I believe this is the time to have an informed discussion   Next week we will mark National Crime Victims Rights Week  and Lifetime Television is helping to focus attention on ending the violence          My goal today is to gather the facts about the size and scope of the problem and to discuss solutions    including a bill I m introducing today called the Survivors  Empowerment and Economic Security Act  which I first introduced with my friend Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila   Together we crafted this bill with input from domestic violence survivors  advocates  workplace experts  and our Senate colleagues         I want to thank our witnesses for sharing their expertise and experiences with us   We ll hear testimony from   Kathy Rodgers  president of Legal Momentum  Laura Fortman  who is commissioner of the State of Maine Department of Labor  Maine is doing some remarkable things to address DV in the workplace   Yvette Cade  a survivor of domestic violence in the workplace   Her horrific experience drew national attention in October 2005   Sue Willman is an attorney in with Spencer  Fane Britt   Browne in Missouri and has over 30 years of experience both as an employment lawyer and human resources professional  She represents management exclusively         I ve been working on domestic violence for a long time  and we have made progress  We ve updated federal laws and invested in prevention  intervention and prosecution   We ve made domestic violence something that  no one talked about  to something that is everybody s business   But I m frustrated that we have not made as much progress addressing the economic factors that allow abuse to continue   As I discuss domestic violence today  I m referring to domestic violence  dating violence  sexual assault and stalking  Its victims can be men or women        When domestic violence follows victims into the workplace  it reveals a key connection between safety and economic independence   For many victims of domestic violence  a steady paycheck is the only thing that keeps them from relying on an abuser   In fact  economic security and independence is the most accurate indicator of whether a victim will be able to stay away from an abuser          But too often  victims are entirely dependent on their abuser for food and shelter for themselves and their families   And too often  abusers try to undermine a victim s ability to work  harass their victims in the workplace  or worse   If we want to end domestic violence in workplace   or anywhere else   we need to address the economic barriers that trap victims in abusive relationships       The Problem   Let me share a few statistics that show the challenge we face   Domestic violence impacts the productivity of employees and the success of businesses   Each year  domestic violence results in an estimated 8 million missed days of work nationwide   And each year  domestic violence causes up to 50 percent of victims to lose their jobs   making them more dependent on an abuser        Many times  employers just don t know how to handle a situation where an abuser is coming to the workplace or causing an employee to miss work   Unfortunately  more than 70  of United States workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses workplace violence  let alone domestic violence   Only 4  of employers provided training on domestic violence   Some companies make the wrong choice and fire the worker   But making the employee go away does not make the problem go away   In fact  it can make it much harder for that person to get help if they don t have the financial security that a job provides   So we need to help employers understand the right things to do       Opening Locked Doors   As I look at these challenges  I see a series of locked doors   A victim wants to leave an abuser  but she can t support herself so the economic door is locked   A survivor wants to go to court to get a protection order  but she can t get time off of work  so another door is locked   A survivor needs medical insurance or a job  but she s discriminated against   yet more locked doors   My bill will unlock the doors that trap victims in abusive relationships   It will lift the economic barriers that allow abuse to continue       The Survivors  Empowerment and Economic Security Act   Let me share four ways the Survivors  Empowerment and Economic Security Act will help   First  it allows victims to take time off from work  without penalty from their employers  to appear in court  seek legal assistance  and get help with safety planning   Second  it ensures that if a victim must leave a job because of abuse  that person is eligible for unemployment compensation   Third  it prohibits employers or insurance providers from basing hiring or coverage decisions on a victim s history of abuse   Too many victims can t get a job or the insurance they need because insurance companies reject abuse victims   Finally  the bill addresses the punitive elements of the welfare system that can penalize victims who are fleeing dangerous situations  also called the Family Violence Option   Those are the main parts of my bill  I want stakeholders to know that if they have concerns or ideas for improving the bill  my door s open  and I d like to hear from you        We owe it to the millions of victims of domestic violence  sexual violence  and stalking to address this problem head on   People should not be forced to choose between financial security and physical security   Together we can stop the cycle of violence and the toll it takes on families  communities and our society  but we have to change the law and that s what I hope we can do together starting with this hearing
