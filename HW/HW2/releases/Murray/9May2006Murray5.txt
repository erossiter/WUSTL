Businesses  Calls for Real Solutions Murray Calls on Senate to Extend the Medicare Drug Deadline  Lift the Ban on Stem Cell Research and Invest in Community Healthcare    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  May 9  2006     Washington D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today spoke out against the Republican sponsored  Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act   S  1955  on the floor of the United States Senate          Murray said the bill  which is opposed by 41 state Attorneys General  the Washington State Medical Association and Washington State Governor Chris Gregoire  will eliminate critical patient protections  encourage insurance companies to charge higher premiums for some consumers  and will fail to reduce healthcare costs        Murray said that the Senate should not be wasting time on a flawed proposal but should address real solutions like extending the May 15th deadline for the Medicare Part D drug program  passing legislation to lift the ban on stem cell research  and investing in community healthcare efforts          Simply put  this proposal is a distraction   said Senator Murray   Instead of dealing with real solutions to real problems  the Republican leadership is wasting time on one narrow proposal that will make things worse  We can do better  and the truth is that patients  seniors  doctors  nurses and our communities all deserve better        Senator Murray supports allowing businesses to pool the risk of insuring employees in order to reduce healthcare costs   However  the Republican proposal eliminates critical protections that help keep patients healthy and keep costs down          In her floor speech  Murray cited a new report by Families USA which found that if S 1955 passes more than 1 861 000 Washington state residents could lose access to emergency services  home healthcare  drug and alcohol treatment  contraceptives  diabetic supplies and education  hospice Care  mammography screening  maternity services  mental healthcare  and many other services           I m not going to tell nearly 2 million people I represent that we re going to take a gamble and risk losing those hard won protections for a plan that will likely raise the cost of healthcare for many families and small businesses   Murray said           Murray also said S 1955 would result in higher insurance premiums for some patients   Insurers would be allowed to charge patients different rates based on their health  age  gender  or geography            Rates will likely become unaffordable for those who need it the most  potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans   Murray said       Senator Murray also shared with the Senate letters she has received from both Washington Governor Chris Gregoire and the 9 000 member Washington Medical Association  Both letters detailed how S  1955 would negatively affect gains Washington state has made in health care quality  and would drive up the cost of health care to the consumer         Murray noted that she does support efforts to pool health insurance risk to reduce costs while still protecting patients          We can help spread the risk in ways that will lower costs and still protect patients  but the legislation before us could raise costs for consumers and small businesses   We can do better   Murray said       Murray said that the Senate should be spending its time on measures that would actually help families and businesses improve healthcare and lower costs   She pointed to three challenges    the looming May 15th Medicare deadline  the Senate s failure to pass legislation allowing stem cell research  and recent cuts to community healthcare      Medicare Deadline    Speaking to the looming May 15th deadline that faces our nation s seniors  Senator Murray said          I ve been traveling throughout my home state of Washington meeting with seniors and holding roundtables with patients  pharmacists  and advocates   If we were serious about improving healthcare  we d be fixing the problems they ve outlined  Instead  we re going to let an unfair deadline hurt seniors even further   In six days  they will have to pick a plan or face higher penalties whenever they do enroll   And the penalties grow the longer they wait   To me  that s just not fair       Stem Cell Research    Murray said the Senate should lift restrictions on promising research   The House passed legislation a year ago  but the Senate has not acted          Every delay means missed opportunities for patients with devastating diseases  If the Senate is serious about advancing healthcare and saving lives  we should be voting on stem cell legislation today        Community Healthcare    Senator Murray also said that if the Senate Leadership were serious about improving healthcare  they would work to expand community healthcare efforts   Murray cited the Healthy Community Access Program  HCAP   which the Bush Administration eliminated last year  as an example of misplaced priorities          If we were serious about improving healthcare  we d be investing in local programs that make a difference  but instead the Republican leadership is focused on distractions   We can do better   Murray said                                                                                  The full text of the Senator s remarks on the Senate floor follow     Mr  President  at this hour families are struggling with healthcare  seniors are facing a critical deadline for drug coverage  businesses are grappling with the high cost of insurance  and patients are being denied the cutting edge research that could save their lives        Those are critical issues and what is the Senate doing  We re dealing with a distraction    instead of real solutions to make healthcare more affordable  more accessible  and more innovative        I m on the floor today to talk about what we should be doing to help families  businesses and communities meet their healthcare needs  I also want to explain why the Republican proposal S 1955 could do more harm than good        This bill takes a good idea    pooling the risk in health insurance    and distorts it with a plan that will raise the cost of healthcare  strip away patient protections  and hurt many small businesses        But don t take my word for it   Attorneys General from 41 states   including my own   have written to outline the serious problems with the Republican bill  I ve heard from doctors with the Washington State Medical Association and from my own governor about the damage that this bill would inflict on patients and our economy        Simply put  this proposal is a distraction    Instead of dealing with real solutions to real problems  the Republican leadership is wasting time on one narrow proposal that will make things worse   We can do better  and the truth is that patients  seniors  doctors  nurses and our communities all deserve better        If we were serious about helping reduce the cost of healthcare  helping improve access  and driving innovation  we would be talking about the critical issues the Republican leadership is trying to avoid   We should be focusing on everything from the Medicare drug program to stem cell research and community healthcare   And we don t have a day to waste      Medicare Part D    On Monday  millions of seniors and disabled will be hit with a deadline that means higher premiums for prescription drugs   That May 15th deadline is just 6 days away  I am hearing from seniors that they re worried about the deadline  they re worried about picking the wrong plan  and they don t think it s fair to be punished if they need more time to make an informed choice        I ve been traveling throughout my home state of Washington meeting with seniors and holding roundtables with patients  pharmacists  and advocates  Three weeks ago  I was in Chehalis at the Twin Cities Senior Center  and I can tell you    seniors are worried about the May 15th deadline   And that s just one of the many problems with this flawed drug program        The week before that I was in Silverdale   I ve held Medicare roundtables in Kent  Vancouver  Ballard  Shelton  Spokane  Anacortes  Bellevue  Aberdeen  Olympia  Lakewood  Seattle and Everett        I ve heard from seniors just how bad the Medicare Part D program is  I ve heard their frustration about dealing with such a confusing system  I ve heard their anger that the program does not meet their needs  And I ve heard many who just want to throw their hands up and ignore the whole program        If we were serious about improving healthcare  we d be fixing the problems they ve outlined  Instead  we re going to let an unfair deadline hurt seniors even further   In six days  they will have to pick a plan or face higher penalties whenever they do enroll   And the penalties grow the longer they wait   To me  that s just not fair        Right now  the Senate could be extending the deadline so seniors are not pressured into making the wrong choice in such a complicated system  Right now  we could be lifting the penalty so that seniors are not punished if they need more time to make the right choice  Right now  we could be providing help to the millions of vulnerable Americans who have been mistreated by this flawed Republican plan        But instead  this Congress is leaving seniors to fend for themselves   The Secretary of Health and Human Services has said he opposes extending the deadline or lifting the penalties    and this Republican Congress seems to agree with him by a shameful lack of action   Seniors deserve better  the disabled deserve better  and our most vulnerable neighbors deserve better        If we really wanted to make healthcare more affordable  accessible and innovative  we would be fixing the Medicare drug program and helping seniors who are facing that unfair deadline      Stem Cell Research     That s just one example of what a real focus on healthcare would include   If we were serious about helping patients  we would be expanding life saving research        For patients living with diseases such as Parkinson s  Multiple Sclerosis  Alzheimer s  and Diabetes  stem cell research holds the potential to help us understand  treat  and someday cure  these devastating diseases  Nearly a year ago  the House of Representatives passed legislation to lift the restrictions that hold back this promising research  The House of Representatives has acted    but for a year the Senate has not        My colleagues  Senators Specter and Harkin  are well known for their leadership in this fight   They were promised a vote on stem cell research   That vote still has not taken place   Every delay means missed opportunities for patients with devastating diseases  If the Senate is serious about advancing healthcare and saving lives  we should be voting on stem cell legislation today  That s why last week I joined with 39 other Senators in writing to the Majority Leader urging him to bring up HR 810    the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  But instead of real solutions  the Senate is focusing on a distraction   Patients with life threatening diseases deserve better       Community Healthcare    Mr  President  if we were serious about improving healthcare  we d be investing in local efforts that boost access to healthcare        Two weeks ago  through the Johnson and Johnson Community Healthcare Awards  I had a chance to honor leaders from across the country who are doing innovative work to break down barriers to care   If we re serious about improving healthcare  we would be building more federal support for their work  Instead  we re moving in the opposite direction        Perhaps the best in example is the Bush Administration s 5 year effort to kill the Healthy Communities Access Program  HCAP    This program helps local organizations coordinate care for the uninsured  and it s made a tremendous difference in my home state        Every year since taking office  the Bush Administration has tried to kill this successful program   I ve led the fight for our local communities every year    and most years we ve won  But this past year  the White House and Republican Congress finally ended support for Healthy Communities and made healthcare less accessible for families from coast to coast        If we were serious about improving healthcare  we d be investing in local programs that make a difference  but instead the Republican leadership is focused on distractions   We can do better       S  1955 is Flawed    Mr  President  let me turn to the specific problems with S 1955 and explain why so many experts across the country are warning us that this bill will eliminate critical patient protections  lead to unfair premiums and insurance practices  and raise the cost of healthcare       1   Eliminates Patient Protections    First  this bill will eliminate many of the important protections that keep patients healthy and that lower the cost of healthcare        Washington state has enacted a number of state patient protections that require health plans to cover services such as diabetic care  mental health services  breast and cervical cancer screenings  emergency medical services  and dental procedures   But under this bill  Small Business Health Plans or Association Health Plans would not be required to cover these important benefits  Allowing insurers to abandon mandated benefits  many of which are preventative and or diagnostic  will result in a sicker population and higher health care costs        When this legislation was debated in the HELP Committee  I offered a number of amendments to provide for coverage of several important women  s health benefits  Unfortunately  my amendments were defeated   So here we have a bill that will strip away the protections that patients rely on       Families USA Report     A new report by Families USA shows just how many families in my home state will be hurt by this bill  The report found that 1 861 000 residents of Washington state may lose state protections if this bill is passed        And what could they lose  Emergency services  home healthcare  drug and alcohol treatment  contraceptives  diabetic supplies and education  Hospice Care  Mammography Screening  Maternity services  mental healthcare  and many other services  I m not going to tell nearly 2 million people I represent that we re going to take a gamble and risk losing those hard won protections for a plan that will likely raise the cost of healthcare for many families and small businesses       2   Unfair Premiums  Cherry Picking     Second  this bill will encourage insurance companies to charge higher premiums for less healthy consumers  This bill will preempt strong laws and protections in our state that limit the ability of insurers to vary premiums based on health status  age  gender  and geography  I am concerned that this will result in adverse selection or   cherry picking     leading to higher premiums for less healthy consumers   Rates will likely become unaffordable for those who need it the most  potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans       Letter from Governor Gregoire    Mr  President  I d like to share some letters that I ve received from leaders in my home state who all speak out against this flawed proposal        Recently  I received a letter from Governor Chris Gregoire  of my home state  in which she expressed her many concerns regarding this legislation and its impact on our state s residents  This chart contains the full text of the Governor s letter    and as you can see she has many serious concerns   I just want to highlight for the Senate some of the main points the Governor raised with me        Governor Gregoire alludes to the harmful aspects of this bill  saying        S 1955 stands to harm our small group insurance market  a critical component of Washington State s current health care system  Instead of promoting more affordable health care  this legislation would cause a serious increase in rates for consumers  possibly two or three times over what they pay now       Governor Gregoire also warns  this bill threatens consumer protections that the state of Washington strives to guarantee to all of our residents      The Governor also warns that this bill would  foster a proliferation of health plans that do not cover preventative services that are absolutely vital to the health and wellbeing of Washington residents     Letter from the Washington State Medical Association    Mr  President  I d like to also share a letter I received from the 9 000 member Washington State Medical Association in strong opposition to S 1955        This chart shows the full letter  and I d like to read a portion   This legislation will have a severe impact on all the consumer health gains that have been made in Washington State over the past decade     S  1955 will     undermine Washington State s many gains in advancing mental health care quality  pull people from existing insurance coverage rather than attract the uninsured  lead to higher costs for consumers  Strike down Washington s Mental Health Parity law  which took eight years of work to be enacted  eliminate other mandated benefits that help consumers such as mammography services  and  leave Washington s citizens at risk for unpaid medical bills in the event of an AHP insolvency        Mr  President  that is from the head of the Washington State Medical Association  which has 9 000 members in my home state       3  Will Not Lower Healthcare Costs    Third  this proposal does nothing to address increasing health care costs   In fact  it just builds on the sorry record of the Administration and this Congress in not addressing the rising costs that Americans face  Because of the flaws I mentioned above  this bill does nothing to contain costs  In fact  it could dramatically increase costs for many businesses and families in Washington State   It will also mean that people in my State of Washington who have affordable coverage could end up worse off than they are today        I know that my State has been a leader in working to expand access to affordable health insurance for working families and small businesses  Many of these reforms that work to control costs in my state would be jeopardized if this legislation were enacted  Washington State also has a proud tradition of strong consumer protections and integrated  managed care that has improved health outcomes and controlled cost increases       I Support Pooling    I support the concept of pooling and believe we can implement policies that provide stability in health insurance premiums  I am currently working with a number of my colleagues on legislation to create federal and state catastrophic cost pools to spread out the risks and address what is really driving health care costs  We can help spread the risk in ways that will lower costs and still protect patients  but the legislation before us could raise costs for consumers and small businesses   We can do better        Mr  President  there are serious challenges facing our country when it comes to healthcare   This Senate needs to get serious  Instead of focusing on a distraction  we should be helping seniors with prescription drugs  expanding life saving research and supporting community healthcare        Those are some of the things we should be working on to reduce cost of healthcare  improve access  and accelerate innovation  We can do all of those things  but we need the Republican leadership to get serious if we re going to provide serious solutions        We don t have a day to waste   I hope we can get to work on the real solutions that American families deserve
