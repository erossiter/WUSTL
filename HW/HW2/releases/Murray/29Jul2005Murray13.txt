                       News Release          Murray Statement on Energy Bill Murray votes against bill  citing short sighted policies  lack of investment in renewable energy sources    For Immediate Release  Friday  July 29  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today voted against the House Senate Energy Bill Conference Report  H R  6  the Energy Policy Act of 2005   While pleased with investment in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the removal of MTBE liability protections  Murray opposed the bill due to its failure to move our nation away from dependence on foreign oil and roll backs in clean water laws and environmental protections   The bill passed the Senate 74 26       Murray  s statement in opposition to the Energy Bill follows       Today I voted against H R  6  the Energy Policy Act of 2005         I do so because this bill fails to move us beyond the status quo of today  s energy situation   Congress rarely steps forward to address our nation  s energy policy and I believe when we do so we should provide real direction that addresses real problems   Unfortunately  that is not the case here        I voted for the bill as reported by the Senate  but only narrowly   A few provisions in the Senate bill attempted to address our need to promote renewable energy resources and decrease our consumption of foreign oil   Those few forward looking provisions have been dropped from this final bill  leaving me with little choice  but to vote no for our failure to truly provide some new direction to our nation  s energy policy        Crafting comprehensive energy policy should offer the opportunity to address the most difficult issues facing our country   The bulk of this bill sidesteps those tough issues and in place of solutions it offers band aids   Moving toward independence from foreign oil should be a top priority  but it is not addressed meaningfully        Climate change is a serious issue that Congress simply refuses to address   While some voluntary measures are included  these are simply not enough   We must have meaningful action if we are to protect our health  environment  and economy of our country        Gone from this bill is the renewable portfolio standard promoted by the Senate   The Senate  s provision would have increased the penetration of alternative energy sources   This bill also fails to take adequate steps to develop conservation and efficiency technologies and yet it offers substantial subsidies to the fossil fuels industry          This is not the bill I would have written and this is no longer a bill I can support         There are sections of the bill that are positive   For example  I am pleased that the conference bill contains provisions protecting the Pacific Northwest  s electricity system from unwarranted interference by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  and protects Washington ratepayers from excessively high electricity rates  I am also pleased that the current bill contains a fair and balanced hydro electric re licensing process and sets new grid reliability standards  I commend my colleague  Senator Cantwell  who championed Washington state interests        This bill in particular supports cutting edge research and development at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Washington state universities in the areas of smart energy  advanced scientific computing  and systems biology        I am equally pleased to see that the bill does not provide MTBE liability protections         As the world  s leading energy consumer  the United States should lead by example and innovation   However  this bill stops short of taking common sense measures that would truly reduce foreign oil dependence and mitigate the looming threat of climate change  To diversify energy sources in America  fossil fuel use must be offset by conservation  energy efficiency and clean and renewable fuels        Yet  proposals to set ambitious  yet achievable  targets for reduced oil imports  tighter fuel economies for cars and trucks were defeated  Instead  oil and gas companies will be allowed to scour our fragile coastlines for more oil and gas reserves  Furthermore  this bill awards multi million dollar tax breaks to those same companies  which are reaping windfalls from record high oil prices at the expense of Washington consumers  to continue us down the path of fossil fuels  which are a key contributor to climate change  This bill also rolls back significant clean water laws that keep our water safe to drink         Despite ample protections for Washington ratepayers  it is hard to ignore that this bill  this national energy blueprint  does absolutely nothing to improve energy security or reduce dependence on foreign oil  We need a national energy policy  but one that acknowledges the needs for the future  sets a plan  and moves us forward   Not a bill that delivers the status quo
