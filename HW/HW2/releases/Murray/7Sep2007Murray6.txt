Landmark legislation raises Pell Grants by 25   cuts interest rates on student loans in half  and provides additional  333 million for need based grants for Washington state students    For Immediate Release  Friday  September 7  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  helped pass critical higher education legislation that will provide more federal support for Washington state students in the form of increased Pell Grants  a significant reduction in student loan interest rates  a cap on monthly loan payments  and various specialized grant programs  The legislation  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act  was passed in the Senate by a vote of 79 12  Without Pell Grants and student loans I never would have been able to attend college  said Senator Patty Murray  So I know what this bill will mean for the millions of students who rely on financial aid to realize their dreams  With college becoming more expensive and more students leaving school saddled with debt  the deck is already stacked against them  By increasing Pell grants  cutting interest rates  and putting students first  this bill will begin to turn the tide  Specifically  this bill   Raises the maximum Pell Grant by 25 percent over four years to  5 400 per student Cuts the interest rate on federal loans in half to 3 4 percent for students with subsidized loans  Guarantees that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their monthly income in student loan payments  Awards grants to students who commit to teaching in high need subjects at high need schools  Increases funding for Upward Bound Program that assists low income students afford college  and Invests in minority serving institutions   Murray Sponsored Initiatives   The bill also includes two provisions that Senator Murray worked hard to include  Military Loan Deferment and Relief  Thanks to Senator Murray s work this bill lifts this three year limit on military loan deferment and makes more service members eligible for student loan deferment and relief  With deployments as long as 15 months in Iraq  and young dependent families left at home  our service members are already facing real financial challenges  said Senator Murray  Paying back student loans should not be something weighing on their mind as they serve us overseas or as they transition back into civilian life  Homeless and Foster Care Students Aid   Senator Murray helped to simplify the student aid application process in an effort to make more homeless and foster care students eligible for aid  I am also pleased that this bill improves college access for homeless and foster care students  Murray said  These vulnerable students face tremendous barriers in their education  especially those who don t have a parent or guardian who s able to guide them through the process  Senator Murray offered the following remarks today supporting the bill   Mr  President  the bill that we are debating today comes at a critical time for our country  As the connected world has brought about new competition from nations across the globe  the need for more Americans to be armed with a college education has become essential to the future of our economy  And as a new generation enters a work world that demands highly skilled  highly trained workers  a college degree is necessary to open the door to a successful career  But for too long the deck has been stacked against students seeking to build their careers and grow our economy  College has become more expensive  interest rates have grown  and those students who are able to attend college often graduate saddled with debt and unable to buy a car or a house  Today we have the opportunity to turn the tide in favor of students and ensure a stronger future for our country  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act   puts students first  makes college more affordable  cuts interest rates  helps recent graduates  and encourages public service   It also helps to ensure that students today have the same opportunities that I had growing up  When I was growing up  my family didn t have a lot  The only way I was able to attend college was through Pell Grants and student loans  In fact  because of Pell Grants and student loans  all seven kids in my family were able to get a college education  Today those seven kids are a school teacher  a lawyer  a firefighter  a homemaker  a computer programmer  a sports writer  and a U S  Senator  In my book that was a great investment  This bill helps a new generation attend college and realize their dreams in a variety of ways  Raising Pell Grants First  this bill raises the maximum Pell Grant by 25 percent over four years to  5 400 per student  That will make a real difference for students in my home state of Washington  In Washington state  20 years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 53  of the costs at a public  four year college  Today it only covers 33  of those costs  By raising the maximum Pell Grant  this bill will help students in Washington state and across the country attend college  For Washington state  this bill will make another  30 million available in need based grants next year alone  Over five years  the bill will provide an additional  333 million for low income students  Reasonable Monthly Loan Payments This bill will also ensure that college graduates are not trapped by high loan payments after college  This bill cuts the interest rate on federal loans in half to 3 4 percent for students with subsidized loans  It also guarantees that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their monthly income in student loan payments  This will bring immediate relief to students who are burdened with excessive loans  Another problem with high student loan debt is that it limits the career choices of college graduates  Many can t afford to take a job in public service and pay back their loans at the same time  This bill encourages public service by providing loan forgiveness for graduates who pursue careers in these areas  TEACH Grants As a former teacher  I am also extremely pleased that the TEACH grant program has been included in this bill  This program will provide  4 000 grants to students who commit to teaching in high need subjects at high need schools  It is past time that we reward students who are willing to embrace the challenge of working with our countrys students who are the most in need  Upward Bound Im also pleased that we were able to increase funding for the Upward Bound program which helps more low income students prepare for and attend college  This program is so important for assisting students who may be the first ones in their family to go to college  Strengthening Minority Institutions  And I m pleased that minority serving institutions will see funding in the form of a  500 million investment contained in this bill  And finally Mr  President  I m especially proud that this bill contains two provisions I worked hard to include that help groups that face other unique problems in the college aid process  Military Service Members  Lifting Three Year Deferment Limit  For our brave men and women in uniform  I worked to include a provision that will allow them to defer their student loan payments during their deployments and as they transition out of service  Currently  the law limits how long service members can defer their payments to just three years  As we all know  those who are serving our country have enough to worry about these days  With deployments as long as 15 months in Iraq  and young dependent families left at home  our service members are already facing real financial challenges  Paying back student loans should not be something weighing on their mind as they serve us overseas or as they transition back into civilian life  So this bill lifts this three year limit and makes more service members eligible for student loan deferment and relief  Opens Doors for Homeless and Foster Students I am also pleased that this bill improves college access for homeless and foster care students  These vulnerable students face tremendous barriers in their education  especially those who don t have a parent or guardian who s able to guide them through the process  In this bill  I joined with my colleagues to simplify the student aid application process and made homeless and foster students eligible for higher levels of assistance  Thank Senator Kennedy   I really want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in moving this bill forward and making sure it does right by our students  He is a tireless champion for our young people  and his work is allowing so many more of them to achieve the American Dream  Conclusion Mr  President  To me  this is simple  If we want our economy to grow  our people to succeed  and our country to be strong  we have to help more students get a college education  This bill will do just that  and I urge my colleagues to support it
