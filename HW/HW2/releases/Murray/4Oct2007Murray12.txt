Jones to be District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington State    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 4  2007     WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   today spoke on the floor of the U S  Senate to mark Senate confirmation of King County Judge Richard Jones as District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington state  Senator Murray helped select Judge Jones and also introduced him during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July of this year  Judge Jones has handled some of the most difficult cases in Western Washington in the past decade  and hes won the respect of everyone whos come before him  Senator Murray said today  In his courtroom  Judge Jones is known for making articulate and powerful statements that make clear where he stands  He also clearly meets the standards of fairness  even handedness  and adherence to the law that we expect of our federal judges  I know that I speak on behalf of a large number of the people in my state s legal and law enforcement community in saying that our federal bench will be stronger with Richard Jones  Senator Murray s full floor remarks about Judge Richard Jones follow  Mr  President  I am honored to speak today on behalf of Richard Jones  a distinguished lawyer and King County Superior Court Judge from my home state  a man who enjoys broad bipartisan support and who deserves a seat on the federal bench  President Bush nominated Judge Jones to be a District Court Judge for the Western District of Washington State  He is an excellent choice  I m proud to support him  and I urge my colleagues to support him as well  If you were to ask lawyers and judges in my home state about Judge Jones  here are some of the descriptions you would hear   He s admired by everyone in the justice system  He gives respect  and he gets respect  The test of one s performance is the way they handle the smaller cases  Richard displays precisely that same degree of sensitivity to all that appear before him   The Seattle Times described this nomination by saying  This is a lifetime appointment with no room for mistakes  and we believe there is no mistake here  Mr  President  I couldn t agree more  Judge Jones has handled some of the most difficult cases in Western Washington in the past decade  and hes won the respect of everyone whos come before him  For example  he presided over the sentencing of Gary Ridgway  also known as the Green River Killer  Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated first degree murder in 2003 and is one of the most prolific serial killers in American history  It would be a tough case for any judge  but Judge Jones earned praise for the sensitivity and dignity he showed for the victims of the Green River Killer  As a result of that case    and in recognition of his long service to Washington State    in 2004 Judge Jones received the Judge of the Year Award from the Asian Bar Association of Washington  the King County Bar Association  the Washington State Bar Association  and the Washington State Trial Lawyers Association  And Judge Jones has also been praised by peers for handling cases far out of the media spotlight with the same care and attention  Mr  President  Both Senator Cantwell and I assisted the President in choosing Judge Jones from a list of very qualified candidates  When I met him  I was so impressed with his sensitivity  his professionalism  and his overall sense of fairness  Throughout his career  Judge Jones has won high praise for his judicial demeanor and for the respect he shows all parties  In his courtroom  Jones is known for making articulate and powerful statements that make clear where he stands  He also clearly meets the standards of fairness  even handedness  and adherence to the law that we expect of our federal judges  In terms of his personal background  he graduated from Seattle University and the University of Washington School of Law  In private practice  Richard Jones successfully represented both plaintiffs and defendants in a variety of civil cases  As a state and federal prosecutor  he had extensive experience prosecuting criminal cases  Most recently  as a full time King County Superior Court Judge  Richard Jones has distinguished himself and won broad support  And in addition to all of his professional responsibilities  Judge Jones has also been deeply involved in community activities  serving as a YMCA board member and mentoring minority youths  He has also worked in the community to expand opportunities for students to pursue legal careers by supporting youth oriented legal programs  Judge Jones has shown a commitment to the people of his community and that is one of the reasons they have shown a commitment to him  Since he was first appointed in 1994  the voters of King County have reelected him three times  I know that I speak on behalf of a large number of the people in my state s legal and law enforcement community in saying that our federal bench will be stronger with Richard Jones  So it s my pleasure to support his nomination  Judge Jones has garnered bi partisan support in my state and I am confident that his record of fair and unbiased service will earn him bi partisan support today  I urge all my colleagues to vote to support this nomination
