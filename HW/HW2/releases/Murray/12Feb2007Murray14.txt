                                                                              For Immediate Release  Monday  February 12  2007     Washington  D C     In a speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged the Senate to prevent cuts in local and federal law enforcement and in critical healthcare services for America s veterans by passing the bipartisan Joint Funding Resolution  H J  Res 20           Yesterday   about how the failure to pass the joint resolution would undermine transportation safety  highway construction and housing for low income families        Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise today to once again urge the Senate to pass the bipartisan Joint Funding Resolution  H J  Res 20   As I mentioned yesterday on the Senate Floor  President Bush s Transportation Secretary Mary Peters has testified that we will see  drastic consequences  if we fail to pass this bill   We ll see painful cuts to aviation safety  highway safety  and highway construction   I can also tell my colleagues that we will see painful and unnecessary cuts in housing  law enforcement and veterans  healthcare       The Difference Between a CR and H J  Res 20    I want to make sure that every Senator understands the difference between the Continuing Resolution that the government is currently running on and the Joint Funding Resolution H J  Res  20  that we are currently debating   If we fail to pass H J  Res 20 and instead extend the current Continuing Resolution for the rest of the year         Families will lose their housing        Airline safety inspectors will be furloughed        Air traffic controllers will be furloughed        Highway construction will be cut        As a result  some states will have to wait till the next construction season to deal with critical safety and congestion problems   In short  failing to pass H J  Res  20 will hurt our communities   That s why we need to pass H J  Res 20 which is a bipartisan bill that is very carefully crafted to address the most critical funding shortfalls across our government     We ve got to pass H J  Res  20  and we ve got to pass it this week       Local Law Enforcement    Mr  President  communities across the country need more help fighting crime  and that s one reason why we need to pass the Joint Funding Resolution        Without this bill  state and local law enforcement will be cut by  1 2 billion   Our Joint Funding Resolution prevents that cut   And our resolution then adds money for Byrne Grants and COPS grants providing a  176 million increase over last year for those two programs  That money goes straight to local communities to help them fight crime        When I sit down with law enforcement officials in my home state of Washington  they tell me they need more help from the federal government  A few months ago  I was in Yakima listening to law enforcement officials talk about their efforts to fight meth and gangs   They told me that Byrne Grants are critical to their efforts   There s a big difference for Byrne Grants under a CR and under our Joint Funding Resolution  Under our bill  the Byrne Grant Assistance Program is funded at  519 million  which is an increase of  108 7 million over FY 2006   Under our bill  the COPS Program is funded at  541 7 million  which is an increase of  67 9 million over FY 2006   That s exactly the type of support our local law enforcement officials need  but they only get that support if we pass H J  Res 20       Support for Federal Law Enforcement    Our resolution also supports national efforts to fight crime   Under a CR  the FBI would have to lay off 4 000 special agents   At a time when violent crime is rising  when robberies are up nearly 10 percent nationwide  when the FBI is working to fight crime   do we really want to lay off 4 000 FBI agents   No  and that s why our resolution provides the FBI with an additional  216 million dollars over FY 2006   That means the FBI will not have to layoff those special agents   If we don t pass H J  Res 20  those FBI agents will be furloughed   sitting at home  unpaid  rather than coming to work to fight crime        The Justice Department s Violence Against Women Office is funded at  382 5 million in our resolution   That s nearly one million dollars over FY 2006       Fighting Terror Funding    The Joint Funding Resolution will help us cut off funding to terrorists   The Treasury Department is working hard to block the flow of money to terrorists  Last year  Treasury hired new intelligence analysts in that effort   Under a CR  those new analysts would be furloughed  Talk about a step backwards in the fight against terror   Our Joint Funding Resolution ensures those analysts stay on the job and keep disrupting terror financing   In short  we must pass H J  Res 20 to         prevent cuts in local law enforcement        to prevent the layoffs of thousands of FBI agents        and to keep our federal law enforcement efforts on track        So this vote is a test either you support funding law enforcement at an appropriate level  or you re voting to cut funding to your local law enforcement community    That s the choice every Senator will have to make       Veterans    Mr  President  America s veterans have a great deal at stake in how the Senate votes on the Joint Funding Resolution   I just came from a hearing with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson this morning  It s absolutely clear to me that we are not doing enough to meet the needs of those who have served our country   Veterans are facing long lines for health care   Veterans who need mental healthcare are being told they have to wait to see a doctor   And the VA is not prepared for the many veterans who are coming home with serious physical challenges        We need a VA budget for the current year that finally meets their needs   If we just pass a CR  veterans are going to get less funding    and with it    fewer medical services  less funding for medical facilities  and more delays in getting the benefits they have earned   We owe our veterans more than cuts and delays        Under our Joint Funding Resolution  total funding for VA Medical care is  32 billion    an increase of about  3 5 billion over the FY 2006 appropriated level   Let s look at one VA account in particular        Under our bill  VA Medical Services are funded at about  25 billion    an increase of  2 965 billion over the FY 2006 appropriated level   That s going to help veterans with medical care including inpatient and outpatient care  mental healthcare  and long term care           Under our bill  there s an extra  70 million for the VA s General Operating Expenses   Some of that money will help the Veterans Benefits Administration deal with its massive backlog of benefit claims          The VA wants to hire a net of 300 more employees to cut down on the waiting time for benefits   Without the Joint Funding Resolution  the VA won t be able to hire those new employees  and veterans will continue to face long delays for the benefits they deserve       Transportation Safety    Mr  President  I also want to discuss the effect that not passing the Joint funding Resolution would have on critical programs under my own jurisdiction in the Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development Subcommittee         Without this bill  air traffic controllers will be furloughed  and air safety inspectors will be furloughed   If we fail to pass this bipartisan bill  we will see a decline in our ability to provide railroad inspections  pipeline safety inspections  and truck safety inspections         Simply put  if we don t pass this bipartisan bill  the safety of American citizens could be put in danger      Housing    We will also feel the consequences in the area of housing   If we don t pass this bill  hundreds of thousands of Americans will face a housing crisis         157 000 low income people could lose their housing         70 000 people could lose their housing vouchers        11 500 housing units that are housing the homeless could be lost       Mr  President  those are just some of the consequences that Americans will face if this Congress fails to pass the Joint Funding Resolution   But don t take my word for it   On Thursday  I held a hearing with President Bush s very able Secretary of Transportation  Mary Peters       Unless We Pass H R  Res 20  Safety Will be Compromised    At that hearing  Secretary Peters talked in very clear terms about the consequences not passing this Joint Funding Resolution would have         I asked Secretary Peters what it would mean for safety and hiring if Congress does not pass the Joint Funding Resolution   She said    W e will see a serious decline in the number of safety inspectors  truck safety inspectors  rail safety inspectors  aviation inspectors across the broad range in our program       That s directly from the President s Transportation Secretary         Does any Senator want to be responsible for voting for a  serious decline  in the number of truck safety inspectors  rail safety inspectors  and aviation safety inspectors   How would you explain to your constituents that you voted to undermine their safety as they travel by car  train or plane        Unless We Pass H J  Res 20  State Highway Construction Will Stall    We also need to pass the Joint Funding Resolution because  without it  states will not be able address their most pressing highway  bridge and road problems   In fact  Secretary Peters warned that some states could miss an entire construction season if Congress does not enact this bill soon         Secretary Peters said   It is especially important to those states who have a construction season that will be upon us very  very shortly  and if they are not able to know that this funding is coming and be able to let contracts accordingly we could easily miss an entire construction season      So your constituents will feel the impact of your vote in roads that are fixed or roads that remain clogged  congested and unsafe        Highway Funding    Mr  President  the bill pending before the Senate provides an additional  3 75 billion in formula funding for our nation s highway and transit systems  That funding will serve to create almost 160 000 new jobs  while alleviating congestion   It will be an important infusion of cash to the States to help them address their most pressing bridge replacements  highway widenings  and safety enhancements         Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent  that a table provided to me by the Federal Highway Administration that displays the highway funding increases that will be enjoyed by each and every state be included in the record at this point        Housing  Unless We Pass H J  Res 20  Housing Will Suffer    The failure to pass H  J  Res  20 will also have a painful impact on housing for hundreds of thousands of Americans   In this bipartisan bill  we worked hard to make sure that vulnerable families would not be thrown out on the streets or face out of reach rent increases   We provided critical support for Section 8  Homeless Assistance Grants  Housing Equity Conversion Loans  HOPE VI  and the Public Housing Operating Fund        Without increases in these programs         Housing vouchers will be lost        Many low income residents will become homeless        Renters will be displaced or will face unaffordable rent increases        Seniors will lose a valuable source of equity        And efforts to replace deteriorated public housing units will be eliminated        Clearly  the consequences of not passing the Joint Funding Resolution would be severe for some of our country s most vulnerable families        Mr  President  in closing  I think it s clear that our communities will pay a very high price unless the Senate passes H J  Res 20         I urge my colleagues to vote         to allow low income families to keep a roof over their heads        to keep safety inspectors on the job        to keep highway construction projects moving forward        to help your local law enforcement fight crime        and to give our veterans the care and benefits they have earned        I urge my colleagues to support H J  Res 20   Otherwise you re going to have to tell your veterans  your police officers   your commuters  your air traffic controllers  your public housing tenants  your housing advocates  and your airline passengers  pilots and flight attendants  why you voted against them
