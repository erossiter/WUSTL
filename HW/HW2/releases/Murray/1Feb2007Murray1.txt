                                                                                             News Release          Senator Murray and Veterans Call on President Bush to Deliver a Budget that Honors America s Veterans    For Immediate Release  Thursday  February 1  2007             Washington  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty            Fighting for America s Veterans      Murray  D Wash  joined with veterans of the Iraq War  senators  and veterans  advocates at a press conference in the Capitol  They called on the President to finally present a budget that adequately funds the needs of America s veterans  The President is expected to send his budget proposal to Congress on Monday  February 5th   For the past few years  the President s budget has sought to impose new fees and restrictions on veterans seeking the care they have earned        The President  s budget comes out on Monday  and we are going to be looking at it through the eyes of the men and women who have served us overseas   Murray said   If he sends us another budget that leaves America s veterans behind  he  s going to run straight into a Democratic Congress that will use our gavels  our voices and our votes to protect those who served our country       One of the speakers was Brady Van Engelen  who graduated from Seattle University and served with the 1st Armored Division in Iraq  In April 2004  Brady was shot in the head by a sniper and was evacuated out of Iraq to recover at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington  D C  Brady spoke about the great care he received and worried about how other veterans  who suffered more serious injuries  are doing back in their local communities          Other speakers included  Iraq war veteran John Bruhns  Steve Robinson  Veterans for America   Joyce Raezer  National Military Family Association  and Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH   Bernie Sanders  I VT   and John Tester  D MT         Senator Murray s Remarks Follow     I want to start by thanking my fellow Senators who join me today   You re seeing some of the energetic new members of the Veterans  Affairs committee   Under Chairman Akaka s leadership  we re going to provide the oversight and the accountability that s been missing for many years        Most importantly  I want to thank the veterans who are here today  You ve made us proud with your service overseas  and today you make us proud once again by standing up for your fellow service members who can t come to the Capital to speak out       This Budget is a Test    We re here today because our country is facing a moment of truth on Iraq War and the care our veterans deserve   On Monday  the President will send us his budget for the coming year  and we will find out if the President is going to offer real help or just more rhetoric for veterans in need       The President Didn t Mention Veterans    Last week  I listened to the President s State of the Union and I was deeply troubled that not once did he mention the word veterans   That is really a disservice to all those who have served us overseas  and I fear it signals that  once again  the President is going to send us a budget next week that does not meet the needs of our veterans       The President s Past Budgets have Shortchanged Veterans    We ve seen that disgraceful pattern year after year  for the last six years            in budgets that seek to lock the doors of the VA to some of our veterans        in budgets that impose new fees on America s veterans        and in budgets that don t meet the needs throughout our country        For too long  this Administration has not honored the sacrifice of our service members with a budget that fulfills our commitment to them   They have not planned for the veterans this war is creating  and they have not made a commitment to fund veterans  healthcare as an essential part of the cost of war          In my own experience in dealing with the VA budget  I have had a hard time just getting straight answers or real numbers  In fact  it  s not just us  the GAO has found    in report after report after report    that VA has misled Congress  concealed funding problems  and based it s projections on inaccurate models         Two years ago  I was assured many times that the VA had the funding it needed    only to find out later that the VA had a  3 billion shortfall and that the agency had falsified budget savings over many years          Veterans are still paying the price for this that mistakes  and they cannot afford another budget coming to us that doesn  t meet their needs        I want to be clear to the President  If he sends us another budget that leaves America s veterans behind  he  s going to run straight into a Democratic Congress that will use our gavels  our voices and our votes to protect those who served our country        Voters sent us all a message in November  and they  re standing here today to send a message again   On Monday we will find out if the President heard that message or if he s sending us more of the same        We Need Accurate Numbers of Injured Service Members    Recent news reports have suggested that the Bush Administration cut in half the number of war casualties on the VA website from about 50 000 to about 21 000   I ve asked the VA to explain the discrepancy in those numbers  and they still have not provided us with a straight answer      Veterans Share Our Concerns    I  personally  have gone home and spoken with many veterans in my state of Washington  and like me  they are very  very worried that the President s escalation will further degrade our ability to care for our men and women when they come home           Today    without the surge    veterans are waiting for the services that they have been promised   If we re not meeting the needs of the veterans today  how are we going to keep a promise to those who are sent in to an escalated war       We Are Watching     So I  m very glad today to be joined by a number of my fellow Senators on the Veterans   Committee who are really adamant about making sure we take care of those who serve  who will be part of those voices  and those votes  to make sure that we provide what is asked   We will speak out loudly if this President sends us a budget that does not meet the needs of the men and women who have been asked to serve us        The bottom line is the President  s budget comes out on Monday  and we are going to be looking at it through the eyes of the men and women who have served us overseas to make sure that they have the funds they  ve been promised  The VA and this Administration are in denial about the costs of war         It is out responsibility as Americans to make sure that our troops have the equipment they need  that they  re protected  and that when they come home they have whatever services they need  whether it  s for brain injury  which is growing  whether it  s for long term care  whether it is for post traumatic stress syndrome or for whatever else they need        This is not a partisan issue  it is an American issue  and we have a responsibility to address it         The President didn  t say the words   veterans   in his State of the Union speech   He  d better say it loud in capital letters in his budget
