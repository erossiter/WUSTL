                                                                                                                                                                  For Immediate Release  Wednesday  July 18  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke out on the Senate floor in support of the Higher Education Access Act  The bill  which Murray helped write  will raise Pell Grants  keep loan payments reasonable for graduates  assist military service members  and help homeless and foster students attend college  Senator Murray s remarks follow  Mr  President  in these days of global competition  a college education is the gateway to a successful career  a growing economy  and stronger future for our country  Today in the Senate  we have an opportunity to help more students attend college and afford a college education  and I m pleased to speak in support of the Higher Education Access Act  When I was growing up  my family didn t have a lot  The only way I was able to attend college was through Pell Grants and student loans  In fact  because of Pell Grants and student loans  all seven kids in my family were able to get a college education  Today those seven kids are a school teacher  a lawyer  firefighter  a homemaker  a computer programmer  a sports writer  and a United States Senator  In my book  that was a great investment  I want to make sure that students today have the same opportunities that I had growing up  It s important for them as individuals  and it s critical for our country s future  In recent years  the deck has become increasingly stacked against students  College has become more expensive while some large lenders have taken advantage of students  Those students who are able to attend college often graduate saddled with debt and unable to buy a car or buy a house  Other graduates can t pursue public service jobs  in areas where we need help  because they can t afford to pay their loans on a public service salary  This bill will begin to turn tide in favor of students  It puts students first  makes college more affordable  helps recent graduates  and encourages public service  I also worked to ensure that military service members get more time to defer their student loan payments while they re on active duty  and I was pleased to provide more help for homeless and foster students  who too often face unique problems navigating the college aid process  Before I turn to some the details of the bill  I really want to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in moving these proposals forward and making sure it does right by our students  Raising Pell Grants First  this bill raises the maximum Pell Grant by 25 percent over four years to  5 400 per student  That will make a real difference for students in my home state of Washington  In Washington state  in the 1986  the maximum Pell Grant covered 53  of the costs at a public  four year college  Today it only covers 33  of those costs  By raising the maximum Pell Grant  this bill will help students in Washington state and across the country attend college  For Washington state  this bill will make another  39 6 million available in need based grants next year alone  Over five years  the bill will provide an additional  340 6 million for low income students  Reasonable Monthly Loan Payments This bill will also ensure that college graduates are not trapped by high loan payments after college  It guarantees that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their monthly income in student loan payments  This will bring immediate relief to students who are burdened with excessive loans  Another problem with high student loan debt is that it limits the career choices of college graduates  Many can t afford to take a job in public service and pay back their loans at the same time  This bill encourages public service by providing loan forgiveness for graduates who pursue careers in these areas  Helps Military Service Members As I worked on this bill  I thought it was very important to help out military service members who have student loans  I have worked to allow those who are serving in combat or national emergencies to defer their student loan payments during their deployments and as they transition out of service  Currently  the law limits how long service members can defer their payments to just three years  As we know  many of our military members have been on active duty much longer than that  So this bill lifts this three year limit and makes more service members eligible  Those who are serving our country have enough to worry about  Financial challenges and paying back student loans should not be something that they have to worry about when they transition back home  Opens Doors for Homeless and Foster Students I was also pleased to help improve college access for homeless and foster students  These students face tremendous barriers in their education  especially those who don t have a parent or guardian who s able to guide them through the process  In this bill  I worked to simplify the student aid application process and made homeless and foster students eligible for higher levels of assistance  Amendment by Senators Nelson  NE  and Burr Mr  President  there is one amendment that I m very concerned about because it would tear through this bill and undermine all the progress we re making for students  That amendment would allow higher subsidies for some lenders  including lenders who acted so irresponsibly in the recent student loan scandals  The amendment would take money away from students and take money away from Pell Grants  With this bill  we re trying to help more students afford college  This amendment would take money away from students and away from Pell Grants  and I don t see why we should change this bill to help fewer students and put the money back into the pockets of lenders  As we move forward on this bill  I hope that we ll reject efforts that hurt students  so we can pass this strong and effective student aid legislation  To me  it s simple  If we want our economy to grow  our people to succeed  and our country to be strong  we have to help more students get a college education  This bill will do just that  and I urge my colleagues to support it
