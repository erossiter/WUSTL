

                                                                                News Release          Murray Calls on Senate to Do the Right Thing  Pay for the Cost of Veterans   Healthcare Murray Amendment would avoid VA   train wreck    by providing  2 billion to pay for veterans   healthcare    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 12  2005                  WASHINGTON  D C      United States Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today offered her amendment to the  80 billion supplemental funding bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   The Murray Amendment would provide  2 billion in funding for a critical cost of war    healthcare for America  s veterans  including those returning home from Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom        Washington state has sent thousands of brave men and women to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan and now  a large group is returning home    including nearly 4 000 members of the National Guard          I am very concerned that when all of these new veterans come home and need medical care they re going to be pushed into a VA system that doesn t have the medical staff  facilities  or funding to take care of them     Murray said in her floor speech     There is a train wreck coming in veterans   healthcare  and I m offering an amendment to deal with this emergency now    before it turns into a crisis           Murray  who  to meet with soldiers from Washington state  said that the soldiers she met were all concerned about access to healthcare for themselves and their families upon their return home   Murray  who has supported every funding measure for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will support the emergency supplemental  but wants the Senate to fund the cost of veterans   healthcare as an integral cost of war            Murray  s amendment would enable the VA to absorb the influx of new veterans and reverse critical budget shortfalls  while still maintaining the quality of care for current veterans   Murray  s amendment does this by         Providing  525 million for mental health care for returning veterans  Many need help with post traumatic stress disorder    Providing  610 million for our newest veterans    so they do not have to compete with existing veterans for health care  and  Provides  40 million for every veterans regional network    so they can open new clinics and meet local needs  Today  most VA networks face a  40 million shortfall that hurts our veterans        As Americans  we made a promise to those who joined our military that we will take care of them when they come home     Murray said     It s a promise that all of us have to work together to keep  and that s why I m on the Senate floor today   This is not a Democratic issue   It s not a Republican issue   It s an American issue   And I m willing to work with anyone to make sure all of our veterans get the healthcare they were promised          The full text of Murray  s speech  as delivered on the Senate floor  follows     Mr  President  today in Iraq and Afghanistan our men and women in uniform are making great sacrifices to serve our country          Last month  I met with some of them in Baghdad and Kuwait  and we can be proud of their service   Each person I met with was a dedicated professional who was putting their duty above their personal well being        But I am very concerned that when all of these new veterans come home and need medical care they re going to be pushed into a VA system that doesn t have the medical staff  facilities  or funding to take care of them        There is a train wreck coming in veterans healthcare  and I m offering an amendment to deal with this emergency now    before it turns into a crisis        Today the VA healthcare system is overcrowded  under funded  and understaffed   It is struggling to deal with existing veterans and I fear what will happen when tens of thousands of new veterans are added to this already strained system        As Americans  we made a promise to those who joined our military that we will take care of them when they come home   It s a promise that all of us have to work together to keep  and that s why I m on the Senate floor today          This is not a Democratic issue  It s not a Republican issue   It s an American issue   And I m willing to work with anyone to make sure all of our veterans get the healthcare they were promised          I appreciate the leadership of many Senators    especially Senator Craig    who chairs the Senate Veterans Affairs committee on which I serve   I also want to thank Senator Hutchinson of Texas  who chairs the committee that funds veterans care   I appreciate these colleagues   commitment to our veterans   I look forward to working with them and many others to make sure we are doing everything we need to do to prepare for the influx so many new veterans        With Senator Akaka and others  I m offering a veterans healthcare amendment to the Emergency Supplemental   Our amendment recognizes that caring for our veterans is part of the cost of war        Our amendment does three things   First  it makes sure that all soldiers who will need healthcare when they return home from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom can get that healthcare   To do that  this amendment provides  610 million        Second  it provides funding for the mental health care of our newest veterans   Specifically  it provides  525 million for expanded mental health services    including  150 million to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder        Third  the amendment helps address the shortfalls that are crippling our regional VA networks   It provides  40 million to each and every VISN    Veterans   Integrated Service Network          This chart shows the 21 regional health networks   Each region will receive  40 million to spend on its priorities   For some areas  that will mean erasing big deficits   In others  it will help them hire more medical staff   In other parts of the country  they ll use it to buy medical equipment       That flexible funding will allow each region to prepare their staff and facilities for our newest veterans   It will put a total of  840 million where local communities need it most        In short  this amendment will ensure we can handle the health care needs of all of the veterans who will seek care after serving our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom        The total cost of the amendment is  1 98 billion  and let me explain how we arrived at that figure   First  we looked at the number of new veterans who will turn to the VA for care   We multiplied that by the average cost per patient   To that we added the cost of reversing the deficits facing our VA hospitals  and the cost of meeting increased mental healthcare needs          Some Senators may wonder if this is the appropriate vehicle to fund veterans   healthcare so let me say a word about that   I would have preferred to fund this critical need in the regular budget process    and I tried to do that several times last month in the Budget Committee  and here on the Senate floor with Senator Akaka          Unfortunately  our amendments were voted down   But the need is not going away   The shortfalls are only going to get worse   So if we re not going to take care of our veterans from Iraq in the regular budget  then we need to take care of them in the bill that funds our war efforts          Mr  President  this is the appropriate bill because the veterans   healthcare train wreck is an emergency  and because caring for our veterans is part of the cost of war   As I ve been talking about this amendment and discussing it with veterans  I ve been very pleased by the support it s received so far        This amendment is supported by  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  AMVETS  Disabled American Veterans  Paralyzed Veterans of America  and the VA workers who care for our veterans    represented by the American Federation of Government Employees  AFL CIO   I want to thank these organizations and their members for supporting the amendment and reaching out their Senators to call for its passage        Before I go any further  I want to note that veteran s healthcare is a very personal issue for me   My father was a disabled World War II veteran   When I was in college  I interned in a VA hospital in Seattle during the Vietnam War   And I became the first woman to serve on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee   The VA provides some of the best care  research  and treatment anywhere   VA employees have a unique understanding of the challenges our veterans face   And their dedication is unmatched   Like them  I want to make sure that this system works for every veteran of every war  and every generation          Today I want to share some specific examples    from throughout the country    that illustrate the emergency in veterans healthcare today   These examples don t come from me   They come from people who know our VA facilities first hand   A few days ago  I posted a form on my website    at murray senate gov    where veterans and their advocates can share their stories and examples with me          I ve been heartened with the things people have shared so far  and I want to invite other veterans to share their stories with me and with their own Senators   For anyone who thinks this is not an emergency or that it doesn t merit emergency funding  I invite you to listen closely   I m going to be talking about different places  but the overall problem is the same everywhere        For years  VA funding has not kept up with the growing demand for care and the rising cost of care   So VA networks around the country have held off making improvements   When a doctor or nurse left  they weren t replaced   When equipment needed to be purchased  it was put on hold   When a clinic needed to be opened  it was held in limbo   When there wasn t enough money in the operating budget  they started taking from the capital budget        Now all those years of chronic under funding are coming back to roost at the worst possible time   Just as we re about to have a major influx of new veterans    our VA facilities are facing deficits  staff shortages and inadequate facilities   Let me give you some of the examples that have been shared with me        In Alaska  as of yesterday  they are starting a waiting list for non emergency care for all new Priority 7 veterans who are not enrolled in VA primary care    that means these people can t get an appointment to see a doctor        In Colorado  the Eastern Colorado Health Care System is  7 25 million short this year          In California  last year  the VA Hospital in Los Angeles closed its psychiatric emergency room         In Florida  the VISN 8 facilities were facing a  150 million deficit earlier this year   One facility    the West Palm Beach Medical Center    has a deficit of  6 million        In Idaho  at the VA in Boise they ve resorted to hiring freezes        In Kentucky  veterans at the Louisville hospital who are having a type of bladder examination have to lie on a broken table because there s not money to replace that broken equipment        In Maine  the Togus VA has a  12 million deficit        In Minnesota  at the Minneapolis VA they ve got a  7 million shortfall   They have one of the VA s four sites for dealing with veterans with complex  multiple injuries  But they re not hiring any more staff for that specialized center because of the deficit        And as all of us who have visited our returning soldiers up at Walter Reed or Bethesda know  many  many more of them are returning with just these sorts of injuries        In Missouri  at the Kansas City VA Medical Center    they ve got a  10 million operating deficit   I m also told that in Missouri there aren t enough doctors and providers to see all the veterans   So if a veteran is less than 50 percent service connected disabled  they re put on a waiting list        In South Dakota  they re expecting to be  7 million in the red by the end of this fiscal year   The VA is proposing to save  2 million by not filling staff vacancies   I m told that they need 58 new beds and that some bed frames are held together with duct tape and wire   But    because of the deficit    they re not buying new beds   I m also told that the Black Hills Health Care System is  3 million in the whole   They ve had to use the capital budget to pay staff and other expenses        In Texas  at the Temple  Texas VA  nurses in inpatient care are working 16 hour days    several times a week    because there isn t enough staff   We know that nurses providing direct care should only be working 12 hour days because longer shifts can lead to medical errors and unsafe care        In Virginia  as of January  I understand that Virginia had a budget shortfall of  14 5 million        And in my home state of Washington    we ve got problems too   In Tacoma  at the American Lake VA    you can only get an appointment if you are 50 percent or more service connected disabled   In the Puget Sound    as of January    there was an  11 million deficit   So at the Seattle and American Lake VA they are leaving vacant positions unfilled   There are about 16 new vacancies every month    and those positions will remain empty   They hope to reduce the workforce by 160 full time equivalents by the end of this fiscal year        This is having a big impact on patients   For example  as of this month  the next appointment at the Seattle VA Urology Clinic isn t available until August   I can tell you that conditions like this are breaking the hearts of our VA personnel   They are frustrated at seeing so many veterans not get the care they have earned because Congress is not providing the money        I share these examples not to criticize or cast blame   We ve got problems like this in my state as well  as I ve detailed   I share them because we need to look at what  s happening and realize that our VA system is not prepared to handle a new generation of veterans        All of these examples    from more than a dozen states    point to one conclusion   The VA is having trouble taking care of the patients it has today   It is certainly not prepared to handle a new influx of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan   Many of these VA centers are in the hole for millions of dollars   They are not in a position to begin expanding care to meet the growing need   They can t do it alone    so we ve got to step in and help them out         Before I close  I want to address one claim that we may hear during this debate   Some Senators have suggested that the VA doesn  t need any additional funding because it has a reserve of  500 million   I was troubled by the idea that the VA may have extra money it s not using    while so many communities are struggling        So at a hearing last week of the Veterans Affairs Committee  I got to the bottom of it        At our hearing on April 7th  I asked the Acting Undersecretary for Veterans Healthcare  Dr  Jonathan Perlin  about it   I asked Dr  Perlin   Is there a  500 million reserve         Dr  Perlin replied  No       I don  t know where that might have been suggested  but there is no  500 million reserve that is sitting there for future projects      I share that with my colleagues to set the record straight          The VA is not sitting on any type of reserve that it can use for medical care and that answer comes straight from the man who runs the program nationwide   We ve got VA centers that are struggling in every part of the country   They can t deal with the caseload they have today   How in the world are they going to deal with all the new veterans who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan        We cannot  kick this can  down the road any longer   It s an emergency today  and if we don t deal with it now  it s going to be a crisis tomorrow        This is not a partisan issue   It s an American issue   I m willing to work with anyone who wants to make sure our country is prepared to care for all the new veterans who will be coming home soon   They were there for us   Now we need to be there for them        I urge my colleagues to support the Veterans Health Amendment          If you re concerned about this  perhaps I mentioned your state  or you ve heard from your own veterans  let s talk about it   Let s find a way to make it work   Because no matter what party we are in  we are Americans first        And we all have an obligation    as President Lincoln said     to care for him who shall have borne the battle  and for his widow  and his orphan           We need to pass the Veterans Health Amendment  and keep the promise to America s veterans
