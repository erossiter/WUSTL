Release  Wednesday  September 6  2006     Washington  D C      Today the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees the Internal Revenue Service s budget urged IRS Commissioner Mark Everson to suspend a controversial plan to outsource the collection of debt to private agencies           I m deeply concerned that your plan would not adequately protect taxpayer privacy  would not ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly and respectfully  would not guarantee any cost savings to the U S  Treasury  and would pre empt the Senate s debate over outsourcing tax collection   Murray said in her letter to Everson        Murray is the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies       The full text of the letter follows     September 6  2006       The Honorable Mark W  Everson  Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  Internal Revenue Building  1111 Constitution Avenue  N W   Washington  DC  20224       Dear Mr  Commissioner        I am writing to urge you to immediately suspend your efforts to outsource the collection of taxpayer debt to private collection agencies  PCAs    I understand that you plan to assign thousands of cases to three private debt collection agencies as soon as this week   You are proceeding with this effort despite an explicit vote by the House Appropriations Committee prohibiting you from moving forward with it   You should suspend your efforts immediately so that the Full Senate and the Appropriations Conference Committee can review this proposal        I m deeply concerned that your plan would not adequately protect taxpayer privacy  would not ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly and respectfully  would not guarantee any cost savings to the U S  Treasury  and would pre empt the Senate s debate over outsourcing tax collection        First  your agency has an abysmal record of protecting taxpayer privacy  and this effort could further threaten taxpayer privacy   I don  t need to remind you that we have witnessed a number of instances in the recent past in which your agency has failed to protect private taxpayer information from your contractors   Unfortunately  the House Government Reform Committee gave the Treasury Department the grade of a   D     for your performance in complying with the Federal Information Security Management Act  the principal law requiring federal agencies to provide information security protections to protect data confidentiality   Unfortunately  that Committee has concluded that the Treasury Department  s performance has actually worsened in the past three years in this area   Your agency s own history offers more reasons for concern  As you know  ten years ago your agency employed private collection agencies to collect tax debts   That program was terminated after it was found to be a dismal failure   Among the failures that led to its termination was the inability of your agency to adequately protect private taxpayer information          Second  I am concerned that private debt collectors will not show the level of professionalism  sensitivity and respect that taxpayers deserve   There is no question that people who owe back taxes must pay their debt to the government   At the same time  every taxpayer should have the right to interact with a professional IRS agent when it comes to dealing with contested tax liabilities   They should not be required to deal with a private contractor who might be insensitive to a taxpayer  s individual predicament   In 2005  the Federal Trade Commission received more consumer complaints about private debt collectors than any other industry        I am also concerned that your policy could create a two class system of debt collection   The National Taxpayer Advocate has said that the nature of the debts that you intend to transfer to PCAs will result in these agencies going after   basically the most vulnerable taxpayers    in our society   We should not allow a system to emerge where better off taxpayers get the benefit of interacting with a professional IRS agent  while economically disadvantaged taxpayers are relegated to the harassing tactics of private collection agents          Third  the Taxpayer Advocate has also questioned the cost effectiveness of this initiative   You testified before the House Transportation Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee that it would be more cost effective for IRS agents to collect these debts themselves   I have seen data indicating that using private debt collection agencies will cost the Federal Government almost 25 cents for every dollar collected because of the commissions that must be paid to the collection agencies   It would cost the IRS roughly three cents for every dollar collected if these collection activities were collected in house   Initially  I am told that it will require 55 IRS personnel to oversee 75 private tax collectors   Taken as a whole  I have to wonder whether the Federal Treasury will really benefit at all from your initiative          Finally  I have to question your motives in rushing to implement this program while Congress is still debating its merits   More than 400 Members of the House of Representatives approved a bill that included a prohibition on outsourcing tax collection   Why do you find it necessary to move forward with this initiative at this time   If you insist on going forward with this potentially misguided initiative  you should at least wait until Congress has completed its debate regarding its merits   Your effort to start this initiative this week is  at best  premature   At worst  it represents a deliberately ploy to jump out ahead of Congress  s own deliberations as to the wisdom of your initiative   You should suspend this effort immediately         Sincerely         Patty Murray  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies
