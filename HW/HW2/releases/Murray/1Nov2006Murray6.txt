Conservancy for taking the long view and focusing on the common good instead of quick fixes and  what s it in for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 1  2006     Tacoma  Washington     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  delivered the keynote address at a luncheon honoring conservation leaders in Pierce County   More than 600 people attended the event  which was sponsored by the Cascade Land Conservancy and held at the Tacoma Convention Center     The group presented its Helen Engle Lifetime Achievement Award to George Russell for his support of environmental sustainability        In her remarks  Murray called for a return to the traditional values of community and a focus on the long term good   Perspectives that she said have been missing in business and government          If we continue on this path    if our nation makes decisions based on instant gratification and  what s in it for me     we won t be leaving much for the next generation   Murray said   As a good friend said to me  we have forgotten if you want to have a good neighborhood  you need to be a good neighbor        Senator Murray s full remarks follow     Thank you Joan for that introduction  and thank you to Craig Ueland  Ryan Dicks  and Ryan Mello   I also want to thank your president  chair and board members   This is an impressive turnout    I m excited to be here today  and I m really energized to see such a strong turnout in support of the Cascade Land Conservancy        Coming to a luncheon like this always reminds me of the best and the worst part of my job as your United States Senator   The best part is that I get to represent the greatest state in the nation    the State of Washington    where smart  enterprising people work together to carry out our highest values   That s the best part        The worst part is that to do my job I have to go to the other Washington    the one they built on a swamp   Talk about different worlds   That s why coming to an event like this energizes me   Being here with all of you reminds me of what I m fighting for back in Washington  D C           I want to congratulate the local heroes we re going to honor today for the work you do and the example you set   Here in Washington state  we have a great tradition of preserving the places that make our region unique  and the CLC has taken that tradition to new heights        I ve been honored to work with the CLC over the years to help protect at risk land  and to make sure we leave the right legacy for the next generation   I ve been able to work with all of you to secure funding for the Skykomish River  Maury Island  Raging River  and Yakima River projects   And this year  I continue to work on funding land acquisition for the Cascade Checkerboard   You have some great projects you re working on like the Green Seattle Partnership and the Green Tacoma Partnership  These are really creative efforts to help restore our urban forests and parkland        Today I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the fight in Washington  D C   but first I really want to put your efforts in the broader context of where we are as a country and where we re headed        Your work is a radical departure from the prevailing ethic of our day  and a true reflection of the best traditions of our country   If that sounds like a contradiction  let me explain        We all know this is an incredibly challenging time for our country   We have the War in Iraq  a nuclear North Korea  and terror threats here at home   We have tremendous needs in our local communities for healthcare  transportation and housing   We have families sacrificing while a loved one is deployed overseas  and we have veterans returning home who need our help  We have all these challenges that we need to face together  and yet our country is deeply polarized        In this environment  many people don t know where to turn or what to rely on to get us through these tough times          I think the answer is simple   We need to embrace the values that helped our country emerge from past wars and the Great Depression   Values we don t hear much about like sacrifice  community  democracy  and hard work        You see  I believe that in tough times  we need to turn back to our core values because they show us where we ve come from  and they guide us to where we need to go        As I look around  I don t see those traditional values in great favor  I often don t see a real commitment to the long term outcome or the common good        Instead  too often I see a mindset that s based on  short term    quick fix   and  what s in it for me       sort of the Enron philosophy         We see that attitude in financial investments  where too often decisions are made on the next quarter instead of the next decade   We see it in consumer spending  where people buy things on credit that they don t need and can t afford          And most troubling  we see it in our government in budget decisions on healthcare  transportation  housing  and the environment        If we continue on this path    if our nation makes decisions based on instant gratification and  what s in it for me     we won t be leaving much for the next generation         Our country has always declared   We re all in this together  with common spaces  public schools  and shared responsibilities          But today the message seems to be   Go into your own house  and shut your own doors  because what s happening to you is more important than what s happening in your neighborhood           We see it in our domestic and our foreign policies   As a good friend said to me  we have forgotten if you want to have a good neighborhood  you need to be a good neighbor        Now I m not going to argue against self interest   It s a fine motivator  but it can t be the only influence         There has to be more than  what s it in for me  if our country is going to move forward together   And there has to more than individual gain if our country is going to address the common challenges we face        The answer in my mind is to return to those traditional values that have sustained our country over so many generations   And that s what the Cascade Land Conservancy does   You had the courage to look at the long term   For some organizations that would be a 10 year plan  but you created a 100 year plan          Just think about that    while our entire society is focused on today and this week  you re challenging us to think on a much longer timeframe   While everyone else is planting annuals  you re planting trees        And while so much of our society is focused on  what s in it for me   you re focused on what s in it for us   That s why it s so energizing to come to a lunch like this and talk with people who are fighting for those great values everyday        I m going to take your energy and your commitment with me back to Washington  D C   and I m gonna need it  because it s tough time in the nation s capitol        At the federal level  investments are going in the wrong direction   Healthcare  transportation  and the environment have seen devastating cuts        Now politicians will tell you that there s just not enough money   And that s true   In this era of deficits  we can t fund everything   But it s a question of priorities          When I see how this Administration and Congress have treated the Land and Water Conservation Fund  it s clear   Back in 2000  President Bush said he would fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund   That would be about  900 million   But since 2001  their budget proposals have steadily declined   Now we re at about one third of the promised amount         I fight for more funding in the Senate   Norm Dicks fights for more funding in the House   But between the White House and the Congressional majority    it s really hard to hold onto the funding we ve secured   That s frustrating because I know how effective you can be when you have the right support from our government and from our community        As I think about those values I mentioned  I think about when I was growing up and the values my parents instilled in me and my brothers and sisters   We grew up with a sense that we were all in this together   That s the spirit we need to recapture as a country  and that s the value that you embody in your everyday work   We are all in this together        It s a tremendous challenge for our communities  our state  and our country  but those who have the courage and vision to look out 100 years never shy away from a challenge        So  thank you for working every day to protect our great places   Thank you for setting an example that we can think beyond ourselves and we can look beyond today   Thank you for leaving our grandchildren with a beautiful legacy   And most important  thank you for standing up for the values that make our country strong
