adds  1 billion in targeted funding toward bridge rehabilitation and replacement in the Transportation Appropriations bill    For Immediate Release  Monday  September 10  2007       Listen to Senator Murray speak about her amendment on the Senate floor   Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA   Chair of the Senate Appropriations Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development  THUD  Subcommittee added a  1 billion amendment that would fund the replacement and rehabilitation of structurally deficient bridges across the country  Senator Murray offered the amendment to the Senate THUD Appropriations bill  It was agreed to by a vote of 60 33  Increasing traffic has put added stress on a system that simply wasn t designed for it and  as a result  our bridges are deteriorating far faster than we can finance their replacement  Murray said in a speech today on the Senate floor  My amendment will allow for a historic increase in Federal bridge funding  a boost of nearly 20 percent  Senator Murray s amendment provides an additional  1 billion for activities authorized under the Federal Highway Administrations  FHWA  Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation program  This program provides grants to each State for bridge replacement  bridge rehabilitation  preventative maintenance  seismic retrofitting  bridge inspections  and activities designed to protect bridges and extend their life spans  Under the Murray amendment  the THUD bill would remain within its budget allocations  The Full Appropriations Committee re allocated unused funding from other areas in order to cover the spending  For the past five years  an average of  5 3 billion has been spent on bridge rehabilitation and replacement  The Murray amendment would add to this level by about 20 percent  The following is a state by state breakdown of how the extra  1 billion Senator Murray added today would be spent     Alabama 15 555 494 Montana 2 822 240   Alaska 3 039 702 Nebraska 5 692

indeed  the entire world  watched in horror as the I 35W bridge in Minneapolis  Minnesota collapsed into the Mississippi River  Given the scope of the disaster  it is miraculous that the fatalities weren t even greater  Thirteen people lost their lives and over 100 were injured that horrible day  And we will all remember the horrendous vision of that yellow school bus  full of children    that came within just a few feet of tragedy  The National Transportation Safety Board is still conducting its investigation into the exact causes of the bridge collapse  But the horror of that incident has appropriately focused the nation on whether we are investing adequately in a national highway system that is fragile and aging  Mr  President  the troubling conditions of our nations highways and bridges should not have been a surprise to the media or to our policy makers  This is not a story that has been kept under wraps  This is not a case where the true conditions were just suddenly revealed in a groundbreaking study  The U S  Department of Transportation has  by law  been required to publish regular reports on the conditions and performance of Americas highway infrastructure  The report is submitted to Congress and is posted on the web  The DOT s report was used extensively in the debate we had with the Bush Administration four years ago over the appropriate amount of funding that should be authorized in the highway bill  This report from the DOT is amplified by regular annual report cards published by the American Society of Civil Engineers along with regular studies by other groups  The difference today  Mr  President  is that the nightmare became a reality for the people of Minnesota and Americans across the country watched live on television  While we have built a national highway system that is the envy of the world  it is now no secret that our government has failed to adequately fund the maintenance needs of that system  Increasing traffic has put added stress on a system that simply wasn t designed for it  And  as a result  our bridges are deteriorating far faster than we can finance their replacement  This is why more than one in every four bridges on US highways is rated as deficient  Put another way  fully 27 percent of our 600 000 bridges have aged so much that their physical condition or their ability to withstand current traffic levels is simply inadequate  Roughly half of these deficient bridges  or about 78 000 bridges across the nation  are structurally deficient  That means the Department of Transportation considers the physical condition of these bridges to be poor or worse  These bridges require immediate attention  and many of them will need to have weight limits just to keep them in service  For a portion of these bridges  their physical condition is so bad that they are unsafe and need to be replaced  The other half of deficient bridges  or another 80 000 bridges across the nation  are functionally obsolete  They dont meet todays design standards  they dont conform to todays safety requirements  and they are handling traffic far beyond their design  These deficient bridges are not just found off the beaten path  Indeed  over 6 000 bridges that are considered deficient are located on the National Highway System  the roadway system designated as most important to the nations economy  defense and mobility  There are deficient bridges found in every state across the nation  My own state of Washington has more than 2 300 deficient bridges But certain of our states are struggling more than others   Iowa has more than 6 600 deficient bridges  Oklahoma has more than 7 400 deficient bridges  Pennsylvania has almost 9 600 deficient bridges  Texas has more than 10 000 deficient bridges  and California has more than 7 000 deficient bridges with more than 2 000 of those deficient bridges on the National Highway System   The Department of Transportation evaluated the complete picture across the nation just last year when it published its conditions and performance report for 2006  That report concluded that there is a  65 3 billion backlog of repairs that are needed on US bridges by all levels of government  Unfortunately  the challenge of addressing this issue comprehensively is going to have to wait for the next highway reauthorization bill  But I have offered an amendment to this bill that will add  1 billion to the resources available to all 50 states to help address their most critical bridge replacement and repair needs  This amendment will not bust the budget  It can be accommodated within the budget ceiling that governs our subcommittee bill  It does not bust through that ceiling or bust through the discretionary spending cap imposed by the Budget Resolution  Working with Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran  our subcommittee was allocated additional outlays that were not used by other Subcommittees specifically to accommodate the cost of this amendment  My amendment would distribute this billion dollars strictly according to the formula that already exists in the code for the bridge replacement and rehabilitation program  This formula  by law  takes into account    The physical condition of bridges in each State  The cost to rehabilitate or replace deficient bridges  Current safety standards and traffic demands  and The role of the bridges in the overall transportation system   Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the distribution of this funding to all fifty states be included in the record at this point  Consistent with the rules that are already in the law for the bridge program  these additional funds will be available to the states for   Bridge replacement  Bridge rehabilitation  Preventative maintenance  Seismic retrofitting  Bridge inspections  and he installation of countermeasures designed to protect bridges and extend their lifespans   Importantly  Mr  President  my amendment does include one restriction that is not included in current law  My amendment will require the Secretary of Transportation to ensure that these additional funds be used to enhance planned expenditures by the states for bridge construction and repair  Under current highway law  states have the flexibility to use obligational authority for many different uses  States may transfer funding between program activities so they can target Federal funds on their most urgent needs  My amendment would not disturb that flexibility for the over  40 billion that we are allocating to the states in regular Federal aid funding  However  my amendment would require the States to use the additional billion dollars that we allocate with this amendment solely for their most critical bridge activities  Mr  President  this amendment is a very measured response to a very big problem  I know that our states need even greater resources to address their bridge repair needs  But my amendment will allow for a historic increase in Federal bridge funding  a boost of nearly 20 percent  And it will do so while working within the constraints of the Budget Resolution  I urge my fellow Senators to support this amendment  The American people deserve to feel safe on our roads and bridges  We should take every step necessary to ensure that they are
