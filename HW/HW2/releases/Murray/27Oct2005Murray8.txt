                                                                News Release          Murray Stands Up for Veterans   Unemployment Services at Senate Hearing    For Immediate Release  Thursday  October 27  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash    a key member of the Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee  today stood up for unemployment benefits for our nation  s veterans   Murray  whose own father was a disabled WWII veteran  and who has held roundtables across Washington state to discuss employment options for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  questioned the Administration  s efforts to force disabled veterans off of unemployment benefits and back into the workplace          I believe in providing employment services to disabled Americans   But the states can  t provide services for these individuals  and the applicable jobs are few and far between   I question any effort to force more disabled veterans off IU and into the workplace  when we have not worked to fund the services they need  or to help create the jobs they are fit for     Murray said at a hearing of the Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee       In Washington state  disabled individuals have a 70 percent unemployment rate and 14 000 people are waiting for vocational rehabilitation   Any suggestion of forcing disabled veterans to seek employment instead of Individual Unemployability benefit  IU   means forcing them to compete with thousands of disabled Americans            Let me be clear that I oppose any effort to increase the scrutiny of our veterans  claims    solely to save money    especially when chances are that veterans more than 70  disabled will likely find it very difficult to get and keep employment     Murray said         A full transcript of Murray  s remarks at today  s Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee Hearing follows        Thank you Mr  Chairman  I would like to thank you and Ranking Member Akaka for hosting today  s hearing on this issue    And I also want to thank both of our panels for being here today        Mr  Chairman  I am very concerned about the need to provide employment services to veterans   But there are some veterans who    because of their injuries    are simply unable to work   We need to ensure that we are taking care of them in the most effective way possible  as well        In general  I do not believe the system is broken    we are providing the Individual Unemployability benefit we promised our severely disabled veterans   But I do believe it is essential we ensure that veterans receiving    or in process of receiving    IU have access to medical and employment services         Mr  Chairman  I am concerned that an effort to increase the scrutiny we put severely disabled veterans under will increase the stigma on veterans trying to access the resources they were promised   This will hurt our veterans        I also worry that it will demand increasing the VA  s discretionary budget by substantial amounts with little known or quantifiable benefit   As you know  we are here today to talk about veterans who have been granted IU benefits because their disabilities were categorized  after much scrutiny  at 70 percent or above          This means that  beyond physical injuries that prevent them from participating in many activities  they could have trouble with mental health issues such as suicidal thoughts  problems with speech  near continuous panic or depression  impaired impulse control  and difficulty in adapting to stressful environments          To mandate new screenings and work endlessly to get veterans with a 70 percent disability rating to work seems unnecessarily burdensome for our disabled veterans   As much as I wish I could sit here and say they will easily work again  I think reality has shown us it is a constant and severe struggle        Mr  Chairman  I believe in providing employment services to disabled Americans   But the states can  t provide services for these individuals  and the applicable jobs are few and far between   I question any effort to force more disabled veterans off IU and into the workplace  when we have not worked to fund the services they need  or to help create the jobs they are fit for        In my state of Washington  disabled individuals have a 70  unemployment rate  and I suspect that is close to the national average   14 000 people are waiting for vocational rehabilitation   When we talk about trying to force disabled veterans to seek employment instead of IU  we are talking about forcing them to compete with thousands of disabled Americans          Let me be clear that I oppose any effort to increase the scrutiny of our veterans  claims    solely to save money    especially when chances are that veterans more than 70  disabled will likely find it very difficult to get and keep employment          For example  the proposed review of 72 000 IU PTSD cases has already increased the stigma surrounding PTSD   And on top of the 800 000 other cases the VBA needs to review this year  these cases will drain limited resources and delay benefits to thousands of veterans   Any review sets a dangerous precedent and increases the stigma against our veterans  and will drain limited VBA resources          In fact  one veteran in New Mexico has tragically committed suicide due to the review   Mr  Chairman  I would like to enter into the record an article about Greg Morris  a Vietnam Veteran who killed himself last week   The article states          On Oct  8  Greg Morris  57  was found by his wife  Ginger  in their home in Chama  N M   For years  Morris had been receiving monthly V A  benefits in compensation for post traumatic stress disorder   Next to his gun and Purple Heart was a folder of information on how the V A  planned to review veterans who received PTSD checks to make sure those veterans really deserved the money         The scrutiny needs to stop   This Committee needs to have a clear understanding of what the VA will get out of any effort to look harder at benefits before moving forward with any effort         Last week  I hosted a hearing of the Employment   Workplace Safety Subcommittee on   Enhancing Cooperation between Employers and Guardsmen Reservists      That hearing highlighted the vital need to increase resources for our Guard and Reserve to help them access employment after their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Instead of looking for ways to strip severely disabled veterans  benefits  this committee needs to examine how to this Committee should have a full hearing on USERRA  TAP  Labor Vets and other programs          We should also analyze why the system is failing our Guard and Reserve and other veterans   Although I think efforts need to be made to provide veterans with employment assistance  I believe we should direct our focus to those who are more likely to find employment         Mr  Chairman  you and I have often discussed the limited budget under which we operate today   And I am concerned about any proposals being put forth today that would demand increased funding to try and get veterans with 70  disability fully employed          I wish we could make that happen  but after 13 years working on these issues  I think it is fair to say    as much as we hate to say it    that some square pegs don  t fit into the round hole no matter how hard you push   And  in the meantime  we have thousands of recent Iraq veterans we are not trying to help get employment        What are we doing to improve services for them   Why are we focusing on stripping benefits from disabled veterans when we have thousands of Iraq vets needing our help now        And why    if we are concerned about the increased number of veterans getting IU    are we not working harder with thousands of OIF and OEF veterans who are coming back home everyday and having trouble transitioning back to civilian life        These are the questions I leave the Committee with today    and I think our nation s veterans deserve an answer   Thank you Mr  Chairman
