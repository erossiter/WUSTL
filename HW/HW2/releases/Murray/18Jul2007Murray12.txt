                                                                         News Release          After All Night Session  Senate Republicans Block Vote to Redeploy Troops in Iraq Senator Murray Urges President and Senate Republicans to Redeploy Troops  Refocus on Al Qaeda  Rebuild Our Military and Respect our Veterans    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  July 18  2007     Washington  D C    Today  after an all night session of the U S  Senate  in which U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  and other Senate Democrats pushed for a vote on a measure to redeploy U S  forces in Iraq  Senate Republicans blocked the Senate from voting  The Senate was considering the Levin Reed amendment that would redeploy U S  forces in Iraq by April 30th  2008  Senator Murray is a co sponsor of the amendment  The amendment was blocked by a vote of 52 47  Under Senate rules  60 votes would have been necessary to move forward to a vote  Prior to her vote  Senator Murray made the following statement of support for the Levin Reed amendment  It is time for President Bush to finally accept what the American people already know  The war in Iraq is not making us safer  and our troops should not remain in the crossfire of that country s civil war  Unfortunately  President Bush refuses to listen to the generals  to the commissions  and to the experts  He stubbornly insists that leaving American troops in the middle of a civil war will somehow cause factions that have been fighting for centuries to agree to work together  We ve tried that approach  and we ve paid dearly  We ve given the Iraqi government the time to reach the agreements needed to form a stable government  We ve done our part  The Iraqi government has not done its part  We should not ask more Americans to sacrifice their lives for an Iraqi government that is unwilling to make even the smallest sacrifices for their people and their future  Because the President refuses to follow a responsible path forward  we in Congress must force a change in our country s policy on Iraq  For months  Democrats have been trying to force that change  We ve been blocked by Republicans who ve continued to support the President s war without end  Now  finally  we are starting to see responsible Senators break ranks with the President and work with us to improve our security  The upcoming vote on the Levin   Reed Amendment is a test for all Senators  Do they stand alone with the President  or do they support redeploying our troops and making America more secure  That is the choice every Senator will have to make on this vote  As we look at the challenges in Iraq  and the threats around the world    Democrats want to do four things     Redeploy our troops from Iraq  Refocus our fight on Al Qaeda  Rebuild our military  and Respect our veterans   That is the responsible way to protect our citizens  keep our country safe  and keep our military strong  We have tried the President s direction  and where has it led us  More than 3 600 American service members have been killed and another 20 000 wounded  We ve spent nearly  500 billion taxpayer dollars  and under the President s approach there is no end in sight  1  REDEPLOY OUR TROOPS It s time for a new direction  and it begins with redeploying our troops  Iraq s civil war cannot be solved by our military  It can only be solved when the Iraqis decide for themselves that working together will bring them a better future  As a foreign military power  we cannot force the Iraqis to set aside their differences and work together  They have to reach that conclusion themselves if Iraq is to ever become a peaceful  stable country  When I was in Iraq in 2005  I met with the leaders of the various factions  Each of them saw themselves as representing their one group  not as people who needed to come together for the greater good  Unfortunately  since my visit  those sectarian differences have only gotten stronger  The Iraqis have not made the progress that only they can make  and I don t think we should keep asking Americans to risk their lives for an Iraqi government that s not doing its job  So our first step must be to redeploy our troops out of Iraq  The Levin Reed Amendment sets a firm deadline to begin the redeployment beginning 120 days after enactment  and it sets April 30th  2008 as the date to complete the redeployment  Now this does not mean that every service member will be coming home  As Senator Levin said  we will need to keep some service members in Iraq for counter terrorism  for training  and to protect American interests  Other troops will be needed in other places around the globe as we stay on the offensive against Al Qaeda and other terrorists  But under this amendment  the bulk of U S  troops will be redeployed from Iraq  2  REFOCUS ON AL QAEDA Second  after we redeploy our troops  we need to refocus our energy on defeating Al Qaeda  Today  the Director of National Intelligence released the   The report says Al Qaeda has quote protected and regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability  The report also says that Al Qaeda has established a safe haven in northwest Pakistan  has operational lieutenants  and still has its top leadership in place  And it is determined to strike us here at home  So while the President has kept our military tied up in Iraq  Al Qaeda has been gaining strength  and we must defeat it  3  REBUILD OUR MILTIARY Third  we need to rebuild our military  According to generals who have testified before Congress  the war in Iraq has weakened our military s readiness  left our equipment destroyed  hurt our ability to respond to disasters at home  and left our troops without fully rounded training  Today  we are forcing a very tough tempo on our service members  The Pentagon has extended tours of duties for our troops  The Administration has deployed troops sooner than planned  The Administration has sent troops without all the training and equipment they could have received  The Administration has deployed troops without the down time at home that our service members and their families deserve  In fact  56 members of the U S  Senate tried to fix that last week with the Webb Amendment  but a majority of Republican Senators blocked us  Our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address the strains on our service members  so we can remain the best in the world  Readiness   Equipment The Iraq War is also impairing our readiness by destroying our equipment  For example  the Army is supposed to have five brigades  worth of equipment pre positioned overseas  But because of the war in Iraq  the Army is depleting those reserves  General Peter Schoomaker told the Senate in March  It will take us two years to rebuild those stocks   Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee  3 15 07  Our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address the strains on equipment and personnel  so we can remain the best in the world  Readiness   Training for Other Missions To meet the President s surge  the Pentagon has been sending some troops to Iraq earlier than planned and keeping other units there longer than planned  That means that troops are get less time at home  less time between deployments  and less time to train  Commanders are forced to shorten the training their troops receive  so they re focusing on the specific training they need for Iraq  but not for other potential conflicts  Now that makes sense  If there s limited training time  we want all that time devoted to their most immediate need  However  many military leaders are warning that this fast pace diminishes our ability to respond to other potential conflicts  Here s how the Colonel who commands the 1st Marine Regime put it   Our greatest challenge is and will remain available training time  and because that time is limited  our training will continue to focus on the specific mission in Iraq  This has  and will continue to  limit our ability to train for other operations      Colonel Lewis Craparotta  U S  Marine Corps  Commander  1st Marine Regiment  Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07    Army Colonel Michael Beech told the Senate in April that he believes our training strategy is broad enough to support a variety of other events  But he added    However  if deployed in support of other emerging contingencies  I would be concerned with the atrophy of some specific tactical skills unique to the higher intensity conflicts      Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07  So military commanders are telling us they re concerned that our ability to train for other missions has been limited and certain tactical skills have had to take a backseat to Iraq  We need to make sure our troops are trained for whatever conflict they might face  and changing direction in Iraq will allow us to do that  Readiness   Responding to Disasters at Home The Iraq War has especially impacted the readiness of our National Guard  The chief of the National Guard Bureau  Lt  General Stephen Blum  testified that the readiness of National Guard forces is at an historic low  General Blum said that     Eighty eight percent of the forces that are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped today in the Army National Guard      1 31 07   Not only do we rely on our Guard and Reserve members around the world  but we rely on them here at home to respond to natural disasters and emergencies  With fire season upon us on the West Coast  I m very concerned that we don t have all the capabilities at home we should have   After the horrible tornados in Kansas  the Governor of Kansas said that recovery efforts were hampered because there weren t enough personnel or equipment  Those resources were in Iraq  not here at home  Colonel Timothy Orr of the U S  Army National Guard told the Senate that his brigade s homeland security capabilities have been degraded  He testified    Our ability as a brigade to perform these  homeland  missions continues to be degraded by continued equipment shortages  substitutions  and the cross leveling of equipment between the state and nation to support our deploying units     Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07     4  RESPECT OUR VETERANS Finally  we need to respect our veterans  That means keeping our promise to meet their needs as they come home  whether it s for healthcare  benefits  education or support  Since Democrats have controlled Congress  we have made dramatic progress for our veterans  First we passed a budget that treated our veterans as a priority  I serve on the Budget Committee and I was pleased to work with Chairman Conrad to pass a budget resolution that provides over  43 1 billion for veterans  care  Specifically  our budget   Increases funding for veterans by  3 5 billion over the President s proposal  Funds 98  of the Independent Budget  which is devised by veterans service organizations and Rejects the higher fees and co payments that the President had proposed  which would have forced more than 100 000 veterans to leave the VA health system   We also passed a Supplemental  that for the first time since the start of the war  provided funding to help meet the needs of our veterans  We provided  1 78 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs to help those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  to reduce the backlog in benefits  and to ensure medical facilities are maintained at the highest level  And just last week    This proposal will address many of the problems that came to light from the Walter Reed investigations  It will ensure service members don t fall through the cracks as the move from the Pentagon to the VA  It will help us diagnose  prevent and treat PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury  And it addresses the problems with unfair disability ratings among other improvements  It is time to change course in Iraq  So far the President has been unwilling to recognize the reality on the ground  Here in the Senate  we have an opportunity to force the President to change course in a responsible way  The Levin Reed amendment gives every Senator a choice  either you want to stay the course in Iraq and leave Americans in the middle of a violent civil war  or you believe it s time for a change  I urge my colleagues to do the responsible thing for our troops  their families  our military s readiness and the fight against terror by voting for this amendment
