                                                                                                        News Release          Murray Says Bush Administration s Failures on Veterans Care and Iraq War Planning Demand Congressional Oversight Senate Floor Speech Remarks    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 27  2006          Mr  President  the hardest decisions we make in the Senate involve asking our fellow Americans to risk their health and life in defense of our country   The cost to our country  our communities  and our families is so great that    in any war    we have an obligation to make sure we re doing right by our service members  our veterans  and our country   That  s why we in Congress need to ask questions like          Do our troops have a clear mission       Is there a plan to achieve that mission       Do our troops have the support and equipment they need to succeed         Do we have the right people in place        And are we taking care of our veterans when they return home from military service       For too long  this Congress has not done its job asking those questions and demanding answers  Here in Congress we have a responsibility to make sure that the Bush Administration    or any administration    is fulfilling those critical requirements  So today I rise to offer an update on where we stand on some of those questions and to share some disturbing news from recent reports        The evidence I ll share today points to five disappointing conclusions  and they all demand hearings and accountability         First  the Bush Administration misled Congress about its failures in planning for the care of America s veterans      Second  the Bush Administration still doesn t have a plan to care for our veterans       Third  we don t have a clear mission in the War in Iraq   That fight has greatly impacted our ability to prosecute the broader War on Terror  and    according to the latest intelligence estimate    has helped to fuel new terrorist recruits       Fourth  the Bush Administration has put politics over progress in Iraq and at home   In Iraq  it sent political cronies to staff the provisional government    instead of experienced professionals who could get the job done   From Brownie at FEMA to new reports about the HUD Secretary  the Bush Administration puts politics over competence       And finally  Congress is not doing its job of oversight   Unless we hold hearings  until we demand answers  and until we require accountability  we ll just keep muddling through with the same poor results       We can do better  we can be safer  and we can be more successful    but it s got to start with an honest assessment of what s working  what s not  and what we need to change       1  Bush Administration Misled Congress on Veterans Care    In that spirit  I want to discuss those five conclusions I mentioned  starting with the fact that the Bush Administration misled Congress about             Bush Administration Misled Congress on Veterans Care     its inadequate efforts to care for our veterans   Over the past two budget years  the Bush Administration was dramatically wrong in its planning for veterans  healthcare   The result was a  3 billion shortfall last summer   This was not just a failure in planning   It meant failing to get veterans the services they required in a timely fashion   It meant veterans had to face long waits to see a doctor   It meant they didn  t get the care they deserved        That horrible planning is no way to care for the veterans who have sacrificed so much for us   We can do better  That s why after that failure  I joined with Senators Akaka  Durbin  and Salazar   Together  we asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate what happened at the VA  This is the report we got back   Frankly  the answers are damning  and they cast doubt on whether we can rely on the VA for accurate numbers and straight answers         GAO s 4 Findings    I want to focus on four findings  First  the GAO found that the VA knew it had serious problems with its budget  but failed to notify us in Congress   Even worse  it misled us   The report suggests that the VA could still be sending us inaccurate information in its quarterly reports   Second  the GAO found that the VA was basing its budgets on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation  and insufficient data    Third  the Pentagon failed to give the VA up to date information about how many service members would be coming down the pipeline into the VA  Finally  the GAO found that the VA did not adequately plan for the impact of service members from Iraq and Afghanistan        VA Misled Congress    For me  I think one of the most disturbing findings is that the VA kept assuring us in Congress that everything was fine    while inside the VA it was clear that shortfalls were growing   The VA became aware it would have problems in October 2004    but didn t admit those problems until June of 2005  Veterans were telling me of long lines and delays in care   For months  I tried to give the VA more money  but the Administration fought me every step of the way   And who paid the price for the VA s deceptions  America s veterans  and that s just wrong          Timeline of VA Deceptions    Let me walk through some of the deceptions found in the report   It shows a very troubling gap between what the VA knew and what the VA told us   According to the GAO report  starting back in             Murray Illustrates the Timeline of VA Deceptions     October 2004  the VA knew money was tight  It anticipated serious budget challenges  and created a  Budget Challenges  working group   Two months later  in December 2004  the budget group made internal recommendations to deal with the shortfall  It suggested delaying new initiatives and shifting around funding         Two months later  in February 2005  the Bush Administration released its budget proposal for 2006  The GAO found that budget was based on  unrealistic assumptions  errors in estimation and insufficient data       A week later at a hearing    on February 15th  2005  I asked the VA Secretary if the President s budget was sufficient   He told me   I have many of the same concerns  and I end up being satisfied that we can get the job done with this budget      Mr  President  let s remember what was happening back at that time   I was hearing from veterans that they were facing delays in care and that the VA system was stretched to capacity   But the VA continued to say everything was fine         On March 8th  Secretary Nicholson told a House committee that the president s FY 2006 budget  quote  gives VA what it needs      I was hearing a much different story as I spoke with veterans around the country   That s why on March 10th  I offered an amendment in the Senate Budget Committee to increase veterans funding by 3  so we could hire more doctors and provide faster care to veterans   Unfortunately  Republicans said no         That same month  the VA s internal monthly reports showed that demand for healthcare was exceeding projections  That was another warning sign that the VA should have shared with us  but it didn t  On March 16th  Senator Akaka and I offered an amendment here on the Senate floor to increase veterans funding by  2 85 billion   Once again  Republicans said no          The next month  on April 5th  Secretary Nicholson wrote to Senator Hutchison saying     I can assure you that the VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005  A week later  on April 12th  I offered two amendments on the Senate floor to boost veterans funding  First  I asked the Senate to agree that the lack of veterans funding was an emergency and that we had to fix  Republicans said no   Then I asked the Senate to agree that supporting our veterans was a priority   Again  Republican said no  As a result  veterans didn t get the funding they needed  and the deception continued          On June 9th  I asked Secretary Nicholson at a hearing if he had enough funding to deal with the mental health challenges of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   He assured me the VA was fine        So for six months we had happy talk that everything was fine with the VA   Then  in June    just two weeks after the Secretary s latest assurance    the truth finally came out  On June 23rd  the VA revealed a massive shortfall of  3 billion   I went to work my colleagues  and we came up with the funding   But we could have solved that problem much earlier and saved veterans the delays they experienced          By misleading us  the Bush Administration hurt America s veterans   We could have provided the money when it was needed   We could have been hiring the doctors and nurses we needed   We could have been buying the medical equipment that was needed   And we could have helped keep thousands of veterans off waiting lists for care         Here s the bottom line   The Bush Administration knew about a problem back in October 2004  They saw it getting worse  but they kept assuring us everything was fine   They worked to defeat my amendments to provide funding  and they didn t come clean until June 2005   That is unacceptable        Veterans Deserve Answers    I think America  s veterans deserve real answers   This report shows that the VA was not telling Congress the truth and was fighting those of us who were trying to help  We need to bring Secretary Nicholson before the Veterans  Affairs Committee so we can get some real answers   We need to ensure the VA does not repeat the same mistakes of the past two years   We owe that to our current and future veterans who sacrifice so much for us         Phony Savings for 4 Years    We need an explanation of why the VA lied to us about so called  management efficiencies   The GAO found those alleged savings were nothing but hot air   This report clearly shows the Bush Administration misrepresented the truth to us for four fiscal years  through four budgets  and four appropriations cycles about these bogus savings   And when they could not make these efficiencies a reality  they took the funds from veterans  healthcare   That too is unacceptable       The VA is Still Not Telling the Truth    The report also suggests that even in its latest quarterly reports to us    the VA is slow to report and does not provide key information we required    such as the time required for veterans to get their first appointment       Pentagon Failed to Provide Updated Information    Mr  President  the GAO report also says that the Department of Defense failed to provide the VA up to date information on how many service members would be separating from service and seeking care at the VA   That is really frustrating to me because I ve been asking every general who comes up here if they re doing enough to ensure a smooth transition from the Pentagon to the VA          In fact  on February 16th of last year  I questioned Secretary Rumsfeld directly  I got him to agree that caring for veterans is part of the cost of war    but he had no real answer when I asked why his request for the war did not include funding for veterans         VA Failed to Plan    Finally  the GAO report verifies that the VA failed to plan for the impact of the veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan       2  Bush Administration Still Doesn t Have a Plan to Care for Veterans    Mr  President  I m concerned that the Bush Administration still    today    does not have a plan to meet the needs of our returning service members   Just look at the gap between what the VA told us it needs    and what we re actually spending on veterans  healthcare  In July  the VA sent an estimate to the Congressional Budget Office   The VA said it would need  1 billion a year for 10 years to care for veterans from Iraq  But here s the problem    we are already spending more than  1 billion this year  and we still haven t seen the lion s share of veterans return home   There will be more veterans needing help  and  1 billion a year is not going to cut it          I ve heard some of my colleagues speak about the generous increases to VA programs  I agree they have been helpful  but unless the dollars we provide meets the needs of our veterans we won t have fulfilled our responsibility  Let s focus on just one area of veteran s healthcare    support for mental health challenges such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  Here s what the Associated Press recently reported          More than one third of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans seeking medical treatment from the Veterans Health Administration report symptoms of stress or other mental disorders   a tenfold increase in the last 18 months  according to an agency study       It s a good thing that veterans are seeking help   I hope it means we ve made it easier to get care and we ve reduced the stigma associated with the invisible impacts of war  During the Vietnam War  I saw those challenges first hand when I volunteered in the psychiatric ward of the Seattle VA hospital  It s good that veterans are seeking care  but we need to make sure we can handle their needs         The AP article mentions a soldier from Virginia Beach  Virginia who was having  a hard time sleeping after he returned from Iraq  and was told he d have to wait two and a half months for an appointment at the VA facility        Here is a service member in need  and all the VA can say is  get in line and wait 75 days   That is disgraceful  I ve held several discussions in my home state of Washington with veterans and mental health experts   Most recently  I was in Everett  Washington on August 17th and heard about the challenges on the ground        Whether dealing with the large number of veterans with severe physical injuries  or traumatic brain injuries  the VA has no plan  Whether dealing with the 16 percent of wounded service members coming back from Iraq who have eye injuries  which Walter Reed reported in August    the VA has no plan  Whether it is dealing with the over one third of all service members to return home and separate from the military who are seeking mental health services    the VA has no plan          And we re still not getting straight answers  In that AP article  a VA official say he s not aware of problems with veterans getting mental health services   Dr  Michael Kussman is quoted as saying   We re not aware that people are having trouble getting services from us in any consistent way or pattern around the country      Mr  President  many veterans advocates disagree    In fact  another VA official pointed to serious problems in meeting the mental health needs of veterans         In the May edition of Psychiatric News  Dr  Frances Murphy  the Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at the VA  said the agency is ill prepared to serve the mental health needs of our nation s veterans  In the article  Dr  Murphy notes that some VA clinics don t provide mental health or substance abuse care  or if they do   waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible          The Bush Administration has failed to deliver our veterans the care they need    denying them the respect they deserve  Given the VA s bad track record and misleading statements  we need to demand a real plan from the VA to ensure our veterans get the care they have earned        3   Iraq    No Clear Mission  A Distraction     Fueling New Terrorists    Mr  President  another question we must ask is about our mission in Iraq today  Unless we have clarity and purpose of mission  we re not going to know when we ve achieved it and when our troops can come home  Mr  President  we all want the same thing in Iraq    for our troops to complete their mission successfully and come home safely  But today our troops  mission in Iraq lacks clarity         What are they accomplishing in Iraq today  Overthrowing Saddam Hussein  They already accomplished that   Looking for weapons of mass destruction   They looked  and there were no weapons to be found   Are they supposed to be setting up an Iraqi government   Well  we ve done that  The Iraqi people have created a constitution  elected their leaders  and filled their cabinet  Our troops have done everything we ve asked them to do  What is left   And will the President s policies get us there  That s the discussion we need to have         Every time we ask these questions  we get the same empty response from the President  his cabinet  and his supporters in Congress     Stay the course    Stay the course  is not a good plan if the course you re on is not working       A Distraction from the War on Terror      Mr  President  we also need to get to the truth about the relationship between Iraq and the broader War on Terror  On September 6th here on the Senate floor  I warned that the President s focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger War on Terror   I said that the President took a detour from the War on Terror and invested a majority of our resources into Iraq    seemingly forever           That weakens our ability to fight the broader War on Terror  and leaves us vulnerable   We have not made the investments here at home to protect ourselves and we haven t finished our work against Al Qaeda   Bin Laden is still on the loose   Afghanistan is a mess  and U S  troops there are imperiled there        National Intelligence Estimate    Iraq War Fueling New Terrorists    Today  three weeks after I gave that speech here on the Senate floor  we learned that the National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the War in Iraq has helped to fuel the recruitment of new terrorists   The Administration s failures to plan and to face the truth in Iraq demand Congressional hearings so we can chart a better course       4  Bush Administration Put Politics Over Competence in Iraq    Mr  President  we also need examine how the Bush Administration bungled the Iraqi reconstruction  On September 17th  the Washington Post ran a story titled   Ties to GOP Trumped Know How Among Staff Sent to Rebuild Iraq       The article describes how Americans were selected to work in Iraq for the Coalition Provisional Authority    The article says   applicants didn t need to be experts in the Middle East or in post conflict reconstruction  What seemed most important was loyalty to the Bush administration     The article goes on to say           The decision to send the loyal and the willing instead of the best and the brightest is now regarded by many people involved in the 3 1 2  year effort to stabilize and rebuild Iraq as one of the Bush administration s gravest errors  Many of those selected because of their political fidelity spent their time trying to impose a conservative agenda on the postwar occupation  which sidetracked more important reconstruction efforts and squandered goodwill among the Iraqi people  according to many people who participated in the reconstruction effort           Mr  President  they had a political loyalty test instead of a competence test and that may be responsible for how long we ve had to stay in Iraq and the problems we ve faced there   Congress needs to look at that and hold people accountable        Politics Over Progress at HUD Too    Unfortunately  this pattern and practice of political favoritism within the Administration             Politics Over Progress at HUD     extends beyond Iraq to how the Bush Administration handles government contracts here at home    Last week  we got new evidence that a member of President s cabinet has made a series of statements that highlighted the importance of politics in awarding government contracts in his agency  In May  I asked the Inspector General at HUD to look into Secretary Alphonso Jackson  s public statements that he deliberately denied a contract to a firm that had been critical of President Bush          Last week  the IG sent me the results of his investigation  The report is 340 pages long    with hundreds of pages of sworn testimony from dozens of HUD officials  The report includes sworn statements from HUD personnel stating that  Secretary Jackson told his staff to monitor the political affiliation of contract competitors and consider those affiliations in the awarding contracts  Secretary Jackson said that a HUD contractor had strong political affiliations that were not supportive of the President  The Secretary said he did not want the contractor to receive any additional HUD contracts          As a result  the contractor s award was subjected to an unusual extent of delay and review  So we have a Cabinet Secretary telling his staff to issue contracts based on politics    not based on who can do the best job for American taxpayers  It is true that  in looking at the record  the Justice Department concluded  that no apparent criminal violation could be discerned based on evidence to date    But the Justice Department came to that conclusion  only because HUD staff actually ignored the Secretary s inappropriate instructions         When you combine what has been going on at HUD with what happened at the CPA in Iraq and reports about similar issues at the Department of Interior  it is clear that we need to demand accountability   That s why last week I wrote to the White House Chief of Staff    Josh Bolten    and urged him to take immediate steps to ensure political favoritism and discrimination don t play a role in federal contracts  But Mr  President  I recognize that we can t rely on the White House Chief of Staff to clean up the Bush Administration    which brings me to my final point   We need real oversight      5  Congress Needs to Provide Real Oversight    In this Congress  there has been very little oversight of the Bush Administration   The President has basically had free reign because this Republican controlled Congress has failed to do its job in asking tough questions and demanding real answers  Norman Ornstein  an expert on Congress at the conservative American Enterprise Institute  said this Congress is the worst he s seen in terms of oversight   He told the Philadelphia Inquirer           These people have long thought of themselves as foot soldiers in the president s army  and their view is that oversight is something to avoid  lest they find something that might embarrass the administration  I don t see a single sign that this attitude will substantively change         That s congressional expert Norman Ornstein on the Republican s failure to oversee the Bush Administration  Democrats are trying to provide the oversight that Republicans are unwilling to provide   On Monday  the Democratic Policy Committee held a hearing on preparations for the War in Iraq  Retired military leaders told us that the Bush Administration failed to plan for the war and that the Administration misled the American people   We had to hold those hearings under the Policy Committee s banner because the Republicans wouldn t hold real committee oversight hearings   We need oversight so we can learn the facts and can fix things that aren t going well   If we never have real hearings  if we never demand real accountability  we ll never get better results        We Can Do Better    America can do better  we can be more secure  and our troops can be safer   It has to start with the truth  Not rosy predictions of how things will be  not declarations of will that gloss over the facts on the ground  not corruption and politics holding back progress  but the truth   So far this Republican controlled Congress has been unwilling to let our citizens learn the truth  The American people deserve better
