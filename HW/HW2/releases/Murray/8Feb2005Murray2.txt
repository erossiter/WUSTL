                                                         Murray  As Senate Considers Class Actions Reform  Murray Renews Call to Protect Asbestos Victims  Ban Use of Deadly Material  02 08 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          As Senate Considers Class Actions Reform  Murray Renews Call to Protect Asbestos Victims  Ban Use of Deadly Material    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 8  2005         Senator Patty Murray today spoke on the floor of the U S  Senate to call for protection of all asbestos victims and their families while the Senate considers class action reform legislation   Her speech came hours after President Bush again called for class action and asbestos reform in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club   The speech also followed news of an indictment against chemical company W R  Grace  who knowingly poisoned workers and residents in Libby  Montana  where hundreds of people have died from asbestos exposure        Murray is the author of the   a bill to ban use of the deadly substance  that Murray has fought to pass for several years        Murray s floor remarks follow     Mr  President  today the Senate is debating a class action lawsuit bill          This afternoon in Detroit  President Bush said   Congress needs to pass meaningful class action and asbestos legal reform this year    Well my response is    before we pass something    we better understand how it will affect the rights and lives of average Americans        Unfortunately  the bill before us will unfairly tip the scales of justice against average citizens          It will give big businesses even more power to avoid responsibility for their actions   And it will delay justice for many victims who deserve justice   You don t have to look very far to see why average citizens need access to our courts        Just look at this morning s newspaper    It reports that yesterday the federal government indicted the W R  Grace Company for knowingly sickening workers and residents in Libby  Montana    where hundreds of people have died from asbestos exposure         The indictment charges that company officials knew of the dangers to workers and the community and created a conspiracy to hide those dangers   I hope these indictments bring a small measure of justice to the thousands of people who have suffered in Libby and around the country           These people worked hard and provided for their families  but the company they worked for knowingly poisoned them and covered it up   The federal government is finally going after the company and the executives who made the decisions that put workers and the entire community at risk        Here is the story from today s Seattle P I   Grace indicted in asbestos deaths  Mine Company and seven executives face criminal charges         Mr  President  I ask that the full article be included in the RECORD after my remarks   The story of what happened in Libby  Montana is heartbreaking   Years ago  when I first heard about what happened there  I began a campaign to ban asbestos and to protect its victims          In June 2002  I testified at a hearing about Libby before the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund  Toxics  Risk  and Waste Management   The people of Libby have been waiting for this day for a long time        This indictment tells companies that they are responsible for their decisions and that human lives are more important than profits          The indictments send a message   If you re putting workers and consumers at risk  if you try to hide the dangers you will be prosecuted        Because at the end of the day    this isn t about profits    it s about people   People like Gayla Benefield  who I met last summer        Gayla  s father worked at W R  Grace  s vermiculite mine and mill in Libby from 1954 to 1973  Her father died of asbestosis in 1974   Gayla s mother never worked in a mine    but she was exposed to asbestos fibers on her husband s work clothes   Gayla s mother died of asbestosis in 1996   Gayla herself was exposed to asbestos fibers when she hugged her dad after work   Then  in December 2001  Gayla and her husband David were diagnosed with lung abnormalities         In all  about 37 people in Gayla s family have signs of asbestos disease   Only three ever worked in the mine   As my colleagues know  for the past four years  I ve been speaking out about the dangers of asbestos and the need to ban it    I ve stood up for victims and their families         I ve introduced legislation to protect workers  educate the public  and improve research and treatment       Last year  when Congress considered an inadequate trust fund bill  I stood up for asbestos victims and voted against it   We still have a lot of work to do to take care of current victims and to prevent future deaths        And that s one of the reasons why I m so concerned about the Class Action bill that s now before the Senate          The bill allows companies to move class action lawsuits from state jurisdiction to federal jurisdiction   That could delay justice for years   In many cases  victims have been waiting a long time for their day in court   If their cases are moved to federal court  they ll essentially have to start all over at the bottom of the pile        That  s because federal courts already have a massive backlog of cases   It s one of the reasons why the federal bench opposes this bill   If class action lawsuits are dumped onto federal courts  they will fall to the bottom of the list of priorities   And even if they work their way up to the top of the docket after many years  they won t be resolved quickly because they are such complicated cases        The bill before us could add years to the amount of time it takes to resolve a case   Unfortunately  asbestos victims don t have time on their side   Once a person is diagnosed with mesothelioma  they usually only have 6 18 months to live        So if companies know they can play legal games  they can just  wait it out     just move the case and hold things up    until the victim dies   When that happens  there is no justice          For someone with the death sentence of an asbestos disease  justice delayed is justice denied   That s why Congress should reject this class action bill   There are other ways this bill could deny justice          Companies could wait until a victim s medical bills or lost wages are so high that the victim is forced into an unfair settlement   Once again  this bill tips the scales of justice against average Americans        Mr  President  I ve focused on asbestos victims but this class action bill would affect many more type of victims   Anyone with a class action lawsuit could find themselves pushed into federal court at the bottom of list   Congress should not delay and deny justice for victims        As for asbestos victims  we still have a lot of work to do   Each year  10 000 Americans die from asbestos diseases   The first thing we need to do is ban the production and importation of asbestos in the United States   Every year it s put in 3 000 consumer products such as hair dryers  floor tile and automobile brakes   If we know it s deadly  we should stop putting it in consumer products        Later this year  I will re introduce my Ban Asbestos in America Act    The first year I introduced it we only had 4 cosponsors   In the last session  we had 14        We also made progress including my ban in the asbestos liability legislation that was considered by the Judiciary Committee   My ban is also included in Senator Specter s most recent version of the bill   We also need to help victims by investing in mesothelioma research and treatment   We need to boost awareness of how consumers and workers can protect themselves          For example  today up to 35 million homes  businesses and schools have deadly Zonolite insulation in their attics   People need to know about that danger so they can protect themselves   Many employees are still in danger    from construction workers to auto mechanics   And let s not forget that many asbestos victims were exposed to asbestos when they served our country in the military          About 32 percent of asbestos victims are Navy veterans  many of whom worked in the Bremerton Shipyard in my home state of Washington        The dangers of asbestos are not just limited to Libby  Montana or military communities   They are everywhere  and this Congress needs to address them the right way        Congress should make sure that asbestos victims can get the justice they deserve    that s why I ll vote against this class action bill and will continue the fight to ban asbestos and help victims         More on
