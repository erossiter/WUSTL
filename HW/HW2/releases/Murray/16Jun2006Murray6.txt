                                                         Murray  Murray Requests Hearing on VA Mental Health Services  06 16 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Requests Hearing on VA Mental Health Services Senator calls on leadership of VA Committee to look into supply and demand of mental health care services    For Immediate Release  Friday  June 16  2006     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA     a key member of the Senate Veterans Affairs  VA  Committee    today sent a letter to Senate VA Committee Chairman Larry Craig  R ID  and Ranking Member Sen  Daniel Akaka  D HI   requesting a hearing of the Committee on the status of mental health services provided by the VA         We need real answers from the VA and the Bush Administration   No gimmicks   No games   Murray said    I am requesting a hearing on the mental health services provided by the VA so we can learn more about the need for mental health care  how to meet that demand  and what changes need to be made to provide our veterans with the care they need and deserve         Murray s call for a hearing follows an article in the May edition of Psychiatric News in which Frances Murphy  M D   Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at the VA  indicates that the agency is ill prepared to serve the mental health needs of our nation s veterans   In the article  Dr  Murphy notes that some VA clinics don t provide mental health or substance abuse care  or if they do   waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible          With an estimated one third of the 1 3 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan facing mental health challenges upon their return  I am concerned that they are not getting the services they need   Murray wrote    It is unacceptable that they are encountering VA waiting lists that render mental health care  virtually inaccessible         The full text of Senator Murray s letter to Sen  Craig and Akaka follows      June 16  2006       The Honorable Larry Craig  Chairman  Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee  Senate Russell Office Building  Room 412  Washington  DC   20510         The Honorable Daniel Akaka  Ranking Member  Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee  Senate Russell Office Building  Room 412  Washington  DC   20510       Dear Chairman Craig and Ranking Member Akaka        I recently read an article in Psychiatric News that leads me to believe the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  is unprepared to serve the mental health care needs of our nation  s veterans        The article reads as follows          Frances Murphy  M D   undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination at the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   said the growing numbers of veterans seeking mental health care has put emphasis on areas in which improvement is needed  She noted that some VA clinics do not provide mental health or substance abuse care  or if they do    waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible           As you know  access to mental health services is vital to America  s veterans   The VA must ensure that resources are available to them whether facing challenges from PTSD and depression or other ailments   If we fail to provide these men and women with the care they need  we will set our nation up for the future cost and complications of veterans struggling with drug and alcohol addiction  homelessness and other conditions        In addition  with an estimated one third of the 1 3 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan facing mental health challenges upon their return  I am concerned that they are not getting the services they need   It is unacceptable that they are encountering VA waiting lists that render mental health care   virtually inaccessible           I am requesting that the Senate Committee on Veterans   Affairs hold a hearing on the status of mental health services provided by the VA   I believe the committee needs to learn more about the demand for mental health care  how the VA is meeting that demand  and what changes need to be made to rectify access problems within the current system          I know you both share my concerns with the VA  s ability to care for the needs of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  and I look forward to working with you to ensure the VA is addressing the mental health needs of America  s veterans        Thank you for taking my request into consideration        Sincerely        Patty Murray  United States Senator
