Bonuses Paid to Top VA Officials Murray Pushes Bills to Provide Lifetime Education Benefits  Increase COLAs  Assist POWs  and Help Gulf War Veterans with MS     Murray Says Bonuses Paid to Top VA Officials While Veterans Wait for Benefits Sends the Wrong Message                                                                                                                                                                      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 9  2007     Washington  D C    At a Senate hearing today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  worked to expand and improve benefits for America s veterans   She also took issue with controversial bonuses that were paid to officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  while veterans face long delays in receiving benefits         We have a lot of veterans who are coming home from serving us overseas and when they do they find themselves fighting their own government  To me that s just wrong   Murray said at a hearing of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee    For me  it s about keeping the promise to those who have served us   When I talk to my veterans at home today  they often tell me that they are forced to wait months or even years to get their claims processed  We re hearing about veterans who are getting different ratings and different benefits across the country and arbitrary limits on too many benefits         When Murray turned to question the VA s Undersecretary for Benefits  Daniel Cooper  she expressed her concerns about bonuses paid to top VA officials         I am hearing from a number of our soldiers who ve returned home who can t get their benefits because of a backlog at the VA  They re literally going for months without any income because of that backlog  When they hear about a senior VA official getting a bonus while they can t even get a benefit to keep them in their home or feed their family  it s pretty disturbing   Murray told Undersecretary Cooper          Murray also expressed dismay that bonuses went to VA budget planners  whose projections were off by more than  1 billion         In addition  Murray said she was frustrated that President Bush put restrictions on the work of a VA panel focused on ways to improve the transition from the Pentagon to the VA   The President limited the task force to policies that do not require new costs or new authority          That s like saying    tell us how we can fix the problem  but leave out anything that costs money or requires new authority   Murray said   I think we re in a bind right now because we haven t been looking at the options         Today s hearing was held to examine several proposed bills that would improve veterans benefits   The committee considered two bills written by Murray  on Multiple Sclerosis and Prisoners of War  and several other bills that Murray supports to expand education benefits and provide increased Cost of Living Adjustments  COLAs  for veterans       Murray s Bill to Help Veterans with Multiple Sclerosis  S  847    Senator Murray s bill  S 847  would eliminate the current seven year window that allows a veteran to claim service connectedness for multiple sclerosis  MS  and extend that service connectedness window indefinitely   Supporters of the bill include MS Vets  the National Gulf War Resource Center  Veterans of Foreign Wars  American Legion and Disabled American Veterans         Under current law  a veteran who is diagnosed with MS up to seven years after their honorable discharge can receive a service connected status   But if they re diagnosed seven years and one day after they leave the military  they re not eligible   That limit doesn t make sense because a person with MS might not show symptoms for years   even though they have the disease   Veterans with MS should not be penalized because their symptoms were diagnosed more than 7 years after separation       Murray s Bill to Improve Benefits for Prisoners of War  S 848    Senator Murray s bill  The Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2007  S 848   would eliminate the requirement that a prisoner of war  POW  must have been interned for a minimum of 30 days for certain diseases to be presumed to be service connected   The bill would also add Type II diabetes and osteoporosis to the listed presumptive diseases  and it would require VA to expand the list to include diseases that warrant such presumption by reason of having a positive association with the experience of being a prisoner of war   Murray s bill is supported by Veterans of Foreign Wars  Paralyzed Veterans of America  American Legion and Disabled American Veterans         An American service member who s held as a Prisoner of War for more than 30 days gets POW benefits  But one who s held in captivity for 29 days   just one day less   is told    Sorry  no help for you   That s not fair   Murray said        Senator Murray also supports a number of other benefits bills which were considered at today s hearing   including the following        Extend the GI Bill s Education Benefits  S  1261    Senator Murray is a co sponsor of the Montgomery GI Bill for Life Act of 2007  introduced by Senator Cantwell  D WA    This bill would repeal the 10 year limit on use of Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance benefits  and for other purposes   It would eliminate the existing time limits within which a veteran must use educational assistance benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill   Currently  GI Bill participants have up to 10 years from their date of discharge from the military to use their earned education benefits  members of the Selected Reserve have up to 14 years   This bill would make education benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill available to eligible veterans at any point in their lifetime      COLA for Veterans  S 423    Senator Murray is a co sponsor of the Veterans  Compensation Cost of Living Adjustment Act of 2007  introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka  D HI   This bill would increase  effective December 1  2007  the rates of compensation for veterans with service connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans   This bill would increase the rates of compensation for veterans with service connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation  DIC  for the survivors of certain disabled veterans effective December 1  2007   The rate increase is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Consumer Price Index  CPI   the same index that determines rate adjustments for Social Security benefits   The current estimate for FY 08 is a CPI increase of 1 4 percent         Merchant Mariners of WWII  S 961    Senator Murray is a co sponsor of the Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of WWII Act of 2007  introduced by Senator Ben Nelson  D FL    The bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay a monthly  tax exempt benefit of  1 000 to certain members of the U S  Merchant Marines  or their surviving spouse  who were employed by the War Shipping Administration or the Office of Defense Transportation during World War II between the dates of December 7  1941 and December 31  1946   Merchant Marines who served off shore between December 7  1941 and August 15  1945 were granted veterans status in 1988   The benefits provided by this bill would be in addition to VA benefits currently received by Merchant Marine veterans and those received by all other veterans        Senator Murray s full prepared statement from today s hearing follows     Mr  Chairman  thank you very much for holding this hearing to improve veterans  benefits  and thank you for including two of my bills   For me  this is about keeping our country s promise to those who serve and sacrifice for all of us   In a time of war  it s even more important that the benefits we provide our veterans are comprehensive  timely  and meet today s needs        Unfortunately  we re falling short of our obligation today   When I speak to veterans in my home state of Washington  they tell me they re forced to wait months   even years   to get their claims processed   Veterans with the same health problems are given different ratings and different benefits across the country   And I hear about arbitrary limits that slam doors in the faces of our veterans   Many of our service members who fought overseas are now returning home and being forced to fight their own government for what they deserve   That s just wrong   Fortunately  we have a number of good ideas that we re considering today to fix these problems        One of the things that really frustrates me is when veterans are denied benefits because of artificial and arbitrary deadlines   Service members answer our county s call  but when they return home and need help   they get hit with an asterisk  They get hit with some arbitrary exclusion that makes them suddenly ineligible for benefits   And I ve found these exclusions aren t based on any sound logic   they re just arbitrary  artificial limits that hurt our veterans        For example  an American service member who s held as a Prisoner of War for more than 30 days gets POW benefits  But one who s held in captivity for 29 days   just one day less   is told    Sorry  no help for you   That s not fair        Or take the case of a Gulf War veteran who develops Multiple Sclerosis seven years after leaving the military   That veteran is covered  but a veteran who develops the same disease one day later is left out on their own   That doesn t make any sense  and it does not reflect the promise we make to everyone who signs up to serve our country         My Bill on Multiple Sclerosis   So I ve introduced two bills to get rid of those arbitrary  artificial limits so we can give our veterans benefits   not excuses   The first bill  S 847  would remove the seven year limit for veterans to get service connected status for Multiple Sclerosis  MS    My bill is supported by MS Vets  the National Gulf War Resource Center  Veterans of Foreign Wars  American Legion and Disabled American Veterans         Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease with symptoms that can include blindness  paralysis and more  It s a disease that I know well because my father  who served in World War II  was disabled by MS         Rates of MS are higher among Gulf War veterans than the general population   Under current law  a veteran who is diagnosed with MS within seven years from their honorable discharge can receive a service connected status   But if they re diagnosed seven years and one day after they leave the military  they re not eligible   That limit doesn t make sense because a person with MS might not show symptoms for years   even though they have the disease   Veterans with MS should not be penalized because their symptoms were diagnosed more than 7 years after separation   We know that a significantly higher number of veterans who served in the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War have MS   What we don t know is the exact cause of that MS  It could be experimental vaccines  toxins from oil well fires  Sarin exposure  pesticides  combat stress or any combination   I think we should give veterans the benefit of the doubt   My bill makes MS a presumptive disability  no matter when its symptoms emerge  and I urge all my colleagues to join with MS Vets  the National Gulf War Resource Center  Veterans of Foreign Wars  American Legion  and Disabled American Veterans to support this bill       My Bill to Extend Benefits for POWs   My second bill being considered today is  S 848  the Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2007  POW s shouldn t have to meet an arbitrary 30 day requirement for internment to qualify for benefits as a POW  As the American Legion points out in their testimony today  even relatively short confinements as a prisoner of war can have long lasting  adverse health effects        My bill  the POW Benefits Act of 2007  would         Repeal the current minimum  30 day  period veterans need to be interned before they get some presumptive service connected disabilities        Add type II diabetes and osteoporosis to the list of presumptive service connected disabilities for former POWs  and       Set up the authority for administrative review by the VA to add or remove additional presumptive service connected diseases conditions for former POWs        Mr  Chairman  we ve got a lot of work to do to fix the VA benefits system and a good start would be to knock down these arbitrary barriers that hurt our veterans   I look forward to working with our colleagues to do just that
