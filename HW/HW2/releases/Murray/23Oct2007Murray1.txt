                                                                                                                                                                            For Immediate Release  Tuesday  October 23  2007      Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  asked tough questions of Federal Government officials during a hearing of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee on concerns that have been raised about the compensation program for sick nuclear workers at Hanford and sites around the country  The program helps Cold War era workers who are ill because they were exposed to nuclear and toxic materials on the job  Senator Murray is demanding to know why it takes so long to process claims  why workers and their families are finding it difficult to get information about the status of their claims  and what can be done to make the process more transparent  Many of these brave men and women and their families have suffered painful consequences from their commitment to our national security  Murray said  Ive heard countless stories of workers and survivors whove waited too long for a response to their concerns or claims  Thousands in Washington state and across the country are stuck in a long and arduous filing process that often continues after the worker has lost their life to dangerous exposures  The pain that accompanies illness and loss should not be compounded by bureaucratic and administrative frustrations  Senator Murray also pressed officials about the status of a special classification that Hanford workers are seeking  The classification  called a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC   would make the process of receiving compensation far easier  During my time in the Senate  Ive pushed the federal government to do the right thing by those at Hanford  to adequately compensate workers and their families and clean up the Hanford site for the well being of those who live and work in the surrounding communities  Murray said  These sick workers and their families shouldnt have to struggle with a frustrating bureaucracy as they seek compensation  Senator Murrays opening statement from todays hearing follows  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this important hearing to help us determine whether the federal governments compensation program for our nations energy workers is serving our Cold War heroes adequately  Many of these brave men and women and their families have suffered painful consequences from their commitment to our national security  Were here today because its our responsibility to ensure theyre receiving the compensation promised them in a fair and timely manner  Im glad were holding this hearing  because I have questions about how the federal government is administering the program   Im concerned about how long it takes to process claims  too many people have been waiting far too long for a final decision  Im also troubled that workers and their families find it difficult to get information about the status of their claims  And I want to know what we can do to make the process more transparent   I know that many of the Senators here with me represent states where these heroes worked for years  Theyve heard first hand how exposure to dangerous radiation and toxic substances affected families for generations  Unfortunately  the same is true for the workers in my home state of Washington  The Hanford facility  near the Tri Cities in Washington state  began more than 60 years ago as a plutonium production site on the Columbia River  During its peak years  nearly 50 000 employees worked at Hanford  where they played a vital role in the Manhattan Project  Residents of the surrounding area sacrificed to help America win World War II and the Cold War  Today  it is the nations most contaminated nuclear site and the largest environmental cleanup project in U S  history  Nearly half the size of the state of Rhode Island  the site is imposing  Approximately 11 000 workers are part of the cleanup effort  We know that working with such hazardous materials impacted the environment and harmed many of the workers who dutifully served their country at a difficult time during our nations history  Ive heard countless stories of workers and survivors whove waited too long for a response to their concerns or claims  Thousands in Washington state and across the country are stuck in a long and arduous filing process that often continues after the worker has lost their life to dangerous exposures  The pain that accompanies illness and loss should not be compounded by bureaucratic and administrative frustrations  During my time in the Senate  Ive pushed the federal government to do the right thing by those at Hanford  to adequately compensate workers and their families and cleanup the Hanford site for the well being of those who live and work in the surrounding communities  Its hard to believe that its been six years since I helped to create the Senate Nuclear Cleanup Caucus  a bipartisan effort to increase funding for nuclear waste cleanup  And Ill continue that fight until the job is done  Because of the incompetence of officials in processing claims at the Department of Energy  two years ago a number of us worked to move this compensation program to DOL  Im anxious to learn how things are going and what we can do better for those whove suffered so much  As I said earlier  I have concerns about how the program is being carried out  We must ask those responsible for administering the program some basic questions   How can we shorten the time it takes for a claimant to get a final decision from the Department of Labor  How can the Department better assist claimants in retrieving their records  How can the Department communicate more clearly and openly with claimants  How can we make the entire applicant process more accessible  transparent  and user friendly   And Im particularly interested to hear more about a recent request by Hanford workers to get a special classification that will make it easier for them to get benefits  As we examine these critical questions  I would encourage the agencies involved to hold themselves accountable to these heroes and their families by measuring their service and making the process as transparent as possible  I would also encourage the Department of Labor to maintain the office of the ombudsman so that applicants have a place to go for help navigating such a complex program  I applaud the work that the office has done over the last two years  Mr  Chairman  our government has a responsibility to those who gave so much of themselves for our country  These sick workers and their families shouldnt have to struggle with a frustrating bureaucracy as they seek compensation  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses about the governments progress with this program  and learning more about how we can make it more responsive to the thousands of claimants still waiting for a decision
