                                                                                     News Release          Senator Murray and Community Leaders Rally Against Cuts to Community Development Block Grants    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 21  2006          Washington  D C      Today at a rally in Seattle  community leaders and Senator Patty Murray spoke out against cuts to Community Development Block Grant   The grants support local efforts to revitalize communities  provide safe and affordable housing  and create jobs and economic development in underserved neighborhoods   The Bush Administration has proposed cutting the program by more than  1 billion   Unless the cuts are stopped  Washington State could lose  16 million in critical community development funds           Supporters gathered at the YWCA Opportunity Place in Seattle and heard from Murray  King County Executive Ron Sims  Bellevue Mayor Grant Degginger  advocates and individuals who ve been helped by federal grants      Senator Murray s remarks follow      Today you  ve heard about just a few ways that the Community Development Block Grant program is being used to strengthen communities throughout King County        Across our state  CDBG funds are being used by mayors and non profit organizations to         revitalize communities        provide safe  affordable housing        and create jobs and economic development in underserved neighborhoods         And so often  CDBG is the catalyst that leads to successful public private partnerships that bring new hope and opportunity to our communities         CDBG is one of the best investments we can make   Each federal dollar leverages about  30 in private capital   That s a great return on our investment    and that doesn t include the lives it changes and the communities it rebuilds         But today  that funding is threatened   The budget before Congress threatens to cut CDBG by more than  1 billion   That  s on top of a half a billion cut the program received this year   What that means here in Washington state is that CDBG funds would be reduced by  16 million next year       I think that  s wrong   And I want you to know that I  m working hard in the Senate to protect CDBG and our investments in public housing   I know how important programs like CDBG are         Everywhere I travel in Washington state I hear from families struggling to find a safe and affordable place to live   Whether it is a young couple looking to buy their first home  a family searching for rental housing near their job  or a senior citizen who wants better access to social services  it is harder than ever to find affordable housing    Over the past few months  I ve been traveling throughout our state meeting with mayors and housing leaders   I ve seen a wide range of challenges throughout the state   But no matter where I go  affordability is the biggest challenge    especially here in King County   Families who spend a high share of their monthly income on rent often are not able to save  They re not able to put money away so that one day they can afford a down payment   They don t have much money left over to buy the goods and services that employ our neighbors   The high cost of housing in this area often means people are stuck in substandard housing       And it probably means they re moving further and further away    but still working here in Seattle or Bellevue   That creates all types of pressures on our transportation system   It means more congestion and higher costs for businesses and families       Here in Washington  we re tackling this challenge   Non profit groups  public housing agencies  and leaders  like Ron Sims and Grant Degginger  are working hard to leverage shrinking federal dollars to build affordable housing and revitalize underserved communities   Today we  ve heard some of those success stories  but we can do more         I believe that in order to make America stronger we need to make investments here at home    in our people  in our infrastructure  and in our communities   That s why last week I led the fight in the Senate to fully fund CDBG   I was down the Senate floor Tuesday night and several times on Wednesday    speaking out and urging other Senators to keep investing in our communities         In the end  we lost   But I m not giving up   I know how much is riding on this investment   That s why I m so pleased to stand here with community leaders and local advocates    to show the real people and community needs that are on the line   I m going to take the stories we ve heard here today back with me to Washington  D C  and continue to fight for the investment we need to make our state strong
