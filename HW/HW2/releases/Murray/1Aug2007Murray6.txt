                                                                              News Release          Senator Murray Speaks Out for Children s Health Insurance  Tells Story of Yakima Youth    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  August 1  2007    Senator Murray s speech  Washington  D C    In a passionate and personal speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  urged Senators and President Bush to do the moral thing and support legislation to expand and strengthen healthcare for children  The Senate is considering a bill to reauthorize the Children s Health Insurance Program  CHIP   President Bush has threatened to veto the bill  In her speech this afternoon  Murray shared the story of Sydney DeBord  a nine year old girl from Yakima  Washington  Sydney s mom wrote to Senator Murray this week and said that without CHIP  Sydney would not have gotten the care she needed  Murray noted that the bill supports Washington state  which covered low income children long before the federal government did  This reauthorization bill provides Washington state with the funding and flexibility to provide more children with quality health care  This bill is a big win for our state and the many families that struggle to provide care for their kids  Murray said  Murray said that President Bush s threatened veto reflects the wrong priorities  The bottom line  the moral line  is that vetoing this bill will endanger coverage for millions of children currently enrolled in CHIP  And it will deny millions of kids who would become covered under the bill the chance to see a doctor when sick  It seems  sadly  the moral light President Bush says guides his decisions has dimmed  Murray said  Senator Murray s full remarks follow  Mr  President  all children should be able to see a doctor when they are sick  and all children should get the medicine they need to make them better  When a child gets a cut that requires stitches  comes down with a fever or an earache  or with any other imaginable problem  they should be able to get help  Period  Unfortunately  today  in America  the richest and most successful country ever  this is not the case  In fact  millions of American children do not have health insurance    which means millions of American children cannot see a doctor when they are sick    and millions of American children do not get the medicine they need to get better  And as wages remain stagnant and the cost of living    heat  food  clothing  college tuition  and doctors  visits    increases  more and more parents are unable to afford health care  So the ranks of uninsured children grow  This tragedy can only be described as a shame  And it is  unquestionably    our moral obligation as Americans to correct this  It doesnt matter if you are Republican or Democrat  progressive or conservative  making sure our children get healthcare is the moral thing to do  Covering More Kids Now Mr  President  most of us in the Senate know this  and are working to do the moral thing  they support reauthorizing and improving the Childrens Health Insurance Program    or CHIP    which takes massive steps toward providing all kids with health insurance  This bill ensures that the 6 6 million children enrolled in CHIP continue receiving care  and it provides 3 2 million uninsured children with coverage  As a result  over the next five years  the number of uninsured American children will drop by more than one third  Mr  President  it also strengthens the program by increasing funding for states that need the most help  In recent years  under President Bushs watch  many states have faced funding shortfalls  jeopardizing the coverage of countless children  This bill also provides an emergency fund to cover unexpected shortfalls arising from economic downturns or emergencies  The Congressional Budget Office   a non partisan group of experts   predicts that 800 000 children now covered by CHIP will lose coverage over the next five years unless there is an increase in funding above the base amount required  ExpandsOutreach Efforts This legislation before the Senate today also provides  100 million for outreach and enrollment efforts that increase participation of children in CHIP  This includes a national campaign to raise awareness of CHIP  and the targeting of children in rural areas with high populations of eligible but un enrolled children  Another outreach effort will provide funds for translation and interpretation services for CHIP  so minority children  including Native Americans and Hispanics  will become aware of the program  Helps Washington State Finally  this reauthorization plan provides Washington state with the funding and flexibility to provide more children with quality health care  This bill is a big win for our state and the many families that struggle to provide care for their kids  Tobacco Tax is a Win Win Mr  President  one of the smartest parts of this bill is that the money for these initiatives    35 billion over five years   comes solely from a 61 cent excise tax increase on cigarettes and other tobacco products  No other programs are cut  Social Security is not raided  The deficit will not be increased  And not only will this provide millions of American children with health care  but it is estimated that it will lead 1 7 million adult smokers to quit smoking    that it will cause a 9 2 percent decline in youth smoking    and that it will prevent over 1 8 million kids from becoming smokers  So when you can provide health care to millions of children and lead millions of young people to stop smoking or to never pick up a cigarette  it is a win win for our country  And for our children  Mr  President  it is important that I thank my colleague  Max Baucus  for his tireless work on this issue  and for Americas children  Without his determination we would not be so close to providing millions more kids with health care  Broad Bipartisan Support It is also important to note that this bill is bipartisan  Senator Grassley worked hard with Senator Baucus in creating the current legislation  and it was passed out of committee on a bi partisan basis  Another big supporter of this bill is Senator Hatch  a co sponsor of the original 1997 bill  Recently  he said   We are trying to do what is right by our children  who are currently not being helped by our healthcare system  If we cover children properly  we will save billions of dollars in the long run  Even if we didnt  we should still take care of these children   Senators Grassley and Hatch arent alone on their side of the aisle  Many of their colleagues also realize supporting this legislation is the moral thing to do  President Bush Opposes Covering More Kids Unfortunately  President Bush does not agree and has threatened to veto the bill  He will give his reasons for the veto  He will make complicated arguments and throw various numbers around  But the bottom line  the moral line  is that vetoing this bill will endanger coverage for millions of children currently enrolled in CHIP  And it will deny millions of kids who would become covered under the bill the chance to see a doctor when sick  It seems  sadly  the moral light President Bush says guides his decisions has dimmed  Sydney DeBord of Yakima Mr  President  I would like to share the following story with President Bush and with any Senators who oppose this bill  This is Sydney  Sydney and her mom  Sandi DeBord  live in Yakima  Washington  Sydney has Cystic Fibrosis  Sydneys mom recently wrote me  She discussed her daughter and the importance of CHIP  which has allowed Sydney to receive care  extending her life and allowing her to live to the fullest  Ms  DeBord Wrote     My daughter has a life shortening genetic condition called Cystic Fibrosis  With quality health care I believe her life has been extended and she has been able to enjoy 9 years of quality life  Of course she has spent many weeks in the hospital on life saving IV Antibiotics during these 9 years and not a day goes by that she doesnt have to endure taking a bucket full of meds but despite the obstacle  in her way  she is a happy child enjoying life to the fullest  She is active  does well in school  has many friends and loves to sing and dance  However NONE of this would be possible if it wasn t for the quality health care she receives as part of the CHIP health care  I know for a fact that without this bit of assistance her life would end much sooner due to the inability to afford quality health care for her  As her parent  it frightens me to even think some day she may be without health care coverage if programs like CHIP are no longer available  I write to ask you to reauthorize the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  and ensure the program is adequately funded to provide high quality health care for children with cystic fibrosis    I hope President Bush and opponents of this bill were listening to this story  I know Ms  DeBord hopes they were  too  Mr  President  it is our moral duty as Americans to ensure all children can see a doctor when they are sick  This bill fulfills that duty  It ensures that children covered by CHIP remain covered  And it ensures that millions without insurance will receive it  I strongly urge my colleagues to do the moral thing  and support the reauthorization of the Childrens Health Insurance Program
