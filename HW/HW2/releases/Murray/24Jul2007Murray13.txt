Just days after raising Pell Grants  Murray helps pass bill that addresses rising college costs  simplifies financial aid applications  and reforms the student loan system    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 24  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  took another step to help more students attend college by voting for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act  S 1642   which passed the Senate today 95 0  The bill will help students and their families get better information on the costs of college  simplify the financial aid application  and reform the student loan system so it puts the interests of students first  Murray helped draft the bill as a member of the Senate s Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  Today  we took another step to help open the doors of college to more students across the country  This bill will change lives  help young people reach their full potential  and help our country build a stronger economic future  Murray said  Without the support in this bill  many young people would never see the inside of a college classroom  Senator Murray also worked to include a provision that allows new teacher preparation partnership grants to train literacy and math coaches at teacher preparation colleges and universities  This will create a pipeline of specially trained coaches in two critically needed areas  Senator Murray s PASS Act  S  6 11  calls for hiring literacy and math coaches to help students master these skills so they can graduate prepared for college and careers  The Higher Education Reauthorization that passed today also   Reauthorizes and improves GEAR UP and TRIO programs that help students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare for and attend college Provides additional grant funds to Upward Bound programs for low income students Creates a new program to help colleges that serve Native American students Provides scholarships for spouses of military service members Reauthorizes programs to help non traditional students attend college  Now that the bill has passed the full Senate  the House of Representatives must pass a companion bill  Today s action comes just days after another victory for students  On Friday  7 20 07   the   S 1762    That bill    raised the maximum Pell Grant amount  protected graduates from spending more than 15  of their income on loan payments each month  and offered loan forgiveness for students who pursue public service jobs  Senator Murray s full statement follows  Mrs  MURRAY  Mr  President  I am pleased to vote for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act because it will open the doors of college to more students across the country  I want to commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this bill  I ve been honored to work with him and the other members of the Committee to produce this comprehensive solution  In response to the recent student loan scandals  this bill reforms the student loan process so that it puts the interests of students first and makes the system more transparent  To help address rising college costs  this bill takes a number of steps to increase user friendly information available to students and parents about college costs  I m also pleased that this bill will make it easier for students to apply for financial aid by replacing the current 10 page application with a new 2 page version  This bill offers more help for students from disadvantaged backgrounds  Specifically  it strengthens TRIO programs to make students more prepared for higher education  It also expands and improves GEAR UP programs  which are a critical tool to help guide and prepare disadvantaged students for high school graduation and college enrollment  I am especially pleased that the bill includes my proposal to train math and literacy coaches in colleges of education  As I ve been working to improve our schools  I ve recognized that we need to provide additional support to students in math and reading  By addressing those areas  we can improve the graduation rate and help students graduate prepared for college and careers  When I introduced the PASS Act  S 611  earlier this year  I included reading and math coaches as a key way to improve the graduation rate  I m pleased that this Higher Education Reauthorization includes a grants program that will help train those coaches  so we have a ready pipeline of qualified coaches to address these critical areas  GET EDUCATION UPDATES   To receive Senator Murray s Education Email Updates  please sign up at    Check the box for Education
