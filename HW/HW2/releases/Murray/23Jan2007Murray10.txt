Veterans    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  January 23  2007     Washington  D C      This morning U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  aggressively questioned top officials from the Pentagon and Veterans  Administration about the government s inadequate support for service members returning home from duty in Iraq and Afghanistan   At a hearing of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  Murray cited long waiting lists for healthcare and benefits  disturbing government investigations  news reports  and the comments of Iraq war veterans in telling Defense Undersecretary David Chu and Deputy VA Secretary Gordon Mansfield that the status quo is unacceptable       Watch the Hearing     Murray s opening statement at 21 00  Murray s questioning begins at 1 15 23      Get Senator Murray s Veterans Updates                                                        Senator Murray s opening statement follows     Chairman Akaka and Senator Craig  thank you very much for holding this hearing   This is exactly the type of oversight and accountability we need to have to make sure our service members get the services they need when they come home          And I can tell you  we ve got a lot of work to do   From the veterans I ve talked to  it s clear that we do not offer them a  seamless transition  from the battlefront to the homefront  and that has really got to change       If we had a seamless transition  why are so many veterans coming home without jobs       Why are so many veterans unable to get housing  We have new reports out today that say that up to 1 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are homeless today  That is unacceptable       If we had seamless transition  why are veterans having to wait six months to see a VA doctor for primary care       Why are so many veterans having trouble getting help with PTSD  On Friday  in fact  the Army s top medical officer said that some returning troops are not getting the help they need  and to me that is unacceptable       If we had seamless transition  why are so many Guard and Reserve members unable to get help from efforts like the Transition Assistance Program       Why are our Vet Centers overwhelmed with veterans seeking help       Why do our veterans have to wait two and a half months to see a mental healthcare professional when they return from combat       We don t need a hearing to discover if we have a seamless transition  I know we don t   And we don t need this hearing to find out if the Pentagon and the VA are working together enough  I don  t think they are          We do need to use this hearing to find out from our witnesses what they re doing about it and how they are going to fix it        And I can tell you one thing   The veterans I talk to don  t really care about Washington  D C  talk    they care about the reality they see in my state and across the nation    whether they can get a job  whether they can get healthcare  and whether they get the benefits they need  and that should be the test we all use         If we do want to make progress  Mr  Chairman  I think we have to understand how we got here so we can change course          How did we get to a point where four years into this war we have a two year backlog for VA benefits  mental healthcare that is inaccessible  and long lines to see a VA doctor        We better understand how we got here  so that we do not make the same mistakes moving forward        Mr  Chairman  the first problem is that the Bush Administration did a miserable job planning for the aftermath of the war  The failures we ve seen in the planning on the military side are mirrored by failures of planning on the VA side         We all know  the VA has some of the best employees in the world  and we  re very proud of the work they do         But for too long we ve had a VA leadership that has not done an adequate job planning for the many veterans this war is creating   And the VA is still woefully behind in its projections          Last year  the VA planned to see 110 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan  It ended up seeing more than 185 000   For this year the VA projects to see 109 000 veterans   fewer than they saw last year  That does not make sense          We need an accurate plan from the VA that spells out the real needs and how the VA intends to meet those needs        The second problem is the Bush Administration has never made a commitment to fund veterans  healthcare as an essential part of the cost of war   This war is being paid for by supplementals  But those supplementals do not including funding for veterans healthcare          Funding for veterans healthcare has gone up    but it s still not tied to the real needs   We need to get the VA and the White House to match the funding to the real needs  so our veterans are not behind        The third problem  Mr  Chairman  is that we have not been able to get straight answers or real numbers out of the VA  The GAO has found    in report after report    that VA has misled Congress  concealed funding problems  and based it s projections on inaccurate models   That has to change because our veterans are paying the price         With all due respect to our witnesses  other officials from your agencies have sat at that very same table and assured us everything was fine    when it certainly was not   I was assured many times that the VA had the funding it needed    only to learn later that the VA had a  3 billion shortfall and the agency had falsified budget savings over many years          So today  Mr  Chairman  I hope we hear from Dr  Chu and Mr  Mansfield that you realize that there are serious problems on the ground and that you are committed to solving them        Impact of a Surge   We are having this hearing at a very critical moment  The President has proposed escalating our military involvement in Iraq        Just four days ago  the VA secretary told the Houston Chronicle that sending more than 20 000 troops into Iraq will not have an impact on the VA s backlog of claims   Secretary Nicholson described the impact of the surge on the VA as    quote     minimal         Well  I stood here in the Senate with nine veterans last week from the Iraq war and they had a much different picture of that  They believe that the President s escalation will further degrade our ability to care for our veterans          Today    without the surge    veterans are waiting for the services that they ve been promised   If we re not meeting veterans   needs of today  how can we keep the promise to troops who are sent to an escalated war       State of the Union   Tonight  the President will deliver his State of the Union speech   During last year  s speech  the President did not mention the word veteran once  I hope tonight  finally  he does talk about our veterans  and acknowledges that our VA is overwhelmed and under funded  and outlines his plans for meeting our troops   needs when they return home
