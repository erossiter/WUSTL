                                                                         News Release          Senator Murray Backs Legislation to Protect Against Personal Data Security Lapses    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 14  2006     Washington  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today joined with Senator Daniel Akaka  D HI  and other colleagues to announce legislation that establishes safeguards to prevent against data theft  The legislation is in response to recent security lapses  the most prominent of which occurred at the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  and included the private information of 26 5 million veterans  Senator Murray called for the VA to come clean with the full story of the breach  and to provide support to veterans who are unsure of how to react          We have 85 year old veterans who don  t know the first thing about credit checks being told that their identity may be compromised   said Senator Murray   They want to know how they can get reliable information concerning their personal credit  and what to do in the event that their identity is stolen  The VA needs to be there for them at every step of this process         Senator Murray also discussed the legislation that Senator Akaka has introduced which she is co sponsoring  The bill  entitled the  Data Theft Prevention Act of 2006   establishes penalties for the misuse of data that is stored on federal databases  The assembled Democratic Senators also released a letter to the Government Accountability Office  calling for a full and independent investigation into the security lapse at the Department of Veterans Affairs            Senator Murray s Full Remarks from the Press Conference Follow        When Americans sign up to serve our country in the U S  military  they put their trust in the federal government  Now that trust has been broken  and it has been broken repeatedly        First  the VA compromised the private  personal data of tens of millions of veterans and active duty military  Then  they took far too long to report that the data was stolen  and then they compounded the problem  by not being honest with veterans about who was affected by the breach  We deserve answers as to why an agency that is supposed to serve the needs of our nation s veterans has failed them so miserably        We need to know why it took so long for the VA to warn veterans  And we need to know why so many of the VA s answers have changed over time   This security breach happened on May 3rd   Two weeks later  Congress was told about it  Two weeks after that  we were told that perhaps 50 000 Navy personnel were affected  The next day  we were told that perhaps 80  of active duty military plus all guard and reserve members could be affected  We still need the full story         We need the full story so that veterans  active duty soldiers  and their families can have the peace of mind they deserve  I have veterans calling my office worried that their privacy has been violated  and they are losing faith in the VA s response  We have the families of soldiers  who are already struggling with their family members away from home  now having to worry that they may be victims of identity theft or other crimes         The VA needs to increase its outreach efforts so that veterans are aware of the support services available to them  We have 85 year old veterans who don  t know the first thing about credit checks being told that their identity may be compromised   They don  t know what to do  They want to know how they can get reliable information concerning their personal credit and what to do in the event that their identity is stolen  Credit checks are not simple matters and many Americans have never before had to request a personal credit history  The VA needs to be there for them at every step of this process         And we must ensure that the cost of helping our military personnel  their families and our veterans isn t paid for out of already scarce VA health care funding  These brave Americans don t deserve to be victimized through no fault of their own and then punished again by being denied access to services and benefits they have been promised        If we have learned any lesson from these awful events it is that we cannot allow this to happen again  That is why I am joining today with my friend Senator Akaka  a true champion of America s veterans         Like me  he is frustrated by the VA s response to the breach and is committed to taking the steps necessary to prevent employee data theft        The legislation that he has introduced and which I am co sponsoring aims to avoid reliving the events of this last month by establishing laws that prevent employees from knowingly compromising personal security information held in federal databases         I thank Senator Akaka and the other co sponsors of this bill for their commitment to veterans and personal data protection  We put our trust in our men and women in uniform when they volunteer to serve our country   They need to know that they can trust our government to protect and serve them as well
