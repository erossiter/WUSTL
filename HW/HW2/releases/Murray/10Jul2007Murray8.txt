Troops Have Sufficient Time between Deployments    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 10  2007     Washington  D C    In a Senate floor speech today  U S  Senator Patty Murray spoke about how the current rotation schedule is hurting our military s readiness  retention  disaster preparedness and military families  Murray spoke in support of the Webb Amendment  Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  our country is home to some of the finest fighting forces in the world  and we can all be proud of that  We need our military to remain the best trained  best equipped  and most prepared force on the planet  Tragically  however  the President s War in Iraq and his use of extended deployments is undermining our military s readiness  The current deployment schedule hurts our ability to respond to threats around the world   It causes service members to leave military service early  It weakens our ability to respond to disasters here at home  It unfairly burdens family members  and intensifies the combat stress that our service members experience   We need to rebuild our military  and the first step is giving our fighting men and women the time they need here at home to prepare and train for their next mission  Today I rise to address the readiness challenges that threaten our military s strength and ultimately our nation s security  Mr  President  more than four years into the war in Iraq  our troops are stretched thin  our equipment is deteriorating  and the patience of our nation is wearing thin  We have seen 3 600 service members die  Thousands upon thousands more have been injured  And month after month  our fighting men and women are pushing harder and harder  Troops leave loved ones for months and years  and put their lives on the line without complaint  We owe them the best treatment and training possible  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has fallen short in these areas  One of the major problems for our troops  their families and their communities is the growing gap between the time troops spend in battle versus the time they spend at home  This gap is alarming  it s disheartening  and it is a disservice to the brave men and women putting themselves in harms way each and every day  Burning out forces Sadly  Mr  President  our forces are being burned out  Many of our troops are on their third or even fourth tours in Iraq and Afghanistan  Months ago  the Department of Defense announced that tours would be extended from 12 to 15 months  And on top of all that  they are not receiving the necessary time at home before they are sent back to battle  Mr  President  that is not the normal schedule  It is not what our troops signed up for  And we here in Congress should not simply stand by and allow our troops to be pushed beyond their limits like this  That s why we re debating the Webb amendment now and why we must pass it this week  Typical Rotation Schedule  Mr  President  traditionally active duty troops are deployed for one year and then rest at home for two years  National Guard and Reserve troops are deployed for one year and then rest at home for five years  But tragically that is not the case now  Currently  active duty troops are spending less time at home than they are in battle  And Guard and Reserve forces are receiving less than three years rest for every year in combat  With the increasing number and length of deployments  this rest time is even critical more critical for our troops  Unfortunately  our forces are not receiving the break they need  increasing the chance they ll become burnt out  But this Administration has decided to go the other direction  pushing our troops harder  extending their time abroad  and sending troops back time and again to the battlefield  Just in March of this year  Salon com reported what I hope is extreme example of the length the military is going to get soldiers back to the battlefield  I ask consent  Mr  President  that the entire story appear in the Record  I do want to read an excerpt form that story   Last November  Army Spc  Edgar Hernandez  a communications specialist with a unit of the Army s 3rd Infantry Division  had surgery on an ankle he had injured during physical training  After the surgery  doctors put his leg in a cast  and he was supposed to start physical therapy when that cast came off six weeks later  But two days after his cast was removed  Army commanders decided it was more important to send him to a training site in a remote desert rather than let him stay at Fort Benning  Ga   to rehabilitate  In January  Hernandez was shipped to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin  Calif   where his unit  the 3 900 strong 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division  was conducting a month of training in anticipation of leaving for Iraq in March  Hernandez says he was in no shape to train for war so soon after his injury  I could not walk  he told Salon in an interview  He said he was amazed when he learned he was being sent to California  Did they not realize that I m hurt and I needed this physical therapy  he remembered thinking  I was told by my doctor and my physical therapist that this was crazy  Hernandez had served two tours in Iraq  where he helped maintain communications gear in the unit s armored Bradley Fighting Vehicles  But he could not participate in war maneuvers conducted on a 1 000 square mile mock battlefield located in the harsh Mojave Desert  Instead  when he got to California  he was led to a large tent where he would be housed  He was shocked by what he saw inside  There were dozens of other hurt soldiers  Some were on crutches  and others had arms in slings  Some had debilitating back injuries  And nearby was another tent  housing female soldiers with health issues ranging from injuries to pregnancy  Hernandez is one of a dozen soldiers who stayed for weeks in those tents who were interviewed for this report  some of whose medical records were also reviewed by Salon  All of the soldiers said they had no business being sent to Fort Irwin given their physical condition  In some cases  soldiers were sent there even though their injuries were so severe that doctors had previously recommended they should be considered for medical retirement from the Army  Military experts say they suspect that the deployment to Fort Irwin of injured soldiers was an effort to pump up manpower statistics used to show the readiness of Army units   Clearly  if the military is going to these lengths to pump up readiness statistics  we have a huge problem  But these problems are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effects of the Administration s rotation policy  Responding to Other Global Threats The current rotation policy not only burns out service members  but it hurts the military s ability to respond to other potential threats  For the first time in decades  the Army s ready brigade  this is intended to enter trouble spots within 72 hours  cannot do so  All of its troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan  The limited period between deployments also lessens the time to train for other threats  Numerous military leaders have spoken to us about this problem  General James Conway said I think my largest concern  probably  has to do with training  When we re home for that seven  eight  nine months  our focus is going back to Iraq  And as I mentioned in the opening statement  therefore  we re not doing amphibious training  we re not doing mountain warfare training  we re not doing combined arm fire maneuver  such as would need to be the case  potentially  in another type of contingency   General Conway  Senate Armed Services Committee  2 15 07  That s not me  Mr  President  That is General James Conway before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February of this year  And General Barry McCaffrey said that because all fully combat ready active duty and reserve combat units are now deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan  no fully trained national strategic reserve brigades are now prepared to deploy to new combat operations   General McCaffrey  Senate Committee on Armed Services  4 17 07  Retention Rates So Mr  President  the current deployment situation is hurting our troops  and it s hurting our troops in another way    it s contributing to a drop in retention rates  Keeping battle experienced and capable troops in the military is essential to our ability to respond to future threats  West Point classes of 2000 and 2001 have an attrition rate five times higher than pre Iraq war levels   54  of the West Point Class of 2000 left Army by end of last year  46  of the West Point Class of 2001 left Army by end of last year   Marine Corps active forces are also losing troops  especially critical mid grade non commissioned officers  And this is despite a bonus for those who re enlist  Clearly  this policy is not sustainable  Responding to Disasters Here at Home Third  the deployment schedule is making us less secure here at home  The current rotation policy has left Guard units short of man power and supplies  and severely hindered their ability to respond to disasters here at home  The recent tornado that destroyed much of Greensburg  Kansas is a terrible example  After their town was destroyed  Greensburg residents needed shelter  food and water  And they needed it fast  But because the Kansas National Guard was stretched so thin  it was hard for them to respond as fast as necessary for an emergency right here at home  Governor Sebelius and Major General Tod Bunting  the head of the Kansas National Guard  said not only is Guard equipment being worn out  but so are its troops   some of whom are on their fourth tour in Iraq  For years  these problems were the exception  not the rule  But I fear that balance is shifting  Last month  USA Today reported that National Guard units in 31 states say four years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have left them with 60  or less of their authorized equipment  And last month  Lt  General H  Steven Blum said National Guard units have 53 percent of the equipment they need to handle state emergencies  and that number falls to 49 percent once Guard equipment needed for war such as weapons is factored in  In fact  Blum said  and I quote  Our problem right now is that our equipment is at an all time low  Mr  President  this is deeply concerning to all of us who worry about a national disaster in our states  especially out in the West where we now face forest fires that are threatening homes and families and lives  Families But Mr  President  this problem is about more than equipment  It s about more than retention rates  It is about real people and about real families  We all know that military life can be tough on troops and their families  They go months and sometimes years without seeing each other  While troops are away fighting for all of us    Sons and daughters are born  Sons and daughters grow up without fathers or mothers present  Husbands and wives don t see each other for years  Fathers and mothers die  Family members become sick   Our troops need adequate time at home to see their newborns  to be a part of their children s lives  to spend time with their husbands or wives  and to see their parents  The current rotation policy decreases the time families are together  placing a great strain on everyone  Our troops  facing these early deployments and extended tours  have spoken out  When the tour extensions and early deployments were announced  our troops themselves expressed their displeasure  In Georgia  according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution  Soldiers of a Georgia Army National Guard unit were hoping to return home in April but instead  they may be spending another grueling summer in the Iraqi desert  At least 4 000 National Guard soldiers may spend up to four extra months in Iraq as part of President Bush s troop increase announced last month  Sgt  Gary Heffner  a spokesman for the 214th  said news of the extension came as a little bit of a shock to the Georgians   Atlanta Journal Constitution  2 7 07  In the 1ST Cavalry Division  according to the Dallas Morning News  Eighteen months after their first Iraq rotation  the 2nd Battalion  5th Cavalry Regiment and the last of the Fort Hood  Texas based 1st Cavalry Division returned to Iraq in mid November  Mr  President  those troops  according to this article  were deeply concerned about that  Washington State  Tacoma News Tribune Article Here in my home state in Tacoma  Washington just this past weekend  there s     I ask unanimous consent to put it in the Record    talking about the tremendously difficult time that they are having being redeployed  Webb Amendment So Mr  President  I rise today to speak out for the Webb Amendment  It is an amendment that support our troops  It supports our troops by requiring regular forces be home for at least as long as they are deployed  It requires that our National Guard and Reserve forces be home for at least three years for every year deployed  These seem like basic  common sense requirements  And they are  I applaud our colleague from Virginia for being a champion for our troops  and for crafting this bi partisan measure that he  and the entire Senate  can be proud of  Our troops have sacrificed so much  We have to institute a fair policy for the health of our troops  for the health and well being of their families  and for our nation s security and ability to respond to disasters here at home  This amendment does all these things  and I urge the Senate to support it
