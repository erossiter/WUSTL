                                                                                        News Release          Senators Murray  Cantwell Help Pass Senate Resolution Denouncing Unfair Aerospace Trade Policies    For Immediate Release  Monday  April 11  2005        Stay Tuned With Senator Murrays   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell today spoke on the Senate floor on a resolution that calls on European governments to reject launch aid for Airbus and supports the Presidents authority to take any action necessary to protect American aerospace jobs   The Senate passed the resolution by a vote of 96 0      The senators introduced the resolution based on the need to level the playing field for fair global aerospace competition  Despite Airbus status as the current leading manufacturer of large civil aircraft with more than fifty percent of the market share  the company continues to receive market distorting subsidies and engage in unfair trade practices which are undermining the U S  aerospace industry and American jobs  In Washington state  we know how important the American aerospace industry is to our economy and our communities  we know that these jobs are worth fighting for  Senator Murray said   I am proud to support this Senate resolution to send the message that the United States is going to take aggressive action to level the playing field for our industry and our workers  The United States cannot stand by while the EU stalls discussions about launch aid   Our domestic companies should not have to compete against the backing of European governments  against the deep pockets of governments that distort the global marketplace   Obviously  launch aid puts our domestic manufacturers at an unfair competitive disadvantage   What we want to see in aerospace is competition that drives opportunities for the consumers  Senator Cantwell said  Today marked the end of a three month negotiation period between U S  and European officials who are working to solve the recent trade dispute and avoid proceedings through the World Trade Organization   Those talks have produced no real progress to date                                                                                   Senator Murray Remarks on the U S   EU Aerospace Negotiations  Senate Fair Aerospace Competition Resolution Mr  President  I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the Fair Aerospace Competition Resolution  Senate Concurrent Resolution 25  Thousands of American aerospace workers have lost their jobs in the past decade  That trend will continue unless we take action  I would especially like to thank leaders on both sides of the aisle  Senator Frist and Senator Reid  for their help and support of this measure  Senators Grassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee have also been of great help  And as always  I m proud to serve with Senator Maria Cantwell  my colleague from Washington state and another strong advocate for America s aerospace workers  Our country invented the aerospace industry 100 years ago  Through it  American workers have done more than feed their families and pay the mortgage  They ve made air travel safer and brought economic growth and innovation to every corner of our economy  Mr  President  many in this body have heard me talk for years about Europes efforts to distort the commercial aerospace industry  In short  Airbus has done everything it can to kill our aerospace industry  Airbus has received billions in illegal launch aid  Airbus has tried to play tricks on this side of the ocean with their slick PR campaign  And Airbus will continue the unfair tactics until they completely dominate the global aerospace market  And while Airbus is doing all these things to hurt American workers  it s actually trying to get us to think they are a friend to the very men and women they re putting out of work  Unfortunately  EADS  Airbus and European governments will do and say anything to dominate the global aerospace market  I m here today to call their bluff and show this body  once again  that Airbus is no friend of the United States or our workers  and to ensure that their double talk is exposed for all to see  I ve worked closely with several U S  Trade Representatives on this over the years  For the past few months  the U S  has tried to negotiate with the Europeans  but it s clear that the Europeans don t take our concerns seriously  Those discussions appear to have broken down and the Europeans are threatening a radical escalation if we pursue our right to file a WTO case  You would think that after all Airbus has done to kill American jobs  they would at least make a good faith effort now that we re finally calling them to account for their behavior  But the Airbus and European leaders have done just the opposite  They ve pounded their chests about how their latest  subsidized plane will dominate the industry  Instead of coming clean    or at least stopping their trade distorting behavior  Airbus has sought to influence public opinion  They ve pursued a deceptive public relations campaign  They ve taken out ads in Capitol Hill publications and major newspapers around the country  Airbus claims to be a friend of American workers  but its selling to Americas sworn enemies  Airbus claims to support hundreds of thousands of American jobs  but they can t document them  And Airbus claims it wants to be a more American company  but then turns and preaches European domination when they think we re not looking  We need to stand up to this unfair competition and send a strong signal to the Europeans that this Congress and this country will NOT allow a European subsidized company destroy America s aerospace industry  They can talk out of both sides of their mouth all they want  I m here to lay the facts on the table and stand up for our workers  Context on the Breakdown of Talks Mr  President  I applaud the Bush Administration and specifically Ambassador Robert Zoellick for the continued work to end unfair trade practices in the aerospace industry   The Administration entered into negotiations in a good faith effort to restore balance and fairness to the commercial aircraft trade  Unfortunately  Europe has never taken these talks or this issue seriously   Our willingness to seek a negotiated settlement has been greeted by more arrogant entitlement from Airbus and its European backers  While publicly committed to negotiations  Airbus and European leaders have been working behind the scenes to continue subsidies to Airbus in spite of U S  threats to file a WTO case  Now  European Commission Ambassador John Bruton is saying that  one result of a case would be that maximum aid would be given for Airbus  new A350  Today  this campaign is more directly in Congress  line of sight than ever   I hope to clearly show that Airbus is not an American company  and that Airbus is simply continuing its policy of saying and doing anything to get what it wants  American Press On April 1st  European Union trade commissioner Peter Mandelson wrote an eye popping piece in the Washington Post   He once again restated baseless accusations against Boeing in an effort to justify billions of dollars in illegal Airbus launch aid  The issue Mandelson correctly identifies as central to American concerns is the massive subsidies in the form of launch aid  landing rights and other giveaways that European governments give to Airbus   Now  the Europeans would like you to think that we offer similar subsidies to Boeing    but the facts simply don t line up   I don t need to talk at great length  again  about the subsidies   But I do think it s worthwhile to make all of you understand what those subsidies actually do  European governments give Airbus huge direct subsidies to build new airplanes  These subsides take the form of launch aid  supplier subsidies  RD subsidies  and facilities subsidies  These subsidies create an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do things that normal  private companies cant afford to do  They develop new products without any risk  One American company is playing by traditional business norms  borrowing money at commercial rates  being responsible to shareholders  and knowing that if they don t make a profit  they re in trouble  That s why Boeing bets the company when they develop a new plane  Airbus enjoys virtually risk free product development  and it operates far outside the bounds of fair competition  All of this comes at the expense of U S  companies and American workers  What does that mean in real terms   Let s take the new Super jumbo Airbus A380 as an example  According to a January 20th article in the Financial Post titled The Airsub 380  A380 subsidies are officially  4 3 billion   Other estimates put it far over  6 billion  The same day  the Independent newspaper said          To break even on its own investment  Airbus needs to sell 250 of the A380   To repay the four governments it needs to shift to 700   To count as a real commercial success  Airbus needs to sell twice that number   So far it has firm orders for 149  It s no wonder that last summer respected industry analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group called the plane a bloated airborne welfare queen  No other company in the world would be able to handle such huge cost overruns   But Airbus can  because if the plane fails they ll simply write off the costs and move on to the next one  To make matters worse  they ve been making outlandish claims in this country for years   First  they claim Airbus has created and supports 120 000 jobs in this country    the Commerce Department can only document 500  Airbus says it subcontracts with as many as 800 firms in the U S   though they ve moved that number up and down over the years  The Commerce Department can only come up with 250  Just this past week the Commerce Department released an exhaustive study  done at the request of this Congress  on the U S  Jet Transport Industry   This 150 page report once again comes to the same conclusion we ve heard time and again  Airbus is not an American company  and Airbus does almost nothing to support the hundreds of thousands of American workers who depend on this important industry  Mr  President  Airbus and EADS are not helping Americas aerospace industry  They are destroying it  In 15 years  700 000 American workers have lost their jobs while Europe keeps adding new workers to the EADS and Airbus payroll   That s simply unacceptable  European Press Looking at their claims in American press alone  Airbus appears to be a pseudo American company looking to create more jobs and help to grow our economy  Of course  that s not the real story   Just take a look at what Airbus s proprietors say in Europe  when they think we re not looking  A few months ago  with much pomp and circumstance  the latest European subsidized Airbus product  the A380    was unveiled with four heads of state   Their comments show Europe s true intentions  From the Spanish Prime Minister   The European Union has built the plane that is the standard bearer for European and global aeronautics  Spains Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapetero said   He went on to boast  What we see here today is Europe cannot be stopped        From the French President   It is a technological feat and a great European success  Jacque Chirac said  When it takes to the skies it will carry the colors of our continent  and our technological ambitions to even great heights   From the British Prime Minister   It is European cooperation at its best  said Tony Blair   Airbus demonstrates that we can achieve more together in Europe that we ever can alone   And finally the German Chancellor  when asked about subsidies to Airbus  said   We have done that in the past  we are doing it now  and we will do so in the future      This doesn t sound like a company bent of doing anything for the American worker   But again  this is Airbus and its supporters saying and doing anything to get what they want   Outside the US Europe Unfortunately  the examples only continue   I didn t have to look any further than the NBC Nightly News to find yet another shocking attack on American values and workers       For years Airbus has said anything to get a deal   Apparently they ll also sell to anyone      Not long ago  NBC News uncovered direct evidence of Airbus  efforts to sell military aircraft to     a country focused on destabilizing and undermining American interests in the Middle East  a country currently in pursuit of nuclear weapons  a country no real American company would dare sell weapons to   NBC News was able to get a camera crew into an air show in Kish  Iran  and they found EADS pitching their military helicopters to Iran        I ll ask that the full transcript of this NBC story appear in the record  but I d also like to read just a bit from the piece  Also exhibiting at the show  European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company  EADS  and its subsidiary Eurocopter  which has launched a campaign in the United States to get a bigger share of Pentagon contracts  featuring ads that wrap the company in the American flag  But if the company is so pro American  why is it ignoring U S  policy to isolate Iran  As a European company  we re not supposed to take into account embargoes from the U S   says Michel Tripier  with EADS  Once again  saying and doing anything  anywhere  to advance the European interests of this European company   Airbus and EADS clearly sing one tune in newspapers in the US  another at media events in France  and quite a different one while selling their products in Iran   But taken together  the goal is clear  EADS and Airbus do not intend to stop until they ve gobbled up the entire aerospace market  What s Next for Airbus So what s next for Airbus  Any question of their intentions was answered as we tried to work out an amicable solution to the dispute this past January   On a day that could have been a turning point in the process Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard said he would seek new launch aid from European nations for the Airbus A350  While in one breath Airbus says that it does not need launch aid to build the A350  they have nevertheless applied for  and European governments are prepared to provide   1 7 billion in new launch aid  To once again paraphrase German Chancellor Schroeder  They have done that in the past  they are doing it now  and they will do so in the future  But again  no need to take my word alone on the illegality of the launch aid or their central role in the ongoing dispute   The Financial Times  a European newspaper    called the plan to subsidize the A350 and Forgeard s announcement unwise and deeply unhelpful  They went on to say that  launch aid  Airbus s unique subsidy  is an especially blatant violation of the principles of fair competition   The EU should let it go   State support for private companies  even those with long lead times and big development costs  becomes indefensible as they mature   Infant industries must grow up  In a Business Week commentary from the same week  Stanley Holmes writes that  The U S  should call the Europeans  bluff  let the facts speak for themselves  and resolve this dispute at the WTO  Months ago I made the same suggestion   And although there appeared to be hope of avoiding that fate within the past few weeks  I now believe we must work through the WTO and hold our line  Conclusion With the Europeans bent on keeping their subsidies it is time to take bold action to protect our workers and send a strong message to Europe that enough is enough   Europe must understand that continued attempts to undermine our aerospace industry and its workers will not stand  The need to restore a competitive balance to the aerospace industry is not going away   Thousands of American jobs have been lost in the last decade and thousands more are at risk due to continued direct subsidies to Airbus  I will continue to work closely with the USTR and the Bush Administration to protect American jobs and ensure the future strength of the American aerospace industry   Whether through the continuation of these negotiations or through a trade case at the World Trade Organization  a competitive balance must be restored   And we in Congress must show the Europeans that we re serious about this action   Supporting this measure is an important step in that direction  and I urge my colleagues to vote yes     Stay Tuned With Senator Murrays
