Farmers in Farm Bill GOP sponsored amendment would have stripped  15 million Murray included in Farm Bill to help struggling asparagus farmers  Eastern Washington asparagus growers will benefit from funding       Murray also works to ensure disaster assistance for farmers remains in Farm Bill                                                                                                                                    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  December 12  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  defended  15 million in funding for asparagus farmers nationwide that she included in the 2007 Farm Bill  The funding Murray included would particularly benefit struggling Asparagus farmers in Yakima and the Tri Cities  The asparagus funding was put in jeopardy by an amendment sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  that would have cut the funding out of the bill completely  Senator Murray joined with many of her colleagues to reject Senator Judd s attempt to cut the funding  The amendment failed by a vote of 39 56  Our asparagus farmers are hurting now because of competition from growers in Peru  Senator Murray said in a statement included in the Congressional Record  This program would provide up to  15 million nationwide to help U S  farmers who still grow asparagus despite foreign competitionstriking the market loss program from the Farm Bill would be a step in the wrong direction for our asparagus industry  In her statement  Senator Murray referenced her  with farmers in Yakima where this issue was discussed  Senator Murray also defended against another of Senator Gregg s amendments that would eliminate the agriculture disaster trust fund from the Farm Bill  The agriculture disaster trust fund ensures that we have a permanent pool of money to help farmers after natural disasters  like the recent storms in Washington state  That amendment has yet to be considered by the Senate  Senator Murray recently spoke out on the Senate floor about the overall importance of the Farm Bill to Washington state  Read HERE  The Senate continues to debate the 2007 Farm Bill  Senator Murray s full statement from today defending asparagus funding and disaster assistance follows  Mr  President  Ive come to the floor to talk about two amendments to the Farm Bill proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire  These amendments would have devastating impacts on farmers in my home state of Washington  and I urge my colleagues to oppose both of them  The first would strike the badly needed Agriculture Disaster Assistance Trust Fund and direct the money to other sources  Under my colleagues amendment  most of that money would go to reduce the deficit  and some would help low income residents with their heating bills  The second would strike the Market Loss Assistance Program for asparagus growers  Mr  President  our farmers are the backbone of our nation  But farming is a difficult business  One bad storm can wipe out a whole crop or a whole herd  and take your livelihood with it  Mr  President  thats the position that some of the farmers in my home state are in now  And thats why it is so important that we have a safety net ready to help them  We Need a Safety Net for Farmers Hurt in Disasters Last week  I spoke on the Senate floor about the storms that had devastated western Washington  Winds and dangerous floods and mudslides washed out roads and homes and cut off power to thousands  Mr  President  thousands of people are still coping with the damage  And our agriculture producers in Southwest Washington were hit especially hard  We wont know the full impact of this storm for some time  But were already starting to hear reports about lost livestock  poultry  farm buildings and equipment  Some reports say that producers lost thousands of animals  and that number may still grow  The agriculture disaster trust fund in this Farm Bill ensures that we have a permanent pool of money to help farmers after natural disasters  like the storms in Washington state  I appreciate the work of the Finance and Agriculture Committees to add this important program  And I want to thank Senators Harkin and Chambliss for their leadership on this bill  I wish this program were already in place  If it were  farmers in Lewis and Grays Harbor  two of the counties hit hardest by the flooding  would be able to apply for federal aid to rebuild their herds  For example  the Livestock Compensation Program in the trust fund would pay 75 percent of the value of the dead animal  Without a permanent disaster assistance program  were left to provide this kind of help on an ad hoc basis  A trust fund would ensure that money is always there when its needed  Our farmers shouldnt have to depend on political whim when disaster strikes  And thats why the amendment to strike this fund would be such a bad idea  Mr  President  Now I strongly support the LIHEAP program  I think its critical  especially as we head into the winter months  But I think we can find a better solution that doesnt eliminate this trust fund  And so I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment by Senator Gregg  Support Market Assistance for Asparagus Growers Secondly  Mr  President  Id like to take a few minutes to talk about the amendment to strike the market loss help for asparagus growers  another program that is vital in my home state  Historically  asparagus has been a major crop for Washington state farmers  In fact  it was the first crop harvested in Washington  But our asparagus farmers are hurting now because of competition from growers in Peru  The Andean Trade Preference Act has allowed Peruvian asparagus to flood the market  And unlike most free trade agreements  the act went into effect without a transition period to allow U S  producers to prepare or adapt  Mr  President  over the Thanksgiving recess  I visited with a number of farmers in Yakima  Washington  who told me about the devastating impact this trade agreement has had  Mr  President  the numbers speak for themselves  In 1990  the value of the crop was approximately  200 million  Its value now is down to  75 million  Before the act  more than 55 million pounds of asparagus were canned in Washington state  roughly two thirds of the industry  But by 2007  all three asparagus canners in Washington had relocated to Peru  Ive fought to help our U S  growers  Ive tried to get them trade adjustment assistance and other help  And over the past several years  Ive secured funding for research on a mechanical harvester to make this labor intensive crop less expensive to produce  And most recently  I worked with my colleagues from Michigan and Washington to include the market loss program for asparagus growers in this Farm Bill  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Harkin and Chambliss on this issue as well  This program would provide up to  15 million nationwide to help U S  farmers who still grow asparagus despite foreign competition  I hope this program will help growers in my state continue to invest in asparagus  Mr  President  we modeled this after a similar program for apples and onions  which I helped add to the 2002 Farm Bill  I remember hearing from apple growers about the effects of Chinese imports on our markets  That program provided over  94 million for our nations apple growers  and it has proven to be a big help to our apple industry  I would note to my colleague from New Hampshire that his state received over  1 million from the apple program  Mr  President  striking the market loss program from the Farm Bill would be a step in the wrong direction for our asparagus industry  And it would have serious impacts on farmers in my home state  So  I urge my colleagues to vote NO on this amendment as well  Vote No on Both the Gregg Amendments NO votes on both of these amendments will support the struggling asparagus industry  And they will help our farmers and ranchers when disaster strikes  These programs are too important to our farmers to be cut
