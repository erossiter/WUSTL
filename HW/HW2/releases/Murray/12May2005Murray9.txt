                                                      Murray  Senator Murray  s Opening Statement  Amtrak Hearing  05 12 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray  s Opening Statement  Amtrak Hearing    For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 12  2005    Today  we will take testimony on what promises to be the most challenging issue this Subcommittee will face this year   Amtrak  America  s national passenger railroad  served 25 million passengers last year the highest number in any year in its history   1 1 million of those passengers were in my home state of Washington          Even so  there are those in the Administration and in Congress who want to push Amtrak into financial collapse and push 25 million passengers onto our already crowded highways and runways   The benefits provided by Amtrak  as well as costs  have been debated in Congress every year since the federal government established the corporation 35 years ago    But  make no mistake  this year is different          This year  Amtrak  s detractors smell blood   As we take each step in the Federal budget process  they have additional reasons to be optimistic that this will be the year that Amtrak service finally grinds to a halt   Up until this year  the path of Amtrak  s funding during each of the years of the Bush Administration has been largely the same   The Bush Administration proposes a funding figure that would throw Amtrak into bankruptcy   The Amtrak Board of Directors requests a sizable funding increase to truly allow the railroad to invest in its infrastructure and modernize   Congress has come along each year and generally provided Amtrak with just enough money to limp along  but not enough to invest in improved service          Over the life of the Bush Administration  actual appropriations for Amtrak have been about 141 percent above the levels sought by the Administration   But they have also remained some 30 percent below what the Amtrak Board has said it needed        But  as I said  this year is different   After working hard to keep Amtrak on a  starvation diet  over the last four years  the Bush Administration is now proposing to terminate all subsidies for Amtrak          Whether it is for state supported trains like the Cascadia Service in my State  or for the Empire Builder that runs from Seattle to Chicago  or for the service in the Northeast Corridor  the Bush Administration  s request is the same    zero funding   And zero funding means zero service           While the Administration seeks  360 million for a special rail account in the Surface Transportation Board  that funding by law can only be used to allow certain local mass transit agencies like the Sounder Commuter rail service to continue to operate over Amtrak property once Amtrak has ceased all operations          Strangely  at the same time the Administration is proposing to zero out subsidies and park all Amtrak trains  Secretary Mineta is flying around the country saying that the Bush Administration is supporting Amtrak  they just want reforms          In fact  Secretary Mineta has stated publicly that the Bush Administration would support between  1 5 and  2 billion in funding for Amtrak per year  if his reforms were enacted   For me  the fallacy that this Administration might actually support funding for rail service    reformed or not    was made clear during our hearing three weeks ago with OMB Director Josh Bolten          I specifically asked Director Bolten if the Bush Administration would be submitting a new Amtrak budget with reforms or without them   Not once  but twice  Director Bolten made it very clear to us that the Committee has received the only Amtrak budget from the Bush Administration that we are going to get    zero for Amtrak             One week after we took testimony from Director Bolten  the Congress took another act to help push Amtrak into insolvency   It adopted the conference report on the Budget Resolution   That budget set the cap on discretionary spending at the level consistent with the President  s budget request    a budget request that assumes zero funding for Amtrak          On March 15th and 16th  during Senate debate on the Budget Resolution  Senators Byrd and Specter offered an amendment to bring the level of funding for Amtrak up to  1 4 billion to provide some certainty and stability to the funding process for Amtrak this year   That amendment was defeated by a vote of 52 46          So  today  our Subcommittee finds itself in the posture of having to cut and cannibalize other programs    as we have never done before    only to see if we can scrape together enough funding from other programs to extend Amtrak for another twelve months   If the Senate had voted differently back in March  we might not be in this predicament        Today  we are joined by Amtrak  s Board Chairman and President    David Laney and David Gunn   Three weeks ago  Amtrak  s Board finally submitted its grant request of the Appropriations Committee   While I was disappointed that this request arrived some two months late  it is notable that the Amtrak Board    made up entirely of Bush Administration appointees    is asking this Subcommittee to provide  1 82 billion for Amtrak next year    more than a 50 percent increase over current funding            Much of the discussion of today  s hearing might focus on the assorted proposals to reform Amtrak   We have two separate comprehensive reform proposals    one from the Administration and one from the Amtrak Board   While Senators might want to discuss these proposals  I want to remind my colleagues that these reforms proposals are the responsibility of the Senate Commerce Committee   What this subcommittee needs to focus on is how much these reform proposals are going to cost          I think my colleagues will find as we discuss these reform packages is that neither of them    not the Administration  s proposal or the Amtrak Board  s proposal    save money in the near term   They all require investments over the long term that will require larger  not smaller  annual appropriations in the future          In that regard  perhaps the most important testimony we will hear this morning is not from the Bush Administration or the Amtrak Board   The DOT Inspector General  Ken Mead  has been a consistent monitor of Amtrak  s finances   He will testify this morning that Amtrak can no longer limp along on the  1 2 billion in funding it has received in each of the last two years   Indeed  he will testify that in order to maintain that status quo at Amtrak next year  we will need to appropriate between  1 4 and  1 5 billion           Given the failure of the Byrd Specter amendment  finding even  1 2 billion will be extraordinarily difficult   Finding  1 4 or  1 5 billion will be a monumental and painful challenge          Unfortunately  the majority of the Senate voted to put us in this box   Only time will tell if we can find our way out of it   One thing that is certain is that Amtrak  s 25 million passengers will be anxiously watching to see if we succeed
