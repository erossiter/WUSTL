Contentious Hearing Murray gets assurances of  no retribution  for soldiers who report problems      Senator asks about soldiers at Madigan Army Medical Center languishing in medical hold units  receiving low disability ratings  and not getting needed care    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  March 7  2007                         Senator Murray       Army Surgeon General Kevin Kiley         Washington  D C     At a contentious Senate hearing today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  questioned the Army s surgeon general about reports of problems at Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis             From what I m hearing  Walter Reed is just the tip of the iceberg   Murray said citing recent news reports of problems at Madigan   If these reports are true then the Pentagon is failing our service members at exactly the time they need the most support  That is shameful and unacceptable  We ve got very talented medical professionals trapped in a system that doesn t let them do their jobs fully  and that s an outrage          Murray pressed Army Surgeon General Kiley  who commanded Walter Reed from 2002 2004  for his assurance that no soldier will suffer reprisals for reporting inadequate care       SEN  MURRAY   We can t get to the bottom of this  and we can t do our job unless we do know exactly what s happening out there  and I want your personal assurance    if you would please give that to me    that no soldier who blows the whistle on substandard care will be retaliated against     Lt  Gen  KILEY   Senator  you have my word   There s a law that prevents that also  the whistleblower law  and I share your concern that soldiers either feel they can t talk certainly to their Representatives  Certainly we want them to talk to us   But we ve have never put a prohibition or a threat of retaliation if they talk to the press      Murray asked about soldiers spending up to two years in medical holdover units  including Captain Mary Maddox       MURRAY  I am hearing from soldiers who say they are languishing for months or even years in medical holds without the care they need        How can this be happening four years into this war      KILEY  It s not acceptable to have soldiers languishing   I ll be the first to say that  and clearly we re taking action to make sure we don t      Further  Murray asked Kiley about low disability ratings for injured soldiers  which deny them the disability pensions they deserve       MURRAY   The suspicion is that medical and physical boards are giving artificially low disability ratings to save money for the Army   At a hearing yesterday  it was revealed that while other branches grant full disability about 20 percent of the time   for the Army it s only about 4 percent     KILEY   I agree that the system that we have       is clearly perceived as unfair particularly when compared to the VA system of disability  and we have already started discussions to change that      Kiley promised Senator Murray that he will instruct his medical personnel to ensure that the medical evaluation boards will rate soldiers  injuries accurately          Murray also asked about military screenings for Traumatic Brain Injuries         Senator Murray s  follows      I want to thank those service members who care for their sick and injured comrades both in theater and back here at home   However  I am very concerned that while we have dedicated people they re working in a system that is failing our soldiers          From what I m hearing  Walter Reed is just the tip of the iceberg   This morning  the Seattle Times detailed serious problems at the medical holdover unit at Madigan Army Medical Center in my home state          It details soldiers who are          Left to languish in medical hold units for nearly 2 years       Soldiers who are being hurried out of DoD care before they receive the surgery they need       Being given low disability ratings that don t reflect their injuries and deny them an Army disability pension  and      Being pressured to sign their medical evaluations to get them off the DoD books       If these reports are true then the Pentagon is failing our service members at exactly the time they need the most support  That is shameful and unacceptable   The Seattle Times quotes Pamela Layne  whose husband  Specialist Steve Layne  was sent home without being diagnosed for a Traumatic Brain Injury   His wife said          I want people to know that if their loved ones are there  they will have to fight for their care       If they do not  they will get lost in the system        The article also says that soldiers who push for help are  branded as malcontents         And there are conflicting reports   one soldier told the Tacoma News Tribune that he received excellent care and generally good casework at Madigan  but he also said           If you want your care  you really have to fight for it   Their strategy is to get you so disgruntled that you just say screw it and go home        So we ve got very talented medical professionals trapped in a system that doesn t let them do their jobs fully  and that s an outrage   General Kiley  you re in charge of this system  and I hold you accountable for every disturbing story I m hearing in my home state  and I want answers          The Walter Reed scandal exposed the problems with military medical care  and then the latest stories out of my home state show that the problems are much deeper and more painful than moldy walls and red tape          Many soldiers are worried that if they speak out publicly they ll be punished or it will end their military careers   General  I want your personal assurance that no soldier who blows the whistle on substandard care will be retaliated against
