                                                                              News Release          Nearly 10 000 Americans Join Senators Clinton and Murray in Pressing the FDA on PLAN B    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  November 1  2005    WASHINGTON  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Patty Murray  joined by nearly 10 000 supporters  today called on the Food and Drug Administration to make a yes or no decision on the pending application for over the counter status of Plan B based on science  not ideology  Senators Clinton and Murray submitted their petition letter to the FDA today in response to the agency  s request for public comment on the Plan B application            It is time for the FDA to stop dragging its feet and make a decision on Plan B  yes or no   We are proud to join with nearly 10 000 Americans in calling on the FDA to take a real step toward closing its credibility gap by making a prompt decision  based on scientific evidence     said Senators Clinton and Murray          On August 26  the FDA announced a new public comment period on the application to make Plan B emergency contraception available over the counter  This action amounts to an indefinite delay in consideration of the application and flies in the face of the mounting scientific and medical evidence that emergency contraception is a safe  effective method for reducing the rate of unintended pregnancies   Senators Clinton and Murray launched their petition on their web sites on October 16 to provide another avenue for those who wished to comment on the Plan B application   Today is the deadline for the FDA comment period and the FDA has not announced its next steps in considering the pending Plan B application         The text of the petition letter Senators Clinton and Murray submitted today to the FDA follows       Andrew C  von Eschenbach  MD   Acting Commissioner Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  MD 20857 0002         Dear Dr  von Eschenbach         We write in response to your request for comments on the pending application to make Plan B available over the counter         As an initial matter  we are disturbed that this application has been subjected to scrutiny that far exceeds the normal FDA procedures  It is virtually unprecedented for an over the counter application to be subjected to more than two years of inaction  only to be then subjected to an extended public comment period with no timetable for a decision  This entire process  and particularly the decision to initiate rule making at this late state in the process of considering an application is a troubling precedent for an agency charged with making decisions rooted in scientific and legal grounds         As you know  the available scientific data indicate that emergency contraception  EC  helps prevent thousands of unintended pregnancies every year  without increasing the rates of unprotected sex  The FDA approved EC for the express purpose of preventing pregnancy  and the Guttmacher Institute estimated that in 2000 alone  use of EC prevented more than 50 000 abortions  Since that time  sales of EC have grown dramatically and researchers estimate that if made available over the counter  emergency contraception could prevent as many as half of the 3 million unintended pregnancies in the U S  annually         More than 70 organizations  including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics  have voiced their support for making Plan B available over the counter  A May 2004 statement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called your agency s failure to approve this application  despite the nearly unanimous recommendation of its own advisory panels  morally repugnant  and  a tragedy for American women   Just recently  the widely respected Assistant Commissioner for Women s Health and Director of the Office of Women  s Health at the FDA  Dr  Susan Wood  resigned in protest  stating that she has  spent the last 15 years working to ensure that science informs good health policy decisions  and  can no longer serve as staff when scientific and clinical evidence  fully evaluated and recommended for approval by the professional staff here  has been overruled          In your request for public comment  you cited particular concerns about access to emergency contraception for young girls  This act was a major deviation from the FDA  s normal standards for evaluating the safety and efficacy of reproductive health products  which have treated all women of child bearing age the same  It appears the FDA is changing the rules midstream  Furthermore  according to press reports  high ranking FDA scientists including Dr  John Jenkins  director of FDA s Office of New Drugs  wrote internal memos stating that Plan B did not pose any particular risks for younger women and that the agency was subjecting the application to more rigorous examination than applications for other drugs  Dr  Jenkins said Barr s application was  fully consistent with the agency s usual standards for meeting the criteria  for OTC status         In any case  several products available for sale in our society are already restricted by age  Retailers are prohibited from selling alcohol and tobacco products  including Nicorette  the FDA approved gum aimed at reducing nicotine addiction  to minors  Many retail chains  such as Wal Mart  Best Buy and Target  have already policies for verifying the age of purchasers as a means of enforcing these restrictions  Surely pharmacies  if they do not already  could follow suit         Furthermore  the FDA has had more than a year to develop a strategy for overcoming complications that could arise from selling a product with age restrictions  Instead you have opted for inaction  waiting until the last conceivable moment  seven months past the agency s own deadline  to announce yet another cause for delay         The fact is that not one reputable medical or scientific organization and few  if any  of the scientists within the FDA s own ranks support the decisions of the agency you head on this matter  The continued delays are damaging the reputation of the entire FDA and putting women s health at risk         We urge you to expeditiously make a decision on the application for OTC status for Plan B based strictly on scientific evidence          Sincerely         Senator Clinton  Senator Murray
