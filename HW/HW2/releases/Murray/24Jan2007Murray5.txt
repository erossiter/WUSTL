                                         News Release          Line Item Veto Hurts Our Communities  Murray Says      For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 24  2007     Washington  DC     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  released the following statement on a proposal to enact a line item veto         This misguided proposal will hurt the communities we are here to represent   It will strip them of the voice they have today in Congress through each of us  and it will hand even more legislative power to the Executive Branch          As I saw in my own experiences  both here in the U S  Senate and in the Washington state legislature  a line item veto is subject to abuse  pressure and horse trading  and it violates the delicate balance of power that the Founders so carefully designed        Now I recognize that the idea sounds attractive   It suggests that we could cut spending and control the deficit without having to make any tough choices   Well like a lot of ideas that sound good at first  once you look into it  the painful impact becomes clear          More importantly  I think all of us need to do the hard work of crafting responsible budgets   We need to legislate and govern and take the needs of the country and our states into consideration  We need to make the tough decisions    not pass the buck to the White House        I oppose the line item veto today for the same reasons I opposed it in the 1990 s   I voted against this gimmick when Congress handed that power to a Democratic president   And today I fight another attempt to hand that same power to a Republican president          For me  it s not about the party of the chief executive  it s about making sure that the constituents I represent have a voice in the budget decisions that affect their lives   The line item veto is the wrong approach for three reasons         The Line Item Veto Would Transfer Power to the Executive    First  it would cede a tremendous amount of power from Congress to the Executive Branch   The Constitution is very clear that Congress has the power of the purse   The framers of our Constitution carefully divided the powers of our government between the three branches          When Congress tried this before  it was ruled unconstitutional   This time around  the sponsors have tweaked the bill to try and address those concerns  but the underlying problem still remains   We should not be handing our legislative power over to the Executive branch   I made that argument in 1995    and it s even truer today  We ve seen the Bush Administration aggressively try to expand presidential power and limit Congressional input and oversight   We should stand our ground as the Founders intended    not surrender our Constitutional authority to the Executive branch       The Line Item Veto Would Hurt Our Constituents    Second  the line item veto would hurt the constituents we represent   They rely on us to fight for their needs and priorities   Through the budget and appropriations process  we work to meet the needs in our local communities    needs that the Administration would ignore   If we give up our ability to fight for our communities  our constituents will lose their voice   Because I can tell you  the communities we represent will not get fair consideration from a budget official sitting in Washington  D C        Last week  a group of constituents came to see me about a local road that needs to be improved   The changes they re seeking will improve safety  support economic development  and provide access to critically needed housing   I represent that community  so I know first hand those improvements are needed   That community has me fighting for them and pushing for their needs   The Administration is not going to do that  They re not going to send someone from Washington  D C  to check out the road and see that it s unsafe    In fact  these constituents had just come from a meeting with an Administration official who basically told them that  in regard to the continuing resolution   Good luck  we ll be making the decisions this year         That s just wrong   If we hand this power to the Administration  we will surrender our voices  and our constituents will lose their voices in advocating for their communities   The families I represent know that if they have a problem  they can come and talk to me   But if you tell them that they have to track down someone at OMB and convince them to care about their local needs  our communities will suffer        I came to the United States Senate to represent the people of my home State of Washington  They elected me to be their voice on a wide array of issues affecting everything from their safety to their health  education  and economic well being   I am not going to transfer my ability to fight for the people of Washington State to this or any other President   That s what this bill proposal would do  and I strongly oppose it       The Line Item Veto Is Subject to Abuse and Unfair Application    Third  experience has shown that the line item veto is subject to abuse and may be applied unfairly by an administration   I have experience with line item veto authority  I served in my state legislature and saw first hand the kind of horse trading that can occur when the Executive has this power         When President Clinton exercised the line item veto in 1997  we saw serious problems in the way it was applied   The White House put forward standards for deciding which projects would be targeted   But then it attacked projects that actually met the standards   In 1997  I stood here on the Senate floor and detailed the mistakes the Clinton Administration made in unfairly targeting projects for elimination   I don t want to see a repeat of those mistakes       The Right Way to Handle Spending    Crafting a responsible budget takes hard work   It requires tough choices   There is no gimmick or trick that will make the hard decisions go away   Handing our power and our constituents  power over to the White House certainly won t do it   So I say  rather than spending our time on a distraction  let s work on a real budget and on the real and difficult choices that are before us   Let s do the job that voters sent us here to do    without gimmicks and without trampling the Constitution
