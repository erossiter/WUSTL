                                                                                        News Release          Senator Murray   Raising the Minimum Wage is the  Right Thing to Do for Workers and Our Economy       For Immediate Release  Wednesday  June 21  2006     Washington  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  today voted to raise the federal minimum wage to  7 25 an hour   The amendment  offered by Senator Edward Kennedy  D MA   sought to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 1997   The measure failed 52 46  falling eight votes short of the 60 votes needed to pass         This is the longest time the nation has gone without raising the minimum wage since it was implemented in 1938   said Senator Murray   The real value of the current minimum wage is already  4 below what it was in 1968  We are long past the time for the nation  as a whole  to raise the level of the federal minimum wage         Since it was last raised the real value of the minimum wage has eroded by more than 20 percent  It is estimated that nearly 6 6 million Americans would directly benefit from a raise in the minimum wage  and that anther 8 3 million would benefit indirectly          By raising the minimum wage to  7 25  we can put an extra  4 400 a year into the pockets of workers  enabling them to better support their families   added Senator Murray   This meager amount can make a world of difference to the poor among us         The Full Text of Senator Murray s Statement Follows        Mr  President  I rise today in strong support of Senator Kennedy  s amendment to increase the minimum wage   Not only is it the right thing to do for working families  but my state has shown that a living wage is compatible with a growing economy  The facts speak for themselves  and they speak loudly  Let  s just take three numbers  9  37  and 50          Nine is the number of years since the minimum wage was last increased  This is the longest time the nation has gone without raising the minimum wage since it was implemented in 1938  The real value of the current minimum wage is already  4 below what it was in 1968        Thirty seven is the millions of Americans  37 million  who are currently living in poverty  including 13 million children         Fifty is the percent by which poverty has increased in the past generation  freezing out an ever larger portion of our working citizens from the advantages of a higher standard of living that most of us enjoy         Mr  President  I believe that these numbers are a very strong signal that we are long past the time for the nation  as a whole  to raise the level of the federal minimum wage   I am proud that my home state of Washington has the highest minimum wage in the country  and it is indexed yearly to ensure that our workers are properly compensated for their hard work        We in Washington State offer direct proof that a living minimum wage is compatible with a growing economy   May marked our 34th consecutive month of job growth   Our unemployment rate  even with the highest minimum wage in the country  is essentially at the national average   Our poverty rate stands at 11   which is significantly below the national average of 12 5    Our median household income stands at  48 000  much higher than the national average of  43 000   Good labor policies make for good labor productivity and a healthy state economy          Ever since the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 1938  opponents have kept raising the same baseless arguments  Even 68 years ago  opponents tried to paint a bleak picture of disastrous effects  like  factories closed    industries forced into bankruptcy   and  people who will be thrown out of employment    It wasn t true then   It s not true today   The fact is that this wage provides more economic opportunities for people to support their families and contribute to their communities        Opponents often cite a negative impact on jobs as their prime argument to oppose an increase in the minimum wage   This tired argument is simply not true   In fact  the four years following our last minimum wage increase marked the strongest economic growth in three decades  creating almost 12 million new jobs   In contrast  during the past four years we have only seen the creation of about 4 7 million new jobs         As elected representatives  it is our job not only to represent the people in our states  but also to stand up for the millions of Americans whose voices cannot be heard   Just since 2000  the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by a stunning 5 4 million people   A minimum wage employee  working 52 weeks a year for 40 hours a week  makes almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines for a family of three  At this rate  it will be a long time before we see significant progress against the scourge of poverty for America  s families         By raising the minimum wage to  7 25  we can put an extra  4 400 a year into the pockets of these workers  enabling them to better support their families   This meager amount can make a world of difference to the poor among us   It could mean 19 months of utilities  15 months of groceries  8 months of rent or tuition for a community college degree   These are the basics  not the luxuries  of life today          It is important to continually remind ourselves who is going to benefit from an increase   Here are some numbers to help set the record straight   This amendment will benefit nearly 15 million Americans  80  of whom are adults  not teenagers trying to earn some extra spending money   In fact  more than one third of these adults are the sole source of income for their families   And let  s not forget the 7 million children of those minimum wage workers who will benefit from this increase         Mr  President  this Congress has substantially cut the tax rates for the wealthiest people in this country  saving them millions of dollars over the last five years   But so far  this Congress has been unwilling to spend a few cents more to help the poorest of our working citizens        Mr  President  I have carefully considered all aspects of this amendment and have come to the conclusion that we have no acceptable alternative   I see the growth of the job market and the strong economy in my state   I see how we ve worked in Washington State to ensure that low wage workers share in this success   I know that this is what our nation needs   We should follow the lead of my state and the other 20 that have already increased their minimum wages and allow all Americans to share in these benefits          Overall  this slight increase in the minimum wage would allow a significant portion of our nation  people who are working hard and playing by the rules  to have an increased opportunity to share in the American dream   They will be able to better support their families and will not have to make unacceptable decisions like whether to buy groceries or pay the rent        If any of my colleagues oppose this amendment  I would like them to consider living on  10 700 a year  and not just living on it  but rather  trying to raise a family of 4 on that low income   That would mean having about  7 a day per person  not adding in all the bills   Now just think about how much you spent on your last meal   If we think of the debate that we are having in these terms  it is clear that raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do        I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to increase the minimum wage   Let s show them that we ve got our priorities straight  and let s finally give low income workers the raise that they are long overdue   It is the right thing to do for workers and the right thing to do for our economy
