                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray Amendment to Fully Fund Veterans   Health Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Murray  Murray Amendment to Fully Fund Veterans   Health Care  03 15 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Amendment to Fully Fund Veterans   Health Care    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  March 15  2005          This Administration decided to fund this war and all of its implications through supplemental requests  yet President  s budget does not provide even one dollar for a very important cost of war  and that is the care of our heroes when they return home   With a new generation of combat veterans deployed around the world  the federal government must meet its obligations to our veterans rather than look away in favor of other priorities                 U S  Senator Patty Murray       PURPOSE  To provide  71 434 billion in VA Health Care funding for FY2006           This is an increase of  2 85 billion above the Chairman  s mark        The Murray Amendment also         Rejects the President  s proposal to cut funding to State veterans   homes      Eliminates the means test for veterans to enroll for VA care      Provides for much needed mental health services      Rejects the President  s proposal to drive veterans away from the VA with annual user fees and increased prescription drug costs          In rejecting the amendment during the Budget Committee Markup  Senate Republicans made several claims that simply don t pass muster        CLAIM   Veterans Health Care Spending is Up 63        FACT  The number of Veterans receiving care has increased 88  and medical inflation has increased 92    Funding continues to fall far short of the need        CLAIM   The VA Hasn t Spent  500 Million     FACT  The VA builds a  500 million cushion into its budget for a rainy day fund and has never touched this funding   Republican claiming excess funding aren t touch with the realty on the ground        CLAIM   This Budget Increases VA Spending by Nearly  1 Billion      FACT  When you look at the numbers  the increase in medical care is less than  80 million   That s an increase of less than one half of 1  for veterans health care at a time of war                                                              Remarks on the Budget Amendment to Boost Funding for Veterans Health Care    Mr  President  at this hour veterans in my home state of Washington    and throughout the country    are waiting for the healthcare they were promised           They re facing understaffed and overcrowded VA hospitals and clinics   They re dealing with paperwork and red tape  And they aren t getting the service they were promised           At this hour  veterans from World War II  Korea  Vietnam and other conflicts are waiting for appointments to see a doctor  They re waiting for prescription drugs   They re waiting for help with post traumatic stress disorder    And while they are waiting    new veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan    and they need health care too        Every day the system is getting more and more crowded  the waiting lists are growing longer  and we ve got to do something about it   These brave men and women were there for us   Now we ve got to be there for them   They answered our country s call   Now we ve got to do our part         That s why I m on the Senate floor today with Senator Akaka offering an amendment to increase funding for veterans healthcare by  2 85 billion        I am here today with a simple message   Congress needs to keep our promise to America s veterans   We need to honor their service and sacrifice  And we need to fund healthcare now        I ve received many letters from veterans throughout my state    with this simple plea         Keep our promise to America s veterans   Fund healthcare now       We ve Got Work To Do    And let me just say we ve got a lot of work to do        If we follow the budget that President Bush proposed last month  we will    force veterans out the VA system  force veterans out of nursing homes  force veterans to pay more fees and co payments  and force veterans to wait even longer for the care they have earned        As the daughter of a disabled World War II veteran  as the first woman in history to serve on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  and as the voice of more than 700 000 brave veterans in Washington state  I will not let that happen        We ve Heard Excuses     I ve been fighting for veterans funding for many years   In fact  just last week in the Budget Committee  I offered an amendment to boost funding for VA healthcare   And do you know what some Senators told me          They said    We ve already increased veterans funding plenty    so we don t need another dime for veterans healthcare          We ll they re wrong   That s not what the veterans in my home state are telling me         This Vote is a Test    I want every Senator to know that how you vote on this amendment is a test of how committed you are to helping America s veterans   With this vote  we re going to find out    Who s serious about helping our veterans and who s just talking   With this vote  every Senator will have to announce publicly    whether they re making life better for veterans or whether they re making excuses          I m here to say    do the right thing    support this amendment and  keep the promise  to those who have served       Different Approaches  Bush  Senate  Murray Akaka    For those veterans who are following this debate  let me just recap where things stand        This month Congress is deciding how much money to spend on priorities like veterans healthcare   So far  we ve only had two choices        One is to follow President Bush s approach   He offered a budget that will impose higher fees and co payments on many veterans   It will lock the doors of the VA to thousands of veterans   It s no wonder that veterans organizations from coast to coast have denounced that budget proposal   So last week  the Senate Budget Committee worked on its own budget proposal   I serve on that committee  and I was part of that debate          The Republican proposal got rid of some of the onerous fees in the President s budget  but they refused to increase veterans funding to meet the needs   I tried to improve their bill with the Murray Veterans Healthcare Amendment  but Republicans blocked my funding and passed their inadequate budget on a party line vote        Now that flawed budget is here on the Senate floor  and we ve got one more chance to make it right   That s why I m here offering this amendment with Senator Akaka          Our amendment says    Let s fund veterans healthcare based on the real needs       The VSO s Told Us What Veterans Need    And we know what the needs are because over the past few weeks  the nation s largest veterans service organizations came before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee    on which I serve   Leaders from AMVETS  the Disabled Veterans of America  Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Veterans of Foreign Wars  all told us what they need   They re not asking for special treatment    just what they were promised in exchange for serving our country          They told us that veterans are not getting the help they need   They told us what would happen if we adopted the President s budget             For me  veterans health care is a very personal issue   My father served in World War II and returned as a disabled veteran   During the Vietnam War  I interned in the Seattle VA hospital          I know first hand the scars and wounds that burden our veterans when they come back home   During the Gulf War  when our soldiers were coming home with Gulf War Syndrome  I brought the VA Secretary out to Washington state so he could hear from the veterans I was hearing from   And over the past two years  when President Bush tried to close the doors at three VA hospitals in Washington state  I worked with veterans and community leaders from across the state to keep those facilities open          I continue to press the VA to open new community clinics in North Central Washington and in Whatcom County    to help serve veterans who today have little access to VA services       Every Year There s a Budget Fight over Veterans    When it comes to the VA s health care budget  it has been a battle every year to get the funding we need   Every year  the President has proposed a small number for veterans healthcare  and every year    we in Congress    have stepped in to protect our veterans        I ve been convinced for a long time that we need to move VA health care out of the annual budget process   That s why I ve sponsored legislation to make VA healthcare funding  mandatory  so it s always there    no matter what type of budget games are going on        But the Republican majority has blocked that common sense proposal every year    so the fight goes on       FY 2006    The President s Proposal    This year s debate started on February 2nd  when the President unveiled his budget proposal  The Veterans of Foreign Wars looked at his proposal and said     If the President s budget were approved  waiting times for basic health care appointments would again skyrocket  returning us to the era of the six month waiting period          That s what the commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said about the President s budget       The President s budget would force more than 2 million veterans to pay a  250 annual fee just to get VA healthcare   In my book if you served our country  you ve already paid your dues   It s insulting to nickel and dime America s veterans          The President s plan would also double the co payments for prescription drugs for thousands of veterans   It would slash research into prosthetics by  9 million   The President s budget would eliminate thousands of state run nursing home beds          In my home state  300 veterans who honorably served their country would lose their place in a state nursing home   That s 300 Washington families being asked to shoulder a new burden   That s just wrong   The President s budget would cut the VA workforce by more than 3 000 people    while a there s a backlog of more than 700 000 claims   That just doesn t make any sense          We ve got a huge backlog of claims    with new claims coming in every day    and now there will be fewer staff to process it   That s wrong        The President  s budget would also continue to ban some veterans from coming to the VA for care          So far  under this flawed policy  nearly 200 000 veterans have been turned away    including more than 3 100 veterans in Washington   That s what the President has proposed   So I ve been working to fix that   But I ve got to tell you it s been frustrating        No one in this Administration is willing to say how we re going to take care of our newest veterans when we ve got waiting lists for existing veterans         I ve Pressed for Answers    I asked the President s Budget Director on February 9th     Where s the money in your budget to take care of our newest veterans and our existing veterans        I didn t get an answer  so on February 15th I asked the Veterans Secretary   I didn t get an answer from him    so the next day    I asked the Defense Secretary   I didn t get an answer  so I offered an amendment in the Senate Budget Committee last week          My veterans amendment was defeated on a party line vote of 10 12   So I m here on the Senate floor with a similar amendment  and now every Senator is going to have to go on the record either for or against our veterans       Refuting False Claims    During this debate  you re going to hear Senators say that  we ve raised veterans funding plenty           Other Senators are going to suggest that we re meeting the needs today   I m going to refute those claims line by line   But let me say this first    When veterans tell me they re being left behind  and then a politician tells me everything is fine    I m going to believe the veteran every time        With that said  let s look at some of the claims the other side will make       CLAIM   Veterans Health Care Spending is Up 63       One of the arguments you ll hear from opponents is that appropriations for veterans medical care grew by 63 percent from FY 1995 to FY 2004        That figure claim is inaccurate because it leaves out three critical facts   First  the number of veterans served has gone up dramatically over that same period of time    as this chart shows        During those same years  the number of unique veterans getting care from the VA has increased by 88 percent    So it s nice that funding has gone up  but it s nowhere close to meeting the number of veterans who are getting care at the VA        Second  the Republican claim is inaccurate because it ignores the impact of medical inflation   As the chart shows    over the same time frame    medical inflation has shot up 92 percent   So the increases we ve had so far have not even kept up with medical inflation   So it s great that veterans funding has increased over the years    but it hasn t even kept up with inflation  There s another problem with this Republican excuse        Every day new veterans are coming back home and seeking care at the VA   If the number of veterans was going to be stable in the coming years  it would be one thing  but we know the number of veterans will keep growing as soldiers come home from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom   Washington state has sent thousands of brave men and women to Iraq and Afghanistan over the past few years   And now  a large group is returning home    including nearly 4 000 members of the National Guard          This is the next generation of veterans   Congress needs to provide more funding if we re going to keep up with the growing needs   So we re going to hear some opponents claim that    veterans funding has gone up by 63 percent so veterans don t need another dime        When they make that claim  we need to remind them that    The number of veterans in the VA system has gone up 88 percent Medical inflation has shot up 92 percent and we re creating new veterans every day who need a strong  stable VA to care for them       CLAIM   The VA Hasn t Spent  500 Million    Here s another excuse we ll hear from opponents   They ll say that the VA is sitting on nearly  500 million   VA officials here in Washington  D C  may be holding funds back to see what next year may bring   But that doesn  t mean that the funds are not needed at VA hospitals and clinics   VA  s health networks are already experiencing shortfalls   As a result  the Committee has heard that outpatient clinics have stopped seeing even the poorest of patients    sending them hundreds of miles away to other facilities        In fact  I m hearing from veterans leaders in my region that the VA is not moving forward with new clinics in Whatcom County and in North Central Washington because all those dollars are needed for medical care for existing veterans        So if the VA is sitting on funds we appropriated  I want those dollars moved out to help veterans as we intended   It is not an excuse to block this amendment       CLAIM   This Budget Increases VA Spending by Nearly  1 Billion     Mr  President  we may also hear opponents claim that this budget increases veterans funding by about  900 million   But when you look at the numbers  the increase in medical care is less than  80 million        I have a chart that was produced by the Majority staff of the Veterans Committee that I d like to insert into the RECORD after my remarks       CLAIM   We Don t Know How the Appropriations Committee Will Spend This Money     We ve also heard some opponents say that we shouldn t provide another dime in the budget for veterans healthcare because we don t know how the Appropriations Committee will spend that money        Mr  President  I serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee and I serve on the Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee   If the Senate passes this amendment  then the Appropriations Committee will have explicit instructions that this money is to be spent on veterans healthcare          And because I serve on all of the committees involved    Appropriations and Veterans Affairs    I will be there    at every turn    to remind my colleagues of the promise we make       Helping Veterans Makes America Secure    Mr  President  this is also about making sure our military is strong today   How we treat our veterans affects our ability to recruit the men and women we need to serve in our armed forces          That s nothing new    it s been true since the very founding of our country    On this chart  I ve placed a quote from George Washington in 1789         Washington said   The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country            We have an opportunity today    with this Amendment    to do right by our veterans and to keep our country strong   This amendment will help us meet the growing needs and will ensure we keep the promise to those who have answered our country s call to service   They were there for us when we needed them  and we need to be there for them          With this amendment  every Senator will have to decide if they re voting for veterans    or against them        I urge every Senator to do the right thing and vote for the Murray Akaka Amendment
