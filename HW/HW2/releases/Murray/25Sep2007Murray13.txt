                                                                    News Release          Senator Murray Helps Lead VA Committee Hearing on Gulf War Veterans  Illness Murray hears moving testimony from Washington state veteran about her struggle with Gulf War related health problems    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  September 25  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  helped lead an important Senate Veterans  Affairs   VA  Committee hearing on Gulf War veterans  illness  Senator Murray requested the hearing to focus on the latest research and treatment for Gulf War veterans  illness  There are still many unanswered questions about Gulf War illness  and Senator Murray is using her position as a senior member of the Senate VA Committee to make sure Gulf War veterans receive the care they need  It has been 16 years since the first Gulf War ended  and while for many Americans the conflict is nothing more than a distant memory  it remains a source of continuous anguish for thousands of veterans of that period who now suffer from chronic multi symptom illness  Murray stated  Among the witnesses who testified was Julie Mock  a Washington state veteran and President of the Veterans of Modern Warfare  Julie provided poignant testimony on her and her family s struggles with medical conditions resulting from her deployment to the Persian Gulf  During the months of January  February and March 1991  we repeatedly experienced the loud alarms of chemical detectors  Mock testified  We ingested expired pyrostigmine bromide tablets  we wore gas masks with expired filters  inhaled dust and sand in the air that was thick with the black of burning oil  I experienced respiratory difficulties  my skin grew hot with red rashes and I began to suffer from debilitating headaches  Many of my contemporaries experienced many of the same  or a combination of these symptoms   Senator Murray s Opening Statement  Mr  Chairman  I want to start by thanking you for holding todays hearing on the latest research and treatment taking place for Gulf War veterans illness  I want to recognize our first panel of witnesses who are here today and who have dedicated so much of their time to fighting for veterans inflicted with Gulf War illness  I want to especially thank Julie Mock  who is from my home state of Washington and is President of the Veterans of Modern Warfare  Despite her ill health and the disorders and diseases her children struggle with  Julie flew all the way across the country to testify about how Gulf War illness has affected her and her family  Julie will also speak about the need for more research  better treatment and improved access for ill Gulf War veterans  Julie is putting a face and a story to the numbers we will hear about today and is speaking out for so many who couldnt be here  and for that  we thank you  It has been 16 years since the first Gulf War ended  and while for many Americans the conflict is nothing more than a distant memory  it remains a source of continuous anguish for thousands of veterans of that period who now suffer from chronic multi symptom illness  This committee has held numerous hearings on Gulf War illness over the years  beginning in 1993  These hearings explored the latest research and probed the possible causes of Gulf War illness  Since that time  our understanding of medicine has evolved  technology has improved  and more about the war has been uncovered  Yet the exact nature and cause of Gulf War illness remains disputed by many  What isnt disputed is that of the nearly 700 000 U S  service members who served in the Gulf War  approximately 30 percent suffer from chronic multi symptom illness  These veterans deserve to know that everything is being done to identify and connect all possible exposures to their illnesses  They need to know that their illnesses will be treated by the VA  and they need to know that every effort is being made to ensure that what happened to them will never happen to future generations of our warriors  Todays hearing is an opportunity to discuss the latest research and treatment options  and to question whether current efforts are sufficient for improving the lives of veterans inflicted with Gulf War illness  or if more needs to be done  It has been said that those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it  and I think it is with those words in mind that we are holding todays hearing     With more than 160 000 troops currently stationed in Iraq we must ensure that we are studying the lasting effects of the last time Americans were sent there  We must never forget the lessons Vietnam and the horrors of Agent Orange exposure taught us    It is our responsibility to be proactive about the health and well being of our men and women in uniform  Today we have the opportunity to examine a disease and a group of veterans who are too often overlooked  I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses and I thank them all for coming forward to address this problem  Thank you Mr  Chairman
