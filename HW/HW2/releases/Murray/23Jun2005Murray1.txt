                                                                  News Release          VA Announces  1 Billion Shortfall  Senator Murray Demands Immediate Action    For Immediate Release  Thursday  June 23  2005             WASHINGTON  DC     In the wake of a Bush Administration announcement that the Veterans Administration has a  1 billion shortfall  Senator Patty Murray today expressed her disappointment and swiftly moved to introduce emergency legislation to fix the problem          Murray  who has attempted to add funding for veterans care to the budget process three times this year  today once again introduced an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that would allow the VA to meet its obligations to veterans         The administration announcement comes after repeated assurances that the VA had more than enough money to make it through the fiscal year   During the debate on the FY2006 Budget and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  Nicholson and other Republican leaders claimed that the VA did not face a crisis          In April  VA Secretary Jim Nicholson wrote a letter in which he declared   I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005 to continue to provide the timely  quality service that is always our goal    Under question by Senator Murray two weeks ago in the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  Nicholson once again repeated his claim that the VA had the money it needs          Senator Murray s remarks at today s press conference and the April letter from Secretary Nicholson follow                                                                                         At a press conference today  Senator Murray said        Caring for the veterans who have sacrificed for our freedom is the duty of a grateful nation   These brave men and women made a solemn promise to protect our country          Our reciprocal promise is to take care of them when they return home from their missions  That is why I find today s admission by the VA that they will need an estimated  1 billion more in emergency funding just to get through fiscal year 2005 appalling  but not surprising          Unfortunately  this Administration has been unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary to fulfill the promises we have made to our veterans  Throughout the budget and supplemental appropriations processes  I fought to increase funding to care for our nation  s veterans   I used my position on the Budget Committee  the Appropriations Committee  and the Veterans  Affairs Committee to get adequate funding for our veterans  I also introduced an amendment to the Supplemental bill to provide for our troops by assuring access to quality health care services and benefits when they return home  I took these measures because I have long believed that caring for our veterans is a fundamental cost of war  Each time  my efforts failed on party line votes          Secretary Nicholson and others fought my amendment claiming the funding was not needed  In an April 5th letter to Chairman Hutchison  the Secretary wrote  quote          I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY2005 to continue to provide timely  quality service that is always our goal      End quote         Even two weeks ago  under direct questioning  Secretary Nicholson did not indicate a need for emergency FY 2005 funding for the VA  Now  less than 3 months after his letter  the Secretary is saying we are short more than  1 billion for veterans  funding  When I was fighting to get my veterans  healthcare amendment passed a few months ago  I warned my colleagues that what was an emergency would become a crisis if we did not work together to address the problem  With VA s announcement today  that emergency has indeed become a crisis        I very much regret that it has come to this  But now is the time to come together and provide the needed dollars so that our veterans have the quality  accessible care they need and deserve   I will work with anyone and everyone to keep this commitment to our veterans and our current service men and women  Taking care of our veterans is a fundamental cost of war    and this is a problem we can not postpone or sweep under the rug        The bottom line is that too many of our veterans are going without the care they need  they deserve  and they have earned as part of their service   With new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan every day  this problem only promises to get worse  When adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000   This is having a big impact on patients    and on VA healthcare personnel   Veterans are having to wait three years for surgery   In my home state of Washington    at the VA  s American Lake facility    you can only get an appointment if you are 50 percent or more service connected disabled  In the Puget Sound    as of January    there was an  11 million deficit  forcing the VA hospitals to leave vacant positions unfilled         Every indication is that we simply do not have enough funding for our current services  and the VA seems unable to handle the increased number of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan while still providing high levels of service to other veterans   This is not right   It is not what veterans were promised   That s why  today  I introduced legislation to provide emergency supplemental funding for the VA          It is identical to the amendment that I offered to the Emergency Supplemental in April to provide  1 98 billion to fully fund our veterans   health care needs   Though that amendment was rejected three times    twice in committee and once on the Senate floor    on party line votes  I am confident that my colleagues will see their way clear to support this critical funding in light of today s highly disappointing and saddening announcement from the VA        My bill would enable the VA to absorb the influx of new veterans and reverse critical budget shortfalls  while still maintaining the quality of care for current veterans   It does this by  providing  525 million for mental health care for returning veterans as many need help with post traumatic stress disorder   providing  610 million for our newest veterans  so they do not have to compete with existing veterans for health care  and providing  40 million for every veterans regional network so they can open new clinics and meet local needs         Today  most VA networks face a  40 million shortfall that hurts our veterans  Under my bill  each of the 21 regional veterans  health networks will receive  40 million to spend on its priorities  For some areas  that will mean erasing big deficits  In others  it will help them hire more medical staff   In other parts of the country  they ll use it to buy medical equipment  That flexible funding will allow each region to prepare their staff and facilities for our newest veterans  It will put a total of  840 million where local communities need it most        I urge the Administration to submit a supplemental request and fulfill the promise to our nation  s veterans  Caring for our veterans is not a Republican or Democratic issue  it  s an American issue   As we head into the 4th of July recess  I call on Congress and the Administration to work with me to do the most patriotic thing we can do    fulfill our promise to care for America  s veterans        Before I close  I would like to say that I intend to work with my colleagues to get to the bottom of this issue  I don t know how we got into this situation of such an enormous shortfall in VA funding   But I intend to find out  This shortfall results from either deliberate misdirection or gross incompetence by this Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs   Just two months ago they vehemently argued against the need for more money  raising loud  consistent objections to my efforts on the Budget and the Emergency Supplemental  Two months later  they re one billion dollars short   That s outrageous   These are questions that must    and will    be dealt with                                                                                       April letter from Secretary Nicholson        THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS  Washington  DC         April 5  2005         Hon  Kay Bailey Hutchison  Chairman  Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs  Committee on Appropriations  U S  Senate  Washington  DC     Dear Madam Chairman         Before I begin the main purpose of this letter  I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the consideration and interest you have shown VA through your leadership in this year s appropriation hearing and many other endeavors on behalf of our veterans  I very much appreciate your proactive involvement and commitment to providing for those who have served this country with such dedication          I write to you today to address certain issues regarding VA s FY 2005 fiscal situation  I know some have said that VA must have emergency supplemental funds to continue providing the services for which veterans depend on us  timely health care and delivery of benefits  Whenever trends indicate the need for refocusing priorities  VA s leaders ensure prudent use of reserve funding for these purposes  That is just simply part of good management  It does not  however  indicate a   dire emergency    I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005 to continue to provide the timely  quality service that is always our goal  We will  as always  continue to monitor workload and resources to be sure we have a sustainable balance  But certainly for the remainder of this year  I do not foresee any challenges that are not solvable within our own management decision capability          I look forward to continuing to work with you as we strive to provide the very best service possible for those veterans who depend on us the most  Thank you again for your leadership in this important area          Sincerely yours          R  James Nicholson
