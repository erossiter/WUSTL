                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray Statement on Nomination of Samuel Alito to Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Murray  Murray Statement on Nomination of Samuel Alito to Supreme Court  10 31 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Statement on Nomination of Samuel Alito to Supreme Court    For Immediate Release  Monday  October 31  2005      Today  less than a week after the withdrawal of Harriet Miers  the President has nominated Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court   We have much to learn about Samuel Alito and I will not pass judgment until I have all the facts        While the President  s standards for a Supreme Court nominee may shift with the political winds  mine do not   I examine each nominee  s record  experience and testimony  and see if they meet my long held standards   Are they ethical  honest and qualified   Will they be evenhanded  fair  independent  and will they uphold our rights and liberties   Just as I evaluated Chief Justice Roberts and ultimately voted to confirm him based on these criteria  I will give a fair and diligent review on these standards to Judge Alito        But today  s nomination must be closely examined due to the actions of the President himself   The withdrawal of Harriet Miers came following intense right wing political pressure that compromised the nomination process to our nation  s highest court         The withdrawal of a Supreme Court nominee to placate the radical right has implications for the nomination of Judge Alito        I am disappointed that this nominee does not even maintain the current diversity on the Court   The President would have done well to ensure that our nation  s highest court better reflects the diversity of background and thought of the American people        I had encouraged the President to take his time and appoint a nominee who represents mainstream judicial thought and would unite the American people and the Senate just as Justice O  Connor  s nomination did two decades ago   To hastily appoint a nominee without consulting Senators from both parties indicates that this action may be more about politics than respect for the process          I pledge to do all I can to learn about Judge Alito and will consider his nomination based on the best interests of my constituents and whether he will be a Justice for all Americans
