properties in Seattle at the 13th Annual Charles L  Edson Tax Credit Excellence Awards  The awards  which are sponsored by the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition  honor the best and brightest in Housing Credit development  This year  out of 48 entries in 28 states  two Seattle properties were selected as honorable mention winners  The Seattle low income housing properties honored today are Genesee Apartments in South Seattle and the Broadway Crossing building  which is at the intersection of the Pike Pine neighborhood and Broadway s business district  I am so pleased to help honor these properties that are providing affordable living  innovative support services  and economic hope to Seattle residents  said Senator Murray  This recognition honors these properties  leadership in building partnerships  using federal support  and designing with the input of the community in mind  It is affordable housing done the right way  and I hope that it can be emulated throughout Washington and across the country  The Housing Credit program was created as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986  It is widely regarded as the nation s most successful housing production program ever  resulting in the construction and rehabilitation of more than 1 9 million housing units for low income Americans     Broadway Crossing  Metropolitan Urban Housing  Honorable Mention  Broadway Crossing is a powerful example of positive economic development and what can happen when a community bands together to make affordable housing a reality in their neighborhood  Senator Murray discussing Broadway Crossing   behind the Broadway Crossing Project    Broadway Crossing sits at the intersection of the Pike Pine neighborhood and Broadway s business district  The site that Broadway Crossing is on was originally intended to house a single story Walgreen s  However  because of the involvement of community members  the focus changed to a mixed use building that provides affordable housing  The public Design Review meeting to consider this building had more community participants than any other Design Review meeting in the last 10 years  Walgreen s chose to support the community plan and partnered with the community based non profit housing group Capitol Hill Housing to make it a reality     This project now serves as a role model to similar efforts in adjacent neighborhoods  Broadway Crossing is environmentally friendly  incorporates elements of the community in its architecture  features local art work  is accessible to public transportation and has a stunning view of downtown Seattle  With the help of the Gates foundation it is also home to residents transitioning from homelessness  Broadway Crossing is a shining example of how a grassroots community effort can utilize the Affordable Housing Tax Credit and private investment   The Genesee Apartments  Special Needs Housing  Honorable Mention  The Genesee Apartments offer some of Seattle s most vulnerable residents much more than a roof over their heads  It offers them the opportunity to live an independent lifestyle while knowing that support services ranging from mental health counseling to job training are always within reach  Senator Murray discussing The Genesee Apartments    behind The Genesee Apartments     The Genesee Apartments are located in the 4400 block of Martin Luther King South in the Seattle Housing Authority s Rainer Vista Hope VI redevelopment  The Genesee Apartments are mixed use  and roughly half of the two building complex s units are dedicated to those with special needs  These units accommodate people with both developmental and physical disabilities with a focus on households living with HIV AIDS  Like Broadway Crossing  the Genesee Apartments also serve families transitioning from homelessness with the help of the Gates Foundation     The supportive services available at the Genesee Apartment include health maintenance  mental health counseling  financial management  education resources  and job training  Genesee is very accessible to public transit  It has two bus lines that that pass through the intersection and is located on the new Sound Transit line  The buildings design and layout were created with input from potential residents  neighbors  a community advisory group  a Universal Design consultant  and the City of Seattle s Neighborhood Design Review board  The project was funded by a capital campaign and funding from the City  County  and State  HUD Section 811 and Low Income Tax Credit funding   about the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition and the Tax Credit Excellence Awards
