                                          News Release          Murray Responds to Mineta Letter on Amtrak Funding Senator calls on Administration to rethink short sighted funding policy    For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 26  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash    Ranking Member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  today responded to a letter by Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta to Amtrak President David Gunn urging immediate cost cutting measures to address the company s declining cash position          Secretary Mineta shouldn  t be surprised that Amtrak is facing a financial crisis   His own Administration  s budget policies have been one of the largest contributors to it     Murray said today         Mineta  s letter references Gunn  s testimony before the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee on May 12th   In response to a question by Murray  Gunn testified that the Bush Administration  s stated goal to put Amtrak into bankruptcy and the failure of a Senate amendment to restore Amtrak  s funding has had a significant negative impact on Amtrak  s cash position   Gunn testified that  as a result of those events  Amtrak  s bond rating was downgraded  the railroad  s insurance costs and accounting costs increased  and the financial requirements by Amtrak  s suppliers were tightened           After starving the patient for the last four years  Secretary Mineta is now complaining that the patient is malnourished   Secretary Mineta and the Bush Administration should have been thinking about Amtrak  s ability to sell tickets and control other costs before they proposed zeroing out Amtrak  s budget and pushing the railroad into bankruptcy                 Over the life of the Bush Administration  President Bush has requested more than  4 billion less than Amtrak has said it needed   As a result  annual funding has been almost a third less than the levels Amtrak said it required           The Bush Administration  s budget policies have been severely detrimental to Amtrak  s financial condition     Murray said     If they really care about Amtrak  s ability to stay solvent  they should abandon their proposal to eliminate their Federal support and provide some certainty to Amtrak  s 25 million riders that there will still be rail service at the end of this year           The text of Secretary Mineta  s letter to David Gunn follows        Mr  David L  Gunn  President and Chief Executive Officer  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  60 Massachusetts Avenue  NE  Washington  DC 20002   Dear Mr  Gunn        In view of Amtrak s declining cash position as we approach the last quarter of FY 2005  I am writing to strongly recommend that you immediately begin to implement cost cutting measures with the purpose of reducing expenses and conserving cash in a manner that does not jeopardize safety        I noted with concern your May 12 testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies regarding FY 2006 Appropriations  When responding to a question about whether Amtrak will end FY 2005 with a positive cash balance  you said       we ll have like  20 million left in the bank  something in that neighborhood   I am concerned that your projection assumes the release of  60 million set aside by law to pay for directed service in the event Amtrak ceases operations  My review of your cash projections indicates you are counting on that money even though the law clearly requires the Department to hold those funds in reserve until we are certain they will not be needed to maintain commuter operations at year s end  Given your recent Senate testimony  it is irresponsible to project a positive cash balance based on an assumption about reserve funds  when without those dollars  Amtrak s cash position before September 30th could be as much as  40 million in the red          You cannot continue to spend at current levels when  according to your own estimates  the recent interruption of Acela Express Service due to cracks in the brake systems  is itself costing the company roughly  1 25 million per week  Management of Amtrak s FY 2005 budget must be based on existing revenue streams and not on hopes for yet another taxpayer bailout  It is imperative that you take meaningful steps to reduce costs as soon as possible  As the President of the corporation  you have a responsibility to identify and implement all available operating expense reduction options necessary to ensure that Amtrak s cash position does not deteriorate to the  dangerously low level you predicted before the Senate Subcommittee          I have directed my designee to the Amtrak Board  Jeffrey A  Rosen  to raise this issue at tomorrow s Board meeting and I look forward to hearing from you about your specific plans to reduce operating expenses in order to protect Amtrak s cash position and viability through the end of this fiscal year        Sincerely          Norman Y  Mineta         cc  David M  Laney  Chairman  Amtrak Board of Directors
