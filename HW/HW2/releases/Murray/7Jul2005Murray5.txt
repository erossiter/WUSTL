                                                                                                                News Release          Senator Murray Addresses Port Security  Trade in Speech to Washington Council on International Trade s Annual Conference      For Immediate Release  Thursday  July 7  2005    I m really excited to be here with all of you to mark the 10th anniversary of the Senators  Trade Conference  I want to thank WCIT  its leadership and staff over the past 10 years for helping to make this conference our state s top forum for discussing timely and provocative trade issues       Here in the state of Washington  we know better than anybody that trade impacts all of our lives  We all come to the table    and to this conference    with different viewpoints whether it  s a local company that makes products to sell overseas  a local storeowner who relies on trade to stock the shelves  a dockworker or truck driver who relies on trade for their livelihood  a farmer who grows products for export  or a family that can buy the things it needs because we trade with the world        No matter where we come from    no matter how trade touches our lives    we all know it s important to have a forum where we can discuss the most pressing trade topics  And over the years  we ve had some really tough discussions on China  the environment  labor  wages and more         But we ve always walked away at the end of the day knowing that    even if we disagree    we all want to make sure Washington state stays strong  I think we all realize that if we can t trade with the world and if we can t sell the things we make    our state cannot move forward       Today I want to talk about three challenges that I see facing our state and our country as we try to move forward on trade  The first challenge is deep anxiety over new trade agreements  The second challenge is our long term ability to help shape and enforce trade agreements so they benefit our state and our country  And the third challenge    in the post 9 11 era    is making commerce more secure without slowing trade to a crawl       Let s start with that first challenge because it is one that is front and center today in Washington  D C   and throughout the country   There is a strong and very public sense of anxiety about making new trade agreements   It s based on legitimate concerns and an underlying uncertainty that we must address  Let s remember that concern about trade does not take place in a vacuum   It s taking place in a context where people don t feel secure about their jobs or their place in the economy       I think one of the reasons that we  re seeing CAFTA become such a controversial issue is because people don  t feel secure today   They don  t think they  ll have their job in five years  they don  t think their pension or retirement plan will still be there for them  they get a new job  and they don  t have healthcare  or they don  t feel they have the training to get a new job   So when you come along and say      You  re going to have to compete in a global environment       that can be a scary thing   And the concerns that I hear are legitimate        The Bush Administration is doing a poor job explaining to the American people what we want our economy to look like and how we compete and win in the global economy   If the Bush Administration does not make changes  they will see support for their trade policies continue to erode  But it  s not just about talking to people and telling them to feel more secure   You have to address the underlying structural problems that drive that insecurity   We certainly don t have enough support for efforts that help people make transitions from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow         As the top Democrat on the Senate Committee that handles workforce issues  investing in job training and other support programs has been one of my top priorities and I can tell you today that we are not doing enough  Every family and every business knows that the ever rising costs of healthcare are driving a lot of economic decisions today   We have got to do more to get these costs under control while retaining the high quality we in the Northwest have come to enjoy and expect from our healthcare system        And right now  because of the stubbornness of the Bush Administration  the Congress is debating a transportation bill that will not meet the growing needs of our country    And unfortunately  the Congressional majority is acquiescing to this mis guided approach   The result will be inadequate investment in the infrastructure that will make our country stronger  more efficient  and competitive       And we must also work to stabilize and secure our retirement system  We must work with industry and labor to confront today  s private pension problems   And instead of arguing over whether to privatize Social Security we should be talking about how we can secure it for future generations of Americans        So if we want to move forward on trade  we have to meet people where they are by acknowledging and addressing the real concerns they have about global competition and    more than that    by making serious investments that make us strong at home  We must improve job security  healthcare  infrastructure and retirement security  so American workers can feel confident about meeting the competition head on       The second challenge I see is making sure the United States has a seat at the table so we can shape trade agreements that support our economy and reflect our values  If we stop building trade relationships with the rest of the world  we will surrender our ability to participate in defining the rules of trade   If the U S  opts out now from trade agreements because of these real concerns  then we  ll be sitting on the sidelines as places like China and South America reach their own trade agreements  They ll write the trade rules without a thought to what it means to American workers or American priorities like labor and the environment  If we walk away from the trade table  we lose our voice         And this challenge is not just limited to writing trade agreements    it also affects our ability to enforce trade deals  We need to make sure that when trading partners are breaking the rules    or not keeping their promises  we can make things right        A good example of that is the current dispute between the United States and Europe over subsidies to Airbus  For years  I ve been raising my concern within our government that Europe is breaking the rules by subsidizing Airbus   Those European subsidies are one reason why our county has lost 700 000 aerospace jobs in the past 15 years  I called for our government to pull out of a trade agreement that allowed some subsidies    and not long after  our government did just that  I called for our government to tell the Europeans that if they aren t serious about ending subsidies  we would file a trade case with the WTO and our government has done that       Today  the United States government is pushing back at the highest levels   I  ve worked closely with the Bush Administration on this fight   We don t agree on much  but I commend their work on this trade fight   Without rules in place  this fight would not be possible       I worked closely with the former US Trade Rep  Robert Zoellick  and I  m developing a good relationship with the new Trade Rep    Rob Portman   We sat down in my office a few weeks ago for a meeting  and I was very pleased by his depth of knowledge and his commitment to stand up for fair trade and for American workers  The European subsidy dispute is just one example of that second challenge I mentioned    making sure we keep a seat at the table so we can shape and enforce trade agreements       The third challenge is this  how can we make trade more secure without slowing it to a crawl and how can we find the right balance  If we have absolute security  we  ll curtail trade  and if we have completely open trade  we won t have enough security       For the past few years  I ve been meeting with leaders in government and industry to figure out how we can strike the right balance  One thing I know for sure is that it s better for us to work together now to design a security system on our own terms than to wait for an attack and force a security system in a crisis atmosphere       I ve spent several years exploring this challenge and meeting with stakeholders to get their ideas   As a result of that work  I ve developed a new legislative proposal  and today  I want to outline it for you  It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security while keeping trade efficient  At its heart  this challenge is about keeping the good things about trade    speed and efficiency    without being vulnerable to the bad things about trade    the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce       For decades  the people in this room and your peers around the world have worked hard to create an open  efficient trade system   That system relies on cargo containers to move the vast majority of the world s commerce from factory to market   The cargo container has reduced the cost of trade    helping American businesses and creating American jobs  We can be proud of the efficiency and speed of our container trading system  But that system was designed for a different time  before terrorist attacks on American soil and before fanatics took jetliners and turned them into missiles   Our container trading system was designed for a world before September 11th        Here we are  almost four years later    and we still haven t made our maritime cargo system as secure as it needs to be   Six months after the September 11th attacks  I held a hearing to examine the vulnerability of cargo security   Many of the concerns that were raised at that hearing are still dogging us today       Based on the research I ve done  cargo containers represent a dangerous vulnerability for our country   Let me give you one example        A few years ago in Italy  dockworkers noticed something strange about one cargo container   They opened it up and found an Egyptian man inside  but this was not your average stowaway  This man was a suspected Al Qaeda terrorist  and he had all the tools of the terror trade  His cargo container had been outfitted for a long voyage with a bed  toilet  heater and water   He had a satellite phone and a laptop computer  He also had security passes and mechanic certificates for four U S  airports  That happened in 2001  Friends  it can still happen today  But don t take my word for it       The head of Customs and Border Protection said that    quote  the container is the potential Trojan Horse of the 21st century    End quote  And the 9 11 Commission said that terrorists may turn from targeting aviation to targeting seaports because    quote  opportunities to do harm are as great  or greater  in maritime or surface transportation    End quote  The U S  Government recently uncovered an Al Qaeda training manual   The book suggested that terrorists try to recruit workers at  borders  airports and seaports        There are two main scenarios we need to think about       First  a group like Al Qaeda could use cargo containers to smuggle weapons and personnel into the United States   They could split up a weapon and ship it to the U S  in separate containers   Those pieces could then be reassembled anywhere in the U S   So the first danger is that terrorists could use cargo containers to get dangerous weapons into the U S       Second  terrorists could use a cargo container itself as a weapon   A terrorist could place a nuclear  chemical  or biological weapon in a container and then detonate it once it reaches a U S  port or another destination inside the U S  Either scenario is frightening   Experts who have looked at this report see some disturbing possibilities       One study said if a nuclear device was detonated at a major seaport  it would kill up to 1 million people  Many of our ports are located near major cities   Others are located near key transportation hubs   For example  if a chemical weapon were detonated here in Seattle  the chemical plume could contaminate the rail system  Interstate 5 and SeaTac Airport  They could detonate a dirty bomb or launch a bioterror attack  Any of these scenarios could impose a devastating cost in human lives  but that s not all       We also know that Al Qaeda wants to cripple our economy   Cargo containers offer them a powerful way to do that    and the damage goes beyond lives  An attack launched through our ports would also have a devastating economic impact  That s because    after an attack    the federal government is likely to shut down our ports to make sure that additional hazards weren t being brought into the country    It s similar to what we did with airplanes after 9 11       When we stopped air travel  it took us a few days to get back up to speed    and it costs our economy a great deal  But if you stopped cargo containers without a system in place  it could take as long as 4 months to get them inspected and moving again    That would cripple our economy and could even spark a global recession       Today  cargo containers are part of the assembly line of American business   We have just in time delivery and rolling warehouses   If you shut down the flow of cargo  you shut down our economy  If our ports were locked down  we would feel the impact at every level of our economy  Factories won t be able to get the raw materials they need   Many keep small inventories on hand         Once those inventories run out  factories will be shut down and workers will be laid off  We d see the impact in our stores   Merchants won t be able to get their products from overseas   Store shelves will go bare  and workers will be laid off  One study concluded that if U S  ports were shut down for 12 days  it would cost our economy  58 billion       In 2002  we saw what just closing down a few ports on the West Coast would do    When West Coast dockworkers were locked out  it cost our economy about  1 billion a day  Imagine if we shut down all our ports    not just those on the West Coast          Dr  Stephen Flynn  a national security expert  has said that a three week shut down could spawn a global recession  It s clear that we are vulnerable and that an attack would do tremendous damage  And if our ports were shut down  we don t have a system in place for getting them started again   There is no protocol for what would be searched  what would be allowed in  and even who would be in charge      Now  I want to acknowledge that we have made some progress since 9 11  We ve provided some funding to make our ports more secure   I ve fought for port security grants to make sure we re controlling access to ports  And our local ports are on the cutting edge of security  We  ve implemented the 48 hour rule so we have a list of what s supposed to be in a container before it reaches the U S   We are adding some more detection equipment to American ports    but remember    once a nuclear device is sitting on a U S  dock    it s too late   Customs created a program that works with foreign ports to speed some cargo into the U S   It s a good idea  but it has not been implemented well         The Government Accountability Office just issued a report  It found that if companies applied for C TPAT status  we gave them less scrutiny simply for submitting paperwork   We never checked to see if they actually did what they said they were going to do    we just inspected them less        In fact  even when U S  Customs finds something suspicious at a foreign port  they can t force a container to be inspected   They can ask the local government  but those requests are frequently rejected   Because we can t enforce those agreements through our State Department  our Customs officials don t have the power they need and potentially dangerous cargo arrives at U S  ports without being inspected overseas       I am deeply concerned about this issue because I know that maritime cargo    especially container cargo    is a critical part of our economy    As this group well knows  my interest in trade goes back to my childhood  My dad ran a store   He relied on imports to stock the shelves in our store   International trade helped put food on our table  and I ve never forgotten that  So I want to make sure that we close the loopholes that threaten our ability to trade while we protect lives and our economy        I ve worked on this challenge for several years  I ve held hearings  I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce  and I ve been meeting with various stakeholders   This proposal has to work for everyone in the supply chain  importers  freight forwarders  shippers  terminal operators and workers like longshoremen  truck drivers  and port employee  all the people who are on the front lines as our eyes and ears and the same people who would be among the first to be hurt if an incident occurred  So after meeting with people and reviewing reports and studies  I  m putting together a bill to strike the right balance       I ve built my proposal around five common sense ideas  First  we need to start screening cargo overseas before it ever gets loaded on a ship that s headed for the United States   That means we need to raise the security standards for all cargo and we need to front load the screening        Second  because there are so many cargo containers coming into our country  we need to make the haystack smaller   Instead of looking at a small percent of all containers  we need to be able to separate the containers that we know are secure from the ones that need more scrutiny         Third  we need to give businesses incentives to adopt better security  Companies are going to do what s in their financial interest and we can use market incentives to make the entire industry more secure       Fourth  we need to minimize the impact of any incident   Right now if there were a terrorist attack through one of our ports  there would be a lot of confusion   So we need to put one office in charge of maritime cargo security and create protocols for resuming trade after an incident   We can t afford to leave cargo on the docks for weeks   We need a plan that tells us in advance    what cargo will be unloaded first and how we ll get the system back on its feet       Finally  we need to monitor and secure cargo from the factory floor overseas to the local store down the street   There are vulnerabilities at nearly every step of the supply chain   A secure system is going to start at the factory overseas and continue until that cargo reaches its final destination         My proposal is called the GreenLane  It says that if companies will adhere to a strict set of security standards  they will have predictable treatment as they ship to the U S  and theirs will be the first cargo considered for entry into our country in the event of an incident   Let me walk through the main parts of my bill       First  it raises the security standards for everyone across the board   It directs the Department of Homeland Security to take all the best practices and lessons learned and create new standards that will establish a new floor of security for everyone       Second  it creates what I m calling a GreenLane   If shippers agree to follow the higher security standards of the GreenLane  they get a series of benefits  To be certified as GreenLane cargo  you need to track packages from factory floor   Everyone who touches cargo needs an identification card  Every thing that is stuffed into a container needs to be scanned and shared with the Department of Homeland Security   You need to use a Container Security Device to secure your container   Now remember  the GreenLane is optional   No one has to participate   I believe that companies will want to participate because they ll get benefits in return       What are those benefits       If there is an attack and ports are shut down  GreenLane cargo is the first to be unloaded   And I think GreenLane cargo should be subject to lower bonding requirements  lower Customs fees  and a regular payment schedule of duties and fees    In addition  GreenLane participants will have less stolen merchandise and they ll be able to give their customers real time tracking of where products are in the supply chain      Finally  it sets up a plan so that trade can be resumed quickly and safely after an attack  Today there are no protocols    there is no guide on how to get the system going again   My bill will create one and it will let the most secure cargo    the GreenLane cargo    in first       My bill also does some other things  It expands port security grants  It makes sure we continue to monitor our security system to make sure it s working  It makes sure that a company s cargo data is not available to competitors   It sets a uniform standard for security so shippers and others have some certainty    rather than a hodgepodge of different standards       There have been a lot of commissions and studies on port security  and I  ve paid close attention   That  s why my proposal accomplishes what these studies call for  The 9 11 Commission said that we need  layered  security  that we need to centralize authority so we can have more accountability  and that federal agencies need to share information better   My bill implements all of those recommendations        The Government Accountability Office looked at current Customs programs and identified some troubling shortcomings   My bill addresses those concerns  It increases scrutiny of shipments  it provides benefits to shippers    but only after we ve verified that they ve improved security  and it ensures we keep testing the system to make sure it s secure       In closing  I want to summarize the benefits of the GreenLane approach  The GreenLane stops dangerous cargo before it leaves foreign ports  It gives U S  officials in foreign ports the authority to inspect suspicious containers before they are loaded for departure to the United States  By empowering U S  officials overseas  the GreenLane stops dangerous cargo before it ever sets sail for America  The GreenLane makes the haystack smaller   It allows the U S  government to focus its limited resources on suspicious cargo  The GreenLane ensures that we are inspecting and stopping any cargo that poses a threat    The GreenLane cuts down on smuggling of weapons  people  drugs or other illegal cargo         A smaller haystack and strict overseas security measures will allow U S  and foreign officials to better stop criminal actions  The GreenLane protects America  s economy in the event of a terror attack and it provides a secure  organized way to quickly resume cargo operations after any emergency shut down   Because any shut down of ports has the potential to cost the U S  economy billions of dollars a day  the GreenLane will minimize the economic impact of a terror attack  And the GreenLane creates market incentives for everyone in the supply chain to improve security and take responsibility for the cargo they handle        If we deal with the challenges we face now    in an organized  comprehensive way  I believe there are ways we can meet these challenges as we make our economy stronger and our state and nation safer and I believe my GreenLane plan is a good way to do just that       Friends  right now  we have a choice and a say in how we deal with the cargo security challenges facing us   But if we wait for a disaster  we won t have a say  and we won t have a choice  If we agree on a system now  we ll have a role in shaping it and making sure it s sensitive to the need for free flowing commerce  Let s make the changes on our terms  now  before there s an incident   If we wait until after there s an incident  we risk drastic actions that hurt everyone in the supply chain  We have the opportunity to create effective  efficient systems and put them in place now  and I invite you to join me in that effort       Before I close  I d like to thank our expert panelists for joining us today and sharing some of their wisdom  and I  d like to commend the Washington Council on International Trade for once again hosting this important event  Most importantly  I want to thank the contributing sponsors of the conference   Without their support  this would not have been
