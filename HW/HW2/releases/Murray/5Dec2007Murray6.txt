and Urban Development Spending Bill  Republicans Block Senate Consideration Again In floor speech following Republican obstruction  Murray highlights sup prime mortgage support and infrastructure funding included in critical bill     Republicans block Appropriations bill vote as President lashes out at Congress for not passing them    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  December 5  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  called up her Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development  THUD  bill for a vote on the Senate floor  However  following the pattern of obstruction Republicans have established this year  they blocked a Senate vote on the bill  The Republican s refusal to vote on this bill that funds the nations roads  highways  airports  affordable housing  and community development projects comes as President Bush continues to call on Congress to pass yearly appropriations bills  Senator Murray highlighted this obvious contradiction in a speech she delivered following the Republican objection to the bill  In her speech  Senator Murray highlighted how the THUD bill addresses the sub prime housing crises head on with nearly  200 million for housing counseling to help keep struggling mortgage holders in their homes Senator Murray also discussed how the flooding in Washington state reinforces the importance of the transportation infrastructure funding in the bill  The full text of Senator Murray s floor remarks are below  Mr  President  Ive come to the floor today to make sure the record is clear on the difference between     What is being said in Washington D C        today      And what is actually taking      place     Just yesterday  President Bush took to the microphones to complain  for the second day in a row  that Congress isnt getting its work done    For the second day in a row  he complained that Congress isnt sending him Appropriations bills that fund the most basic functions of our Government    And for the second day in a row  our Minority Leader  Senator McConnell  followed suit    He complained on the Senate floor that Congress hasnt sent Appropriations bills to the President    Republicans are Blocking the THUD Bill Well  M  President  just seconds ago  I made a motion to pass the final conference report for the Transportation  Housing Appropriations bill and send it on to President Bush    And what was the result  The Republican Senators blocked it from going to the White House    It wasnt the first time  either  They blocked it from going to the White House twice before  two and half weeks ago on November 15th and 16th    Let me tell you whats going on here    President Bush and the Senate Republican Leadership are trying to quietly block our progress on funding the needs of the American people while loudly complaining about our failure to make progress    This Bill is Not Divisive Mr  President  I would understand the actions of the Senate Republican Leadership if our Transportation Housing bill was partisan and divisive    But Mr  President  the conference agreement that were trying to move today has the support of every single Republican who sat on the conference committee in the House and Senate  This bill originally passed the Senate with 88 votes    The conference agreement has already passed the House with 270 votes    This bill isnt controversial  It makes critical investments in some of the most urgent needs of the American people and their local communities    The bill provides     195 million to replace the      I 35W bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis       1 billion in enhanced      highway formula funding so all 50 states can inspect and make repairs to      their most deficient bridges      And  75 million in new      housing vouchers to shelter homeless veterans  including struggling      veterans who have returned from Iraq      and Afghanistan      It rejects hundreds of      millions of dollars in cuts proposed by the White House  which would throw      Amtrak into bankruptcy and make congestion at our airports worse  not      better      The bill also includes  200      million  which is urgently needed to provide housing counseling services      to keep struggling mortgage holders in their homes    We Want to Deliver on the Need for Housing Counseling Mr  President  I want to take a moment to discuss this last item  the  200 million for housing counseling    This nation is in the middle of a housing crisis   Millions of homeowners risk losing their homes in the next few quarters as the interest rates on billions and billions of dollars in mortgages are adjusted upward    On Monday  the Presidents Treasury Secretary  Hank Paulson  and his Housing Secretary  Alphonso Jackson  made speeches on the need for Congress to address the many steps necessary to minimize this crisis    Secretary Paulson complained at a National Housing Forum about the number of borrowers who were entering foreclosure without contacting either their lender or a mortgage counselor    He said   For this public outreach campaign to be successful  there must be enough trained mortgage counselors to answer the phone when homeowners call  The Administration requested funding for NeighborWorks Amerca and other non profit mortgage counseling operations in its budget  But the appropriations bill has yet to be finalized  Congress needs to get it done quickly    Well  Mr  President  We can do that right now  In fact  we could have done it last month    We are trying to send a bill that includes a critical investment in housing counseling to the White House  just as Secretary Paulson said he wanted us to do    The bipartisan conferees on this bill agreed that the amount the President asked for was too low to meet the demand for housing counseling given the size of the problem    Congress acted  and increased it substantially    But even though every Republican conferee on our bill signed onto that plan  we are now being blocked from sending it to the White House    I only wish the Senate Republican Leadership would follow the words of Secretary Paulson and Secretary Jackson about the urgent need for this initiative    Mr  President  yesterdays Washington Post published an article on our  200 million housing counseling initiative  I ask unanimous consent that this article appear in the Record at this point    The article describes the importance of non profit housing counseling agencies and all they can do to keep mortgage holders in their homes    Washington State Storms Highlight the Need for This Bill Finally  Mr  President  I want to say that the storms in my home state of Washington highlight how important this bill is    Devastating mudslides and floods in Washington and Oregon have swamped homes and washed out roads all across both states Many roads are still closed  including a 20 mile stretch of Interstate 5  a major artery connecting Seattle and Portland    And the floods have virtually isolated communities in parts of the Northwest  My heart goes out to all the families who have been affected    Well be feeling the effects of this storm for a long time  even when the flood waters recede  And thats not just because it has caused serious damage to our roads and bridges   Mr  President  the closure of I 5 forced cars and trucks traveling from Seattle to Portland to detour through the Tri Cities  a drive that takes at least four hours longer  and means drivers have to cross the mountain pass east of Seattle Think about the effect that will have on businesses  which rely on our highways in order to move goods quickly and safely    The impact of these storms reinforces how important our transportation infrastructure is to everyone  We need to make sure we keep up our investments in our roads and bridges  and in our airports and railways  because one rainstorm  one bridge disaster  one airport disruption can have huge impacts on our families and our nations economy
