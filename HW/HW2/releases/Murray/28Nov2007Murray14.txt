with U S  Senate Hearing in Seattle Hearing brings together students  employers  workforce experts  educators and labor leaders to discuss how to connect educational priorities with the job skills needed in a global economy    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  November 28  2007     Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing of the U S  Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety in Seattle  WA  The hearing focused on addressing the need for more highly skilled workers and preparing students to fill job openings in Washington state and across the country  Washington state students  employers  labor leaders  educators and workforce experts joined together to discuss ways to meet this challenge  The days when someone could move easily from high school to a family wage job have long been a thing of the past  said Senator Murray  The truth is that most new jobs require at least some education and training beyond high school  even at the entry level  Unfortunately  we aren t doing enough to prepare our young people for these jobs  In order for us to truly address our workforce needs  we need to bridge the gaps between education and the skills employers are demanding  Today  we are bringing together workforce experts  students  employers  labor leaders  and educators to draw up a blueprint for success  At the hearing  prominent labor leaders and workforce experts shared their thoughts on the problem   Currently we have more than 12 000 enrolled apprentices and our apprenticeship training centers are bursting at the seams  said Rick Bender  President  Washington State Labor Council  There will be a continued need to train apprentices for the next eight to ten years at current or higher rates  not only for the work that is already sited and bid  but to replace the retiring construction workforce which is the oldest in American history   Youth should be focusing on education because of work  and in addition to work  said Kris Stadelman  CEO  The Workforce Development Council of Seattle King County  When we show them the connection and allow them to learn in the context of the real world  they are less likely to drop out of high school  They are more likely to pursue further education and training  They learn social and work skills that cannot be taught in school  And they are given both the tools and the inspiration to forge their own futures   Educators shared their views on what needs to be done   The common theme all educators must convey to individual students is  are you college ready  With college being defined as any education post high school  said John Aultman  Asst  Superintendent  Career and Technical Education  OSPI  This would include technical certificate programs  two year  four year  and apprenticeship programs   Local employers discussed opportunities for growth   Clean Tech is now the third largest venture investment category  with projections boasting some  19 billion in investments by 2010 that is expected to create more than 500 000 new jobs  said David Allen  Vice President of Marketing  McKinstry Company and a key player in the development of the Washington Clean Technology Alliance  The emerging Clean Tech industry is dependent on and committed to working with all interested parties to enhance worker training and education  We anticipate partnerships with trade unions  apprenticeship programs  workforce development organizations  community colleges  four year institutions and local government agencies will be required to meet the needs of the future   And students shared solutions that work   I found out that not only could I get my diploma  I could also earn college credits at the same time  and at no cost  This was exactly what I needed  said Meisha Nash about the New Market Skills Center in Tumwater where she completing her high school education  With newfound confidence  and skills and abilities I have learned  I will go much further in life  I am well on my way to getting my high school diploma and beginning to further my education at a community college   To read the full testimony from the
