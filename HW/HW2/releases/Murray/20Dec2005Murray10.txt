                                                                                                            News Release          Senator Murray Hails Passage of VAWA Reauthorization  But Says Victims Need More Help Escaping Abusive Relationships    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  December 20  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray made the following statement on Congressional passage of a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act          Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the Violence Against Women Act  which Congress has finally reauthorized after many delays   As my colleagues know  the    it passed the House on Saturday  and it is now headed to the President for his signature        As domestic violence leaders in my home state of Washington will tell you  this reauthorization is long overdue   VAWA has been a critical tool for fighting domestic violence  and it should have never been allowed to expire   The Republican leadership finally recognized that  and now we will strengthen and expand that critical law        Today I want to discuss some of the improvements we ve passed    including new tools related to healthcare  housing  and abuse that involves police officers   I also want to share my disappointment that the economic protections I ve worked to include were removed when this bill was considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee          I ve tried to advance critical economic protections at every turn  and I want to update my colleagues    and advocates in Washington state    about where those efforts stand   I do want to thank several of my colleagues for their hard work on this bill  including    Senators Leahy  Specter  Biden  Hatch and Kennedy       Updating a National Strategy    Mr  President  the original Violence Against Women Act  VAWA  created a national strategy for dealing with domestic violence  And that strategy has been very successful   VAWA brought together victims   advocates  social service providers  and law enforcement professionals to meet the immediate challenges of domestic violence   This bill reauthorizes and strengthens those core programs        This bill also creates new programs that represent important steps forward in areas like healthcare  housing and officer involved abuse         New Healthcare Initiative    The first new step concerns healthcare   For the first time  VAWA includes a national health care response to domestic violence  dating violence  sexual assault and stalking   It authorizes new grants to train health care providers to recognize and respond to domestic or sexual violence   These grants will help establish partnerships between victims service providers and health care providers in state hospitals and public health departments   It also provides funding for direct services for sexual assault victims  including 24 hour emergency and support services       New Housing Support for Abuse Victims    Second  this law now addresses housing inequities for victims by providing new grants to help victims find long term housing   It also protects the confidentiality of victims who are receiving assistance from Department of Housing and Urban Development funded programs   VAWA also now includes provisions to protect mail order brides and expands protections for immigrant victims         Creation of the Crystal Judson Domestic Violence Protocol Program    This legislation also addresses the issue of police officer involved domestic violence   I have spoken about this issue on the Senate floor before because of a terrifying case in Washington state   In April 2003  Tacoma police chief David Brame shot and killed his wife  Crystal Judson Brame   Then he took his own life  all while their two young children watched   The final tragic act was the last in a long history of abusive events        In response to this incident  the City of Tacoma  the Tacoma Police Department  and others formed a task force to examine officer involved domestic violence   They created a new policy for the Tacoma Police Department  and they helped pass a state law which requires that departments have policies on officer involved abuse        This VAWA bill gives local communities new resources to deal with abuse that involves police officers   It funds the Crystal Judson Domestic Violence Protocol Program   It allows law enforcement agencies  victim service providers  and federal  state and local governments to use STOP grant funds to create new protocols for handling officer involved domestic violence        What happened in Tacoma is a tragedy that cannot be weighed   Out of that tragedy  Washington state changed it laws  and now the federal government is giving communities across the country new tools to address officer involved abuse   So that new provision    along with the healthcare and housing measures    represent new progress in fighting domestic violence        But frankly  we ve got a lot more work to do   I am deeply disappointment that the economic protections I have been fighting for since 1998 were not included in this reauthorization    despite some early progress       We Still Need to Address the Economic Barriers that Trap Victims    Mr  President  if we are going to break the cycle of violence  we need to address the economic barriers that trap victims in abusive relationships          We know that financial insecurity is a major factor in ongoing domestic violence   Too often  victims don t have the financial strength to leave a violent relationship   As a result  they are forced to choose between protecting themselves and keeping a roof over their heads   When a victim cannot afford to move out  or cannot afford to pay the rent  or has lost a job because of abuse  that person is trapped  and Congress needs to help free them from that trap       My Attempt to Provide Unpaid Leave for Abuse Victims    In this bill  we had an opportunity to help victims   In the Senate version of the bill  I worked to include an unpaid leave provision   It was in the Senate version  but it was dropped by the Senate Judiciary Committee          In my view  that was wrong   It s like leaving someone trapped in a burning building   We should have knocked down the barriers and thrown open the exit doors  but the Senate failed    and that will have a real impact on people trapped in abusive relationships        The protections I sought were reasonable   It would have allowed victims to take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per year to address domestic violence   Over 40 percent of American workers get no paid time off   They cannot use vacation time to address abuse  and missing work puts them in danger of losing their job   My provision would have allowed victims to take unpaid leave to get a protective order  see a doctor  or make a safety plan        But unfortunately  there was opposition and complaints about jurisdiction  and these protections were stripped from the bill during consideration in the Judiciary Committee  See     My Attempt to Include Unemployment Insurance Benefits    Once those protections were dropped  I kept fighting   I offered another tool to help victims escape abusive relationships   I asked the managers of the bill to include a provision on unemployment insurance   I asked them to provide victims of domestic violence  dating violence  sexual assault  or stalking with unemployment insurance if they have to leave their job or are fired because of abuse          We know that a job is often the only way for victims to build up the resources to leave a violent relationship  but abuse and stalking can make it impossible for a victim to keep a job          Many of my colleagues may recall the story of Yvette Cade  of Maryland   As reported in the Washington Post  Ms  Cade  s estranged husband showed up at her job at a wireless phone store  threw gasoline on her  and lit her on fire   A restraining order against her estranged husband had been dropped shortly before the incident  even though she had indicated he was still threatening her    Ms  Cade was burned over 60 percent of her body and remains in the hospital        There are many more cases of abusers who deliberately sabotaging a victim  s ability to work  placing harassing phone calls  cutting off their transportation  and showing up at the workplace and threatening other employees   When a victim loses a job because of violence  that victim should have access to unemployment compensation benefits       Recognize the Full Cost of Domestic Violence    Mr  President  some people might claim that it is too expensive to allow victims to access unpaid leave   But I would remind my colleagues that domestic violence imposes costs on a workplace too   When violence follows victims into the workplace  it doesn  t just hurt victims   it hurts their employers   It means less productivity and higher insurance costs          So anyone who says it s too expensive to provide unpaid leave should also remember that domestic violence is expensive to businesses to in both lives and dollars   Providing the tools that will allow abused women to escape abusive relationships can help offset billions of dollars in costs that domestic violence imposes on businesses       I ll Continue the Fight    Mr  President  unfortunately  my efforts to include unpaid leave provisions were rejected as well   But I m not giving up   I ve been at this since 1998 and I know who I m fighting for   I ve been to the shelters in my state  and I ve talked with the victims   I ve met with their advocates  and I m not giving up on them   For example  see     My SAFE Act    I m going to keep pushing for my SAFE Act  which stands for the Security and Financial Empowerment Act      It contains the protections victims need to break the cycle of violence    I would like to thank Senators Leahy  Corzine  Dayton and Dodd for signing on as original cosponsors  and would invite all of my colleagues to sign on as well        Mr  President  I m going to continue to tell their stories because we need to hear their voices here in the United States Senate   It s easy to argue about jurisdiction  but that doesn t mean anything to someone who s getting beaten up every night   It s easy to argue about the cost of unpaid leave    but that doesn t mean anything to someone who needs to get a protective order so they can escape a violent relationship        This Congress has a lot of work to do to help victims  and I will come to this Senate floor as many times as it takes  until we finally give victims the help they need and deserve
