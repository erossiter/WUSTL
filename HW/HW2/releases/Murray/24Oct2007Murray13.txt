                                                                News Release          VA s Top Health Official Doesn t Know Why VA Remains Without A Secretary Under Questioning from Sen  Murray  Dr  Michael Kussman cannot provide reason for absence of VA Secretary during time of war  Challenges accuracy of recent reporting on waiting times for veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  October 24  2007     of Murray questioning Dr  Kussman  Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  questioned the Department of Veterans  Affairs   VA  top health official  Dr  Michael Kussman  about why a nominee for VA Secretary has still not been selected by the Bush Administration  Senator Murray also questioned Dr  Kussman on a  which found that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffering traumatic brain injury  multiple wounds and serious illnesses were waiting longer for appointments than the VA s 30 day standard  The questioning was part of a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing  Senator Murray is a senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  VA Remains Without a VA Secretary The VA has gone without a Secretary nominee since Secretary Jim Nicholson announced his resignation on July 17th  Senator Murray is deeply concerned about what this vacancy means for a VA facing many challenges and desperately in need of strong leadership  Senator Murray is also concerned about what this vacancy says to veterans and active duty troops at a time of war  Senator Murray   We ve been three months without a nominee and I m beginning to hear from a lot of veterans who are very  very concerned that a lack of a nomine signals that the Administration doesn t have a priority for veterans at a time when we are at war and we have issues with wait times  mental health  an all the other things this committee has been discussing   Dr  Kussman  Do you have any idea why we have not had a nominee sent over for Secretary of Veterans Affairs   Dr  Kussman  No  Senator I don t  But I can assure you were still doing our jobs    Murray went on to say the We need someone who s going to stand up for our veterans at a time of war  Wait Times for Veterans with Serious Injuries   Senator Murray also questioned Dr  Kussman about a  that brought to light troubling revelations about health care appointment wait times for veterans with serious injuries  Senator Murray   I was really discouraged a see this and I was even more disc to see the vas response to that report was attacking their own data saying the reports can t be used to judge service because they don t show all appointment I am compelled to ask you why is the VA spending money on these reports   Dr  Kussman   We believe that their interpretation of the data did not reflect what was going on   Dr  Kussman said that he believes that 95  of VA patients receive appointments within 30 days  He could not provide an exact reason why the Charlotte Observer story was inaccurate he said that he wasn t sure but that it may have been an issue of how the data was interpreted and whether data was being analyzed as a snapshot or a continuum  Senator Murray   It s not just a newspaper article  We continue to hear that from our veterans  They don t care whether they are a snapshot or a continuum                                                                                                           Senator Murray s opening statement from today s hearing follows  Chairman Akaka  thank you for holding todays hearing  Mr  Chairman  Veterans Day is only a few weeks away  Many of us go home to our states and celebrate the day with veterans at remembrance ceremonies and events  But Veterans Day is not just a ceremonial holiday  Its also a time to ask if we have done enough for those who served our country  And thats a very timely question today with so many new veterans coming home every day from places like Iraq and Afghanistan  and with an aging population of veterans  who need more care  When these brave men and women signed up to serve our country  we agreed to take care of them  They kept their part of the bargain  Now we need to keep ours  Todays hearing is  in essence  about this country keeping its commitment to our veterans and ensuring that we are giving them everything they need  And its the third legislative hearing held by this committee  The Veterans Affairs Committee held two previous legislative hearings several months ago  when we considered other benefits and health bills  Many of the bills that were considered during those two hearings were eventually included in the health and benefits omnibus bills that have passed out of this committee and are awaiting floor time  The fact that we have had to schedule a third legislative hearing is  I think  a real testament to the amount of concern members of this committee have about the way the VA is being run  Near the top of that list is the VAs ability to care for veterans with mental health problems  Last week  USA Today reported that the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans seeking care for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at the VA increased by almost 70 percent last year  And unfortunately  that number of returning veterans with PTSD and other mental health ailments is probably too low  Many service members and veterans dont seek care because of the stigma surrounding treatment  or because they fear that a mental health diagnosis will hurt their career  As troops are deployed overseas for their third  fourth  and now even fifth tour of duty  the likelihood of PTSD and other mental health conditions increases  We have all heard about the lack of providers across the country and the lengthy delays in getting an appointment  The VA is facing some real challenges on this front  The two mental health bills being considered today provide slightly different approaches to dealing with this challenge  and I look forward to hearing from todays witnesses about which approach they think will work best  Im also looking forward to discussing a bill I introduced earlier this year  which would ensure that the VA is prepared and equipped to deal with what may be one long term effect of Traumatic Brain Injury  the occurrence of epilepsy  My bill would establish six epilepsy centers of excellence in the VA system  Its based on the successful MS Centers of Excellence and Parkinsons Disease Research  Education and Clinical Centers already operated by the VA  At a May hearing in this committee  Dr  John Booss  a former national director of neurology at the VA  testified that VA funded research  done with the Department of Defense  found that more than half of veterans who suffered a penetrating TBI in Vietnam developed epilepsy within 15 years  For these veterans  the relative risk for developing epilepsy more than 10 to 15 years after their injury was 25 times higher than non veterans in the same age group  Dr  Booss expressed strong concern that the VA lacks a national program for epilepsy with clear guidelines on when to refer patients for further assessment and treatment of epilepsy  He urged the committee to create a network of epilepsy centers of excellence  Its too early to determine the impact of TBI induced epilepsy created by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars  But we know from past wars that many injuries associated with service take years or even decades to develop  This bill will ensure that the VA is prepared to care for those veterans who need care down the road  And I hope to work with my colleagues to make this important idea a reality soon  Thank you Mr  Chairman
