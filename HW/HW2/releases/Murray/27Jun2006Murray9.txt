                                                                              News Release          Aerospace   Senator Murray Urges  No More Subsidies  for Airbus in Senate Floor Speech    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  June 27  2006     Washington  D C    With Airbus hemorrhaging money and looking for handouts  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  today called for the United States  to send a clear message to European governments that America will not tolerate another round of job killing subsidies to Airbus  If we want to lead the world in commercial aerospace  our message to Europe must be strong and clear   No more illegal subsidies to prop up Airbus   Airbus must compete in the marketplace just like everyone else  Murray said   Every time European governments underwrite Airbus with subsidies  American workers get pink slips  Murray  a leading advocate for America s aerospace workers  said that recent problems with Airbus s A350 and A380 aircraft  along with financial and management problems  make it likely that European governments will decide by the July 17th Farnborough Air Show to provide Airbus with illegal subsidies  Airbus and EADS have been in a tailspin over unsuccessful planes  production delays  and management scandals   Airbus is finally beginning to see just how difficult it is to compete in the marketplace without the cushion of government subsidies  and it is floundering  Murray said   But now  rather than letting Airbus compete on its own in the marketplace  European governments seem poised to once again rescue Airbus with market distorting subsidies   If we want to keep a strong aerospace industry in America  we can t let that happen     Senator Murray s full remarks follow  Mr  President  in the coming weeks  we are entering an important crossroad in the future of commercial aerospace   I want to explain what s at stake for our country and for American workers  Down one road  American workers will be left to fight for their jobs with one hand tied behind their backs  They ll face unfair competition  and our economy and our future could suffer  Down the other road  our government will make it clear that we will fight for fair trade  and our economy and our workers will win as a result  That is the crossroad we are approaching and which path we take will be determined by two things   Whether Europe decides to provide illegal subsidies to Airbus and EADS and whether the United States government works aggressively to keep that from happening  For decades  Europe has provided subsidies to prop up Airbus and its parent company  EADS  Those subsidies have created an uneven playing field and have led to tens of thousands of layoffs here in the United States  In the past few years  the United States has stood up to Europe  and I ve been proud to work with the Bush Administration in that effort  first under U S  Trade Representative Robert Zoellick  then under Rob Portman  and now under USTR Susan Schwab  We ve demanded that Europe stop the subsidies and play by the rules   With the threat of a WTO trade case  we got the Europeans to the negotiating table  and I was hopeful we would make progress  But over the past few months  Airbus and EADS have been in a tailspin over unsuccessful planes  production delays  and management scandals   Airbus is finally beginning to see just how difficult it is to compete in the marketplace without the cushion of government subsidies   And it is floundering  But now  rather than letting Airbus compete on its own in the marketplace  European governments seem poised to once again rescue Airbus with market distorting subsidies  If we want to keep a strong aerospace industry in America  we can t let that happen   Every time European governments underwrite Airbus with subsidies  American workers get pink slips        If we want to lead the world in commercial aerospace  our message to Europe must be strong and clear   No more illegal subsidies to prop up Airbus  Airbus must compete in the marketplace just like everyone else   Mr  President  I first sounded the alarm on this important issue in March 2004 when I spoke about my concerns here on the Senate floor   For those who have not been following the debate  I want to provide some background  Fundamental Differences in Doing Business Only two companies in the world make large passenger airplanes  The Boeing Company  whose commercial air operation is headquartered in Renton  Washington  and Airbus  which is headquartered in Toulouse  France   Airbus is a division of the European Aeronautics Defense and Space Company  also known as EADS  Mr  President  the distance between Airbus and Boeings headquarters is about as big as the disparity between how the U S  and Europe view the commercial aerospace industry   For us here in America  commercial aerospace is a private industry  one that must respond to the needs of the marketplace and the demands of its shareholders   It is a difficult business  and many times manufacturers like Boeing bet the company on a new airplane  In Europe  on the other hand  commercial aerospace is viewed as a job creation program   Airbus has been shielded from the dangers of marketplace by decades of government subsidies   In fact  Europe doesnt seem to care if Airbus loses money  as long as it produces jobs  and those jobs come at the expense of American workers  Subsidies Sustaining Airbus Mr  President  the history of Airbus and EADS is a history of government subsidies that have sheltered it from the competition and the real pressures of the marketplace   It has allowed Airbus to develop new aircraft with virtually no risk  This government assistance takes many forms  including launch subsidies  research subsidies  facilities subsidies  and supplier subsidies   These subsidies create an uneven playing field and allow Airbus to do things that normal  private companies can t afford to do  Because of these subsidies  Airbus has grown to become a market power without assuming any of the financial risk and accountability that U S  firms have to contend with every day   As a result of this government support  Airbus has been able to erode Boeings market share  Airbus market share was once in the teens  Today  Airbus claims to supply more than 50 percent of the industry  But European government support of Airbus does not stop there   It includes everything from bribes to threats   There are reports of state airlines being promised landing rights at European airports if they buy Airbus planes  and we ve seen countries threatened that they won t be let in to the European Union unless they buy Airbus planes   There are reports of Airbus using deep discounts and guaranteeing to airlines that Airbus planes will hold their value  To date  Airbus has received more than  15 billion in launch aid   But despite this massive infusion of government cash  Airbus and EADS are still hemorrhaging money and are undergoing a crisis in leadership at the highest levels       Airbus in Crisis In fact  if anyone was to scan the newspapers this week you could read about any number of problems Airbus and EADS have been confronted with   The Airbus A350 model has been widely condemned by major airline purchasers  It requires an expensive redesign  which is estimated   to cost about  9 billion to  10 billion  The A380 mega jetliner  which Airbus spent more than  13 billion on developing  has secured only a small list of customers   Now it s plagued by delivery delays  which could result in cancelled orders and financial penalties for Airbus  In fact  according to recent reports  Airbus is facing the possible loss of orders worth more than  5 billion   The delays could reduce Airbus annual earnings by  630 million between 2007 and 2010  EADS also has a huge liability on its hands  It needs to buy out BAE Systems share of Airbus  which is estimated to cost about  4 billion  And on top of all that  the co chief executive of EADS  Noel Forgeard  is under investigation for insider trading   By all accounts  Airbus is struggling  It is also losing credibility with its customers   In fact  when news broke about the A380 s production delay  Singapore Airlines cast a no confidence vote in Airbus by ordering 20 Boeing 787 Dreamliners  The Pentagon is Noticing One important customer that is also taking notice is the United States Department of Defense  With Airbus  financial house of cards on the verge of collapse and no current U S  manufacturing presence  it is becoming clear that EADS will not be able to give the United States Air Force the tanker of the future  I am pleased that the Air Force asked the right questions   In its request for information for the tanker contract  the Air Force asked potential bidders to provide them with information about launch aid and subsidies  including details about any government support  tax breaks  debt forgiveness or loans with preferential terms they might have received  The Air Force clearly understands that need for transparency and a level playing field  Any new subsidies to Airbus for tankers or other programs should end once and for all Airbus  campaign to access the U S  treasury   To protect taxpayers and national security  the Air Force must exercise extreme caution if it continues to consider an Airbus tanker proposal  Washington State  Boeing Progress Mr  President  as many of my colleagues know  my home state of Washington has a very proud and long history of aerospace leadership   On July 15  1916  Bill Boeing started his airplane company in Seattle  Washington  Since that day  Boeing and Washington state have shared the ups and downs of the commercial aerospace industry  In fact  just a few years ago Boeing found itself struggling to keep up with Airbus   But through the sacrifice and hard work of more than 62 000 Boeing employees in Washington state    and many more around the country    the company pulled itself up by its bootstraps   It recovered to once again evenly share the market place with Airbus  And it did so by producing a plane  the 787  which was just what the marketplace wanted  Airbus  on the other hand  ignored the markets demand and produced a plane that few people want   Now  they are being punished by the marketplace for their mistakes   But rather than take their lumps  they are likely to seek an illegal government bail out that would negate the hard work and sacrifice of Boeing employees  Recently  an EADS spokesman called launch aid indispensable and said  Launch aid is the only available system right now to deal with Airbus  floundering marketing and design problems     Mr  President  how can American aerospace workers compete with a competitor that never has to face consequences for its failures  It is Time for Action      Last week  President Bush met with E U  leaders at a summit  Before his trip  I wrote to the President and urged him to raise the issue with European leaders   Time is running out   We are quickly approaching the Farnborough Air Show on July 17th  when European ministers are expected to decide whether to provide EADS with more launch aid  I have supported this Administrations willingness to go the distance at the World Trade Organization in the fight for fair markets   They stood up for American aerospace workers after it became clear that negotiations with the Europeans were going nowhere  As a result  the WTO is now considering the subsidies case through its dispute settlement body        The U S  Senate Opposes Airbus Subsidies The U S  Senate is on the record against Airbus subsidies   On April 11  2005  the U S  Senate unanimously passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 25   That resolution called for European governments to reject launch aid for the A350 and for President Bush to take any action that he considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States in fair competition in the large commercial aircraft market   The Resolution also specifically encouraged the United States Trade Representative to file a WTO case unless the E U  eliminates launch aid for the A350 and all future models  Mr  President  the production of large civilian aircraft is now a mature industry in both the United States and Europe   It is due time that market forces  not government aid  determine the future course of the industry  Mr  President  that crossroad I mentioned is coming up on us quickly   One road will leave Americans workers in a fight for their jobs with the game stacked against them   The other road will give us a fair playing field  where American workers can win through their hard work and ingenuity  I hope for our country s future that we choose the right course   And it begins by sending a clear message from our government to Europe that the United States will not tolerate another round of illegal subsides that kill American jobs    The clock is running    The choice is ours
