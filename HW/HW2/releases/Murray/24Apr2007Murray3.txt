Senator Works to Focus on Math  Literacy and Academic Planning Starting in Middle School    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  April 24  2007         Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  continued her efforts to provide more federal support for math education  literacy education and graduation planning    areas that contribute to low graduation rates and expensive remediation for colleges and businesses        Murray spoke about her   S 611  at a hearing of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  which examined   Modernizing Middle and High Schools for the 21st Century    The hearing included five education experts from across the country         If we re going to make sure all students can graduate prepared for college and careers  we need to start academic planning in middle school and provide more help for math and literacy through high school  That s exactly what the PASS Act does   Murray said after the hearing        When Murray first introduced her high school reform bill in 2003  there was little national or political interest in high school reform   Today  four years later  Murray s legislation  S 611  is gaining new interest after both the Bush Administration and Congress have signaled that high school reform will be a major part of updating the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB    Senator Murray is using her background on high school reform to make sure Congress passes changes that will have a positive impact for students  high schools and America s economy       Murray s PASS Act    Senator Murray s PASS Act         Creates a new focus on literacy  mathematics  and academic counseling        Improves the accuracy of graduation rates  and      Helps low performing high schools implement proven reforms        Former West Virginia Governor Bob Wise  president of the Alliance for Excellent Education  said Murray s bill would help          Middle schools are a vital part of it  and your PASS Act has led the way I think to showing us a lot through the counseling  through the recognition of math and literacy coaches  through the calculation of graduation rates as well   Wise said           Murray crafted her bill based on input from students  parents and educators         One of the things I heard from many students as I went out to work on this in high schools was that  Well no one ever told me in 7th grade that I needed four years of math to get into college  No one ever talked to me about the fact that I needed a foreign language    Murray said           Kids in middle school don t often have a family background of graduation and college  They may be the first person to look at graduating  They may not have anybody in their own community that is talking to them about what they need  and part of what I put in to this was academic counselors to begin to focus our kids in middle school at making sure they have a plan        More Support for Literacy Education    Wise called for a continued focus on literacy after elementary school         We essentially at the federal level and most states stop doing literacy reading instruction by the fourth grade   Wise said         Murray also co wrote the   S 958  to target resources to literacy instruction for middle and high school students        Academic Planning    Murray also highlighted a Washington state program that provides the early academic planning she put in her PASS Act         Washington State has a program called Navigation 101 that really helps parents and students set goals to map their progress and know what they need to do   Murray said        Murray s bill would help high schools hire academic counselors to help students and their parents plan their academic careers   Witness Edna Varner  a consultant for Tennessee s Hamilton County Public Education Foundation  said that guidance counselors can play a critical role but often have high caseloads         In many schools  a guidance counselor has 500 students to see      Guidance counselors can t do it all  but guidance counselors have been very helpful in helping other teachers build the skills to keep up with that plan  to revise it each year with parents and students and the school and the child s records there   Varner said        Bob Balfantz of the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University testified that middle school students  independently decide to engage or disengage from schooling           In the middle grades  they start asking you to think for yourself  The mathematics gets more difficult  You have to comprehend what you re reading and answer questions  And if no one builds that bridge for you  you start feeling lost  and you start felling maybe this isn t for me  and you start disengaging  On the opposite hand if somebody reaches out to you   if a teacher grabs you and pulls you along  you become engaged and excited about schooling  And we sort of ignore that and we sort of leave it up to the kids    believe it or not  And especially in high poverty environments they disengage in huge numbers  and once they disengage it s hard to get them back         Witnesses at the hearing
