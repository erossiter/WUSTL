Reveals Manipulation of Wait Times for Health Care Appointments As Petraeus testifies  Murray questions impact of  surge  on VA care    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 12  2007      Washington  D C   U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  spoke on the Senate floor today to discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  Inspector General s report released yesterday that details widespread false reporting in wait times for VA health care appointments  How can we be expected to trust this Administration about the continuation of a surge when they continue to cover up the true costs of this war  Murray questioned in her speech  If the VA had been frank about waiting times and backlogs from the beginning  we would have been able to invest in busy facilities and allocate resources properly  Yesterday s report revealed that only 75 percent of veterans waited less than 30 days for health care appointments  Senator Murray had previously gotten assurances from VA officials  including Secretary Jim Nicholson  that 96 percent of all veterans seeking primary care and 95 percent of veterans seeking specialty care were seen within 30 days of their desired appointment date  The following are Senator Murray s full remarks on the Senate floor  Mr  President  I rise today  after two days of testimony by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  to talk about a subject that we ve still heard virtually no discussion of  The impact of this war on our service members and veterans  Mr  President  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have now spent countless hours in an attempt to sell both Congress and the American people on the virtues of the President s surge  Their aim is to convince us to spend   More time More money And more lives in Iraq  Yet  we have heard precious little about the impact of the surge on the men and women who are actually on the battlefield fighting  This is a disturbing omission that leaves me  and Im sure thousands of military families across the country  deeply unsettled and greatly concerned for the future of our nations plan to take care of these heroes    Mr  President  we all know that going to war has a profound effect on our men and women in uniform  and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are no exception  As the Iraq War now enters its fifth year  it is clear that the fighting overseas has taken a tremendous toll on the lives of our troops who have served this nation so honorably and on their families who have supported them so fully  Yet over and over again  in their sales job  this administration has either failed to make the cost of caring for our wounded warriors a priority  or  as we found this week  blatantly misled Congress and the American people about the cost  Unfortunately  on Monday  the same day that General Petraeus appeared in the House to talk about the results of the surge  we learned from the VA Inspector General that the department repeatedly understated the wait times of injured veterans seeking care  How can we be expected to trust this Administration about the continuation of a surge when they continue to cover up the true costs of this war  Mr  President  Administration officials  including Secretary Nicholson himself  have repeatedly told Congress and the American people that   96 percent of all veterans seeking primary care  and 95 percent of veterans seeking specialty care were seen within 30 days of their desired appointment date   The Inspector General found that in reality  only 75 percent of veterans had waited less than 30 days  In FY 2006  the VA underestimated the number of patients it would see by 45 000  For the current fiscal year  FY 2007   the VA has been forced to revise its projection up by 100 000 veterans  Now the VA is projecting that it will see 263 000 Iraq and Afghanistan vets in 2008  yet I am told by some that the VA should actually be preparing to care for more than 300 000 returning veterans  Frankly  I think it s very important that we don t underestimate this number  We ve seen the past failures in the VA to accurately project the numbers  and I think it s important that this committee get it right  The VA s fiscal year 2008 budget also assumed a decrease in the number of inpatient mental health patients  when all signs point to an increase in need  In February of this year  I had the opportunity to ask VA Secretary Nicholson how the President s escalation of the war would impact caring for our veterans  He told me it would have a  quote  minimal impact  Not only does this statement fly in the face of reason  it boggles the mind  I told Secretary Nicholson  When the President has proposed a surge in troops to Iraq  when the men and women in uniform are being deployed for their second and third tours of duty  and when more and more of our troops are coming home with PTSD and other mental health care needs  I don t understand how the VA can assume that they will treat fewer patients for inpatient mental health care   The VA Secretary s duty is to protect veterans  not a dishonest Administration  If the VA had been frank about waiting times and backlogs from the beginning  we would have been able to invest in busy facilities and allocate resources properly  If we were getting accurate information and not being served a political line  we could serve our veterans  Unfortunately  based on our experiences with VA leadership over the past few years  I have serious doubts about the level of frankness we can expect from a VA that has tried to minimize the cost  both in money and in lives  of this war  This spring  as our military was surging in Iraq   we learned that VA officials received bonuses  while veterans faced waiting lines and backlogs for benefits  This is just plain wrong  Senior career officials throughout the VA were receiving a generous package of more than  3 8 million in payments by the financially strapped agency  as our veterans waited up to a year to see a doctor and VA officials misled Congress and the American people  This week s IG report found  that schedulers at some facilities were interpreting the guidance from their managers to reduce waiting times as instruction to never put patients on the electronic waiting listThis seems to have resulted in some  gaming  of the scheduling process   Were officials receiving bonuses for cooking their books on wait times  In light of this week s report  it seems like a fair question  The Inspector General s report on the VA s failure to provide an accurate account of how long our veterans are waiting for care is a frustrating reminder of the agency s need for honesty and leadership  Whether the VA s numbers were intentionally skewed or incompetently reported  the result is the same  our veterans pay the price  I have long said that the VA provides excellent care to veterans  once they get in the door  The VA s   long term focus on patients  its integrated delivery model  and its first rate health IT system provide distinct advantages over private sector care  and we need to keep it that way   But too often  getting in the door is a probleMr  All of us have heard from veterans in our home states who have waited months to see a primary care doctor  Some veterans have even had to wait years to get surgery  For too many years under this Administration  veterans have been last in line  and we in Congress have had to fight the Administration tooth and nail to meet their needs  It is clear that five years into this war the VA is still not on a wartime footing to deal with this problem     It is past time for the VA to put an end to the pattern of dishonesty that has plagued them  From exaggerated reports of past successes  to failures to present real funding needs  to poor conditions at facilities  the VA is not coming clean with the American people  And every time the VA tries to save political face it ends up costing our veterans  No matter how they feel about the war  Americans support our veterans and we are ready to do whatever it takes to get them care  But without an honest assessment of their needs  we can t provide that support  The President must quickly send up a nominee to fill the position of VA Secretary who will be an honest advocate who will fill the needs of current and future veterans and honor their sacrifice with true service  I am looking to find somebody in this position that we can trust who will bring about a culture of change  If we are not getting accurate information  if we are being told a happy picture and not getting the reality  we cannot serve our nation s veterans  The men and women who have served in our military have born significant burdens of war  They have assumed great risk for our country  and they have sacrificed life and limb to protect our freedoms  They kept their promise to serve our nation  It is only right that we keep our promise to serve theMr  Our nation has a moral obligation to care for those who have served this country in uniforMr  That means being honest about the cost
