                                                News Release          Murray to Rumsfeld  Caring for Veterans is a Cost of War Senator to introduce amendment to support veterans   health care    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  February 16  2005         the Hearing         WASHINGTON  D C      Just one day after questioning the Veterans   Affairs Secretary over the Administration  s deep cuts to the VA budget  U S  Senator Patty Murray today grilled Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld over the complete lack of funding for veterans   health care in the Administration  s  82 billion supplemental request          This Administration decided to fund this war and all of its implications through supplemental requests  yet this request in front of us does not provide even one dollar for a very important cost of war  and that is the care of our heroes when they return home     Murray told Rumsfeld        Murray  a key member of the Senate Veterans   Affairs Committee  told Rumsfeld that providing the necessary care and resources for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan is not only our responsibility  but is critical for future military recruitment and retention        Nearly three thousand members of the Washington National Guard are scheduled to return home next month and thousands of soldiers based at Fort Lewis continue to rotate in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan   These soldiers are returning to underfunded and overburdened VA facilities           Mr  Secretary  can you share with this committee why  when we are creating more veterans who need health care  who are coming home with tremendous costs that we have a responsibility to pay for  that they are not considered part of the costs of war     Murray asked Rumsfeld        Even under repeated questioning  Rumsfeld  like Secretary Nicholson a day earlier  was unable to provide answers as to why veterans are not included in the   cost of war    paid for by the Administration  s supplemental request        In response to the lack of adequate funding to the Veterans   Affairs budget  Murray today reiterated her intent to introduce an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill to pay for veterans   health care   Murray  s  2 billion amendment would fully fund health care services for current veterans and those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan            In Washington state  we have 3 000 soldiers who are going to be coming home in a couple of weeks  Guard and Reserve  who are going to go into the veterans   services     Twenty percent of these soldiers  at least  will need help for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome   And we have lines today and we do not have the services for these folks    If this is a cost of war  then we should have money in the Supplemental    in the Emergency Supplemental    to take care of these veterans     Murray said         The full transcript of Murray  s questioning of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld follows     Murray   And it is part of the cost of the war  I think you would agree   The cost of caring for our veterans is a cost of the war        Rumsfeld   Oh absolutely       Murray   The supplemental that is in front of us is to cover the cost of war  and I will tell you  there  s not one dime in it  Now  I have to tell you  I  m a member of the veterans committee  the VA secretary was in front of us yesterday  I asked him these questions  he couldn  t provide me with an answer          When I ask you  you tell me you  re Secretary of Defense  you can  t answer me  Well  I want to know who I  m supposed to ask          We do not have the services available to take care of our soldiers once they come home  and come out of service  and become veterans  In Washington state  we have 3000 soldiers who are going to be coming home in a couple of weeks  guard and reserve folks  who are going to go into the veterans services  I met with all of our service personnel  and with the veterans   services  They know that they do not have the services to take care of this  They told me that 20 percent of these soldiers  at least  will need help for post traumatic stress syndrome   And we have lines today  we do not have the services for these folks         Mr  Chairman  I just have to say  if this is a cost of war  then we should have money in the supplemental  in the emergency supplemental  to take care of these veterans  And I am deeply disappointed by this request that it does not take care of these soldiers when they return home          I think all of us agree that they are a part of the cost of war  and we have a responsibility to make sure they get cared for  but we also have to recognize it is part of our recruitment and retention  And if we are not taking care of these veterans when they return home it is going to be very hard in the future to care of them         Mr  Secretary  I will let you respond  but Mr  Chairman  I want you to know that I will be offering an amendment on this supplemental when it comes before this committee for  2 billion  to care for our veterans because I do believe it  s a cost of war  I do believe it  s the responsibility of the United States Senate and Congress and I think we have an obligation to those who serve to make sure we  re there for them
