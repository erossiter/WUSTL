                                           News Release          Murray Speaks Out on the Credibility Gap at the FDA Washington state  s senior senator calls for the FDA to return to the status of   gold standard    not   double standard       For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 21  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash   a leading advocate for a strong  independent Food and Drug Administration  today took to the floor of the U S  Senate to speak about the dangerous road down which Commissioner Lester Crawford has led the agency following the announcement of further delays on the application of Plan B          Murray  who has repeatedly called for a yes or no answer from the agency on Plan B  s over the counter application  has filed several amendments to the Agriculture Appropriations bill in an attempt to force Commissioner Crawford to end the delays and return the FDA to a   gold standard           The full text of Senator Murray  s remarks follows        Importance and Concern    M  President  I rise today to address a matter of extreme importance to women  s health  public safety  and the independence and credibility of one of our nation  s most revered federal agencies  the FDA           M  President  I am outraged American women are outraged and consumers all across the United States should be outraged that the FDA is letting politics trump science in the way it approves medicines for the American consumer         Strong and Independent Agency    I have always supported a strong and independent Food and Drug Administration   It is the only way in which the FDA can truly operate effectively and with the confidence of American consumers and health care providers        Americans must have faith that when they walk into their local grocery store or pharmacy that the products they purchase are safe and effective and that their approval has been based on sound science    not political pressure or pandering to interest groups         By allowing politics to play a role in its decision making the FDA is opening a Pandora  s Box that could have profound consequences in determining the safety and efficacy on the drug approval process        Plan B as Exhibit A    Unfortunately  recent decisions    and delays    at the FDA have called into question the agency  s independence and allegiance to science based decisions    and Plan B is Exhibit A         But don  t take my word for it   Listen to Dr  Susan Wood  the former Director of the FDA  s Office of Women  s Health   In resigning in protest  Dr  Wood wrote         I have spent the last 15 years working to ensure that science informs good health policy decisions   I can no longer serve as staff when scientific and clinical   evidence  fully evaluated and recommended by the professional staff here  has           been overruled       In later comments to the Associated Press  Wood said    and I quote            There s fairly widespread concern about FDA s credibility  among agency veterans as a result of the Plan B process       M  President  these are the words of a health care professional who worked for years within the FDA to improve women  s health          Her resignation is a huge loss to the agency    to those of us in Congress who hadve championed women  s health and most importantly    her resignation is a loss to the millions of American women who rely on the FDA to make choices based on sound science          What Is Plan B     M  President  let me take a step back to explain what Plan B is and why the FDA  s actions are such a threat to the public  s health          Plan B is a form of contraception         Plan B contains a specific concentrated dose of ordinary birth control pills that prevents pregnancy        Emergency contraception cannot interrupt or disrupt an established pregnancy   In fact  Plan B has the potential to reduce the incidence of abortions    something we all can agree is an important goal        Greater awareness and use of emergency contraceptives    like Plan B    is an important component to reducing the rate of abortion in the U S          An analysis conducted by The Alan Guttmacher Institute estimates that 51 000 abortions were prevented by emergency contraceptive use in 2000  and that increased use of emergency contraceptives accounted for up to 43 percent of the total decline in abortion rates between 1994 and 2000          Plan B has already been approved by the FDA for prescription use and is available over the counter in seven states    including my home state of Washington   But it is not available nationwide       Why Plan B should be available OTC    When it comes to emergency contraceptives  every hour counts   The effectiveness of Plan B declines by 50 percent every 12 hours   The longer a woman must wait to see a doctor  get a prescription and then locate a pharmacy that will fill the prescription  the less effective Plan B becomes          Even privately insured women with regular access to a health care provider have to overcome significant barriers to obtaining a prescription for emergency contraceptives including finding a pharmacy that stocks Plan B within the short timeframe   For many uninsured women and teens  the barriers are often insurmountable       The   Hold       In December of 2003    almost two years ago    the FDA  s own scientific advisory board overwhelmingly recommended approval of Plan B  s OTC application by a vote of 23 4  but the FDA has not adhered to its own guidelines for drug approval and continues to drag its heels         In fact  Alastair Wood  a member of the advisory panel  told USA TODAY that          What  s disturbing is that the science was overwhelming here  and the FDA is supposed to make decisions on science          At a HELP Committee hearing in April of this year  I pressed the President  s nominee to head the FDA    Dr  Lester Crawford    to answer questions about the long pending application for nationwide over the counter approval of Plan B          When Dr  Crawford informed me that he couldn  t answer my questions in a public forum  I invited him to my office to discuss the process in a private meeting          My colleagues    Sen  Kennedy and Sen  Clinton    joined me for a very frustrating meeting in which Dr  Crawford failed to provide any timeline or specific reasons for the FDA  s highly unusual foot dragging on the Plan B application         It was very clear to me after this disappointing meeting that politics had trumped science and the public health mission of the FDA had been compromised   For this reason  Senator Clinton and I joined together to place a hold on Dr  Crawford  s nomination to head the FDA on June 15th  2005        We placed the hold saying we wanted a determination on the application    we did not advocate a particular outcome    all we asked for was that the FDA abide by its own rules and regulations          This is a very important point  M  President   Senator Clinton and I did not demand approval   We were simply calling for the FDA to follow its own procedures          In the end  apparently  that was asking too much       The Double Cross    The Administration and the Chairman of the HELP Committee understandably wanted Dr  Crawford confirmed   We began  what I considered to be a very productive conversation about restoring integrity to the FDA  s process and getting Dr  Crawford confirmed   I  d like to thank the Chairman for his responsiveness and good faith efforts         Our discussions culminated in a July 13th letter to HELP Committee Chair and Co Chair    Sens  Enzi and Kennedy    from Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt   This chart shows the letter from Secretary Leavitt   It says          I have spoken to the FDA  and  based on the feedback I have received  the FDA will act on this application by September 1  2005          Based on this assurance  Senator Clinton and I dropped our hold on Dr  Crawford and his nomination passed the full Senate        Unfortunately for the American people and the integrity of the FDA  Secretary Leavitt and the FDA broke their promise          The FDA had a chance to restore the confidence of American consumers in promoting safe and effective treatments  but it failed in this mission        A delay is not a decision   For over 6 months  Senator Clinton and I asked for a simple answer    yes or no         It is a breach of faith to have this Administration give us their word that a decision would be made  and have that promise violated          Now the FDA is claming that there are unanswered questions about Plan B  s effect on girls under 17   The fact is that the pending application does not apply to this group          Today  girls under 17 may only receive this drug with a prescription and that would remain the case if the FDA were to approve Plan B  s application   The FDA  s argument is highly suspect because the government already regulates products with age restrictions like tobacco  nicotine gum and alcohol        The Administration gave us their word  only to pull out the rug at the last moment   This continued delay goes against everything the FDA  s own advisory panel found nearly two years ago  that Plan B is safe and effective and should be available over the counter          There is no credible scientific reason to continue to deny increased access to this safe health care option        In fact  in his statement of further delay    Dr  Crawford acknowledged that the application has scientific merit  but still refused to approve it          I can only infer that FDA    and Dr  Crawford as its head    are continuing to put politics beliefs ahead of science       What Others Are Saying    And  I  m not the only one         According to the Washington Post  s editorial page on August 30th        In recent months critics have accused the FDA    which is required by law to make decisions  exclusively on scientific and legal grounds    of falling victim to outside political agendas  They have claimed that the Plan B decisions have reflected not sound science and legitimate caution but rather the influence of  moral  and antiabortion lobbies     By abruptly rejecting an application that had been tailored to meet the FDA s requirements  Mr  Crawford appears to        confirm the critics  worst fears      Whatever the legal arguments taking place  this unexpected delay at this stage    of the approval process makes the FDA    long admired around the world for its    neutrality and professionalism    look like an easily manipulated political tool      Here  s what Newsday said   quote        Drugs and politics don t mix  The current case in point is Plan B  the morning     after emergency contraceptive  and the politics of abortion  Taken together they re   threatening the Food and Drug Administration s credibility as an agency that             dispassionately evaluates the safety and effectiveness of drugs      The FDA said Friday it will delay for 60 days a decision on whether to allow Plan B to be sold to those 16 and older without a prescription  Officials attributed the foot dragging to concern that younger teens would get the drug and wouldn t use it responsibly  That rings hollow  When the FDA rejected an application for over           the counter sales without age restriction two years ago  it overruled its staff and an advisory panel and discounted the experience of six states and 33 countries where such pills are sold without prescription  The most recent application responsibly included the age restriction         Here  s how The Virginian Pilot put it        Plan B contraceptives can prevent tens of thousands of abortions and unwanted pregnancies  Restriction on availability to minors is consistent with other national reproductive policies and therefore valid      A country that can put a man on the moon can surely figure out how to distinguish          between younger and older women in selling a pill  If  that is  policymakers care half as much about science in one case as in the other        And perhaps  most succinctly  the Baltimore Sun        Dr  Crawford has been forced to adopt many improbable positions in order to keep his job  But now he s at risk of turning the world s most respected drug reviewing agency into a laughingstock  Nobody wins if that happens     Gold Standard  Not Double Standard    No amount of semantics or politicking can change the fact that the HHS Secretary and the FDA performed a bait and switch with the United States Senate and    more importantly    to the American people        Today  the Bush Administration has its FDA Commissioner  but the American public still doesn  t have an answer on Plan B   And    unfortunately    the FDA  which has long been known as the   gold standard    in drug approval  is at risk of becoming known for a double standard        M  President  the health and well being of the American people should not blow with the political winds          Caring for our residents is an American issue and part of that goal is ensuring that our residents have access to safe  effective medicines in a timely fashion        M  President  as a new member of the Senate HELP Committee in 1997  I faced the daunting task of working to reform the FDA   I    along with my colleagues   was dedicated to making the Food and Drug Modernization Act work          The intent of this landmark legislation was to introduce a new culture at the FDA    one which was to expedite the drug approval process by eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic delays while ensuring product safety   This new partnership was intended to open the lines of communication and ensure that manufacturers had a clear understanding of what would be required in the drug review process        M  President  the FDA has broken those lines of communications and has called into question the future of drug approval within the agency        M  President I still believe in a strong and independent FDA  but I believe that this agency has made a mockery of Congress and of its own procedures and protocols   They have abused the trust of the Congress and of the American people in the way in which they have played around with Plan B   It is far past time to return credibility to the FDA        M  President  the FDA needs to return to the gold standard   not continue to create a double standard    that puts politics ahead of the health and safety of the American public        M  President this is not the last word on this issue   The problem with politics subverting the FDA  s adherence to science and its integrity is so profound and so urgent that I intend to use every tool available to me as a Senator to make sure that this discussion about our priorities and our future is not lost
