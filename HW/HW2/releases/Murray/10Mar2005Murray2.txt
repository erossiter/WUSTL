                                                                   News Release          Senator Murray Fights Bush Administration Cuts to   Hanford Nuclear Cleanup Citing  89 million cut to Tank Farm Program  Murray asks if Washington State is being  targeted  by Bush Administration    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 10  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  continued her fight against the Bush Administration s plan to cut funding and delay cleanup at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the Tri Cities   Over the past five years  Murray has been the leading champion for Hanford cleanup funding and is co chair of the Senate s bipartisan Nuclear Cleanup Caucus        Speaking today at a hearing of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee  Murray told Paul Golan  Deputy Assistant Energy Secretary for Environmental Management   that Hanford will suffer the biggest share of the Administration s cut to the Environmental Management program  54 percent          This fact  combined with the absolute lack of sound rationale for the majority of Hanford budget cuts  can easily lead one to believe Washington state was targeted by the Department of Energy and the Office of Management and Budget   Murray said        Murray also criticized the Bush Administration s plan to cut funding for Tank Farm activities by  89 million in FY 2006    and then cripple tank farm work after September 30  2005         Tank farm activities going on this year can and should proceed in fiscal year 2006   There is absolutely no legal or technical reason that these activities must suddenly end September 30th   Murray said  noting that any legal uncertainty about the program s future was created by the Department of Energy itself          Murray also expressed her hope that relations will improve between Washington state and the U S  Department of Energy   Murray referenced the recent nominations of Clay Sell to be Deputy Energy Secretary and David Garman to be the Energy Department s Undersecretary as positive steps        Today s hearing comes one month after President Bush released his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2006   His budget cuts Hanford funding by  297 million   148 million from the Office of River Protection and  149 million from the Richland Operations Office    The same day the President released his budget  Senator Murray and Cantwell sent a  to President Bush protesting the cuts         On February 8th  Murray issued a  saying  in part   Hanford area residents and workers deserve a strong federal commitment to nuclear waste cleanup  The President  s budget not only breaks that promise  but puts the safety and economic security of this community at risk             Senator Murray s full statement from today s hearing follows     Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I say it every year  but I again want to thank you and Senator Reid for your leadership on this subcommittee   The jurisdiction of the subcommittee touches on so much that is critical to my state including the Corps of Engineers  the Bureau of Reclamation  the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  and    most prominent today    the Hanford Nuclear Reservation   I appreciate of the time and consideration you  Senator Reid  and the entire subcommittee staff give to matters effecting Washington state   Now  we both have to get to the Budget Committee that is beginning its mark up at this time  so I  ll try to be brief   I first want to recognize that Senator Reid wished to be here  but Budget Committee and floor matters required his attention   I know Senator Reid  myself and others likely have statements and questions they would like to have been able to give in person  but will not be able to   I ask that Senators be given an appropriate amount of time to submit these for the record and response from the Department         Mr  Chairman  I  d like to make some comments about the budget for Hanford and the Environmental Management program   By my calculation  the Defense Environmental Management program has been reduced by  548 million   Hanford alone would suffer 54  of this cut   This massive funding cut is dramatically disproportionate to Hanford  s share of the overall EM program   This fact  combined with the absolute lack of sound rationale for the majority of Hanford budget cuts  can easily lead one to believe Washington state was targeted by DOE and OMB         Let just point out one budgeting issue that makes no sense   The budget cuts the tank farm program by  89 million on the basis of legal uncertainty caused by the reclassification issue   I will move beyond the fact that DOE itself created this legal uncertainty   The fact is that tank farm activities going on this year can and should proceed in fiscal year 2006   There is absolutely no legal or technical reason that these activities must suddenly end September 30th   So  this budget is already undercutting a scope of work that has yet to be awarded   There are other examples of this budget  s lack of integrity and intelligence when it comes to Hanford  but I will not spell them all out          Rather  Mr  Chairman  let me end with my hope that communication and agreement between Washington state and the Department of Energy will improve   This hope is largely based upon the nominations of Clay Sell and David Garman   I respect the work they did here in the Senate  their willingness to listen  and their forthright communication   I hope their confirmations will help us move past the political and legal games and back to a strong partnership between Washington state and the Department of Energy   But  regardless of improving relationships between the State and the Department of Energy  I do not accept the Department  s rationale for these cuts and I will urge this subcommittee to maintain the federal government  s moral and legal obligation to Washington state and the Hanford communities
