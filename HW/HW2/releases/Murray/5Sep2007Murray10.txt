Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  spoke on the Senate floor in support of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  MILCON VA  Appropriations bill which is currently being debated by the Senate  The MILCON VA bill sets record new spending levels for veterans at a time when benefits waiting lines  a lack of mental health care accessibility  and inadequate conditions at VA facilities show they are desperately needed   After years of neglect  our government is again honoring our veterans sacrifices  Murray said on the Senate floor  This bill takes into account the additional strains on the VA system that simultaneous wars and new battlefield realties presentIt invests in improving health care  expanding mental health services  and constructing new facilities  It will mean more qualified health care workers  better prosthetics  and more accessible veteran s facilities   The MILCON VA bill also funds military construction projects nationwide and includes  635 million in improvements to Washington state facilities  To read more about the military funding for Washington state included in this bill visit HERE  Senator Muray is a member of the MILCON VA Appropriations Subcommittee  Senator Murray s floor remarks follow  Mr  President  In Iraq and Afghanistan  like so many conflicts before  our service members have done absolutely everything that has been asked of them   They have answered the President s call to war with the honor and sense of duty we have come to expect from our nation s bravest men and women  They have performed under enormous pressure in the middle of a civil war  They have left the loved ones that count on them behind  and They continue to put their lives on the line every day   Unfortunately  here at home  their commitment to serve us has not been met by an Administration committed to care for them  From poor conditions at VA facilities around the country  to a lack of PTSD counselors  to a benefit claims backlog that keeps veterans waiting for months and sometimes years   it is clear the Administration has failed to account for our nations veterans as a cost of this war  It is unacceptable that service members who fought overseas are returning home and being forced to fight their own government for the care and services they need  Today we take a major step toward reversing this trend and the Bush Administrations failure to care for our heroes  This Bill Invest In the Real Needs of Veterans    The funding for our veterans included in this bill is more than  3 6 billion over the President s request  After years of Bush Republicans cutting corners on caring for our heroes  we have put forth an honest assessment of what these men and women need  This bill takes into account the additional strains on the VA system that simultaneous wars and new battlefield realties present  And it is an investment that represents nearly all of the Independent Budget  a recommendation of the funds needed to care for our veterans  which is compiled by Veterans Service Organizations  It invests in improving health care  expanding mental health services  and constructing new facilities  It will mean more qualified health care workers  better prosthetics  and more accessible veteran s facilities  It will also mean thousands of new VA case workers to help reduce the unacceptable delays in receiving earned benefits  improved conditions at VA facilities  and an increased investment in Polytrauma and mental health facilities that will improve treatment for PTSD  Traumatic Brain Injury and catastrophic injuries  Most of all though  this bill means that after years of neglect  our government is again honoring our veterans sacrifices  Examples of VA Failures from Field Hearing Mr  President  this bill and all it provides couldnt come at a more crucial time As a member of both the Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for this bill and the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee  I have heard first hand about the VA s shortcomings in caring for our veterans  In fact  last month I held a Senate Veterans  Affairs field hearing in Tacoma  Washington to examine the challenges these men and women are facing  At the hearing I spoke with Brandon Jacobs  a veteran of the Army and National Guard who served in Iraq  He said that more must be done to raise awareness of PTSD  and combat related stresses  He talked about how we need to increase access not only for him and his fellow service members  but also for the many families that struggle when a loved one returns from war with an invisible wound  I also heard from Dan Purcell  an Iraq veteran who said he didn t want to be treated as a tool that could be casually discarded when broken or found to be no longer useful  This bill finally takes the necessary steps to recognize Brandon  and Dan  and so many others as a cost of war  Military Construction  Mr  President  we also have to make sure that our troops are ready  and that they receive the training they need  That s why I m so pleased with the military construction investments this bill makes across the country and particularly in my home state  Washington s military facilities play a critical role in our nation s security  From Fort Lewis in Tacoma that is training the Stryker Brigades at the center of the fight in Iraq  to Fairchild Air Force base in Spokane that plays a major role in our air defense  to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island that patrols our Pacific shores  It is critical that these bases  which serve such vital roles  receive the funding they need  This bill does just that  providing more than  635 million in improvements for Washington military installations  I d like to thank Senators Reed and Hutchinson for their special attention and recognition of the needs of bases throughout Washington State  Their leadership on this bill has been outstanding  Conclusion  Mr  President  this bill recognizes that any time we invest in building our military and improving training for our troops  we also invest in their care  George Washington once famously observed that   The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country         This bill reverses President Bushs failures and carrys through on the commitment that our first President discussed  It keeps our military strong by honoring the sacrifices of our heroes with funding that meets their needs  It s also important to note that this bill is endorsed by the Disabled American Veterans  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  the American Legion  the Paralyzed Veterans of America  AMVETS  and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America   among many others Veterans Service Organizations that fight for veterans every day  Mr  President  It s clear that a vote for this bill is a vote to right a ship that the Administration has steered off course  But above all it is a vote to keep faith with the brave men and women who serve us all  When those men and women first put on a uniform they earned the right to a government that provides the care they need  And when we approve this bill we will begin to renew that covenant
