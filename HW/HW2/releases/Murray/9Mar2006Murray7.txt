                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murray Statement on DPW Announcement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Murray  Murray Statement on DPW Announcement  03 09 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Murray Statement on DPW Announcement    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 9  2006      We still don  t know what today  s announcement by Dubai Ports World means for the future operations of the six ports in question   Considering the lack of scrutiny and general mismanagement of the process to this point  we need to continue to proceed with caution         But while we don  t yet know enough about what today  s announcement means  we do know that there are gaping holes in cargo and port security that need to be plugged        America can  t afford to outsource the security of our ports   The safety of our citizens and the strength of our economy are the most important responsibility of the United States government   And our government must begin to take that responsibility seriously         I urge the Administration and Congress to take a serious look at the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act that I have introduced with Senator Susan Collins of Maine   The GreenLane bill develops a cargo security system that closes vulnerabilities  provides a way to resume trade after an incident  and maintains the efficient flow of commerce   I believe that we can move ahead with this legislation this year
