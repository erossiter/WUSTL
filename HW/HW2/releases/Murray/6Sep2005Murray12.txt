                                                                        News Release          Senator Murray Addresses the Hurricane Katrina Recovery in a Senate Floor Speech    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  September 6  2005    Mr  President  I come here this afternoon to join my colleagues in offering my support  my sympathy  and certainly everything we can do from my home state of Washington to so many of our fellow Americans who are suffering so tragically from the outfall of Hurricane Katrina   I want them to know we will do everything we can from here to make sure we are there for them        Mr  President  I have to say that over the past week  citizens from this end of the country to my end of the country on the West Coast have been glued to their television screens and really overwhelmed by the tremendous devastation and the unfathomable suffering of so many of our fellow Americans   The images have become almost too much to bear    watching families without food and without water  people who have been trapped on their roofs  and people searching for their loved ones        People have come up to me everywhere I ve gone in my state over the last week  and my office has been inundated with calls from Washington state residents who are really horrified at the conditions they have seen on TV   They are asking    rightfully    what can we do to help and how can we be there for our citizens  They are reaching into their pockets and doing everything they can  and that truly has been heartwarming to see          But they are also asking    how could this have happened   Mr  President I have to say that people in my home state are upset and with good reason  Our government failed in its initial response   We now have to see that we succeed in this ongoing recovery and that certainly is my focus right now          There is going to be a lot of time for hard questions and accountability  but I think today we need to focus on meeting the tremendous needs that rescue workers  and our Guard  and our police forces are meeting on the ground        We also need to recognize that the recovery area is now no longer just limited to the Gulf Coast   As Americans have opened their hearts and their homes  they ve opened their communities  and their stadiums  and their hospitals and their homes in towns and cities from coast to coast that need has spread across the country        In my home state of Washington  we re expecting to welcome shortly 2 000 evacuees   Nearly 200 of them are going to arrive by this Thursday  and we need to make sure we are doing everything and being prepared to meet their needs as they come to our state        Right now  we have to ensure that the evacuees have the bare essentials   that they have food  and they have clothing  and they have shelter   But we also have to make sure we are preparing for the long term        For most children in this country  as we all know  this week marks a very exciting time    the beginning of the school year    a time when they head off to meet their new teachers and reconnect with old friends and make new ones   For all of the children who have been displaced from their homes and their school districts by the effects of Hurricane Katrina  the beginning of the school year is really the least of their worries   But we will need to come together as a country to help these schools across the nation that are taking in these students from Gulf Coast        I just heard on television that there will be probably 200 000 or more of these young students   We ve got to do everything we can to absorb the cost and do everything we can to help the transition for these children and families        We also need to pay special attention to funding for support for homeless and foster children and ensure that the most vulnerable among us have the support they need to succeed and build brighter futures again        Mr  President  in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  many different sectors of our transportation system are also stepping up to the plate to deliver critical service   Because this region s infrastructure is so devastated  we need to immediately explore alternatives to moving people and freight throughout the region   It s going to take time to get our transportation infrastructure back to where it was    but we need to really start concentrating on that and getting systems put in place now as well        Mr  President  rest assured  I will be asking very hard questions in the days to come about what went wrong  and what we need to do to ensure that Americans never endure such preventable suffering ever again   All of those questions will be explored in detail  but right now I m going to continue to make sure that we are providing the immediate support that our families and our communities need   And once again  Mr  President  I just want to say my thoughts and my prayers go out to everyone who has been touched by this disaster
