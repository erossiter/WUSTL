Release  Monday  December 5  2005     Vancouver  WA     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  joined local leaders to announce  2 3 million she secured for the Port of Vancouver  s Freight Access project   The project will help the Port handle an expected surge in cargo  will reduce traffic congestion in downtown Vancouver and neighboring communities  and will support new jobs and economic development at the Port   Senator Murray  s funding will help complete an environmental impact statement   Last year  Senator Murray secured  1 million for the project         This investment is great news for the region  s economy  for local businesses  for the port  and for our state   Murray said    For Southwest Washington  it means we  re going to grow the region  s economy   For working families  it means more jobs here at the port and more local businesses hiring workers   For our producers and importers  it means we  ll have more capacity at the Port to trade with the world   For local residents  it means you  ll have fewer trucks on residential streets  less traffic congestion and a better quality of life   And for our state  it means we are moving forward    planning for the future and making sure we benefit from it            Senator Murray s remarks follow    Today is a great day for the people  the economy  and the future of Vancouver   I  m thrilled to be here to celebrate with you and to announce some critical federal funding I was able to secure for transportation improvements that will help shape the region well into the future        We all know our ports and transportation infrastructure are the economic engines moving people and goods across our state and laying the foundation for continued economic growth   And thanks to all of you  we  re making that engine even stronger and more powerful here in Vancouver          All of us know how important trade and our ability to move goods quickly and efficiently through our ports is to the economy   That s why I  ve worked so hard at the federal level to make critical investments in our waterways  our highways  our railways and our ports    especially along the Columbia River        This past summer I joined many of you in celebrating the start of dredging on the Columbia River channel deepening project and continuing repairs to the Jetties at the mouth of the Columbia River to protect that investment   I know that a deeper channel will support greater economic growth along the river and throughout the state   And that  s especially true for the Port of Vancouver   But in order to sustain that growth we must make other investments in our transportation infrastructure to address increased traffic and improve access to the port        That  s why I  m proud to announce that I was able to secure  2 3 million to support the Port of Vancouver  s efforts to reduce congestion  increase capacity  and improve freight mobility   As the highest ranking Democrat on the committee that funds the Department of Transportation  I was able to use my position to make the federal government a partner in this important project          This investment is great news for the region  s economy  for local businesses  for the port  and for our state   For Southwest Washington  it means we  re going to grow the region  s economy   For working families  it means more jobs here at the port and more local businesses hiring workers   For our producers and importers  it means we  ll have more capacity at the Port to trade with the  world   For local residents  it means you  ll have fewer trucks on residential streets  less traffic congestion and a better quality of life   And for our state  it means we are moving forward    planning for the future and making sure we benefit from it        This day has been a long time in the making for many of you and your success reflects your commitment to building a better future for the entire community   I applaud your work and your foresight          I talk to people all over our state who have ideas about how to help their communities and sometimes they don  t know how to move forward   I always tell them to do exactly what you have done here    develop a vision  build a broad coalition and don  t stop until you make it happen        I m so excited about the positive impact this funding and this project will have on the future of Vancouver   The investment we  re making today to improve transportation infrastructure lays the foundation for future economic growth        Everyone here played a role in helping us reach this point    and I just want to say my special thanks to Mayor Pollard and the City of Vancouver  the Port Commissioners and staff  the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway  and local business leaders   All of you have worked so hard  and I thank you for that        We know that when we invest in our transportation infrastructure  we reduce congestion  improve safety  and build stronger communities   Today  we  re ensuring that the port and city will be ready for the future and we re confirming that we re willing to make the critical investments that will serve this community for decades to come           So  I  m proud to be here today to support this important project   Thank you for your work and dedication  and I look forward to working with you to make this project a success well into the future
