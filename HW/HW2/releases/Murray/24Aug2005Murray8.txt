Department of Interior to accept ownership of the East and South Vancouver Barracks should they become available through the BRAC process   The three lawmakers requested the ownership transfer in the following letter addressed to Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton                                                                                         August 24  2005       Gale Norton  Secretary of the Interior  Department of the Interior  Attn   MS7229 MIB  1849 C Street  NW  Washington  D C   20240    Dear Secretary Norton        The Vancouver National Historic Reserve was created by Congress in 1996 in recognition of the tremendous cultural and historic assets located within the 366 acre site  The significance of this site was such that Congress designated two federal agencies  the US Army and the National Park Service as official Partners  along with the City of Vancouver and the State of Washington         Since the creation of the Reserve the Partners  working in conjunction with the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Trust  the official non profit organization for the Reserve  have collectively invested almost  24 million dollars into the development of the Historic Reserve to create one of the premier historic and cultural sites in the United States   Fort Vancouver National Historic Site currently draws over 500 000 visitors per year from across the country and around the world  Other Reserve venues  including the Pearson Air Museum  Officers Row  the Water Resources Education Center and the Columbia River waterfront provide a rich cultural and educational experience for visitors in addition to a significant economic benefit for our region        Recently  the Confluence Project with artwork by internationally renowned artist Maya Lin has chosen the Vancouver National Historic Reserve as one of their major sites   A 40 foot wide land bridge has been designed to link the major part of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve with the waterfront of the Columbia River   A combination of private funding  Washington State Capital funding and federal transportation dollars totaling  10 million dollars promises to make the land bridge a significant attraction for visitors as well as a major transportation link for the Reserve        In addition  almost a billion dollars of private and public funding has been invested in the vicinity of the Historic Reserve in the last 15 years  In the last month  a significant piece of the Columbia River waterfront close to the Reserve has opened up for redevelopment with the expectation that close to a hundred million dollars will be invested in that area   While the Historic Reserve benefits significantly from this community investment  the development of the Reserve as a tourism destination also plays a role in encouraging further community investment        The Historic Reserve now has a significant opportunity that will allow for expansion of public use and bring additional visitors and economic benefit to Southwest Washington and beyond   The East and South Vancouver Barracks  currently occupied by the Army Reserve and Washington National Guard  are on the proposed Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  list  The BRAC process would allow the ownership of the East and South Barracks  which has been within the authorized boundaries of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site for nearly 50 years  to transfer to the National Park Service  if the Department of the Interior agrees to accept the property        The East and South Vancouver Barracks are located in the middle of the Historic Reserve and contain a number of nationally significant buildings and cultural resources  including the Hudson s Bay Company Village and Cemetery where members of 37 different Native American tribes are buried   National Park Service ownership of the property will allow the Reserve Partners to continue to work cooperatively to ensure successful redevelopment efforts          This opportunity is a critical juncture for the future of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve   The City of Vancouver  the State of Washington  the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Trust  and the community at large have long anticipated that the National Park Service would accept responsibility for the East and South Barracks since these areas are within the park s legislative boundaries   We urge the National Park Service and the Department of the Interior to accept ownership of the East and South Barracks should they become available through the BRAC process or other mechanisms         Sincerely        Patty Murray  U S  Senator         Maria Cantwell  U S  Senator             Brian Baird  U S  Representative
