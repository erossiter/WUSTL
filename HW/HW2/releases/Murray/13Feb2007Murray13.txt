Need Inpatient Mental Healthcare  02 13 2007                                                                                                                    News Release          VETERANS   Senator Murray Questions VA Secretary Over Bush Budget that Raises Fees on Veterans and Predicts Fewer Veterans Will Need Inpatient Mental Healthcare President s VA Budget Does Not Keep Up With Inflation  Murray Warns    For Immediate Release  Tuesday  February 13  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  questioned Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary James Nicholson about President Bush s proposed veterans  budget for fiscal year 2008          Murray expressed her frustration that once again the VA is seeking to raise user fees and double drug co payments for some veterans         I m very concerned that this budget closes the VA s door to thousands of our nation s veterans   It includes new fees and increased co pays that will discourage veterans from accessing the VA   And it continues to bar Priority 8 veterans from enrolling in the VA healthcare system   Murray said        Murray also sought an explanation for why the VA plans to see fewer veterans for inpatient mental healthcare in the coming year          When the President has proposed a surge in troops to Iraq  when the men and women in uniform are being deployed for their second and third tours of duty  and when more and more of our troops are coming home with PTSD and other mental health care needs  I don t understand how the VA can assume that they will treat fewer patients for inpatient mental health care   Murray said         In addition  Murray questioned the VA s estimates of how many veterans it will serve in the next fiscal year   Finally  she mentioned the VA s troubled emergency room policy after the death of a Spokane area veteran and asked the Secretary to provide further answers in writing                     Senator Murray s opening statement and Q with Secretary Nicholson follows     Thank you very much Chairman Akaka and Senator Craig   I appreciate you holding this very important hearing on the President s budget proposal for fiscal year 2008   And I want to thank the veteran s service organizations  who put so much work into crafting the Independent Budget  and I think it s very important we hear what they have to say as well   I appreciate them being here        I want to welcome back Secretary Nicholson  Mr  Secretary  as I said to you privately before we started  thank you so much for the new CBOC in Northwest Washington and the new vet center in Everett   These are issues we ve been working on for a number of years  and our vets in Northwest Washington are really pleased that someone is finally moving the ball forward  and I want to thank you for that publicly        Mr  Chairman  with our troops fighting overseas and more veterans being created each and every day  it s critical that we do everything in our power to make sure that this budget provides for our veterans   In the past  the VA has been dramatically wrong in its budget projections   I think we all agree we can never let that happen again        Mr  Secretary  you and I both agree that the VA s health care system is among the best in the country once you get in the door   But it s getting in the door that s the problem        I m very concerned that this budget closes the VA s door to thousands of our nation s veterans   It includes new fees and increased co pays that will discourage veterans from accessing the VA   And it continues to bar Priority 8 veterans from enrolling in the VA healthcare system          I am also very concerned that the VA is still underestimating the number of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan that will seek care in the VA   In FY 2006  the VA underestimated the number of patients it would see by 45 000   For the current fiscal year  FY 2007   the VA has been forced to revise its projection up by 100 000 veterans         Now the VA is projecting that it will see 263 000 Iraq and Afghanistan vets in 2008  yet I am told by some that the VA should actually be preparing to care for more than 300 000 returning veterans   Frankly  I think it s very important that we don t underestimate this number   We ve seen the past failures in the VA to accurately project the numbers  and I think it s important that this committee get it right        While this budget increases funding for the VA over previous years  it barely keeps pace with inflation and other built in costs   It falls far short of the Independent Budget recommendation   And this budget assumes cutbacks in veterans  healthcare in 2009 and 2010   We need to focus on that  Mr  Chairman  because we can t project out the care of some of these veterans in the short term  We have to make sure they re covered in the long term  and this budget doesn t do that         This budget also assumes a decrease in the number of inpatient mental health patients  when all signs point to an increase in need   When the President has proposed a surge in troops to Iraq  when the men and women in uniform are being deployed for their second and third tours of duty  and when more and more of our troops are coming home with PTSD and other mental health care needs  I don t understand how the VA can assume that they will treat fewer patients for inpatient mental health care         Mr  Chairman  I think our veterans deserve a better budget than has been presented to us   They deserve a budget that is based on real numbers and real needs  We all know too well what happens when the VA gets shortchanged   It isn t bureaucrats in D C  that suffer   It is the men and women who have served us so honorably that pay the biggest price   I hope that through strong oversight of this committee and your leadership that we will make sure we are presenting a budget that reflects the needs we have in front of us       Q with Secretary Nicholson   Unofficial Transcript by Senator Murray s Office    MURRAY  I wanted to follow up on the chairman s line of questioning on the need for inpatient mental health care  I too was really disconcerted to see the budget request projecting fewer veterans needing inpatient mental healthcare   I understand the philosophy of trying to do more and more outpatient to reach more people that way  but it just seems to me   when 1 in 3 Iraq war veterans are estimated to be seeking mental healthcare  many of our service members are now on their second or third or even fourth deployments   We re hearing about the intensity on the ground and what our men and women are facing and the consequences when they return home  and the President now sending up to 48 000 more troops  it just seems to me that we re going to need more inpatient psychiatric services  not less and I want to hear your rationale on that          You made a comment that just struck me because you said that no veteran has been denied inpatient mental healthcare  yet we heard about a highly publicized case of an Iraqi war veteran with two purple hearts named Jonathan Schulze who tragically took his own life   The press reports were that he asked for help from the VA twice and was told that he was 26th on the waiting list   He was from Minnesota  but there s also a case in Illinois and Iowa   It just seems to me when you have that many red flags going you can t just arbitrarily say no one s being denied care  and I think we have to say there are red flags out there   We need to find out what s going on   So I ll ask you two questions   We re hearing about these cases that say veterans are being denied care when they ask for it  and secondly  how can you predict a lower demand for inpatient psychiatric services in the budget when we know there are going to be increasing consequences as the years progress       NICHOLSON   Thank you Senator Murray  several important questions  I like having the opportunity to respond   First  our budget for psychiatric inpatient care is actually up   I m looking at it  we re asking for a billion  six million dollars         MURRAY   Right  your budget requests increased  but you are projecting that fewer veterans will need inpatient healthcare       NICHOLSON   Well  let me give you the capacity figures  what we ve anticipated our needs to be is what we should request from you the money to fill   In our capacity for mental health  is currently being utilized at 70  and for polytraumatic care  and our polytraumatic centers  is 80   so we have in the case of mental health in general 30  capacity available  in the case of polytraumatic capacity we have 20  available   Let me also address         MURRAY  Are you talking nationwide 20  available because you know  if those facilities aren t where our veterans are it doesn t make any difference  they re not going to travel 5 000 miles to get inpatient care       NICHOLSON  Well  I mean you know that we have 154 inpatient facilities around the country and almost a thousand other points of access for veterans to come in to be screened  to be referred   I want to address the other point that you raised to the extent that I can  and I m limited by the privacy regulations because the family has not given us a waiver to discuss this  but the case that you mentioned from Minnesota which comes up often  that veteran was seen by our facilities in Minnesota 46 times   So that s about all I can say       MURRAY   OK  and I understand extenuating circumstances in all cases  but it s not an isolated case  we re hearing about cases elsewhere   But my question to you is do you really think that we re going to see fewer veterans needing access to inpatient mental healthcare       NICHOLSON  We re projecting that we re going to be getting somewhat fewer in this time frame       MURRAY   Well  my time s out  and I want to ask another quick question   But Mr  Chairman  I think we have to be careful not just to project numbers on the hopes of keeping the budget down  but really looking at what we re going to need to pay for because of inpatient care   And as you stated and I ve referred to  we do have many veterans who are in their second  third  possibly fourth tour   We have 48 000 additional troops being sent  and we are seeing a third of our veterans seeking mental healthcare  so I hope we look very carefully at those numbers as we put our budget together   But let me ask one other question really quickly in my time          I wanted to ask about shorter hours at our urgent care in Spokane   I m going to submit that for the record because we have a serious concern about that facility closing at 4 30 in the afternoon   We have one    if not more    cases of veterans who ve died because they ve shown up shortly after the facility closed   And there is a huge problem with how veterans receive their care if they don t go to the VA facility not being paid for  that is an issue I want to address with you on another occasion          But I also wanted to ask you about these increased user fees and co pays because as you know I oppose that   I believe that anyone we ask to serve us should not be given an additional cost to get their healthcare  that s not what they were told   But I am disturbed that in the proposal this year  that you asked to put that money from fees  should it ever be collected  back into the general budget rather than into the VA healthcare   It seems to me what that simply is saying to our veterans is we re asking you to balance the federal budget now  and I find that even worse than the suggestion that they should pay co pays   I wanted to ask you why you have changed that policy  and why you re suggesting that in this budget       NICHOLSON   The reason for that  Senator Murray  is that if you ll recall other discussions that we ve had about this  the revenue from that was assumed in the budget  and was used to pay for the needs of the application side of the budget   Having an experience where it s not been approved  and then having a gap  instead of doing that  we didn t assume it   And this budget  if you approve it without those measures  we ll have the money that we need for the application       MURRAY  So basically we can balance the budget if we charge our veterans fees   I just find that incomprehensible       NICHOLSON  No no  I m not being very artful in trying to explain it   If you deny it  there will be no gap in this budget and have to find it somewhere else       MURRAY   For the VA        NICHOLSON   Right         MURRAY   I know my time s up  Mr  Chairman  thank you       Note  Senator Murray submitted additional written questions to Secretary Nicholson for his reply
