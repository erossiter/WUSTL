                                                         Murray  Remarks by Senator Murray on the So Called  Child Custody Protection Act   07 25 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Remarks by Senator Murray on the So Called  Child Custody Protection Act       For Immediate Release  Tuesday  July 25  2006    Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the so called  Child Custody Protection Act    This is yet another one of those divisive bills with a deceptive title and a dangerous impact on women          Today many Americans are upset about the direction our country is moving in   You d think that the Republican Majority would finally start addressing the real issues that affect working families every day    things like access to healthcare  high energy prices  fixing the prescription drug program  and protecting our ports        But instead  today we re seeing yet another debate on another election year gimmick   Last month  Republicans rolled out a constitutional amendment on gay marriage just so they could energize their base   Then they brought up a constitutional amendment on flag burning   Now we have a divisive bill that threatens the health of women and undermines our rights        It s no wonder that Americans are so frustrated with this Republican Majority   Today families are facing real challenges  and once again what we see here is the Republican leadership is playing election year games   To me  this is just the latest example of how Republicans have the wrong priorities         With a war overseas  painful cuts to education here at home  veterans being denied healthcare  soaring energy costs  and mounting debt  the Republican Majority is saying this is the most important issue we could be debating today   Well I think they should stop wasting time on divisive election year politics and start focusing on the real challenges facing the American people   We should be talking about pressing needs    not a dangerous and misguided bill that threatens the health of our nation  s young women          Today s debate comes in the context of a series of attacks on women s rights   Since 1994  we have seen a consistent and aggressive effort in Congress to limit a women  s right to choose   There have been more than 170 anti choice votes taken in Congress since 1994   This bill follows that troubling pattern   This legislation is not about protecting young women or improving communication within families  or stopping sexual predators   Instead  it is just another attempt by Republicans to chip away at a woman  s right to safe and legal reproductive health care        Let me turn to the substance of the bill   This legislation could criminalize a grandparent  aunt  or adult sibling for responding to a request for help from a young woman in a crisis pregnancy situation   If any of these caring adults accompany a young woman across state lines to obtain reproductive health services  and the woman s home state has a parental involvement law  then those caring adults could be criminally prosecuted   Today  we will offer an amendment to exempt grandparents and clergy from this onerous bill   It s the least we can do to minimize the harm of this legislation          But this law doesn  t stop at turning caring adults into criminals   It would also criminalize anyone who transports a pregnant minor across any state line   Imagine a young woman living in a rural area with no reproductive health service providers  and the nearest facility is in a large city just over the state line   If that young woman boards a bus or takes a taxi to the city to get an abortion  the person who drives her could be criminally liable under this law  and sued by the parents          Mr  President  I think we all agree that a young woman facing a crisis pregnancy should be encouraged to talk to her parents   According to a study by Stanley Henshaw and Kathryn Kost  in the vast majority of these situations  the young woman does involve her parents   But tragically  in situations where women don t tell their parents  one third of the young women are victims of abuse   In an ideal world  every young woman would talk to her parents   But we don t live in an ideal world   The reality is that a young woman cannot always turn to a parent   We are not talking about a young woman who is afraid her parents will be ashamed or shun her   We are talking about serious situations where the young woman may be a victim of incest or abuse   A young woman who has an abusive home situation often accurately predicts the danger of telling a parent about a pregnancy   This bill would punish those young women if they seek the support and help of other family members or clergy          We live in a time when we have a lot of families who don t fit the traditional two parent model   More and more grandparents are raising their grandchildren   Divorced parents are getting remarried  and young women can develop close relationships with their step parents   In these families  the caring adult who is responsible for the day to day care of a young woman would be criminally liable  and could even be sued by an absentee parent          We also know that some young women have no other alternative but to go to another state to obtain reproductive health services   Access to these services all across our country is severely limited  Eighty seven percent of counties have no providers   There are states such as Mississippi that have only one provider   Our laws should reflect the reality that for some women these services cannot be found locally        Unfortunately  the only thing this bill does do is ensure that young women who are intent on seeking reproductive health services go it alone   If a young woman thinks that bringing a caring adult or supportive friend will get that person in trouble  she will make the trip on her own   You wouldn  t want your children to drive home from the hospital after having surgery  but this legislation will result in young women driving themselves after having a medical procedure   How can my colleagues say that this bill is about the safety of young women when it actually endangers them more        Proponents claim that the  judicial bypass procedure  is an adequate protection for young women who feel they can  t involve their parents   That s not the case   A young woman would have to go to a courthouse  get a hearing  tell the judge and anyone else in the courtroom her situation  and wait for a judge to rule   Now imagine that this happens in a small town where the judge is friends with her parents   Whether it s in a big city or a small town  a young woman who s never been to court could find the whole process intimidating and overwhelming          Mr  President  this bill doesn  t even have an exception to protect the health of young women   That raises huge constitutional questions   Since Roe v  Wade  every constitutional federal law restricting a woman s right to choice has contained a health exception  and many laws have been struck down because they lack one   Should we really be saying that a young woman s health does not count when she faces a crisis pregnancy   Is this Senate ready to tell young women that their health and safety do not matter          This bill doesn t care about a young women s health  and it barely even cares about her life   That s because the bill s exception for a life threatening situation is very narrow and very limited        In addition  according to experts who have studied it  this bill could effectively nullify the laws of states that allow physicians to provide confidential medical services to minors    like my home state of Washington   The people of my state have twice affirmed a woman s right to choose   That is the settled position of our state   This bill could reach into my home state and effectively eliminate those protections   No matter how you feel about this bill  I think everyone should be concerned that federal intervention could undermine the ability of states to set their own laws on this difficult subject      The House version goes even further    potentially making criminals out of Washington state physicians who follow the laws of Washington state        Proponents of this bill claim that it is needed to prevent sexual predators from taking pregnant young women across state lines to obtain reproductive health services against their will   But that s not how the bill is written   If it were truly meant to prevent sexual predators from harming young women  why would it criminally prosecute a young woman  s family members  including grandparents  aunts  or adult siblings   Why is the scope of this bill so broad that it includes clergy members and even unknowing taxi drivers          Every one of us wants to reduce the number of abortions that occur   Mr  President  instead of forcing the government deeper into sensitive and personal family relationships  we should focus on preventing teen pregnancies   We should be working on a comprehensive approach to reproductive health education for our teens  That will help reduce teen pregnancy and that s the goal of the Lautenberg Menendez amendment   That amendment would be a good step forward    but even that addition could not redeem such a flawed underlying bill   We should be working on ways to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies among teens and women alike   That is why on issues like emergency contraceptives I have fought so hard to ensure that the FDA makes its decisions based on science    on whether a drug is safe and effective         Instead of working to reduce teen pregnancies  this Senate is looking for ways to criminalize those who want to help and support teens facing a crisis pregnancy   Unfortunately  this bill is just what it looks like    another ploy for the majority to play to their base in an election year   Women s lives should not be used as pawns in a political debate  and women s rights should not be traded away in a ploy for votes          Let s send a message that we know our country is facing serious challenges and we are going to spend our very limited time addressing those challenges and fighting for working families   I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous  divisive  and misguided bill
