                                 News Release          Murray to Open New Office on the Eastside    For Immediate Release  Monday  January 31  2005    At an event at the Kirkland Chamber of Commerce  Senator Murray announced that she will open a new office to better serve her Eastside constituents   Senator Murray introduced the newest member of her state staff  Marygrace Galston  who will be primarily responsible for responding to the needs of Eastside residents           In her speech  Senator Murray also talked about her priorities for the upcoming Congress  which include making sure Social Security stays strong  keeping our Ports secure  taking care of our veterans  and meeting the transportation challenges faced by our state        Senator Murray s Remarks Follow     Thank you  Bill   I am delighted to be with you          Today  I want to give you a preview of some of the things I  ll be working on this year   I also want to announce some good news for the Eastside and a step I  m taking to strengthen our relationship        I just got back last night from Washington  D C   Yesterday  I had the honor as your Senator to sit on platform a few feet away from President Bush as he took the oath of office          I have been fortunate to attend four inaugurations  and they are a time to reflect on our great country and to look ahead to what we can accomplish   For me  yesterday was a powerful reminder of the great responsibility the people of Washington have given me  You  ve sent me back to the Senate to speak out for you and to stand up for our state  and I take that responsibility very seriously           Today  I want to preview some of the big national issues Congress will deal with in the coming months and then I want to mention some of the Washington state priorities that I  ll be fighting for         Of course  we  ll be working on many of the topics President Bush outlined in his speech         We know we have challenges abroad    with the war in Iraq and the global war on terrorism           The President has asked Congress to fundamentally change the Social Security system   My parents never had a lot of money  and they literally limped onto Social Security  It was a rock of security for them  and I want to make sure it remains strong for all Americans         Congress will address many other issues  including  taxes  deficit reduction  education  healthcare  homeland security  and transportation   On all of those issues  I  ll be looking out for our state and speaking out for our values and priorities        Beyond those big national debates  I  ve got a few priorities that are closer to home    and I  d like to mention three of them today        The first is port security   We have to do more to protect our ports and our region  s economy   Our state  s economy and many family jobs depend on trade    so this is crucial work  and I  ll continue to lead the national effort to keep our ports safe from terrorist threats and at work for our economy  I  ve got some specific ideas for how to move port security to the next level  and I  ll be introducing legislation on that in the coming months         I  m also very concerned about our veterans   My dad was a disabled World War II vet   When he came home  our country was there for him    and it needs to be there for our veterans today   particularly  the young men and women who are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan           These men and women have served with honor and distinction   They  ve made us all proud   Many of them are coming home with real needs    from mental and physical health to job training and educational assistance   I have pushed the Administration to equip and train our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan   And I am committed to fighting for these new combat veterans and their families when they get home           On Wednesday  I met with the President  s nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs   I laid out all of my priorities for helping the veterans in our state  and I  m going to use my position on the Senate  s Veterans Affairs Committee to honor those    who honor us    with their service         And I just want to say personally that taking care of our returning veterans is not just something for the government   As they come home  these veterans will need help from us all   I encourage you to be part of the effort to welcome them home and to help with the transitions these veterans and their families will face        The last issue I want to mention today is transportation   I know transportation continues to be a top concern here on the Eastside from traffic congestion to the impact of commuter traffic on your neighborhoods   Over the past few years  we  ve made good progress on transportation statewide   The legislature stepped up  and our region has been willing to make the investments we need to make           I  ve been proud to be a strong federal partner in that effort  As the senior Democrat on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee  I have used my seniority to fund more than  900 million dollars in Washington state transportation projects over the last four years   These funds and projects are above and beyond our state  s federal formula funding   Here in King County  we  ve worked together to improve our transit system and to address the challenges of Eastside projects like I 405 and the 520 bridge           There  s much more work to do on transportation for the Eastside  for the entire state  and I very much want to work with all of you to address those needs        Those are just a few of the priorities I  ll be working on  and I want to invite you to work with me on the things that matter to you   I welcome the Chamber  s input and the opportunity to have a closer relationship with everyone on the Eastside         And that brings me to the final news I want to share with you today   I  m proud to announce that I will open a new Senate office here on the Eastside to make it easier for us to communicate and make progress together   This area is growing  and I want to make sure that I know what  s happening here    as it happens    and can offer help quickly to the community         I  ve already hired a staff member for the Eastside   Her name is Marygrace Galston  Marygrace is my eyes and ears here  and you  ll be seeing a lot of her in the coming months    I hope you  ll include Marygrace in your regular meeting here at the Chamber and throughout Kirkland   I want to invite you to say hello to her  and if you give her your business card  you can get email updates from me on the issues I  ve talked about today        Marygrace is raring to go  and the only thing she needs is a place to work   Right now  we  re looking for office space that is both affordable and easy for people to get to    a true Eastside challenge    But my new office will open as soon as we have the location  and I hope it will be a resource to help us make progress for this community        So there are a lot of challenges I  ll be working on in the Senate this year and there a lot of things I want to do for our state    and for this community   I  m proud to start off this year opening a new office here on the Eastside  and I  m looking forward to partnering with all of you in the days to come         Thank you for having me today
