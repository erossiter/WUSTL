Board to fulfill mandated duty    For Immediate Release  Friday  February 18  2005     WASHINGTON  D C      One day after receiving the Amtrak Board of Directors   financial report  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D Wash   and Daniel Inouye  D Hawaii  today sent a letter to David M  Laney  the Chairman of the Board  admonishing the writers of the report for purposely evading the subject of federal subsidies            This year  s report as submitted by a largely new Board deliberately evades the question of the railroad  s subsidy needs and instead praises the President  s irresponsible proposal to bankrupt Amtrak as the   right message     Such an approach undermines Congress   ability to assess Amtrak  s needs and is a disservice to the Corporation that you are charged with governing     Murray and Inouye wrote         The annual report  written by a Bush Administration appointed Board of Directors  bucks the intent of the laws mandating its submission by avoiding any discussion of federal funding figures            The Congress and Amtrak  s 25 million annual riders expect the Amtrak Board to responsibly and independently work to improve and sustain a safe and efficient passenger railroad  not to dutifully line up behind the reckless policies of the President that appointed them     the letter states        The complete text of the Murray Inouye letter follows     February 18  2005       The Honorable David M  Laney  Chairman  Board of Directors  National Railroad Passenger Corporation  60 Massachusetts Ave  N E   Washington  D C   20002        Dear Chairman Laney        We write to you today having just received your letter dated February 17 and the accompanying reports regarding Amtrak  s financial condition as mandated under Subtitle V of Title 49  United States Code    Each and every year since Amtrak  s creation  the Board of Directors has submitted these reports to Congress  providing us with a vital and independent assessment of Amtrak  s Federal subsidy needs for the coming fiscal year   That is  until this year          This year  s report as submitted by a largely new Board deliberately evades the question of the railroad  s subsidy needs and instead praises the President  s irresponsible proposal to bankrupt Amtrak as   the right message      Such an approach undermines Congress  s ability to assess Amtrak  s needs and is a disservice to the Corporation that you are charged with governing   The law mandating these reports calls on the Amtrak Board to   submit recommendations for legislation  including the amount of financial assistance needed for operations and capital improvements    and every one of your predecessor Boards has done so   In just two weeks  the Congress is scheduled to begin drafting a Budget Resolution for the coming fiscal year   By not submitting a grant request prior to our budget considerations  you deliberately leave uncontested the Administration  s request to eliminate all funding for Amtrak and push the railroad into bankruptcy         These actions on the part of the Board are irresponsible   In fiscal year 2004  some 37 percent of all of Amtrak  s revenues were derived through Federal grants   By not specifying Amtrak  s federal funding needs to Congress prior to our budget deliberations  the Board is failing to serve as independent stewards of the Corporation  s assets  operations  and employees and is ignoring its legal responsibility to Amtrak  s financial condition   We must question whether these actions are consistent with your fiduciary duties as Directors as stipulated under Title 29 of the Code of the District of Columbia and other applicable laws          The Congress and Amtrak  s 25 million annual riders expect the Amtrak Board to responsibly and independently work to improve and sustain a safe and efficient passenger railroad    not to dutifully line up behind the reckless policies of the President that appointed them   In explaining why the Board has failed to submit a grant request  your letter states that the Board is going through a   strategic planning process    and that a grant request might be submitted   as the planning process permits      No date is supplied as to when  if ever  this grant request might be forthcoming   We must respectfully point out that Amtrak  s Board has often engaged in critical planning processes regarding the railroad  s operations and infrastructure  but such endeavors have never kept any prior Board from submitting a grant request        We hope that  in the future  the Amtrak Board will be attentive to these responsibilities so that we can all work cooperatively toward a sound rail transportation policy for the nation                                                                     Sincerely           Patty Murray                                                                            Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Transportation  Treasury
