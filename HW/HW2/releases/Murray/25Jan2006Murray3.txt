                                                         Murray  Statement by Senator Murray on the Confirmation of Judge Alito  01 25 2006                                                                                                                    News Release          Statement by Senator Murray on the Confirmation of Judge Alito    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  January 25  2006         Mr  President  I rise today to discuss how I will vote on the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito  Jr  to the U S  Supreme Court        After meeting with Judge Alito  studying his record  and comparing his answers to my criteria for judicial nominees  I have decided to vote against confirming Judge Samuel Alito  Jr  as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court        The next justice will have the power to change the Court  change the country  and change our rights for generations   Judge Alito has a very troubling record   In his hearing and in our private meeting  he did not show he will be an independent judge who will uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans   With our rights and freedoms on the line  I will not take a chance on Judge Alito because I have serious questions about his independence and commitment to protecting our rights and liberties        As with past nominees  I evaluated this nominee based on my long standing criteria  which asks   Is the nominee qualified  ethical and honest   Will the nominee be fair  evenhanded and independent  And will the nominee uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans        Personally  I got involved in politics because of another Supreme Court nomination    that of Clarence Thomas   At the time  I was frustrated that average Americans did not have a voice in a process that affects them so much   I ve worked to be the voice of working families in my state   I ve asked the questions they would ask  and I m voting to protect their interests        I recognize the significance of a seat on the United States Supreme Court   The Constitution directs Senators to provide advice and consent on all judicial nominees  and the people of Washington state have trusted me to be their advocate and to safeguard their rights as I vote on judicial nominees   I take that responsibility very seriously   That s why I ve reviewed Judge Alito s past writings  studied his answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee  and asked to meet with him in my office        A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous grant of unchecked power   If the Supreme Court rules incorrectly  there is no option for appeal   There is no backstop   Any seat on the Supreme Court can affect our rights for generations   But there are three factors involved in this particular nomination that make it even more significant   Those factors are the times  the seat  and the process       The Times    First  I am well aware that we are living in historic times   Each day it seems the rights of the individuals and the power of government are being tested   We are at war overseas  we face threats from terrorism at home  and the current Administration is pushing the bounds of governmental power in remarkable ways   The Bush Administration has arrested U S  citizens and held them without access to the courts   It has run secret prisons around the world   It has expressed views on torture that put our own troops at risk   And  as we recently learned  the Administration has been spying on American citizens without prior approval from a court         These are grave issues which will likely come before the Supreme Court   How the Court rules will affect the rights of citizens  the balance of power between the branches of our government  and the balance of power between citizens and our government   So as I make my decision on this nominee  I am mindful of the historic times we are living in and the serious questions the Supreme Court will address in the coming years       The Seat    Second  I am very mindful of the seat that is open on the Supreme Court and its significance       Justice Sandra Day O Connor was a pioneer in the field of law and justice  and her decisions will shape the lives of the American people for generations to come   As I said when she announced her resignation  we live in a better America due to her 24 years of service on the Court   Justice O Connor was often a swing vote on critical decisions   Her successor could easily change the balance of power on the Court  which could dramatically shift the Court s rulings on so many issues   Because this is a swing seat that could tip the Court s balance of power  we need to make sure that the person we confirm is someone who will protect our rights and liberties        Some have suggested that I should just  go along  and support the President s nominee   That is not the way I make decisions  I have criteria that I use to evaluate all judicial nominees  and Judge Alito is no different       The Process    Third  I am also well aware of how Judge Alito came to be the President s nominee   The President had nominated his counsel  Harriet Miers  to the high court  but Ms  Miers was not acceptable to the right wing of the President s party   I found it very interesting that before her nomination  Republicans were demanding an  up or down  vote on the Senate floor for anyone the President nominated   But when President Bush nominated Ms  Miers  suddenly we stopped hearing the urgent call for an  up or down  vote   In fact  Ms  Miers  nomination was killed by the President s own party  apparently because she did not meet the ideological test of the extreme right         I recount this history not to diminish Judge Alito  but to point out that his nomination comes before the Senate in the context of an ideological battle created by the right wing   When the President nominated Judge Alito  the right wing cheered  confident that he will vote their way   That reaction gives me pause as to whether this nominee can keep an open mind on the issues that come before him  If the right wing is so confident he will vote their way  how can we be confident that he will put the country s needs first   That alone does not suggest that Judge Alito cannot be fair  but it did lead me to explore those questions diligently        Given the importance of the Supreme Court and the background of the times  the seat and the process  I began to evaluate how Judge Alito measured up to my standards for judicial nominees        Judge Alito s record contains some disturbing statements  rulings and pronouncements that require detailed explanations   Does he still hold some of those views  In many cases  we don  t know   I wish Judge Alito had been more forthcoming during his hearing    At the same time  many of the things he said    and refused to say    spoke volumes        My Criteria for Judicial Nominees    As I noted earlier  my standards are   Is the nominee qualified  ethical and honest   Will the nominee be fair  evenhanded and independent  And will the nominee uphold the rights and liberties of all Americans        I am comfortable that Judge Alito is qualified  honest and ethical   Whether he will be fair and evenhanded is another question   As was discussed at his hearing  he has a troubling record of voting for the government and corporations and against individuals   He seems to favor the entrenched power over the little guy   His record does not give me the confidence that everyone who comes before the Court will be treated fairly        I am also deeply concerned about Judge Alito s independence   We rely on our courts as a critical check and balance against government abuse   That independent check helps to protect our rights   This is especially important today because of the growing questions about the expansion of executive power   The Supreme Court will need to evaluate whether recent executive actions are constitutional   Here  Judge Alito s unbalanced  minority view of the scope of executive power tells me he does not have the independence to be an adequate check on government abuse of our rights        Finally  I have serious doubts that Judge Alito will uphold our rights and liberties   One example is his hostility to the right to privacy   In the hearings  he refused to say that Roe v  Wade is  settled law   and he did not adequately explain his 1985 statement that the  Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion         Last year  when I voted to confirm Chief Justice John Roberts  I said I was choosing hope instead of fear  and that Judge Roberts  through his answers  inspired such hope   Judge Alito    through his writings  rulings and non answers    does not inspire confidence in me that he will protect all our rights   Because so much is on the line and because I do not believe he will be sufficiently independent or will uphold our rights and liberties  I will respectfully vote against his confirmation to the Supreme Court
