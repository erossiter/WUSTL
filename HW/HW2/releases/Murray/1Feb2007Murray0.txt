                                                                                      News Release          Healthcare  Senator Murray Warns the President s Health Proposals Could Do More Harm Than Good    For Immediate Release  Thursday  February 1  2007             Washington  D C      Today U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  spoke on the Senate floor to respond to several healthcare proposals that President Bush mentioned in his State of the Union address          Senator Murray warned that his plan could undermine the employer based health insurance system  push people into the expensive individual insurance market  fail to provide coverage for our most vulnerable  and divert funds for the health care safety net to experimental programs        The President is finally bringing some ideas to the table and saying he wants to be part of the solution   I thank him for joining the debate  and I hope he s serious about working with us to address the challenges that have only gotten worse over the past 7 years   Senator Murray said      Senator Murray cited the example of a Washington state resident who has faced serious challenges getting health insurance       Senator Murray s remarks follow     Mr  President  I rise today to discuss the health care proposals that President Bush mentioned in his State of the Union address last week          For too long  as working families and businesses have struggled with rising costs and shrinking access  Washington  D C  has virtually ignored the healthcare crisis   Now  with Democrats in control of Congress  the President is finally bringing some ideas to the table and saying he wants to be part of the solution   I thank him for joining the debate  and I hope he s serious about working with us to address the challenges that have only gotten worse over the past 7 years        There may well be valuable ideas in his proposals   I want to get more details than we heard in the speech because there could be areas where we can agree          However  from what I  ve seen of the President  s plan so far  I have serious concerns that his initiatives will          Undermine the employer based health insurance system       Push people into the risky and expensive individual insurance market       Fail to provide coverage for our most vulnerable       And divert funds for the health care safety net to experimental programs       1  Could Jeopardize Employer based Health Insurance    My first concern is that that President s proposal will jeopardize the employer based health insurance system   The most stable form of health insurance for America  s working families is through their employers   155 million Americans receive health insurance from an employer          One of the primary reasons why employers offer health insurance to their workers is because these benefits are excluded from taxable income   But the President  s proposal would take away this incentive by putting all forms of health insurance on an equal playing field        Even if employers choose not to drop health care coverage  they may be forced to do so in the future as the healthiest employees drop out of their employer  s plans   If insurance becomes unaffordable  employers may be forced to stop offering health care benefits    I think many of my colleagues agree with me that we should be strengthening the employer based health insurance system  not taking steps to jeopardize it         2  Individual Insurance Market    Second  I m concerned that the President  s proposal will push people into the individual insurance market   When workers can  t get coverage through their employer  they will need to purchase health insurance in the individual insurance market   But as any small businessman or self employed woman will tell you  the individual insurance market today is not a good alternative to employer provided coverage            In many states  insurers can cherry pick applicants to avoid enrolling those with high health needs  or insurance companies can sell different policies to high and low risk individuals   If you have a chronic disease like diabetes    or even any prior health problem    good luck getting reasonably priced  comprehensive coverage in the individual market   Any proposal to increase access to health insurance should support the ability of Americans to receive affordable and comprehensive coverage    not force people into expensive  bare bones insurance plans       3  No Help for the Uninsured    Third  I m troubled that the President  s proposal will not increase access to health insurance for the uninsured   We have 46 million uninsured men  women and children in this country   This is a staggeringly high number  and these people face daily challenges trying to avoid getting sick and going into debt when something unexpected happens   Every day  I hear from people in my home state of Washington who struggle to pay for their health care costs          Unfortunately  President Bush  s proposal won  t help these people because they don  t pay enough money in taxes to benefit from this tax deduction   This makes me question whether the President  s plan will actually reduce the number of uninsured Americans         4  Undermines the Health Care Safety Net    Finally  I am very concerned that the President  s plan that will further chip away at our health care safety net   It would divert critical Medicaid dollars into an experimental grant program   Although we don  t have a lot of details yet  he is proposing to use Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments to give states the ability to experiment with health care reform          These DSH payments keep the doors of our public hospitals open   Public hospitals are the foundations of our communities   They not only provide emergency care  but they train doctors  support rural health care  and are the first lines of defense against pandemic flu and bioterror attacks   I am very concerned that this proposal could seriously jeopardize my state  s Medicaid funds  and therefore undermining these critical services       Wesley s Experience    Mr  President  I want to give an example of how these proposals could exacerbate the worst parts of our health insurance system   Last week  I received a letter from Alice and Michael Counts  constituents of mine from Vancouver  Washington   Their son  Wesley  was diagnosed with a kidney condition at age 16   Their family  s personal health insurer insisted that his kidney disease was pre existing  and the insurer refused to pay for the medical tests diagnosing his condition          Although his parents appealed to the Insurance Commissioner and won  the insurer raised its rates far beyond the reach of a self employed individual   Later  when Wesley was going through dialysis and a kidney transplant  his employer dropped insurance coverage because it was too costly          Throughout all these medical and financial ups and downs  Wesley has worked and graduated from Clark College   And thankfully  his parents have been able to help him navigate a healthcare system that has failed him    Wesley s parents wrote to me         We would rather pay higher taxes that give everyone affordable health care than live with the fear of losing everything through catastrophic illness         Mr  President  Wesley  s story shows just how risky the individual market is  and how people with serious health problems can be severely affected when an employer is forced to drop coverage   No patient should have to live in fear that his next dialysis treatment won  t be covered by his insurance          What Wesley deserves    and what other Americans deserve    is access to affordable  dependable  and comprehensive health care   The President s plan doesn t guarantee that   It doesn t even come close   It just makes the health insurance market more unstable and more risky and leaves people like Wesley more vulnerable   He deserves better than that  I think all Americans do       We Need a Real Health Care Debate    So as I said at the beginning of my statement  I welcome the President  s attention to the health care crisis in this country    Last year  we devoted three days    only three days    to health care here on the Senate floor   The President probably spent even less time talking about health care    so this is an improvement   We desperately need a serious and thoughtful debate about how to increase access to health insurance         We Have Health Care Solutions    My colleagues and I have put forth a number of good ideas about how to increase access to health care          One of the first things we can do is reauthorize and strengthen the State Children  s Health Insurance Program   SCHIP provides quality health care to millions of uninsured children  and Congress should give states the funding and flexibility to cover more kids        Second  we need to fund community health centers so they can continue to provide quality health care to the uninsured         Third  I agree with the President that we should help states devise new ways to increase access to health care   My home state of Washington  like many others  is working on innovative initiatives to expand coverage   But we can accomplish this in ways that don  t chip away at the foundation of our public hospitals         And finally  we can expand health insurance for small businesses and the self employed by creating federal and state catastrophic cost pools in ways that will lower costs and still protect patients          I look forward to working with Chairmen Kennedy and Baucus  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  and the President on real health care reform   There are people like Wesley across the country  in each of our states  who are crying out for change  and we owe it to them to finally make the progress that is long overdue
