problems with Sea Tac Airport s runway safety technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       For Immediate Release  Thursday  May 10  2007     Washington  D C     Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  chaired a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation to explore the FAA s troubled efforts to modernize its air traffic control system while ensuring aviation safety   Senator Murray explored her concerns that certain aspects of the modernization program are encountering cost overruns while not performing as planned   The hearing also focused on the FAA s air safety inspection function and whether the agency s inspection staff is adequately manned  trained  and deployed to address the increasing amount of aircraft maintenance being performed overseas   Administrator Marion Blakey and the Department of Transportation s Inspector General Calvin Scovel testified at the hearing         At the hearing  Senator Murray discussed issues pertaining to Washington state s aviation community including persistent problems with Sea Tac s runway safety technology  ASDE   X      The following is Senator Murray s opening statement    The Subcommittee will come to order          I would like to welcome our witnesses this morning  FAA Administrator Marion Blakey  and   DOT Inspector General Calvin Scovel         Over the next eight years  it is estimated that the number of air passengers will grow by 40 percent   That s good news for our country   It s also good news for my region because we build the best airplanes in the world  and we are a gateway to our biggest trading partners in Asia        But all those new aircraft will do little to expand our economy if we don t have a modern air traffic control system to move those planes safely and with maximum efficiency   If we fail to modernize that system    and soon    it will not just be a drag on the economy of my region   It will be a drag on the global economy        Unfortunately  we are years behind in this effort   We are years behind because  just three years ago  the Bush Administration and Administrator Blakey successfully advocated a cut to our annual investment in air traffic modernization funding by more than  400 million   And the program has been funded roughly at that reduced level every year since   That represents a loss of more than  1 2 billion from the baseline we established back in 2004           We are years behind because  well over a decade ago  the FAA s modernization effort got seriously derailed as the agency wasted billions of dollars in a failed effort known as the Advanced Automation System          That debacle was characterized by the FAA constantly changing its requirements and throwing good money after bad through undefined open ended contracts   Today  in 2007  we are still paying to replace systems that were slated to be fixed in the 80 s and the 90 s as part of that failed effort          Back then  the FAA was not up to the task of rapidly and efficiently modernizing the system   I worry that the FAA may still not be up to the task today        Just last month  Administrator Blakey gave a speech that included the following passage           It stings when I listen to criticisms about the FAA that are based on something that happened ten or twenty or thirty years ago  In the last few years  we have achieved enormous management efficiencies and at the end of FY 2006  97 percent of our major capital projects were on time and on budget          The Administrator has made similar statements before several House and Senate Committees        I don t disagree with the Administrator that things have improved since the  bad old days  of the Advanced Automation System   But I do question whether it is appropriate or accurate to claim that the overwhelming majority of FAA s capital projects are progressing along just fine          Part of my goal for this morning s hearing is to scratch under the surface of that claim   From my perspective  we still see too many examples where the FAA has         signed contracts with undefined requirements        encountered sizeable cost overruns that get handed  right to taxpayers        purchased equipment that could not provide all the functions promised  and       failed to produce all the operating savings promised          I am not talking about examples from ten  twenty or thirty years ago   I am talking about examples in the last five years   I m talking about programs that we are paying for right now  And I m talking about programs for which the Administrator is seeking more money in 2008          So how can we have all these procurement delays and cost overruns   but have the FAA claiming that almost all of its programs are  on time and on budget             The answer lies in a process known as  re baselining    This is a process required by OMB for major procurements throughout the government   When a program appears to be exceeding its targeted costs   or failing to deliver its intended product   an agency is required to re baseline the program   That means the agency must re estimate the cost  the schedule and benefits  and decide if it still makes sense to move forward            As we will hear from the Inspector General  the FAA has been required to re baseline a significant number of programs because of substantial cost overruns and schedule slips          Let me be clear   I do not question that the FAA did the right thing in re baselining these programs   What I do question is whether the agency is being honest with the system users  the Congress  and taxpayers  when it establishes a new higher cost estimate  a later delivery date  or a     a weaker performance goal   and then continues to proclaim proudly that the program is  on time  and  on budget           As the IG says in his formal testimony  this re baselining process explains why the Wide Area Augmentation System according to the FAA s logic is still on budget  even though its costs have grown from  892 million to over  3 billion since 1998         That s right   A program that has experience cost growth of 233 percent is still considered to be  on budget  by the FAA   And this is yet another program that will not produce all the benefits originally promised   But that s how the Administrator can claim that 97 percent of her major capital programs are doing just fine           Things are not all  on track  at the FAA        Let me share of a few examples of programs the FAA has re baselined  but still considers on time and on budget        There s the Integrated Terminal Weather System   costs have grown by  10 million and the schedule has been extended by nearly 6 years   Yet the FAA Administrator says they re  on time and on budget   I think taxpayers would disagree         Or look at the ASR 11 radars   Instead of installing 112  they ve slashed it down to just 66 units and the schedule has been extended by 4 years   That doesn t sound like a programs that s  on track  to me      ASDE X   Another very worrisome case of this re baselining process has been the so called ASDE X program          This program is designed to address perhaps the greatest safety threat in our current commercial aviation system   runway incursions   It is designed to ensure that aircraft operating on the ground don t collide with other planes or vehicles on the airfield           These aren t hypothetical threats   Just this past summer  two aircraft at O Hare missed each other by 35 feet    As the Administrator knows  improved measures to prevent runway incursions has been on the National Transportation Safety Board s  most wanted  list since 2001          This program was re baselined in September 2005   As part of that process  the FAA substantially changed its goals and reduced the number of airports to be served by 25 percent          The FAA also admitted that the cost of the program had grown from roughly  500 to  550 million and that the completion date would slip from 2007 to 2011   Ever since that re baselining took place  this program has been declared as being  on time  and  on budget           In Administrator Blakey s formal testimony  she points out with pride that the FAA installed five of these systems in 2006   She fails to mention  however  that the Agency s schedule called for seven systems to be installed that year          Today  the IG will report to us that  since that initial re baselining  the program s costs have grown by another  100 million and the program has gotten further behind schedule   Even more disturbing  the IG will testify that  at present  the new systems are not delivering the safety benefits that were promised          Central to the FAA s decision to pursue this program was the plan to install new software upgrades that would greatly improve the equipment s ability to warn controllers of impending collisions between aircraft operating on converging runways         Example  SeaTac s Faulty ASDE X   For my region of the country  the upgrades are necessary so that the equipment can perform in rainy and foggy conditions   But controllers at SeaTac Airport tell me that when it rains  they observe so many false targets and hear so many false alarms that they have to turn the system down to its most limited setting and use just 10 percent of it s capability          It is precisely when the weather is bad that this technology is needed the most   But instead of getting the service they were promised  on foggy days  the controllers have to send out a vehicle to the end of the runway to see whether the target they see on the ASDE screen is a real aircraft  or just another false target          Every time they have a false target or false alarm  the controllers have to fill out reports   And in just the last 15 months  they have filled out more than 480 reports  including 25 false alarms   That is more than 30 reports every month   roughly one false target or alarm for every day of operation   And many incidents go unreported because the controllers just get tired of filling out the forms          You don t have to use that airport every week   like I do   to know that in the Pacific Northwest we get a lot of rain   Madam Administrator  it shouldn t be a surprise to the FAA that safety technologies that don t work in the rain do not provide safety in my part of the country          Right now  the FAA is struggling to get all those functions to work   Hopefully  the FAA will succeed   But  in the meantime  the rising costs are being passed right along to the taxpayer          That is because  once again  according to the IG  the FAA s contract with the vendor does not have all the necessary taxpayer safeguards in place   The contract has a number of undefined requirements that are allowing costs to pile up  while the system struggles to perform as promised      I am not talking about a contract from twenty years ago  I am talking about a contract that is less than two years old            It is important to point out that these problems persist at the FAA at the same time that Congress is considering legislation to substantially alter how the FAA is funded   I view my mission as part of this reauthorization process to ensure that this Subcommittee continues to exercise appropriate oversight and budgetary control           These ongoing procurement problems at the FAA must not escape notice    Elected officials must continue to have the opportunity to withhold or redirect funding when the agency is not performing   Back during the failed Advanced Automation System  it was this subcommittee that began withholding funds long before the FAA was prepared to recognize the extent of their failure          Continuing budgetary oversight is essential  whether we are talking about funds that are directly appropriated or funds that are borrowed under the Administration s new proposed borrowing authority           I want to be clear   The role of this Subcommittee is not just to cut budgets when funds are being wasted   To the contrary  in many critical aviation areas  this Subcommittee has taken the lead in funding initiatives well before the FAA has decided that they are a priority          Let me give some examples   For three of the last six years  this Subcommittee has included funding well above the President s request to boost the number of FAA s air safety inspectors          As the IG will testify this morning  the FAA still has a long way to go to ensure that the FAA s  safety inspection force is adequately trained and deployed to deal with the growing amount of major aircraft maintenance that is being conducted oversees          The FAA has been losing air safety inspectors to retirement at a very rapid rate   If this Subcommittee had not provided funding above the Administration s request for these inspectors  the situation would be more dire than it is today          Similarly  the Administrator has requested funds in her 2008 budget for both the ADS B program and the SWIM program   These are critically important technologies that are needed if we are really going to launch the next generation of air traffic modernization          They are also two programs where this Subcommittee has provided resources before the Administration ever got around to asking for them   As a result  these programs are farther along today because the Subcommittee rejected the Administration s budget request and funded them on our own           So I look forward to discussing with the Administrator  not just how this Subcommittee will have control to stop wasteful programs but also how this Subcommittee will have the ability  under this new funding regime  to add funds that the Agency desperately needs        The need to modernize our air traffic control system could not be more urgent   We have lost precious time and precious dollars   But given the daunting cost and urgency of this challenge  we must not throw dollars at programs without adequate oversight or fiscal controls          We must make sure that the taxpayer is getting what it pays for  and we have to quit saying that all programs performing well when they are not   I look forward to working with the Administrator to make air traffic control modernization a near term reality  and I know that my ranking member Senator Bond does as well
