                   U S  Senator Patty Murray   Murrays Addresses Washington Workforce Association                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Murray  Murrays Addresses Washington Workforce Association  03 03 2005                                                                                                                    News Release          Murrays Addresses Washington Workforce Association    For Immediate Release  Thursday  March 3  2005       I want to thank the Washington Workforce Association for their leadership and ongoing commitment to the long term economic prosperity of the Pacific Northwest   I also want to thank our state workforce board  and congratulate them on being honored this week by the National Association of Workforce Boards   I know your Chair  David Harrison is here with us  as is Executive Director  Ellen O  Brien Saunders        And I want to welcome our friends from Oregon and California who are here with us today   It  s really great to see all of you here in Washington  DC         You know  it  s very timely and appropriate that we  re here today in the hearing room of the US Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions   Because  today no one argues with the idea that American prosperity and long term economic security depend in large part on a highly skilled workforce   And it  s clear that  together  we must act strategically and aggressively to maintain a comprehensive  relevant  and easily accessible workforce investment system        Today  I  d like to talk to you about how we can continue to work together to make that happen   I  d like to talk about the prospects for congressional reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act  WIA   But first  I  d like to talk briefly about the impact of the president  s proposed budget cuts on workers and businesses          You and I know the importance of a system that creates good jobs while providing the types of skilled workers businesses need to remain globally competitive        Unfortunately  not everyone in Washington  DC  shares that vision   In fact  you  re in Washington  DC  at a very critical time for the programs we all care about  The president  s budget for FY   06 would sharply reduce or eliminate the funding available to educate and train our workers         And his proposal to consolidate federal job training programs would be a cruel bait and switch for America  s workers   He would cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding    yet he claims you could train twice as many workers if you were only more efficient with your money        But I know you are already serving twice as many workers in our WorkSource centers around our state  with far fewer resources than in the past   And I understand the demand for these training and re employment services keeps increasing         I also know federal funding cuts over the last couple of years have prevented thousands of workers in Washington state from receiving the training they need to secure the good paying jobs available in our state        And I  m aware that these proposed cuts and consolidations could not come at a worse time for workers in the Pacific Northwest         In Washington state we have lost tens of thousands of good paying manufacturing jobs over the last four years  Our state  s unemployment rate has been among the highest in the nation over the last four years   And we know that 75  of our current workers will need to be retrained just to maintain the jobs they have   Yet this Administration continues to propose cuts to programs that are vital to maintaining a skilled workforce and a good quality of life         These proposed cuts and changes to our federal job training programs also come at a time when the Workforce Investment Act is just beginning to hit its stride   I know because I  ve traveled across Washington state over the last year and I  ve seen firsthand the critical partnerships you  re forging between businesses  labor  community colleges and our workforce development councils         Let me give you just two examples   Last summer I was in Southwest Washington meeting with representatives from Clark College to discuss their new Advanced Center for Transportation Technology   This state of the art facility will help train truck drivers  railworkers  supply chain logistics professionals  as well as other high demand workers  for good careers           And just last week I visited the Tacoma Pierce County Workforce Development Council to help launch Washington  s In Demand Scholarship Program  This unique partnership between the Washington Workforce Association  the Washington State Labor Council and the Association of Washington Business will help train qualified and enthusiastic workers  Both of these partnerships will allow our businesses in Washington State to grow and remain globally competitive  and will provide young workers with the family wage jobs they need to stay and raise their families in the Pacific Northwest        So you  ve given me the success stories and the support I need in Washington  DC  to fight for funding and flexibility at the state and local level  And  this week  the General Accountability Office  GAO  will provide you with even more evidence that WIA is working   They  ll release the results of a survey which clearly demonstrates that employers find real value in the services provided by the Workforce Investment Act          But  even though we know WIA is working  the truth is we need your energy  your hard work  and your determination because we still face significant challenges in reauthorizing it   As you know  in the 108th Congress we were able to work in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate to craft a bill that struck the right balance between the needs of stakeholders like business  labor  community colleges and the state and local workforce systems        The Senate  s version of the WIA reauthorization bill       would have protected the role of local boards and elected officials in areas that are performing well  while allowing for change in those areas with low performance      it would have maintained the existing funding streams for adults  dislocated workers  youth and Wagner Peyser     it would have encouraged innovative strategies for business  including the expanded use of incumbent and customized worker training      and it also would have reduced the number and type of reporting requirements to provide more flexibility for states       So I believe that the Senate version of the WIA reauthorization bill made some very important improvements to our federal job training system    without throwing the baby out with the bathwater   I  d like to see a similar bill this year   But I know that depends on you   You get much of the credit for letting us know just what your needs were  and I  m counting on you to do that again this time around        You  re on the front lines and you have the enormously important and difficult job of responding to the needs of thousands of laid off and unemployed workers in the Pacific Northwest who want good jobs   You  ve truly done a great job  and I want to tell you today that I  m proud to have a relationship with all of you        I look forward to continuing to work together    both during the reauthorization of WIA and in the appropriations process   I know that we can build a comprehensive education and workforce investment system that meets the needs of all Americans  and I  m going to continue to be your partner in the United States Senate
