secure cargo  and safeguard American lives and the U S  economy     For Washington state  passage means security grants for Washington s ports  new regional coordination center  new radiation detection equipment and Customs personnel  and a new system to keep Washington s trade dependent economy moving    For Immediate Release  Thursday  September 14  2006     Washington D C      Today the U S  Senate passed landmark cargo security legislation authored by U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  that will dramatically improve the security of America s ports and cargo container system   Murray s bill passed by a vote of 98 0   Senator Murray has spearheaded the effort to protect America s ports since the terrorist attacks of September 11th   She spent the past week on the Senate floor managing debate on her bill          Today we have taken a giant step to improve the safety of ports in Washington and across the country   said Senator Murray    By raising security standards and investing in cargo security  we will close a dangerous security gap and keep our country safe          The bipartisan bill  which Murray introduced with Senator Susan Collins  R ME            raises security standards for all cargo entering the U S         creates a GreenLane to track and monitor cargo        creates a system to resume trade after an incident        and funds port security grants         For Washington state  the bill will provide new security grants for Washington s ports  a new regional coordination center  new radiation detection equipment at the Port of Tacoma  new Customs personnel for Seattle Tacoma  and a new system to keep Washington s trade dependent economy moving            Because our state relies so heavily on the trade that flows through our ports  we are uniquely susceptible to a devastating and economically crippling attack   said Murray   The legislation passed today effectively pushes out our security borders  allowing us to detect tampered cargo long before it enters our ports   This bill also takes into consideration our state s unique trade needs by providing security measures that won t impede the flow of commerce           Today s vote marks the culmination of a five year effort by Senator Murray to implement cargo security measures at our nation s ports  Beginning after the attacks of September 11th with Senator Murray s Operation Safe Commerce program to enhance port  cargo and supply chain security  Murray had been steadfast in her dedication to port security   The legislation passed today is a result of Murray s collaboration with Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chair  Senator Susan Collins  D ME   Senator Murray approached Senator Collins over a year ago to work on a bill to protect America s ports  Together  they introduced the GreenLane Maritime Security Act       Specifically  Murray s legislation will      Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability        Help prevent a lengthy shutdown of America s seaports in the event of an incident    protecting America s economy from severe disruption        Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient        Push the borders out so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo       The bill improves security at America s ports by establishing     The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures        Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs        The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures   regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies        Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level        The Act also authorizes port security grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT          Next  the Senate bill must be reconciled with the House version and both chambers must approve the final bill before it can be sent to the President for his signature      Senator Murray has worked on today s legislation since the attacks of September 11th  The following is a summary of her efforts leading up to today s passage                                                         TIMELINE  Post September 11  2001   Senator
