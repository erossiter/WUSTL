WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Robert Menendez    D NJ  introduced legislation to address the intergenerational   challenges faced by many New Jerseyans forced to balance the   cost of paying for their children  s college education with   the need to support their elderly family members   The two bills    which are similar to measures he introduced in the House of   Representatives and are now the first legislation he has   introduced in the Senate  would expand tax credits for   caregivers and make college more accessible and affordable for   students          As a son helping to care for a mother with   Alzheimer  s disease and the proud parent of two college   age kids  I know personally the intergenerational demands   families are facing and the sacrifices they are making to care for   their loved ones     Menendez said     That  s   exactly why my first legislative initiatives in the United States   Senate are to make higher education and long term care more   affordable and more accessible for New Jersey families and   families across the country          The Caregiver Assistance and Relief Effort  CARE  Act would   provide tax credits to people caring for ailing family members   and loved ones and encourage individuals to plan and invest in   their own long term care by offering a tax deduction for long   term insurance   In addition  it would double the funding for the   existing National Family Caregiver Support Program  which   supports a wide range of important services for older persons          Caregiving families face unique strains   Their   compassion  dedication  and selflessness come at a price  and   this legislation is aimed at addressing their hard work and   sacrifice     Menendez said       The College Access and Affordability Act will expand and   increase the HOPE tax credit  which currently provides a  1500   tax credit to families with children in college   The HOPE credit   was enacted in 1997  but has not been increased to account for   the rising costs of tuition   Furthermore  it is only available for   the first two years of college  is reduced for taxpayers who earn   more than  43 000 and is not available for taxpayers who earn   over  53 000         By targeting families making the national median income of   approximately  43 000  it leaves out thousands of middle class   families in New Jersey  where the median income level is over    58 000        The College Access and Affordability Act will increase the size of   the existing HOPE Tax Credit and make it available to more New   Jerseyans by           Increasing the HOPE Tax Credit to  2 500        Expanding the HOPE Tax Credit to cover all four years of   college          Raising the income eligibility limits to  68 000   136 000   for joint filers         The bill will also reward college graduates who give back to their   communities and help those communities attract qualified   individuals to public service positions by expanding loan   forgiveness  which is currently available to certain teachers     Many communities are stretched for qualified individuals to   serve as teachers  nurses  firefighters  police and social workers    so the College Access and Affordability Act will ease the loan   burdens of public service employees and attract highly qualified   professionals to critical areas by           Providing loan forgiveness of up to  17 500 over a five   year period          Allowing forgiveness in the first year of service         Extending loan forgiveness to highly qualified teachers in   science  mathematics  special and bilingual education in low   income communities  nurses  first responders  including police    firefighters  and emergency medical technicians in low income   communities  and child social workers         Too many students do not pursue a college education   because they think it is out of their reach     Menendez   said     We must commit to providing sensible tools and   adequate resources so that financing a college education is not   more of a burden on families  and achieving the dreams of a   higher education is not beyond the reach of our nation  s   young people                     The full text of Senator Menendez  s statement follows       Mr  President  I rise today to introduce The Caregiver Assistance   and Relief Effort  CARE  Act and the College Access and   Affordability Act because far too many families today are   squeezed by the demands of caring for aging loved ones while   working to give their children what all parents want for their kids      the opportunity to go to college and be successful   As a son   helping to care for a mother with Alzheimer  s disease and   the proud parent of two college age kids  I know personally the   intergenerational demands families are facing and the sacrifices   they are making to care for their loved ones   That  s   exactly why my first legislative initiatives in the United States   Senate are to make higher education and long term care more   affordable and more accessible for New Jersey families and   families across the country             The CARE Act would provide tax credits to those caring for ailing   family members and loved ones  and encourage individuals to   plan and invest in their own long term care by offering a tax   deduction for long term care insurance   In addition  it would   double the funding for the existing National Family Caregiver   Support Program  which supports a wide range of important   services for older persons         There are an estimated 44 4 million caregivers in the U S   which   is 21 percent of the adult population   My home state of New   Jersey has over 830 000 caregivers  ranking it 9th in the country         Caregiving families face unique strains   They are challenged   with additional costs  and often caregivers must sacrifice their   job or cut back on their hours at work   Almost 6 in 10   caregivers either work or have worked while providing care  and   62 percent of caregivers report having had to make work   related adjustments ranging from going in late and leaving early   to having to give up work entirely   Caregivers are also a   valuable asset to keeping health care costs down   They are   providing  257 billion in care annually  more than double the   annual spending on home care and nursing home care   combined    Their compassion  dedication  and selflessness   come at a price to their families and are a benefit to the greater   good of our state and nation   This legislation is aimed at   addressing their hard work  sacrifice  and contributions to   society       The other bill I  m introducing today  the College Access   and Affordability Act  will help open the doors to higher   education for more young people by making financial assistance   more flexible for students and by expanding and enhancing   existing financial aid options         I know the difference a college education can have on a young   person  s life   As the first in my family to go to college    and later law school  I had opportunities that would not have   been available to me had I not been able to go to college   But   financing a higher education was not an easy thing for my   family   Federal financial aid helped ensure that I could go to   college and that I could pursue my dreams   I know first hand   the important benefits of receiving federal aid    not only   did it help me finance my dreams of college  but it also gave me   the extra confidence that I needed to succeed         So  Mr  President  I am committed to ensuring that other   promising young people get the same chance that I did and that   we  as a nation  will be there to help everyone in this country   achieve their dreams of college  regardless of background  race    language  or income level   One of the great foundations of this   country is that the doors of opportunity are open to anyone who   works hard   We must follow through on that promise by   providing a path for young people to have access to and attend   college   If we do not lead the way to ensure that our colleges   are full of the brightest minds and fullest potential  we are   failing to prepare our future generations and we are   jeopardizing the future of our nation         The College Access and Affordability Act will make financial aid   more flexible and accessible to more students  such as   extending Pell Grant eligibility to students who attend school   year round   It will also make substantial changes to the Hope   Scholarship Tax Credit  a useful tool in helping cover the costs   of a higher education   Since the Credit was enacted in 1997  the   maximum credit has not increased to reflect the rising cost of   tuition   This bill would raise the award by  1 000 and allow the   credit to be claimed for all four years of college  instead of the   current two years   It will also make more families eligible for the   credit by expanding the eligibility limits         Finally  in recognizing that many of our communities are in need   of qualified individuals to serve in essential public service   positions  this bill would help attract dedicated college   graduates who serve low income communities in positions such   as science  math  bilingual  or special education teachers    nurses  first responders  and child welfare workers       Too many students do not pursue a college education because   they think it is out of their reach   We must commit to providing   sensible tools and adequate resources so that financing a   college education is not more of a burden on families  and   achieving the dreams of a higher education is not beyond the   reach of our nation  s young people      On any given day  families across New Jersey  and indeed  across   this country  face the daunting challenges of making ends meet      putting food on the table  clothing their children  and   putting a roof over their head   If that weren  t enough    add the challenge of trying to pay for college or care for an   aging parent  or in many cases  both  and you have what many   times is an insurmountable challenge   But that  s exactly   what  s happening to more and more people everyday     And the intergenerational demands will only increase as the   baby boom generation grows older and our life expectancy   increases   We need to work now to address the challenges on   both fronts    from providing affordable long term care   and encouraging future retirees to plan for their own long term   care  to ensuring that anyone who is willing to work hard has the   opportunity to go to college and succeed   That  s what   this country is all about  and that  s why I  ve made   these initiatives my first priorities in the U S  Senate   I  m   hopeful that we will be able to work in a bipartisan fashion to   address these important challenges facing American families
