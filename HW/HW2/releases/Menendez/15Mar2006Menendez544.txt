 March 15  2006      WASHINGTON    In a speech to the Center for   American Progress  United States Senators Robert Menendez   today outlined a plan to strengthen security at the nation  s ports   by developing an international program to ensure that 100   percent of containers entering the nation through ports are   scanned for weapons of mass destruction   He will offer an   amendment to the federal budget  which is being considered by   the Senate today  to take the first step in that plan by increasing   port security funding for the next fiscal year by nearly a billion   dollars          If we could roll back the clock ten years and spend a few   billion dollars to raise the levies in New Orleans to be able to   withstand a Category 5 hurricane  we could have saved hundreds   of lives  as well as the billions of dollars it will take to rebuild   that city     Menendez said in the speech     I don  t want this   country to look back in hindsight a few years from now with the   realization that had we spent a few billion dollars to improve the   security at our ports  we could have prevented a major terrorist   attack         Menendez  s amendment will provide  965 million for port   security to fund technology capable of scanning containers for   weapons of mass destruction  increase the number of inspectors   available to physically review containers  help developing   countries scan and inspect containers  and triple port security   grants          When it comes to port security  we need to do more than   think outside the box   We also need to think inside the   container     Menendez said        The bottom line today is that we don  t know what is inside   the vast majority of containers entering this country  because   despite repeated warnings from security experts from both   within and without our government  ninety five percent receive   no inspection  other than a cursory review of the cargo   manifest     he said      Menendez also called for passage of legislation he has   introduced with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to ban   companies owned by foreign governments from controlling   operations at U S  ports          It simply runs contrary to the national security interest of   this country to turn over control of critical security assets such   as port operations to a foreign nation     he said      The Senate is expected to vote on Menendez  s amendment   to increase port security funding on Tuesday        The full text of Menendez  s remarks and a detailed   summary of the amendment are below       Ports  Politics and Priorities  A Common Sense Plan to   Strengthen our Security  Senator Robert Menendez  Remarks to the Center for American Progress  As prepared for delivery  March 14  2005     A little over a month ago  Americans began to pay attention   to a barely noticed merger that had previously been followed   only by a few business reporters and industry analysts  Almost   overnight  the bid by Dubai Ports World  a company owned by   the government of Dubai  burst into the national consciousness   as the media  members of Congress  and an angry public began   to ask questions about both the company  s plan to take control   of operations at six major U S  ports and the process by which   the Bush administration approved it      In the month since that transaction leapt onto the front   pages of the nation  s newspapers  Americans have been   exposed to story after story about the security or lack thereof  of   our nation  s ports      Problems with Port Security I opposed the DP World transaction for reasons I will   discuss  but whatever your opinion on the merits of the deal  the   failings it exposed in the way our government protects its   citizens from the dangers of a weapon of mass destruction   smuggled through our ports has created a rare opportunity to   fix a system that today relies on a weak security apparatus   largely cobbled together by the hodgepodge of government   agencies and private companies that together bear the   responsibility for securing ports      It is unfortunate of course that it has taken so long for the   country to focus on this debate  but now that the glare of the   spotlight shines brightly on our ports  we must seize the   opportunity to enact reforms that will make us all safer      Each year more than two billion tons of cargo passes   through U S  ports   Jobs at U S ports generate  44 billion in   annual personal income and  16 1 billion in federal  state and   local taxes   The Port of New York and New Jersey  which I   represented for thirteen years in the House and now represent in   the Senate  handled more than  132 billion in goods in 2005    This work takes place every day in cities across the country  yet   it happens without most Americans giving it a single thought     But with everything from toys to food to electronics to cars   passing through our ports  the odds are that if you eat it  wear   it  or drive it  there is a good chance it came through one of our   ports      Unfortunately  the attention the administration has paid to   securing those ports only slightly surpasses the attention most   Americans pay to their existence   And that mistake could bring   deadly consequences      On September 11  2001  nineteen men armed only with   boxcutters turned commercial airplanes designed to transport   people around the country for business or pleasure into the   most deadly weapons of mass destruction ever deployed on   American soil   A few months later  someone turned a common   envelope sent through the mail into a delivery device for a   deadly poison        Those deadly attacks should have taught us the need to be   creative in improving our homeland security   The 9 11   commission told us that to prevent a terrorist attack we had to   think outside the box   If an ordinary envelope could be turned   into a biological weapon and a passenger airplane into a weapon   of mass destruction  then it takes little imagination to see how a   container could be used to transport a nuclear weapon to the   Port of New York New Jersey  or any other sea port  where it   could cause tens of thousands  if not millions  of casualties        When it comes to port security  we need to do more than   think outside the box   We also need to think inside the   container      The bottom line today is that we don  t know what is inside   the vast majority of containers entering this country  because   despite repeated warnings from security experts from both   within and without our government  ninety five percent receive   no inspection  other than a cursory review of the cargo manifest       In 2002  an ABC News team shipped a suitcase containing   15 pounds of depleted uranium from Istanbul  Turkey to New   York  without any detection from any authorities   In 2003  they   tried again  and succeeded again  this time sending 15 pounds   of depleted uranium from Jakarta  Indonesia into the port of Los   Angeles   Even more disturbing than ABC  s report  however  was   the government  s response   instead of investigating how ABC   was able to sneak the uranium through undetected  they instead   attacked ABC and launched an investigation into whether its   reporters had broken any laws        That response is the sort we have come to expect from the   Bush administration on a host of issues   Deny any problems  no   matter the evidence to the contrary   Proclaim that things are   fine  even when they are not   And if anyone stands up and   shows you are wrong  attack them mercilessly      But the demise of the Dubai Ports World transaction shows   that their tried and true strategy to squelch dissent and paper   over their mistakes may be beginning to fail   The American   people now know that our ports are not secure  and even the   administration  s own experts are agreeing        This past weekend  the Associated Press reported on a   study conducted by the Department of Homeland Security that   traced 20 000 containers that arrived in the U S  from Europe    Asia and the Middle East   The study showed that lapses by   private port operators  shipping lines or truck drivers could   allow terrorists to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into   the United States   As the AP reported  the study   undercut    the   administration  s claim that private terminal operators play no   role in port security        That claim was one of the administration  s main selling   points in defending its approval of the DP World transaction     Stewart Baker  the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security  told   the Senate Banking Committee  on which I sit  that private   terminal operators do little more than manage a pier  a crane   and a parking lot   He made this claim even though his own   Department was preparing a study that directly contradicted it        Clearly  terminal operators do have responsibility for a piece   of the security puzzle at ports   Terminal operators develop port   security plans that contain sensitive security information   They   are responsible for securing the perimeter of the terminal and   determining how drivers who move cargo to and from the port   are identified   They conduct security training for dockworkers   and communicate with federal authorities in the event of a   security problem   They are involved in background checks for   their employees  personnel screening  recordkeeping and   identification   They play an essential role in port security      Menendez Government Ownership Legislation That is why I believe Congress needs to pass the legislation   I introduced with Senator Clinton and others at the outset of the   debate over the DP World transaction to ban companies owned   by foreign governments from controlling operations at U S    ports         It simply runs contrary to the national security interest of   this country to turn over control of critical security assets such   as port operations to a foreign nation      The Bush Administration ducked this debate by   disingenuously claiming that there was no difference between   the British company P Ports  and Dubai Ports World   But that   claim is simply wrong on its face  There is a vast difference   between a publicly traded foreign company that answers to   shareholders and a state owned one that answers to a foreign   government        Publicly traded companies exist for one reason  to make   money for their shareholders  and every action they take is   designed to further that goal   Nations  however  act for a variety   of reasons    in some cases to make money through state owned   companies  and in other cases to project power  secure strategic   interests  or defend their own borders  One need only study the   way Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has used his state   owned oil company to further the interests of the government of   Venezuela to understand that state owned companies behave   very differently than publicly traded ones      Nations have no permanent allies or enemies  only   permanent interests   No matter Dubai  s relationship with the   United States  and they have undoubtedly provided crucial   assistance in the war on terror since 2001  it is simply an   abdication of our responsibility as a nation to let them  or any   other foreign government  control the operations at our ports     The terminals they would have acquired are responsible for 40   percent of the equipment sent to our soldiers in Iraq  and even if   Dubai is an ally of ours today  we cannot simply take the chance   that they will continue to be one in the future   If they made the   decision  for whatever reason  to stop allowing supplies to pass   through their terminals  it could have enormous ramifications   for our security        Menendez Port Security Plan But passing that legislation only addresses a potential threat   to our security   We also need to address the existing threat   posed by the porous security system at our ports      As I said earlier  only five percent of containers entering this   country are currently inspected  a number that would shock   most Americans   Even the system that we use to determine   which containers to inspect is riddled with flaws   Customs   inspectors rely on manifests and intelligence data  both of which   can be either unintentionally incorrect or even manipulated  to   develop algorithms that tell them which containers to open      If you  ve ever seen a 90 year old grandmother pulled out of   line for special screening at the airport  you know just how   logical the Department of Homeland Security  s algorithms can   be      We cannot take the risk that complex mathematical   equations relying on faulty inputs will catch a nuclear  chemical   or biological weapon shipped into our ports       We need to create an international inspection system and   international standards that will eventually ensure that 100   percent of containers bound for this country are inspected      either physically or through technological scanning that will find   and detect weapons no matter how they are disguised   That is   why this week in the Senate I  along with Senator Clinton    Lautenberg  Durbin  Boxer  and others  am offering an   amendment to the budget for Fiscal Year 2007 to start us down   the road to 100 percent container scanning  We need to take   advantage of existing technologies that can scan the inside of a   container before it even leaves a foreign port and create a   down loadable image of what  s inside   That image can be   viewed in real time by security officials here in the U S  so we   know exactly what the container holds before it even sets sail for   our shores  By combining this technology with scans for   radioactive materials  we can find dangerous materials before   they arrive in our ports   And by scanning containers that leave   our ports for foreign destinations  along with adopting the   green lane system proposed by Senators Patty Murray and Susan   Collins  we create incentives for other countries to participate         My amendment provides  105 million to operate this dual   technology here in the United States and another  50 million to   help developing countries which may not have the funds to buy   it   In fact  these ports could be the weakest link in our   international port security chain  so we must take extra efforts   to prevent them from becoming easy targets for terrorists   looking for lax security practices        Once containers leave foreign ports  we must also use the   latest technologies to track them as they make their way across   the seas   By investing in seals and monitors that would show   whether a container has been tampered with after it was   scanned and black boxes or GPS trackers that keep track of   containers so we know if a ship stops at an unknown port  we   strengthen another link in the chain      Adoption of this system will not happen overnight  so our   government must set yearly goals both for domestic ports and   the international community and monitor progress until we   reach the goal of 100  inspection      But while we are waiting for this new international scanning   system to become fully operational  we must make sure that we   increase inspections through our existing programs and that we   improve on the ground security at our ports        So my plan also provides  100 million to hire 400   additional inspectors both here and abroad   The General   Accounting Office has pointed out staffing deficiencies as one of   the most pressing problems for the Container Security Initiative    or CSI  the program DHS designed to target and inspect high   risk cargo before it leaves ports  The report specifically noted   that   staffing imbalances    are one of the factors which   limit    Customs    ability to successfully target containers to determine   if they are high risk       and that   as a result  35 percent of U S    bound shipments from CSI ports were not targeted and not   subject to inspection overseas the key goal of the CSI program         The GAO has also found that staffing problems have kept   Customs from validating security information provided by   foreign participants in other security initiatives      My plan will also provide  600 million for the Port Security   Grant program  more than tripling last year  s budget    This   money would do directly to the ports  which sit at the front lines   of the security equation  and would be used to comply with the   requirements of the Maritime Transportation Security Act   For   reasons that defy logic  the administration has proposed that   grants for port security be eliminated entirely  and that they   money previously allocated to ports be instead turned into     Targeted Infrastructure Protection Grants    available to mass   transit  rail and other critical infrastructure sectors  as well as   ports  which means that ports will be forced to compete with   others for scarce resources   While I strongly believe that we   must improve the security of our bus  rail and transit systems    and have introduced legislation to do so  that investment cannot   come at the expense of our nation  s ports  The American   Association of Port Authorities has noted that their   recommendation to double the funds is only a   modest   investment      In fact  doubling these funds would only cover a   little over a third of the Coast Guard  s projected cost of facility   improvements  leaving the remainder to local port authorities as   an unfunded mandate and creating the risk that many would   simply fall by the wayside  I believe we must do better than that       And instead of allocating these grants based on politics    they must be distributed based on risk   The Port of New York   and New Jersey  which is the largest port on the East Coast and   the third largest container port in the country  received about   the same homeland security grant funding last year as the far   smaller Port Memphis        Finally  we need to look beyond current technology and   develop the next generation of equipment   We must make sure   that we have the cutting edge technology to safeguard our   ports  This amendment provides  100 million for research and   development  Up to now  we haven  t focused enough on creating   second generation technologies for non intrusive inspections   which the private sector is unlikely to develop   It  s time for that   to change       To coordinate these disparate programs  we need to create   a Port Security Czar with the responsibility for the different   programs within the Department of Homeland Security as well as   programs at the Departments of Energy and State   Port security   is too important to be bogged down in bureaucratic turf battles    and putting one person in charge will give both the president   and Congress a means of holding agencies accountable for their   success in meeting their annual goals      I want to take just a moment to thank the experts here at   the Center for American Progress who have worked with me and   my staff in developing this plan   Your advice and counsel was   crucial at each step of the process  and I hope you will allow us   to continue to lean on you as we push forward in the legislative   process  I would also like to acknowledge Stephen Flynn at the   Council on Foreign Relations  whose work has influenced my   thinking on this important topic      Strengthening security at our ports will not be cheap  and   given the budgetary challenges our nation faces  every dollar is   hard to come by  but the status quo is unacceptable   An attack   on one of our ports would not just cause a tremendous toll in   loss of life  but would also shut down a port and all of the   economic activity it generates  at a cost of billions of dollars to   our economy        If we could roll back the clock ten years and spend a few   billion dollars to raise the levies in New Orleans to be able to   withstand a Category 5 hurricane  we could have saved hundreds   of lives  as well as the billions of dollars it will take to rebuild   that city   I don  t want this country to look back in hindsight a   few years from now with the realization that had we spent a few   billion dollars to improve the security at our ports  we could   have prevented a major terrorist attack      Who among us would be satisfied in the aftermath of an   attack that we did not take the steps that could have prevented   it because we were unwilling to dedicate the necessary   resources   That is the choice Congress faces  and for the   security of our country  it is essential that we make the right   one      Thank you          Menendez Port Security Amendment The amendment provides  965 million for port security to   increase inspections and put the nation on the road to 100   percent scanning of containers  It would also add funds to   improve existing programs  increase funding for research and   development  and help developing countries improve their   ability to scan and inspect containers   Specifically  it provides          600 million for the existing Port Security Grant   Program  Would triple current level of funding  This   program provides money directly to individual ports  and   experts say that there is a critical need for significantly more   funding of this program   The Administration  s FY2007 budget   eliminates the port security grant program in favor of a     Targeted Infrastructure Protection Grant    which forces ports to   compete for limited resources with mass transit  rail  and other   critical infrastructure sectors         100 million for staffing to increase inspections   and security   Would provide for at least 400 new staff to   increase inspections and improve the system to identify high   risk containers  These funds are specifically for ports   Funding   would help both the C TPAT and CSI programs by increasing the   number of inspectors at foreign ports  The GAO has stated that    as a result of staffing imbalances  35 percent of high risk   containers were not inspected  The GAO also reported that the   security checks performed by Customs and Border Patrol  CPB    are not rigorous enough and that staffing problems have kept   CBP from validating participant  s security information        100 million for Research and Development    It is critical to develop next generation and second generation   technologies  These technologies take us past the scanning   phase and into more finely tuned technologies that can locate   the contraband material in the shipping container   Such   technologies are not likely to be developed by the private sector         105 million for Cargo Imaging and Radiation   Portal Monitors  Would provide funds for both Radiation   Portal Monitors  RPMs  and gamma x ray imaging technologies   to detect radiation and identify high density shielding used to   block radiation emissions        10 million to improve technology to respond to   increased scanning abroad  As we create incentives for   international companies and ports to create a unified system to   scan containers creating downloadable images and for radiation    the US must be able to integrate these new technologies into our   existing scanning and inspection system  These funds would be   to used hire new staff  provide training  and acquire new   technology        50 million to help developing countries scan and   inspect containers  Right now  many developing countries   don  t have the resources or the training to purchase the   necessary equipment to scan containers  We must provide   additional funds to help them put these programs in place  Ports   in these countries are of particular concern  as they could be   targeted by terrorists as weak links in the international port   security system
