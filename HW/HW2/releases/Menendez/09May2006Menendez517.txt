STEM CELL RESEARCH CRITICAL TO FINDING CURES

boast no party affiliation    Calls for end to partisan obstruction   Tuesday  May 9  2006      WASHINGTON    In a statement delivered on the Senate floor  United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today reiterated his strong support for embryonic stem cell research and urged Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist to allow a vote on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  The bill would allow federal support of research that uses human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from a human embryo  thus negating the Bush stem cell policy limitation on   existing stem cell lines          Neither Diabetes  Alzheimer  s  cancer  or Parkinson  s boast a party affiliation     Menendez said    We hold the key to unlock that door  and it is shameful that we have let partisan politics stand in the way of medical progress  We owe it to our parents  our children  and our grandchildren to unlock that door       Menendez joined last week with 38 Senate colleagues in urging the Republican leadership to call a vote on critical stem cell legislation  In a letter to Senator Majority Leader Bill Frist  lawmakers said the legislation  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  would end restrictions currently placed on stem cell research  thereby expanding the hope and promise of finding cures and therapies for spinal cord injuries  Alzheimer  s disease and other illnesses  President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation              The full text of Menendez  s floor statement on stem cell research follows    M  President  today we are in the middle of what is being called   health week    in the United States Senate  but rather than debating important life saving  life enhancing legislation that has bipartisan support and could actually deliver hope and promise to millions of Americans  the Republican leadership in the Senate has instead decided to continue their political posturing  business as usual approach to governing    It  s no wonder the American public has become disillusioned with the leadership in Washington    Instead of debating and passing stem cell legislation that will end suffering and extend lives  we  re again focusing on a partisan proposal to limit patients   options when they  re harmed through medical malpractice    Instead of passing stem cell legislation that will provide new treatments and cures for debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer  s  juvenile diabetes  spinal cord injuries  or cancer  we  re debating a bill that will actually eliminate the health coverage that many states currently provide to cover some of these same diseases    Instead of wasting an entire week debating legislation that has no chance of passing  we owe it to the American people    to the millions of Americans and their families suffering from life altering disabilities and diseases    to demonstrate our nation  s full commitment to finding a cure and doing all that we can to make their hopes and dreams come true    It has been almost one year since the House of Representatives passed the Stem Cell Enhancement Act  and yet  the Senate still has not passed this vital legislation   I rise today to urge the Majority Leader to do the same and bring this important legislation to a vote in the Senate    I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to vote in favor of the bill as a Member of the House  where we had broad  bipartisan support for the proposal   And I believe that same bipartisan support exists in the Senate  which makes it even more difficult to understand why we can  t come together and do something meaningful for those who are suffering    M  President  my support of stem cell research is partially a reflection of my home state  s commitment to innovation and discovery   In 2004  New Jersey became the second state in the nation to enact a law that specifically permits embryonic stem cell research   We know that embryonic stem cells have the unique ability to develop into virtually every cell and tissue in the body    And we know that numerous frozen embryos in fertility clinics remain unused by couples at the completion of their fertility treatments   Why shouldn  t they be allowed to donate those embryos to federal research to save lives   We allow people to donate organs to save lives  why couldn  t a couple  if they so choose  donate their frozen embryos instead of simply discarding them    The great State of New Jersey offers more scientists  engineers and technicians per capita than any other state  and I am proud to represent the innovation and research taking place in New Jersey  Our state is known not only as the Garden State  but also as America  s Medicine Chest  But for our state and our country to continue to compete globally with health care breakthroughs  it is going to take more than just private and state support   It is going to take the support of our nation    it is going to take leadership that looks beyond politics    But  M  President  to me  like countless Americans and New Jerseyans  this issue is about more than our ability to compete as a nation   The promise of stem cell research is painfully personal   It means hope and promise    hope that people like my mother who are suffering from Alzheimer  s disease might one day be cured from the loneliness and confusion caused by this horrible disease  and the promise that future generations of families will not have to see their loved ones enter a world of dementia that robs them of the best years of their lives    We hold the key to unlock that door  and it is shameful that we have let partisan politics stand in the way of medical progress   We owe it to our parents  our children  and our grandchildren to unlock that door    Diabetes  Alzheimer  s  cancer  Parkinson  s    none of these diseases boast a party affiliation  and we can  t let ours keep us from doing what  s right    Today we have an opportunity to do what  s right  and it  s clear that the majority will again let that opportunity pass them by   I will continue to fight  along with many of my colleagues  to see that this bipartisan bill is debated on the Senate floor and becomes law   We can no longer afford to delay this bill when it holds the key to curing some of the most devastating and debilitating diseases of our day   As the bill waits in the wings of the Capitol  children and adults alike wait for the cure they  ve been praying for    This is health week  and what could better demonstrate our commitment to the health of this country than full federal support for embryonic stem cell research   This bill has the potential to make a profound and positive impact on the health of millions of Americans   All we need is the leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote for the humanity of our nation  and for the mothers  fathers  brothers  sisters  sons and daughters across this country who are suffering or watching a loved one suffer    This bill means so much more than ending restrictions placed on stem cell research   This bill means hope and promise to countless Americans   This bill means that all the prayers for cures and therapies for spinal cord injuries  Alzheimer  s disease  diabetes  Parkinson  s  cancer and countless other illnesses could be answered   This bill provides a promise that families might no longer have to see a loved one suffering   This bill means hope for the individuals challenged and fighting to live a life with dignity    Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases  alleviating suffering and saving lives   I know my colleagues recognize the enormous potential of this research too  and it is time to clear the way for discovering new cures and therapies and bring this bill to a vote    Thank you
