Protect its Citizens Should Not Be Pre empted    Monday  March 19  2007      NEWARK   United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  testified today at a field hearing of the U S  Senate Transportation Safety  Infrastructure Security and Water Quality Subcommittee on the important role of state and local authorities in ensuring chemical plant security    Full statement as prepared follows    Senator Robert Menendez   Testimony   Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Subcommittee on Transportation Safety  Infrastructure Security  and Water Quality  The Importance of State and Local Authorities in Ensuring Chemical Plant Security    March 19  2007   Mr  Chairman    Thank you for the invitation to appear before you today on this critical issue   I am pleased that we have a strong commitment from our New Jersey congressional delegation to address serious concerns facing our state s ability to regulate chemical security  and that our senior senator has made this such a forefront issue   I have been proud to join you in your efforts on chemical security and I thank you for holding this hearing    Today  we are not far from the area that many of us from New Jersey know has been deemed the  most two dangerous miles  in America by the FBI   Here  at Rutgers Law School in Newark  we sit within five miles of the Kuehne plant in South Kearny  in a range that would without question be devastated by an attack at that facility   This is not a new reality   For those of us here  who have long worked to improve the security of the critical infrastructure in our state  these are the scenarios we have worked furiously to avoid   For residents of New Jersey  many who have grown up in the shadows of chemical plants  down the road from port container shipyards  or in the backyards of railroad lines that transport hazardous materials  these are the type of threats they have had to grapple with on a daily basis    In New Jersey  we are acutely aware of the risks we face   Not only did we experience the horror and the impact of September 11th  not only do we live across the river from a site that is a constant reminder of what we are up against  but we have are own risks that are unique to New Jersey   Nowhere else in the country are densely populated areas sandwiched between a multitude of wide ranging threats  including a major international airport  the largest seaport on the east coast  proximity to the nation s largest metropolis  and all within a tight cluster of chemical plants   So  when it comes to our security  the bottom line is  no one knows what we need better than our state    And that is the key distinction over which we are currently locked in a battle with the Department of Homeland Security   The Department s assumption that it can and should pre empt chemical security measures at the state level should be  at a minimum  alarming to New Jerseyans   The Department s proposed regulations would not just jeopardize the progress we are making here in New Jersey to ensure our plants are secure and our communities are safe   it would take us backwards   The proposed rules would fail to cover many dangerous chemical facilities unique to the state   They wouldn t push chemical makers to switch to less dangerous technology or materials  something New Jersey has already been doing   The fact is  we are the only state that has acted to enact such strict protections and provide enforceable standards   So  instead of working to come up with regulations that could supersede the progress we have made and pre empt future attempts to tighten our regulations  I would hope they would use New Jersey as an example  and build off the steps we have taken    More than five years after September 11th  the fact that the federal government has not led the way to secure our chemical plants is nothing short of a failure   Instead  our local police departments  our state legislatures  and communities  are leading the charge   If there was anything we learned from September 11th  it was that we will not always be able to pre conceive the nature of an attack or imagine what could be used as a weapon against us   What was once inconceivable   that commercial planes we use every day could become deadly weapons of mass destruction   changed our world forever   Yet  we refuse to come to terms with a stark reality  the terrorists are creative and are working every day to find a new vulnerability to exploit   At a minimum  we have to be at least as creative as they are    Meanwhile  we have yet to see any innovative approach from DHS on chemical security   This latest development from the Department is concerning not just because it calls into question the future of New Jersey s chemical security  but because it signals the Department is on the wrong track   Instead of looking ahead to develop creative ways to secure our plants  the Department has put forward a proposal that threatens to undermine our own protections    We will not  and should not  be at the whim of an agency that has yet to prove it grasps the gravity and the urgency of securing our chemical plants   New Jersey needs the flexibility to enforce its own  tougher standards   I think I speak for all of us on this panel that we will not give up until we ensure that New Jersey s right is upheld and that our security will not be compromised   The stakes are simply too high
