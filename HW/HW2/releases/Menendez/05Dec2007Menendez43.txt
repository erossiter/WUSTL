Iraq  As Prepared for Delivery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wednesday  December 5  2007      M  President  For more than 4 straight years now  President Bush has been declaring victory or progress in Iraq  But the thousands of soldiers who have lost their legs or have gone blind or suffer horrible nightmares might be finding it hard to celebrate  The families of those men and women might not be cheering very loud about this war  The thousands more whose children  whose mothers and fathers are lost forever  might be finding it hard to share in the latest cries of victory  Yes  the number of soldiers killed last month dropped to 37    Well  thats another 37 families who have no reason to rejoice  And more American troops have died this year than any other year  M  President  no matter how much military progress has been made in Iraq  that kind of security can only go so far  No amount of troops will force Iraqi politicians to agree on a fair distribution of oil revenues  No Abrams tank can build trust between Shiites and Sunnis    CHART 1  The whole point of the surge was to create the conditions necessary for Iraqis to make political progress  But just two weeks ago the Washington Post ran this headline  Iraqis Wasting An Opportunity  U S  Officers Say  Iraqi security forces are still unable to operate on their own  Any cease fire between factions could evaporate in minutes  Weve started drawing down troops to pre surge levels  but we have to wonder whether were going to be told that were going to need to re surge  to do it all over again  because the Iraqi government and security forces are still at square one  Our generals in Iraq have been the first to admit that a solution to that countrys conflict has to be more than a military solutionit has to be a political solution  A political solution is up to Iraqi leaders  and right now  there has been practically zero progress on the core critical issues necessary to bring lasting peace  The administration set 18 benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet  They have barely met 3  So is it time to turn up the pressure  or let them keep squabbling while Americans pay and Americans die   CHART 2  There is more corruption in Iraq than almost anywhere else on Earth  Its a pit of quicksand when it comes to money  Some estimates say as much as a third of the money we spend on Iraqi contracts and grants winds up unaccounted for or stolenwith a lot of it going straight to Shiite or Sunni militias  Let me repeat that  one out of every three dollars we pay out gets lost or stolen  Even after billions and billions and billions of dollars in funding  Iraqi society is still dysfunctional  American money went toward improving municipal water systems    Iraqis now break open the pipes and steal the water  American money went toward books for schools  Iraqis steal them from the Ministry of Education and sell them on the street at three times the price  Government officials have sold the furniture right out of their offices  Thats what the American taxpayers are funding  So is it time to change our strategy  or ignore the corruption while Americans pay and Americans die  Heres the message we send to Iraqi politicians by sending them a blank check with no expiration date    continue your squabbles  and well continue to see the loss of American life and continue to empty our treasury for you  for as long as you like  That message is  you can just sit back  while Americans pay and Americans die  I think its time for a different message  M  President  after seeing a surge in the military thats lasted for months do nothing about a splurge of corruption thats lasted for years  the conclusion we have to draw from that is clear    the only way Iraqis will take charge of their own country and make the tough compromises necessary to form a functional society is when they believe we wont be there forever  Thats the only way  It is long past time for the Iraqi government to take charge  and the only way theyre going to step up is if we begin to transition out  A reduction in fighting is not an excuse for a reduction in planning for our involvement to end  The fact is  the violence has not stopped  and the costs of this war have only gone up  The war is costing us  10 billion dollars per month    The debt our government is taking on and that taxpayers are going to be responsible for is exploding at the rate of  1 million a minute   CHART 3  When the numbers are that high  every American taxpayer has to ask him or herself a basic question  How does the President plan to pay for this war  Well  last week we got a small part of an answer  he wants to cut funding for counterterrorism at home  According to a leaked administration document  President Bush wants to cut counterterrorism funding for cities by more than half    I had to do a double take when I heard that  I thought  the report had to be wrong  His reported budget would slash funding for police  firefighters  and rescue workers  It could mean fewer security guards at ports  less reliable detection of explosives  less training for security personnelbasically  it would undercut the entire effort to prevent terrorism that our nation realized  one September day  was one of the most urgent challenges we have ever faced  Cutting counterterrorism funding is simply outrageous    I know this Congress will not stand for itand the people who live in those cities definitely will not stand for it   Is it really necessary to remind the President how important it is to protect our homes and families from terrorist attacks  Do we really have to say that we must do everything within the bounds of possibility and the law to prevent a terrorist attack from happening again    Is that a risk he wants to take  to cut what amounts to point zero six percent of the federal budget  especially when the War in Iraq has eaten up  455 billion and counting  when the amount he wants to take away from police and firefighters is an amount we spend in Iraq every 5 days  The President has requested  1 billion for the Iraqi police  but wants to cut funding for the COPS program that fights crime in American communities  Hell spend anything on the streets of Baghdad  but suddenly thinks we should be stingy when it comes to security on the streets of our hometowns    The President wants a blank check for Iraq  but nothing for America  From childrens health  to cancer research  to crucial water resources  the President has vetoed whats most essential  our health  our safety  our liberty  He has repeatedly said all that is too expensive  Meanwhile  hes requesting  200 billion more to fight a war in Iraq that has achieved nothing for any of us  killed thousands of Americans  and left us more disliked around the world as a nation than at any point in our history  He wants a blank check for Iraq  but nothing for America  If he submits a budget that cuts funding for counterterrorism  he truly would be laying the final brick in the Department of Homeland Hypocrisy  M  President  in high school many of us read George Orwells book 1984  which was about a nightmare world where words mean the exact opposite of what they should mean  America is really starting to understand what the word security means to the President  He apparently thinks funding firefighters  police and emergency responders is excessive    But he wants to spy on Americans without warrants  tap peoples phones without any oversight    condone procedures that even the U S  Army itself considers torture  throw people in jail without trial  and basically ignore the most basic tenets of the justice system of the United States since we drafted our Constitution in 1789  Now  President Bush wants to cut funding to stop terrorism  in order to fund a war that has created terrorists  M  President  America isnt just ready to turn the page on this administration  Were ready for a whole new book  Thank you
