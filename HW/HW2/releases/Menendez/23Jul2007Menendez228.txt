SPEAKS ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Monday  July 23  2007      WASHINGTON  During the Senate debate on the Higher Education Reauthorization bill  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  made the following speech   I rise in strong support of the higher education act reauthorization bill before us today I would first like to thank my colleague  the Chairman of the HELP Committee  a true champion for education in this country Senator Kennedys vision for higher education will help make sure college is accessible and affordable to all our young people  regardless of race  class  or income It is because of the vision of people like Senator Kennedy  like Senator Pell and those before him  that the doors to college have been opened to millions of Americans who otherwise would not have access to the American Dream    As someone whose dreams of college could not have been realized without the power of the Pell Grant  without other federal aid  I am proud be able to support legislation that will open the doors for the next generation of students in this country  Without the critical assistance I received  I would not have been the first in my family to graduate from college and law school  and I surely would not speaking here on the floor as a member of the United States Senate    The bill before us takes great steps towards improving and leveling the playing field for all students  so that more students are able to access and afford a higher education  Today  all students do not have an equal chance to attend college Latinos and African Americans are less likely to be able to afford college  and are 40 to 60 percent less likely to earn a bachelors degree in their lifetime than white students By expanding federal aid opportunities for minorities  this bill will help improve those numbers and close a critical gap in higher education   My own story  of growing up poor  yet having the opportunity to fulfill my dream of attending college because of federal aid  is still true for so many of our young people today  and will continue to be for the young people of tomorrow   The changes in this bill come at a critical time  when the landscape of a typical college student body is changing drastically It is projected that by the year 2015  college enrollment of African American students will increase by 23 percent  and for Latinos  that number will increase by a whopping 73 percent  Moreover  some three quarters of todays students are non traditional students  meaning they either are attending part time and working full time  non high school graduates  or have dependents  among other characteristics  More and more students will not be the sons and daughters of previous college graduates  or of U S  citizens  or of English speakers    the student of tomorrow will be a mother who juggles a full time job and attends community college part time at night so she can gain skills that will lead to a better job and provide her children economic security    the student of tomorrow will be a naturalized U S  citizen who  with the help of federal aid  can fulfill his dream of becoming an engineer  who can give back to his country by helping build new infrastructure    the student of tomorrow will be a foster child who is able to attend college with federal aid and fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse so she can not only live a stable life  but give back to a system that saved her    the student of tomorrow will be a bright high school student who works part time through college and  despite his familys low income  can attend the college of his choice because of Pell and Perkins   These are the students that will help define the future of our nation  the first generation students breaking through new barriers  the parents working to improve life for their children  the naturalized immigrant building a better life in this country They will each be charting their own path  able to realize their dreams because of the opportunity only a college education can provide    And how well they are educated will not just determine how successful they are in the workforce  but how successful our nation is in the global economy  As a nation  the greatest asset we will have is our collective intellect And to be a leader globally  we will have to be at the apex of the curve of intellect This means the most highly educated population our nation has ever known To get there  our education pipeline must be accessible and affordable to a great cross section of young people   However  rising costs  combined with far too stagnant growth in family income and declining federal grant aid  have effectively priced many students out Even with student loans and work study  todays students have thousands in unmet financial need they often cannot afford to pay As a nation  we simply cannot afford to have our students priced out of a college education Our nations future depends on it   The legislation before us will make key changes to help ensure the doors to college remain open to all  not just those who can afford it out of pocket And this bill realizes that improving access to college does not just mean increasing funding   Improving access to college means curbing rising tuition costs so that young people will be better able to afford higher education This bill will hold colleges accountable for rising tuition costs by making tuition data public and available so students and their families can compare costs  By publicizing costs to prospective families  colleges will need to justify tuition increases that far exceed those of comparable institutions    Improving access to college means reforming the student loan system so students get loans that are fair  not loans that wash them away in debt  Outrageous loan debt is forcing borrowers to delay buying a home or taking the dream job of their choice after college  simply because it will not pay enough  This bill reverses this troubling trend by not only expanding federal aid  but ensuring students are getting the best possible deal when taking out loans   Improving access to college also means starting at the first step  filling out the forms  As someone who had to fill out the FAFSA by myself  it was daunting For any student facing this process on their own  or for families with language  income  or other barriers  the financial aid process itself can be overwhelming By reducing the FAFSA from ten pages to two pages  we are making it easier for students to accomplish the first step to getting financial aid   And improving access to college means helping students get on the right path early  By strengthening and expanding programs like GEAR UP and TRIO  and by promoting quality teacher preparation programs and helping high needs public schools recruit and retain high quality teachers  this bill takes low income and first generation students closer to their dreams of college   We also need to expand access beyond the undergraduate realm I am particularly pleased this bill expands funding for Minority Serving Institutions  and specifically supports the creation of graduate programs at Hispanic Serving Institutions  a proposal I have supported for a long time Latinos currently make up less than six percent of graduate students  and by expanding opportunities at Hispanic Serving Institutions  which enroll more than 50 percent of all Latino students  this expansion is an important step to ensuring the nations graduate and doctorate students reflect the diversity of our nation   M  President This means making education work for all of our students   That is why we must take steps to increase critical grant aid and strengthen key programs to help open the doors to college for all our young people We must ensure our students are getting the best possible deal when they apply to college and that every student who is willing to work hard has the opportunity to graduate from college    This bill  I believe  takes us in the right direction I urge my colleagues to support this legislation   To hear segments of the Senators floor speech  visit
