the Cost of War in Iraq v  Energy Independence  As Prepared for Delivery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Friday  December 14  2007      M  President  No matter the ups and downs of the military campaign in Iraq  there is a central truth about the war we must acknowledge  this war is not free  It was not free to the 28 661 men and women who have come home with horrible burns and scars  who gave up their eyes  their arms  their legs in Iraq  It was not free to the 3 877 soldiers who died thousands of miles away from home    And it certainly was not free to the mothers  fathers  sons  daughters and friends who have to share in the burden of a soldiers injuries  or to those families who will never see their loved ones again  For the past several months I have come to the floor to talk about what else it is costing us to be in Iraq  besides the awful loss of human life that has occurred  Since March 2003   455 billion dollars are gone  The price tag for every additional month we spend there is  10 billion dollars  No matter how the war in Iraq drops in and out of the news  no matter how public opinion about it shifts  the costs keep piling up  to our troops  to their families  to all of us  Today Id like to speak about what it has cost us in terms of our energy independence  Last night  this Congress passed a bill to push America toward energy independence and environmental responsibility   Few things are more important to our national security than energy independence  Everyone  on both sides of the aisle  from coast to coast across this country  agrees that continuing to rely on oil not only fuels our cars  it fuels authoritarian regimes and radical ideologies  from Saudi Arabia to Iran  Venezuela to Sudan   Few things are more important to the health of our environment than energy independence  If we are to pass on to our children a world where the air is breathable  where the oceans dont rise and flood their houses  where droughts dont parch their soil and starve them of food  we need to dramatically reduce the fossil fuels we are spewing into the atmosphere  Few things are more important to our economic security than energy independence  Relying so heavily on oil means this country is walking a liquid tightrope over an economic canyon    If oil prices go up even to the mid  100sand it wouldnt take that big a crisis in an oil producing country to get the price that highit would result in a massive recession  a massive devaluation of our dollar  a devastating blow to working families in this country  Ill say it again  oil is a liquid tightrope for this country  and only a truly enormous national effort can weave the net of alternative fuels  infrastructure and conservation to catch us when we fall   So  with a problem this daunting  this enormously important to our future as a nation  you would think that both Republicans and Democrats would be willing to invest whatever it takes to get the problem solved  The version of the energy bill we passed last night contains strong measures  and I voted for it  It requires auto makers to build cars with better gas mileage for the first time in more than twenty years  It requires our electric appliances to use less electricity for the first time in history  But that legislation could have gone much farther  Some argued that we could not afford to pay to spur innovation in alternative energy  On top of that  some of my colleagues blocked any progress on the energy bill until it included tax breaks for big oil companies  Lets remember that over the last few years these oil companies have hauled in half a trillion dollars in profits  We faced a clear choice  would we stand up for the oil companies  or for the American people  Many Republicans chose the oil companies  Some senators had proposed creating new incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in new technologies like tidal  geothermal and small irrigation hydro power  But some of my colleagues blocked it  They said it was too expensive  Lets put that in context  The proposal would have invested  6 billion over ten years  In other words  it would have cost the same amount as we spend in Iraq every two and a half weeks  Some senators had proposed a long term extension of a tax credit for solar energy and related technologies  a  700 million investment over the next ten years  Some of my colleagues demanded that provision be cut  Yet we could pay for that investment in alternative fuels for an entire decade with the money we spend in Iraq inI can hardly believe it as Im saying itabout 2 days  Roughly 2 days in Iraq would pay for that provision to help wean us off burning fossil fuels  Conserving energy doesnt have to be complicated or expensive  The strong new standard we just passed to make electric appliances and light bulbs more efficient is proof of that  The energy savings is going to be tremendous  When an American home replaces just one old incandescent bulb with a fluorescent bulb  it saves that family about  30 over the life of the bulb  And if every home in America changed just one bulb  in terms of the carbon emissions we kept out of our atmosphere  it would have the same impact as taking 800 000 cars off the road  Lets say that back in 2003  instead of going to war  we decided to replace every light bulb in America with a more energy efficient model    Since a compact fluorescent light bulb costs about  4  for the amount of money weve spent on the war in Iraq  we could have purchased more than 100 billion compact fluorescent light bulbs  Probably more if wed gotten a bulk discount  In any case it would have been more than enough to light up every household in America for decades  It would probably be enough bulbs to light up planet Earth like a giant glowing ornament  Thats the scale were talking about  If the President had proposed that back in 2003  we would have thought he was crazy    And yet  it would have done far more for our energy independence than invading Iraq  It is hard to fathom how much power that would have saved  how much money we would have saved  how much carbon we could have prevented from being spewed into the atmosphere  how much funding we could have ultimately denied to regimes that are no friends of ours  had we decided to actually put real money behind reducing our energy use  Instead  we got a war that has achieved nothing for any of us  Thats what the war costs  It could have been traded for real solutions to one of the most tremendous problems of our time  M  President  Deciding whether this nation is going to spend our blood and treasure on a war that achieves nothing for any of us  or whether we are going to devote our minds  budgets and hearts to solving our massive energy challenge  is a question of priorities  It is a question of values  On both counts  keeping the war in Iraq going indefinitely is the wrong answer  If we do not change our priorities  so they match the values of the American people  I am afraid that every day we are going to be more and more aware of what the great American poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote more than a hundred and fifty years ago  of all sad words of tongue or pen  the saddest are these  what might have been  M  President  I yield the floor
