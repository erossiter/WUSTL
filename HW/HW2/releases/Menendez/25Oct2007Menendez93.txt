IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AMTRAK FUNDING BILL

October 25  2007      WASHINGTON  Today  the U S  Senate is considering the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act  a bill sponsored by U S  Senator Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  to support the operation of Amtrak and improvements to the passenger rail system  Senator Bob Menendez  D NJ   a strong supporter of Amtrak and co sponsor of the legislation  spoke today on the Senate floor in favor of the legislation  Excerpts from Menendez remarks  Every year since 2002 Amtrak has had to continue operations on a yearly basis without adequate funds to maintain the rail system over the long term  Its almost like a starvation diet  just enough to be temporarily alive  but cutting its funding in such a way that it can neither be successful nor fully survive  Right now the system is at a breaking point  Amtraks equipment is aging and no amount of maintenance can keep cars built in the 1950s on the tracks  Amtrak is not just a passenger rail system that serves 25 million people each year  Amtrak is also a program that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions  reduces congestion on our roadways  fights sprawl  creates jobs  and fosters economic activity  I know first hand the benefits of Amtrak because over one hundred thousand New Jersey commuters depend on Amtraks infrastructure every day  Over the last 35 years we have spent less money on Amtrak than we will on highways in this year alone  We have never committed the same support behind Amtrak that we have for other modes of transportation  This bill will finally give Amtrak a stable amount of authorized funds it needs over the next 6 years to adequately fund its operations and finance capital improvements   Text of full Menendez remarks  as prepared  M  President  I rise in support of the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007  I want to thank Senators Lautenberg and Lott for their efforts to guide this important legislation to the floor  My distinguished colleague from New Jersey not only in this legislation but for some time has been probably Amtraks strongest advocate  Every year since 2002 Amtrak has had to continue operations on a yearly basis without adequate funds to maintain of the rail system over the long term  Its almost like a starvation diet  keeping it just enough to be temporarily alive but working it in such a way  cutting its funding in such a way that it can neither be successful or fully survive  Right now the system is at a breaking point  Amtraks equipment is aging and no amount of maintenance can keep cars built in the 1950s on the tracks  Amtrak is not just a passenger rail system that serves 25 million people each year  Amtrak is also a program that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions  reduces congestion on our roadways  fights sprawl  creates jobs  and fosters economic activity  I know first hand the benefits of Amtrak because over one hundred thousand New Jersey commuters depend on Amtraks infrastructure every day  And there are many other commuter rail systems in states that depend upon Amtraks infrastructure as well to move very large amounts of their residents over the Amtrak lines  Some critics want Amtrak to be the only major transportation system in the world that operates without government subsidy  This standard is simply impossible to meet and a standard we do not hold any other mode of transportation to  Over the last 35 years we have spent less money on Amtrak than we will on highways in this year alone  When you factor in state and local subsidies for infrastructure and parking some studies suggest that up to 8  of our Gross National Product is spent on subsidies for automobile use  We have never committed the same support behind Amtrak that we have for other modes of transportation  This bill will finally give Amtrak a stable amount of authorized funds it needs over the next 6 years to adequately fund its operations and finance capital improvements  But these funds are not free  To get these funds Amtrak will be forced to tighten its belt while simultaneously improving service  The bill reduces Amtraks annual appropriations need by requiring reforms that will reduce Amtraks operating costs by 40 percent over the life of the bill  In addition  bill provides for  1 4 billion dollars for state to provide new passenger rail service between cities  In some instances these state operations will likely provide service that compliments existing Amtrak service just as the recent light rail projects in New Jersey have done  But in other cases these funds may actually create competition for Amtrak for service between some cities  The bill will also require Amtrak to use a new financial accounting system so regulators and legislators can better monitor how Amtrak uses its resources  And this bill will require Amtrak to use it resources to provide a new level of service by improving on time performance  upgrading on board services  and providing easier access to other transportation systems  Finally  the bill will also require a system wide security review to ensure that rail remains a safe transportation alternative  With record high gasoline prices  congested highways and airports that are experiencing record delays  we need all of the alternative forms of transportation we can provide to the frustrated American traveler  As someone who represents a state that saw the consequences of what happened on September 11th  I know that we have come to appreciate the importance of multiple modes of transportation in a security context  Weve always talked about transportation in the context of getting people to work and economic opportunity  Weve talked about people who might get on a rail line to Johns Hopkins University or Robert Wood Johnson or Hackensack Medical Center or the great hospitals in New York  Weve talked about tourism and people being able to take Amtrak to go to different parts of the country to see the greatness of this nation  But on September 11th  we learned that multiple modes of transportation are critical to the nations security well being  On that fateful day we had the attacks in New York  as well as Washington and Pennsylvania  On that fateful day the metropolitan region where there are millions of people  saw the tunnels were closed down  and the bridges were closed down  and it was a different mode of transportation that got people out of downtown Manhattan from the World Trade Center and to the hospitals to be triaged  and that mode of transportation happened to be the ferries  And the only way to get the only mode of commercial intercity travel  when all the airlines were shut down for that period of time  was Amtrak  So weve learned a lesson that this is beyond economics  A lesson that this is beyond tourism  This is beyond getting people to research areas to be cured  It is about security too  If we do away with Amtrak  we do away with the ability to have another mode of transportation that is critical to our security blanket  Amtrak was absolutely essential in keeping the country going in spite of a horrendous terror attack  We have to think about Amtrak in that way as well  M  President I urge my colleagues to recognize that a strong  well funded Amtrak is an essential resource for our country  Please join me in voting for the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007
