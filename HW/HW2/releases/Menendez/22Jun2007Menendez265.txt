June 22  2007       WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   voted in favor of the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007  which included various proposals  authored and supported by the senator  The bill  which passed by a vote of  65 27  is widely considered to be an overhaul of current energy policy  taking  the first step in transforming our economy from one based on fossil fuels to one  based on clean  renewable energy including such provisions as raising CAF  Standards from 25 to 35 miles per gallon by Model Year  2020   With the passage of  this bill  we are steering America on a new course towards a  greener  healthier  and more affordable future  said Menendez  This energy  package will help us achieve energy self reliance  lower gasoline prices  and  reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  I applaud my colleagues for supporting this  vital legislation  Off Shore  Drilling  Menendez led the  successful effort to block Sen  John Warner s amendment to allow off shore  drilling off the coast of Virginia  less than  100 miles from New  Jersey s shores      Senator Menendez and a group of coastal senators threatened a filibuster in  order to require the measure to reach a 60 vote threshold  It was soundly  defeated   Drilling less than 100  miles off the Jersey Shore is bad for our states environment   our states economy and our nations dependence on oil  said Menendez  Some  believe that the best way to move forward with energy legislation is to expand  our reliance on oil by opening up new drilling arenas  I could not disagree  more  Our oil dependence is a threat to our security and a threat to the  environment  We need to focus our attention to transition away from an oil based  economy  not make ourselves more dependent on oil  Block  Grants  The legislation  included Menendez s provision that would create an Energy and Environmental  Block Grant program to fund energy efficiency and renewable energy projects at  the local level   As a former mayor  I  recognize the impact that local action has on global problems  said Menendez   This program will allow cities and counties to get federal grants to make their  buildings more efficient  create new renewable energy projects and continue  their leadership in reducing U S  carbon  emissions  Puerto  Rico  Menendez also sponsored  an amendment to make Puerto Rico eligible for  the Federal Weatherization Program  which enables low income families to  permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy  efficient  The amendment was inserted into the bill by unanimous  consent   The Weatherization  Program helps thousands of low income families keep their energy costs down and  also helps the environment by making energy consumption more efficient  said  Menendez  It is time we help the low income families of Puerto Rico gain access to this vital  program  Taxes  Menendez also expressed  dismay that the tax provisions of the bill could not overcome Republican  opposition  The tax portion of the legislation would have shifted over  30  billion in government hand outs to oil companies and convert them into tax  credits for renewable energy and other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions    The Senate Republicans  today made it quite clear they are still the party of big oil  They would  rather help oil companies pad their record profits instead of helping make our  country more secure and a better steward of the environment  said  Menendez  Menendez also  co sponsored the following amendments accepted into the Energy  legislation    DRIVE Electric  Amendment to encourage innovation in vehicles thus reducing dependence on oil   The amendment would expand research and development into plug in hybrid  technologies so one day soon our cars can be fueled in part by  electricity    25x25 Amendment which  states that it is the Sense of Congress that America s agricultural  forestry and working  lands should provide 25  of the total energy consumed in the United  States from renewable sources by the year  2025
