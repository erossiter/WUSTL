of globalization  we are inextricably linked to the rest of the world  and to no people are we more closely connected than to our neighbors in Latin  America  said Senator Menendez  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Development and Foreign Assistance  Their successes are our successes  just as their social problems cause instability in our communities too  A partnership between our nations that spans the public and private sectors and attacks the roots of poverty is a new approach whose time has come  We have seen the benefits of our increased

longtime inequalities  The program I believe is absolutely essential to help the people in Latin America and the Caribbean economically  because of that  we hope it will create more stability in the
