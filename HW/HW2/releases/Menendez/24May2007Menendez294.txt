AGAINST CORNYN AMENDMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Measure would dramatically expand grounds for deportability   Thursday  May 24  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today voiced his objections to an amendment offered by Senator John Cornyn  R TX  to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007  Menendez spoke on the floor against the amendment  which would dramatically expand grounds for deportability to include social security fraud and would allow deportations based on an unreviewable executive branch determination  which could be based on secret evidence      This provision would place individuals applying for legalization in a  Catch 22  situation   said Menendez   We want them to come forward and register because we want to know who is here pursuing the American Dream versus who is here to destroy it  Yet  if they admit to having used a false social security card to work in the United States only to be prosecuted    that individual s ultimate prosecution changes to a removal because of conduct that occurred prior to enactment  The potential impact of making literally thousands and thousands of undocumented workers subject to these provisions would  in essence  nullify the very essence of the earned legalization aspect of the Grand Bargain    Menendez strongly objected to the measure s retroactive applications   What is more unfair than changing the rules in the middle of the game  That is what is unconstitutional in criminal law and strongly objectionable in the context of immigration law  with such changes having profound consequences     The closed captioning text from the Senate floor of Sen  Menendez s comments  not an official transcript     MR  PRESIDENT  I D LIKE TO TURN TO ANOTHER AMENDMENT PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE  SENATOR CORNYN S AMENDMENT    I M JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME ELEMENTS OF THIS TO GIVE OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE A TASTE OF WHAT S HERE  THIS IS FAR FROM A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT    IT HAS VERY SUBSTANTIVE CONSEQUENCES IF IT WERE TO BE ADOPTED  IT ACTUALLY UNDERMINES THE GRAND BARGAIN THAT I UNDERSTOOD WAS STRUCK    LET ME GIVE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF HOW  IN MY MIND  IT UNDERMINES THE GRAND BARGAIN    UNDER THIS PROVISION OF THE CORNYN AMENDMENT  IT ADDS NEW GROUNDS OF DEPORTIBILITY FOR CONVICTIONS RELATING TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS OR SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS AND RELATING TO IDENTITY FRAUD    AS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS IN HIS AMENDMENT THIS IS EXPANSION    THIS EXPANSION IS RETROACTIVE    RETROACTIVE    SO  UPON THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL  IF IT WERE TO BECOME LAW SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT  THESE NEW OFFENSES WOULD GO BACKWARDS  WOULD BECOME RETROACTIVE SO THAT THE ACTS THAT OCCURRED BEFORE THE DATE OF ENACTMENT WOULD BECOME GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL    WELL  IF PART OF THE GOAL HERE IS TO BRING OUT THOSE FROM THE SHADOWS INTO THE LIGHT AND TO APPLY FOR A PROGRAM  YOU WOULD HAVE HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD  IN ESSENCE  BE CAUGHT BY THIS PROVISION IN A WAY THAT WOULD NEVER  EVER  ALLOW THE EARNED LEGALIZATION ASPECT OF WHAT IS BEING OFFERED AS A REAL POSSIBILITY FOR THEM    IN ESSENCE  IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE GRAND BARGAIN    THIS PROVISION WOULD PLACE INDIVIDUALS APPLYING FOR LEGALIZATION IN A CATCH 22 SITUATION  WE WANT THEM TO COME FORWARD AND REGISTER BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW WHO IS HERE PURSUING THE AMERICAN DREAM VERSUS WHO IS HERE IT DESTROY IT    YET  IF THEY ADMIT TO HAVING USED A FALSE SOCIAL SECURITY CARD TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY TO BE PROSECUTED BY A UNITED STATES ATTORNEY OR ONE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO SELECTIVELY TARGET SOME APPLICANTS  THAT INDIVIDUAL S ULTIMATE PROSECUTION CHANGES TO A REMOVAL BECAUSE OF CONDUCT THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO ENACTMENT  CONDUCT THAT WAS FUNDAMENTALLY INCIDENT TO HIS OR HER UNDOCUMENTD STATUS    NOW  THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MAKING LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SUBJECT TO THESE PROVISIONS WOULD  IN ESSENCE  NULLIFY THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE EARNED LEGALIZATION ASPECT OF THE GRAND BARGAIN   NOW  WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE FAILED    BECAUSE OF THE FAILED EMPLOYER SANCTIONS WHICH THIS BILL MAKES SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TYPE OF EMPLOYER VERIFICATION AND THE RIGHT TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT  UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS HAVE MOVED CONSISTENTLY IN ORDER TO EARN A LIVELIHOOD AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE UNDERMINED BY THIS AMENDMENT    GIVEN THE NEW INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY  IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT WE WILL SEE IS ROUNDING UP OF THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS DURING WORK SITE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHILE THEY    WHILE WE ARE SUPPOSEDLY WAITING FOR THE TRIGGERS WHICH WE ENHANCED YESTERDAY  BY THE WAY  MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT SO THE 18 MONTHS WILL NOT BE 18 MONTHS  IT WILL BE A LOT MORE TIME IF THAT ENDS UP BEING THE FINAL BILL    SO  IN THAT EFFORT  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE VICTIMS WHO ULTIMATELY ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO THE OPPORTUNITIES WE SUPPOSEDLY SAY IS A PATHWAY TO EARN LEGAL SAGS AS PART OF THE OVERALL SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM    AND BECAUSE THE AMENDMENT IS RETROACTIVE AND JUST IN GENERAL RETROACTIVITY AS A PROVISION OF LAW IS SOMETHING WE GENERALLY HAVE DISDAIN FOR  IT WOULD APPLY EVEN TO THOUGH APPLYING FOR ADMISSION AFTER THE DATE OF ENACTMENT  CLEARLY  IT PUTS IN JEOPARDY THE TOTAL ELEMENT OF THE LEGALIZATION PROCESS    SECOND  TO GIVE A DIFFERENT PROVISION OF SENATOR CORNYN S AMENDMENT  IT PERMITS SECRET EVIDENCE TO BE USED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR IT TO BE REVIEWED    THIS AMENDMENT GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL    AND WE VE SEEN OF LATE WHAT IS CAPABLE OUT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT    UNREVIEWABLE DISCRETION TO USE SECRET EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE IF AN ALIEN IS DESCRIBED IN AS A PERSON APPLYING FOR NATURALIZATION THAT COULD HAVE THEIR APPLICATION DENIED IT AND THEY WOULD NEVER KNOW THE REASON FOR THE DENIAL AND NEVER HAVE A CHANCE FOR APPEAL TO PROVE IT WAS WRONG    IF A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  SOMEBODY WHO FOLLOWED THE RULES AND OBEYED THE LAW AND WAITED AND CAME IN AND IS NOW A LAWFUL REPRESENT AND MAY BE SERVING THE COUNTRY  WAS GIVEN    GIVING MONEY TO TSUNAMI RELIEF AND ACCIDENTALLY THAT MONEY WENT TO A CHARITY CONTROLLED  FOR EXAMPLE  BY THE TIGERS IN SRI LANKA  THAT PERSON COULD BE DENIED CITIZENSHIP ON THE BASIS OF SECRET EVIDENCE AND THERE IS NO REVIEW IN THE COURTS    IT ALLOWS DEPORTATION BASED UPON THE UNREVIEWABLE DETERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH  THE UNREVIEWABLE DEMOCRATATION BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH  DETERMINATIONS THAT CAN BE BASED ON SECRET EVIDENCE THAT THE PERSON CANNOT EVEN SEE LET ALONE CHALLENGE    FINALLY  JUST TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS    THERE ARE OTHERS    ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE RETROACTIVE  ALL OF THEM    ALL OF THEM INCLUDING    INCLUDED IN THIS AMENDMENT ARE RETROACTIVE  THAT IS    WHAT IS MORE UNFAIR THAN CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME    THAT IS WHAT IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN CRIMINAL LAW AND STRONGLY OBJECTIONABLE IN THE CONTEXT LIKE IMMIGRATION LAW WITH SUCH CHANGES HAVING PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES    WHY WOULD WE WANT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF SOME OF THE PAST IMMIGRATION REFORM WE HAVE HAD  RETRO ACTIVITY LED TO INCREDIBLE HARDSHIP WITH THE MOST STRIKE DEPTH IMMIGRATION HARD LINERS QUESTIONING WHETHER THE LAWS HAD GONE TOO FAR    RETROACTIVITY WAS ELIMINATED FROM ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS DURING JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MARKUP IN PAST LEGISLATION BUT NOW IT REEMMERGES ONCE AGAIN    LOOK  WE CAN BE TOUGH  WE CAN BE SMART    THE UNDERLYING SUBSTITUTE DOES SO WERE TO MOVE US FORWARD IN THIS REGARD    BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY  LET US NOT UNDERMINE THE VERY ESSENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES THAT HAVE BEEN UPHELD BY COURTS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW  OF DUE PROCESS  WHAT MAKES AMERICAWORTH FIGHTING AND DYING FOR  THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT GRPS THE RIGHTS IT ALL OF US FOR ITS ENFORCEMENT THAT MAKES US SO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD    WE ARE MOVING IN THIS BILL BY A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS    SOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND SOME THAT ARE ALREADY PENDING AND OTHERS  I FEAR  MAY COME    THAT MOVE US INTO SUCH A STATE IN WHICH THAT IS CONTINUOUSLY ERODED TO A GREAT ALARM  AND I HOPE THE SENATE WILL REJECT THESE BECAUSE IN TERMS OF THEIR PURSUIT AND ENFORCEABILITY  I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WILL BECOME REAL CHALLENGES    WE WILL OVERTURN STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES   THE ENFORCEMENT    WILL THERE BE PENALTIES AGAINST STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW OF PUBLIC SAFETY      WHAT WILL WE DO  PERMIT SECRET EVIDENCE  IS THAT THE NEW STANDARD FOR US  SECRET EVIDENCE THAT IS NOT SINGLE TO REVIEW  NOT SUBJECT TO BE CONTESTED    WHAT ARE WE GOING TO PERMIT NOW  RETRO ACTIVITY AS A RULE OF LAW FOR THE UNITED STATES   YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU DID BEFORE MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT OR WRONG  THAT S THE ESSENCE OF WHY WE DON T LIKE RETROACTIVITY    WE SAY  THIS IS THE LAW  FOLLOW THIS LAW  AND  WE EXPECT THEM IT DO IT BUT WE ALSO DON T CHANGE IT ON THEM    AND THEN  IF WE PASS A NEW LAW AND SAY  BI  THAT WAS WRONG  YOU COULD NOT DO THAT ALTHOUGH WE TOLD YOU YOU COULD  BUT  RETROACTIVELY WE  CHANGE  AND NOW WE CATCH YOU IN A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME  THAT S WHY WE DO NOT DO THAT  GENERALLY  IN THE LAW  THAT S WHY THIS CORNYN AMENDMENT SHOULD BE DEFEATED    WITH THAT  MR  PRESIDENT  I YIELD THE FLOOR
