2007      WASHINGTON   While America s Hispanic population exceeds 45 million  representing more than one in seven in the U S  population  the unique contributions and needs of Hispanics in our Nation is often overlooked  In order to increase dialogue and understanding  the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force yesterday kicked off its action in the 110th Congress by hosting its first forum with leaders of major Hispanic organizations    The meeting was organized by Hispanic Task Force co chairs Senators Ken Salazar  D CO  and Robert Menendez  D NJ   and featured Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and Senator Debbie Stabenow  Chairwoman of the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee  and other Democratic Senators   Over 20 top Hispanic leaders attended  many of whom are members of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda  NHLA   a nonpartisan coalition of 40 major national Hispanic organizations and distinguished leaders from throughout the Nation  representing over 40 million Hispanics    During the meeting  participants and leaders in the Senate exchanged ideas on public policy for the Nation  and specifically the Hispanic community  and focused in four important issues areas    Education  A study by the non partisan Pew Hispanic Center found that more than one fifth of Hispanics between the ages of 16 and 19 are high school dropouts    Healthcare  Nationwide  nearly 14 million Hispanics   one in three   are without health coverage  according to the U S  Census Bureau    Immigration Reform  America is currently home to 11 million undocumented residents  many of whom are Hispanics working hard for their families and contributing positively to their communities  and   Federal Employment   Hispanic organizations urged Senate Democrats to focus on increasing Hispanic employment in the federal workforce  Senate Democrats pledged to continue to do everything in their power to ensure the highest levels of diversity in the federal government and in the halls of the U S  Congress    After the meeting  senators reflected upon the excellent dialogue coming out of this high level meeting of Hispanic and Congressional leadership     It was critical for Senate Democrats and national Latino leaders to meet early in the 110th Congress to discuss key priorities for the Hispanic community   Reid said    While immigration reform is certainly on the forefront in the coming months  there are several additional areas of policy that must be addressed to bring equity  access  and opportunities to the Latino community   We discussed concrete policy priorities to tackle continued challenges faced by the community  including the high health care uninsurance rate among Latino children  and the disproportionate levels of high school drop out rates among Latino students  Senate Democrats are committed to advancing priorities for Hispanic families  I deeply appreciate the leadership of my friends Senators Menendez and Salazar  who brought this important meeting together and who will ensure that we take action on the priorities that strengthen Latino families and all of America      Senate Democrats have an aggressive agenda this year that reflects the priorities of American families and acknowledges the contributions and needs of our vibrant and growing Hispanic communities  I applaud the leadership of Senator Salazar and Senator Menendez in chairing our Hispanic Task Force and organizing the first of what promises to be many productive discussions   Senator Stabenow said     Yesterday s meeting was positive and energetic   said Senator Salazar    I look forward to building on the successful work of the Hispanic Task Force during this Congress and in the future to continue to build bridges with the Hispanic community      Our meeting this week was a critical step toward building an influential  high level dialogue between Hispanic leaders across the country and leaders of the U S  Senate   Menendez said   As co chair of the Hispanic Task Force I will work to ensure that leaders of the Hispanic community always have a voice in shaping the policies and legislation advocated in the Senate  Furthermore  we will work to ensure that the leadership of the U S  Senate is always aware of  and responsive to  the concerns of the Hispanic community     Photos from yesterday s Hispanic Task Force meeting can
