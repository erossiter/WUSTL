compares Iraq War spending to domestic public safety priorities   Wednesday  October 17  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  this evening began a series of floor speeches aimed at highlighting what Iraq War spending could provide in domestic priorities  He plans to deliver these speeches periodically  particularly when a domestic policy priority is being considered on the Senate floor   This evening  Sen  Menendez focused on what Iraq War spending could be providing in public safety priorities  the Senate passed the Commerce  Justice and Science appropriations bill this week   Below is the text of his remarks  as prepared for delivery   THE IRAQ WAR  What Its Costing Us Here at Home Part 1  Public safety  M  President  On October 11th  we marked the fifth anniversary of Congresss capitulation to the resolution authorizing the War in Iraq   We should take this opportunity to tally up what this war has cost our nation   We are all very aware of the human cost  More Americans have died in Iraq than died on 9 11  These are our friends and neighbors  fathers and mothers  sons and daughters  gone forever   28 000 men and women have come back home wounded  some with legs or arms blown off by bombs  some blind from shrapnel in their eyes  some thrown into a state of mental shock from which they will never recover   As for the Iraqi men  women and children who have died in this conflict  we cannot even say  Some estimates say the body count is more than 100 000  And as for the people who have been forced to abandon their homes  they are about to number four and a half million  A disproportionate number of them are children   We all know that the Iraq War is a human calamity of vast proportions  It can be harder to visualize the direct damage that comes from the financial cost of the warto see it as the cancer it is  making our debt metastasize  threatening our budget  eating away at the financial stability of our entire nation   We are paying for this war with borrowed money  racking up massive debt  severely threatening the future of our country  We know that our country has spent more than  450 billion on this war so far  We continue to spend about  10 billion every month   That doesnt just add up to a stack of bills that could have sat in the Treasury  Its equipment at ports that scan for nuclear weapons  and other measures that actually make the homeland more secure  Its children healed with better healthcare   Its more teachers in schools  better training for our jobs  energy thats clean and doesnt strengthen repressive regimes in the Middle East  payment of our debts so future generations will inherit a country that is financially viable   Those are casualties we cannot fail to count  When our money gets burned in Iraq  we deserve to know what were trading away  What were trading away cannot be summed up in one speech  so Ill be coming back to this subject as many times as necessary to give each sacrifice fair attention   When we add it all up  the bottom line is very clear  if we had never gone into Iraq  our lives would be better  And the sooner we get out of Iraq  the better our lives will be  I will repeat this until our troops have come home  If we had never gone into Iraq  our lives would be better  And the sooner we get out of Iraq  the better our lives will be    M  President  today I would like to speak about what the failed War in Iraq has cost us in terms of our security here at home   The Bush Administration likes to parrot the line that were fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them here   Never mind that the War has created more terrorists than there were before  Beyond that  it has directed funding away from programs that actually would prevent terrorists from attacking the homeland   The Administrations budget for the failed War in Iraq is 13 times this years budget for Homeland Security  Do they really think the Iraq War is 13 times more important to America than the Department of Homeland Securitys mission   When it comes to our money  the Administrations motto really is  Were spending it over there so we dont spend it here   Every time we ride the subway or the bus  we put ourselves at risk  because our public transportation systems are unnecessarily vulnerable to terrorist attacks  The American Public Transportation Association estimates it would cost  6 billion to make them substantially more secure  That includes funding for personnel  training  communications systems  cameras and detection systems  We spend that much in Iraq every 18 days   Thats what the war costs  Security on public transportation  Versus 18 days in Iraq   Money being spent in Iraq could have substantially improved security at our nations portswhere 95  of cargo slips into the country without any inspection whatsoever  For the cost of three days of operations in Iraq  we could fund a years worth of strong port security initiatives  purchasing radiation detectors  giving individual grants tailored to the specific needs of each port  and drastically increasing the number of containers screened   Heres an example  Theres something called a Container Security Device  It attaches to the hinges of a container and lets inspectors at ports know if the container has been tampered with  They cost about  25 each  You could provide a device for every one of the 11 million plus containers that enter our ports every year for the same money it costs us to be in Iraq for one single day   Thats what the war costs  Electronic security for every container entering the United States  Versus one day in Iraq   And as we consider the Commerce  Justice and Science appropriations bill  this is as good a time as any to discuss how funding for the Iraq War impacts local police here at home   With the billions of dollars going toward a failed effort to secure the streets of Baghdad  we could boost our efforts to fight violence and the terror of gangs on the streets of the neighborhoods we call home  The FBI tells us that crime rates are going up in the United States   Thats no coincidence  considering the Bush Administration has repeatedly cut federal funding for hiring new police  law enforcement technology  and successful prevention programs   The Senate is taking action to reverse this situation  I was proud to co sponsor Sen  Bidens amendment  which was adopted  to boost funding for the COPS program  one of the most successful federal crime prevention programs in history  8 hours of Iraq funding would pay for that amendment   Thats what the war costs  More police on the streets  Versus 8 hours in Iraq   When it comes to our money  the message the administration is sending us is clear  Were spending it over there so we dont spend it here  In terms of security  If we had never gone into Iraq  our lives would be better  And the sooner we get out of Iraq  the better our lives will be   The costs of the war for the United States are only going to escalate as Great Britain withdraws its troops  So the financial question we have to answer as a nation is as urgent as any we have ever faced  We have to decide what we value as a nation  The war  Or keeping our country safe
