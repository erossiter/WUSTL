October 22  2007      WASHINGTON  The College Board today released its annual report on college costs and student aid  revealing that the average cost of tuition and fees at public four year colleges in New Jersey increased by 7 percent to  9 984 for 2007 08  the second highest in the nation  The College Board also released annual statistics on student aid  which showed that many of the federal student grants and loans have increased only marginally or have decreased over the past five years  when adjusted for inflation   U S  Senator Bob Menendez  D NJ  today said that the report is further evidence of the importance of the landmark College Cost Reduction and Access Act passed by Congress last month  The new law makes available nearly  20 billion in new grant aid for students  including  434 million for New Jersey students over the next five school years and  114 8 million in additional loan aid for New Jersey students over the next five years      As college becomes more expensive each year  it becomes even more important that a quality education isnt placed out of the reach of students who want it  said Menendez  A good education is the great equalizer in our society  With the landmark college affordability legislation passed by this Congress  I expect that more students who otherwise couldnt afford college will be able to get the education they want and need to be competitive in this global economy  We have made education a priority with this investment  and it will benefit not only todays college students but also the progress and prosperity of our nation
