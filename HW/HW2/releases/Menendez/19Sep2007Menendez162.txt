on Senate floor in favor of proposal to support the troops by ensuring they have time to recover at home   Wednesday  September 19  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today spoke out on the Senate floor in favor of the Webb Hagel amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill  an amendment that would ensure troops have time at home equal to their previous tour overseas  The amendment is meant to address the issues of troops wearing down from extended tours in Iraq and the militarys long term ability to deal with other international threats  This is about preserving the troops  enhancing their abilities and  in the long term  being able to continue to enlist people who want to serve their country and who bear the overwhelming burden of the national security of the United States  said Menendez  a co sponsor of the amendment  We are providing here a plan to fully support our troops who volunteered to put their lives on the line for our country  Our brave troops answered the call of duty  Let us now do what is right by them  Full  unofficial transcript of Menendezs floor statement   12 22 58 NSP   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   MR  MENENDEZ  MR  PRESIDENT  I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE WEBB HAGEL AMENDMENT  BOTH OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY NOT ONLY IN THE SENATE  BUT ALSO IN UNIFORM AND THEY HAVE DONE SO HONORABLY  SO THEY SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE  AND I FOR ONE DON T QUESTION THEIR SINCERITY OF PURPOSE  I DON T KNOW WHAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE SENATE    HOW THEY DECIDE ON HOW THEY LL CAST THEIR VOTE  BUT I DON T QUESTION THEIR SINCERITY OF PURPOSE OF WHAT THEY ARE DRIVING AT  THIS IS ABOUT  12 23 28   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   PRESERVING OUR TROOPS  ENHANCING THEIR ABILITIES  AND IN THE LONG TERM  BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ENLIST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY WHO BEAR THE OVERWHELMING BURDEN OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES BY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION  THAT S WHAT I BELIEVE THAT SENATOR WEBB IS DOING  AND THAT S WHY I JOIN HIM STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF HIS AMENDMENT AS WELL AS SENATOR HAGEL S  THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE COURAGEOUS EFFORTS OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM  THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE CARE AND SAFETY OF OUR  12 24 04   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   TROOPS  THE CARE AND SAFETY OF OUR TROOPS NOW  BUT I WOULD ARGUE NOT ONLY NOW  BUT FOR THE LONG TERM  THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS AMENDMENT IS ONLY WITH NOW  TO CHANGE THE CURRENT COURSE OF EVENTS  I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENT HAS LONG STANDING IMPORT  NOW AND FOR THE LONG TERM  IT SETS OUR POLICY AS TO WHERE WE RE GOING TO BE HEADED IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS  THE RESPITES THAT THEY NEED  THE ABILITY FOR US TO SUSTAIN A VOLUNTARY ARMY UNDER ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES  THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN THE SENATE TO IGNORE POLITICS AND WORK TOGETHER ON BEHALF OF OUR TR TROOPS  THIS AMENDMENT SIMPLY SAYS  12 24 41   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   THAT OUR TROOPS SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST  AT LEAST THE SAME TIME AT HOME AS THEY SPEND ABROAD  DEPLOYED ABROAD  AND IT ENSURES THAT NO UNIT  INCLUDING THE NATIONAL GUARD  WHICH ARE CLEARLY CITIZEN SOLDIERS AND WHO HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO FAR BEYOND WHAT THEY    MANY OF THEM THOUGHT THEY WERE EVER GOING TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO ON BEHALF OF THEIR NATION  WOULD GET THE SAME TREATMENT  THIS AMENDMENT SIMPLY SAYS THAT AFTER 4 1 2 YEARS OF BRAVELY FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY  WE MUST HONOR THE SACRIFICE  12 25 15   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   OF THE TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES  AND THIS AMENDMENT SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE  UNDERLINE TAKING CARE  OF OUR TROOPS  WE BELIEVE WE MUST PROTECT OUR TROOPS FIGHTING IN COMBAT NOW JUST AS WE MUST TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS WHEN THEY RETURN HOME FROM COMBAT  LET ME BE CLEAR  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS AMENDMENT TIES THE HANDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE CASE OF A CLEAR THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY  SENATOR WEBB HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE IN PROVIDING A FAIR  12 25 50   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   AND REASONABLE WAIVER FOR THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS A WAIVER FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN SERVICE WHO WANT TO VOLUNTEER TO RETURN EARLY  IF THEY WANT TO RETURN  IF THEY FEEL THEY ARE READY TO RETURN  THEY LL BE ABLE TO DO SO AND PROVIDE THE CONTINUED LEADERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING  AND I M SURE THAT MANY MAY  BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE ARE MANY WHO MAY FEEL THEY CANNOT DO THAT  AND SO THEREFORE THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM AT THE OPTIMUM IS NOT BEING PRESERVED UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES  THIS AMENDMENT ALSO RESPONDS TO SPECIFIC  12 26 24   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   CONCERNS RAISED BY THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND OTHER MILITARY LEADERS  IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TIME FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD  FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD THAT IS WELL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS NECESSARY  IT ALSO PROVIDES A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FOR SPECIAL OPERATION FORCES SINCE THE NATURE OF THEIR DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE IS MUCH DIFFERENT  SO I THINK SENATOR WEBB HAS LISTENED AND RESPONDED SINCE THE LAST TIME HE OFFERED THIS AMENDMENT  AS HAS SENATOR HAGEL  NOW  UNFORTUNATELY  THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS TAKEN A TERRIBLE TOLL ON OUR  12 26 55   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   MILITARY  I M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR GROUND FORCES  I M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SY SYNDROME  WHICH COME OUT OF EXTENDED AND REPEATED DEPLOYMENTS  I M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXPERIENCED SERVICE MEMBERS AND OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT NEW FORCES  CLEARLY  IF SOMEONE IS LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT TO BE ENGAGED IN ADDITION TO THEIR GREAT DESIRE TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY  AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE FAMILY  THEY RE GOING TO BE LO LOOKING AT WELL  HOW ARE THESE DEPLOYMENTS TAKING PLACE AND ARE THEY TAKING PLACE IN SUCH A  12 27 30   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   WAY THAT I CAN RESPOND TO MY DESIRE TO SERVE  BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN MY FAMILY  THAT S WHY WE HAVE TO PASS THIS AMENDMENT  IT S ABOUT NOW AND THE LONG TE TERM  NOW  SOME HERE HAVE ARGUED THAT CONGRESS SHOULD NOT INTERFERE  BUT YOU KNOW  THE FOUNDING FATHERS PUT IT RIGHT UP THERE EARLY IN THE CONSTITUTION  THEY DIDN T WAIT FOR VARIOUS LATER ARTICLES  THEY PUT IT RIGHT UP THERE  ARTICLE 1  SECTION 8 OF THE  12 28 02   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   CONSTITUTION  WHERE THEY GAVE THE CONGRESS THE RIGHT  THE POWER TO MAKE RULES FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATION OF THE LAND AND NAVAL FORCES  NOW  I VE HEARD OTHER STATUTORY REFERENCES HERE  BUT NONE OF THOSE STATUTORY REFERENCES HAVE THE POWER TO UNDERMINE THE CONSTITUTION  THE CONSTITUTION IS SUPREME  IT COMES FIRST ABOVE ALL OTHER ACTS  AND SO THEREFORE  THE FOUNDERS UNDERSTOOD HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR THE CONGRESS TO HAVE THE ROLE TO MAKE RULES FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND REGULATION OF THE LAND AND NAVAL FORCES  AND THEY PUT IT UP EARLY IN THE  12 28 35   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   CONSTITUTION TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR  THOSE WHO WISH TO IGNORE OR REJECT THAT PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION  IN MY MIND  UNDERMINE THE CONSTITUTION BY DOING SO  NOW  THIS PRESIDENT OFTEN ACTS LIKE THE ONLY ROLE FOR THE CONGRESS IS TO PROVIDE A BLANK CHECK FOR HIS FAILED WAR POLICY  I BELIEVE HE IS DEFINITELY WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT THE CONGRESS  ONLY ROLE IS TO PROVIDE A BLANK CHECK  THAT IS NOT THE ROLE OF THE CONGRESS  AS A MATTER OF FACT  THAT WOULD BE AN ABDICATION OF THE DUTIES  12 29 09   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONGRESS IN ITS ROLE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  WE HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BOTH IN NATIONAL TR TREASURES AND  MOST IMPORTANTLY  IN LIVES  AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM  THIS AMENDMENT BEFORE US REFLECTS THE REALITY ON THE GROUND AND THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY  THE WELFARE OF THOSE SACRIFICING THE MOST  I VE HEARD A LOT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE TIME I VE BEEN HERE IN THE SENATE AND BEFORE IN THE HOUSE ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR  12 29 40   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   TROOPS  WELL  WE ARE PROVIDING HERE A PLAN TO FULLY SUPPORT OUR TROOPS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR OUR COUNTRY  SENATOR WEBB HAS REFERRED TO T THE MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION S UNUSUAL OR ACTION OF SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT  I THINK WE NEED TO LISTEN TO   NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE SENATE PROCEEDINGS   WE BELIEVE THIS IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE  AND IT COMES FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN SERVING  I VE HEARD SO OFTEN OUR COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT LET S LISTEN TO THOSE ON THE GROUND  WELL  THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THOSE IN BOOTS IN SERVICE   OUR BRAVE TROOPS HAVE ANSWERED THE CALL OF DUTY  LET US NOW ANSWER THE CALL TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT BY THEM  I URGE ALL OF OUR  12 30 38   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT  IT GOES TO THE HEART OF HOW WE TRULY HONOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING OUR COUNTRY  SACRIFICING FOR OUR COUNTRY  AND  IN MY MI MIND  WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SU SUPPORTING THE TROOPS AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR LONG TERM SECURITY CAN BE PRESERVED AND ENHANCED  IT GOES TO THE VERY CORE OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO TREAT THEM IN THEIR SERVICE  THAT S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT SENATOR WEBB S AND  12 31 13   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT   SENATOR HA HAGEL S AMENDMENT  AND I HOPE ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WILL DO SO AS WELL  AND WITH THAT  MR  PRESIDENT  I YIELD THE FLOOR
