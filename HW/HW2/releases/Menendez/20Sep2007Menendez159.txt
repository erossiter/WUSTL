September 20  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  today spoke on the Senate floor in favor of the Feingold Reid amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill  an amendment that would require the president to redeploy troops from Iraq by June 30  2008    Audio of speech  call in actuality information at bottom of release     Excerpts of speech   On Return on Success  The reality is that A Return on Success is just Staying the Course by a different name  Weve tried this road  weve gone down it for four and a half years  with no turn of the wheel     Going down this road has diverted attention from Osama bin Laden  who is back in business and roaming free in a safe zone along the Afghanistan Pakistan border  It has fomented terrorism  creating a training ground in Iraq and allowing al Qaeda to regroup to its strongest level since 9 11  according to intelligence estimates  It has stretched our military thin  wearing down troops serving extended tours  depleting our reserves and national guard  and compromising national security with a diminished preparedness to tackle other international threats  It has cost us dearly in national treasure and  most importantly  precious lives    Going down this road has not brought stability to Iraq nor made us any safer at home  It is clear we are being driven down a dead end street by an administration without a roadmap for a lasting peace    On purpose of Feingold amendment  A majority of Congress and a overwhelming majority of the American public has long been unified behind a course of action that we believe gives us the best chance for success and security  both in Iraq and here at home  And that is the purpose of this amendment  A responsible transition of our mission and withdrawal of our troops from Iraq on one hand gives a sense of urgency to the Iraqi government and security forces that is currently absent Until they actually believe we wont be there forever  they will not take control of their country   At the same time  bringing our troops home allows our overburdened military to regroup  It allows us to have capability to respond to other threats in the world that might arise  It allows the replenishment of our National Guard  which is currently stretched so thin that response to disasters in the homeland has been affected  Most important about our plan and this amendment  it allows American families who have been separated and stressed by an ill conceived war  to be made whole again  The alternative is an endless occupation in Iraq with more American blood spilled and no light at the end of the tunnel  On war in historical context   Future generations will harshly judge this war policy and the choice to continue it indefinitely  they will still be paying the price  We have another opportunity  here today  to write an ending to this sad chapter  to turn the page and recommit to strengthening the military and targeting Osama bin Laden  We have the opportunity to change history for the better     FULL TEXT OF SPEECH  AS PREPARED   M  President  I rise as one who has voted against this war from the beginning in strong support of the Feingold Reed amendment  The last time we gathered here to vote on a change of course in Iraq was July 18  two months ago  Since that day  the Iraqi parliament  with its country in the grips of a civil war and with much work to do to achieve political reconciliation  took a month long vacation  Since that day  four bombs were set off in concert in northern Iraq  leaving more than 500 dead  the deadliest coordinated attack since the beginning of the war  Since that day  despite a much ballyhooed cease fire in Al Anbar  Shiekh Abu Risha  our main ally in the province  was murdered a mere 10 days after he shook hands with President Bush  Since that day in July when we last had a chance to change course  another 160 sons and daughters of America have lost their lives in Iraq  Another 160 flag draped caskets flown to Dover  Another 160 renditions of Taps played at tear soaked funerals  Another 160 American families that will have an empty seat at the table come Thanksgiving   So here we are again  The calendar changes  but the challenge does not  Yet again  we meet here on the Senate floor to consider another proposal to responsibly and safely transition our mission in Iraq and bring our troops home out of another countrys civil war  Yet again  as we have heard many times before through the course of this failed war policy  the president and his loyalists in this chamber are using that tired refrain  the plan is working  it needs more time  we cannot leave  Now  as then  these words ring hollow  The administration that brought us  the search for WMDs  the cakewalk   and last throes is now pitching A Return on Success  But this president lost his credibility on Iraq about the time he stood on an aircraft carrier underneath a banner reading Mission Accomplished almost four and a half long years ago  The administration may be shopping a new catch phrase  but we are not buying anything they are selling anymore   The President  armed with questionable statistics  has presented us an open ended  no exit plan for the sons and daughters of America who continue to fight and die in Iraq    The reality is that A Return on Success is just Staying the Course by a different name  Weve tried this road  weve gone down it for four and a half years  with no turn of the wheel  Going down this road has diverted attention from Osama bin Laden  who is back in business and roaming free in a safe zone along the Afghanistan Pakistan border   It has fomented terrorism  creating a training ground in Iraq and allowing al Qaeda to regroup to its strongest level since 9 11  according to intelligence estimates   It has stretched our military thin  wearing down troops serving extended tours  depleting our reserves and national guard  and compromising national security with a diminished preparedness to tackle other international threats  It has cost us dearly in national treasure and  most importantly  precious lives  Going down this road has not brought stability to Iraq nor made us any safer at home  It is clear we are being driven down a dead end street by an administration without a roadmap for a lasting peace  And now they expect the American people to buy the no exit occupation they are selling  The deployment of more than 100 000 American troops for as far in the future as the eye can see  No end in sight  Today  we are living with the consequences of the Administrations failed policy   Over 3 700 troops have been killed in Iraq since the beginning of the war  including 97 service members with ties to New Jersey    We have now spent over  450 billion on the war in Iraq  with a burn rate of  10 billion a month    Frankly  I never believed the Administrations estimate that the so called surge would only cost  5 6 billion and these new numbers only prove once again that we have been misled    Despite the meager improvements in the Anbar province cited in General Petraeus report last week  the situation in Iraq continues to grow worse    Sectarian violence surrounding Baghdad has surged this past week in connection with the holy month of Ramadan    At least 22 people have been killed in a series of bombings and shootings in Diyala and Kirkuk    Moreover  General William Caldwell has reported that there is evidence that Sunni extremist groups in Iraq have been receiving funds from Iran    And in terms of reconstruction  oil production in Iraq is still lower than it was before the war and Baghdad is getting approximately 7 hours of electricity a day  significantly less than before the war  How can we be expected to support a war plan about which every independent report portrays a situation of chaos  far away from stability or political reconciliation  In fact  according to the latest report card on Iraqi progress  the presidents war policy is still flunking  Even if the debatable metrics used to compile the report are solid  half of the benchmarks have not even seen a minimal amount of progress  Half  And now that its clear that the benchmarks are perhaps impossible to achieve with our current strategy  we see a concerted effort to play down their importance  In General Petraeuss testimony it was evident   the original goals of the escalation  to give the Iraqi government and political factions breathing room to achieve reconciliation  have not been met   The benchmarks are now an afterthought and success is being measured in different and less stringent terms  Its a recurring pattern that no longer fools anyone  make a bold proclamation  fail to meet expectations  change the discussion  Moving the goal posts may appease some in this chamber  but it does not help us achieve the lasting peace that is ultimately more important   And when all else fails  the president and his supporters often respond to rightful criticism of their disastrous war plan with a question meant to change the subject  well  where are your ideas  But what they fail to realize is that a majority of Congress and a overwhelming majority of the American public has long been unified behind a course of action that we believe gives us the best chance for success and security  both in Iraq and here at home  And that is the purpose of this amendment  A responsible transition of our mission and withdrawal of our troops from Iraq on one hand gives a sense of urgency to the Iraqi government and security forces that is currently absent  Until they actually believe we wont be there forever  they will not take control of their country   At the same time  bringing our troops home allows our overburdened military to regroup   It allows us to have capability to respond to other threats in the world that might arise  It allows the replenishment of our National Guard  which is currently stretched so thin that response to disasters in the homeland has been affected  Just yesterday  it was announced that half of the Army National Guard in my home state of New Jersey  thats 6 200 soldiers  will be deployed as soon as late next year  almost two years before the deployment was originally scheduled   That will leave our National Guard at half strength in a state at serious risk for a terrorist attack  Thats 6 200 soldiers taken away from their loved ones to be tossed into another countrys civil war  Most important about our plan and this amendment  it allows American families who have been separated and stressed by an ill conceived war  to be made whole again   The alternative is an endless occupation in Iraq with more American blood spilled and no light at the end of the tunnel   M  President  throughout this war  many have drawn the obvious parallels between this failed war policy and another quagmire 40 years ago  The comparison is valid and important  It is said that those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it  Because I fear history is being repeated  I want to draw upon the words of Robert Kennedy  who served in this chamber and delivered this statement about the Vietnam War in March of 1968   He said   We are entitled to ask    we are required to ask    how many more men  how many move lives  how much more destruction will be asked  to provide the military victory that is always just around the corner  to pour into this bottomless pit of our dreams   But this question the Administration does not and cannot answer  It has no answer    none but the ever expanding use of military force and the lives of our brave soldiers  in a conflict where military force has failed to solve anything in the past   M  President  our past teaches us that our current struggle and our current predicament are best solved by a new course  Future generations will harshly judge this war policy and the choice to continue it indefinitely they will still be paying the price   We have another opportunity  here today  to write an ending to this sad chapter  to turn the page and recommit to strengthening the military and targeting Osama bin Laden    We have the opportunity to change history for the better  I urge my colleagues to begin that change today and vote for a new course in Iraq     Call in actuality info   800  511 0763 Actuality number is 1648
