December 6  2007      WASHINGTON  As President Bush today prepares to announce his administrations plan regarding the mortgage crisis  Senator Bob Menendez  D NJ  spoke on the Senate floor in response to reports of that plan and to assert his intention to push for provisions in Congressional legislation that would hold Wall Street accountable for purchasing bad subprime loans  Senator Menendez  a member of the Senate Banking Committee  today said he supports the spirit of Bush plan  but that reports of numerous limitations within the plan will prevent enough Americans from getting much needed relief  He also announced that he is working with Banking Committee Chairman Dodd to write a strong subprime bill  Senator Menendez is pushing for it to include so called assignee liability provisions to increase accountability for the secondary market  the trusts on Wall Street that helped exacerbate the rise of subprime loans  He said he believes this will lead to greater accountability and will guide Wall Street to view loans that are purchased with greater scrutiny    Excerpt on Bush subprime plan from Menendez speech  While I applaud the President for taking a step in the right direction  this plan simply does not seem to go far enough  I strongly support this concept  but Im concerned that it will not help enough homeowners  Depending on the details of this planon how they determine who is eligiblemany homeowners may be left in the cold  A strictly narrow approach will keep relief out of reach for many who need it    I am concerned about that family next in line when they close the door on eligibility  I am concerned about the millions of Americans who cannot pay their bills  And I am concerned that President Bushs plan will only help a fraction of the families at risk    Excerpt on assignee liability from Menendez speech    Essentially this kind of loan is a hot potatoit gets tossed from the broker to the lender to the trustee  Along the way  each one wipes their hands of responsibility after they send the loan on down the chain  And when a bad deal is made  each one points the finger at the previous owner  Well  it is time to stop passing the buck  And  for me  the buck must stop with Wall Street    We cannot allow Wall Street to purchase loans without scrutinizing the details of that loan  If the trustee had to make sure each loan was a good loanthat it meets certain specific standards and practicesand the lender had to make sure it was a good loan  the brokers would have to stop making bad loans because they wouldnt be able to sell them if they did    That is why I support a strong liability standard  If a loan is made illegally or contains illegal terms  the homeowner should be able to sue the owner of their loanotherwise who do they hold accountable  Their broker and lender could both be long gonenearly a hundred subprime lenders have gone out of business in the last year aloneand then where does the borrower go to for protectionthey have to be able to reach the holder of the loan    Without assignee liability  a subprime bill has no teeth  Yes  of course  we need stronger broker and lender standards  but we also need a standard for Wall Street    Let me be clear  I am not talking about holding specific investors accountable  who act much like shareholders in a public company  They would see a reduction in the value of their stock if the company experienced financial losses  but would not be personally responsible for those losses  I am talking about the trustthe company who owns the loan  That is who must be liable    This is not a popular provision that I am calling forbut I think it is the right thing to do  We are in a crisis here in America and it is going to take bold decisions to get this system back on track    Full text of Menendez speech    Statement of Senator Robert Menendez On the Mortgage Crisis December 2007   M  President  today I rise on behalf of more than 130 000 New Jersey homeowners who have a subprime mortgage  I rise on behalf of the seven million American homeowners with a subprime mortgage  And I rise on behalf of the more than two million Americans who are or may be facing foreclosure in coming years  M  President  this is a national crisis  and the time to respond is now    Families across this country are having their homes ripped from their grasp and there is no end in sight  Some have been saying that the storm is over  and others have been sitting silently as the black clouds roll by  but the reality is that this storm is going to get worse  More families are going to be facing foreclosure  more homes are going to be lost  and more damage is going to be done to our economy unless we act  There is no point in letting an invisible hand guide this destruction  If we have any sense of human compassion  we will help these families    Many families are in trouble because they got a deal they didnt understand  a loan they couldnt afford  and now their adjustable rate mortgages are resetting  But these families are just the beginning  The storm is only going to get worse   chart   Many of the adjustable rate mortgages that were made in 2006 will explode with higher interest rates sometime in 2008  And another type of adjustable rate mortgages  known as payment option  are set to explode after that    Already  foreclosure rates have doubled and tripled in many areas  Hundreds of thousands of families are already losing their homes  Over the next year  absent strong action  the wave will build into a mortgage tsunami  Not only will families lose their homes  often the largest asset they have  but the ripple effects will devastate neighborhoods and the broader economy    If we do not act now to help these families  the effect will be catastrophic  We can see the storm coming  we know the damage it will cause  so we had better reinforce our levies    In Congress we should be working to help hundreds of thousands of homeowners modify their mortgages to avoid foreclosure  We should be working to pass a bill that will help homeowners modify their loan in a bankruptcy proceeding  And we must pass  over Republican objections  legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration  But this is just the beginning    Banks and lenders  without the prodding of Congress  should be reaching out to help these troubled homeowners renegotiate their loan terms  This isnt a suggestion  this is an expectation    And President Bush is announcing today his plan to address this crisis  He has reached an agreement with major mortgage firms to freeze interest rates for five years for financially troubled homeowners  While I applaud the President for taking a step in the right direction  this plan simply does not seem to go far enough  It seems to operate under the assumption that we only have to do what is minimally necessary  Depending on the details of this plan  on how they determine who is eligible  many homeowners may be left in the cold  A strictly narrow approach will keep relief out of reach for many who need it    I am concerned about the family next in line when they close the door on eligibility  I am concerned about the millions of Americans who cannot pay their bills  And I am concerned that President Bushs plan will only help a fraction of the families at risk    Hardworking families are in crisis in America  and in a time of crisis they expect strong and bold leadership to help them through  We need to provide that leadership  Congress  the administration  and industry all have key role to play to help these families    But what about the families that have yet to sign that stack of papers to get their mortgage loan  What about when my daughter or son buys their first home  Or  what about the homeowner who needs to refinance out of an unsustainable mortgage  In order to protect those families  we need to make sure that we stop predatory lending before it starts    As a member of the Senate Banking Committee  I have repeatedly said that in order to prevent the mortgage crisis from happening again  we need to find the root of the problem and fix it  That requires all partiesall partiesto step up to the plate and admit where they went wrong  A not me attitude will simply not workeverybody who was responsible must be held accountable  I am proud to be working with Chairman Dodd on a bill that will hold all parties accountable    When I considered what I hoped to see in a final bill  I looked at all these responsible partiesfrom the regulators to the lenders to the broker and beyondbut one particular piece concerned me  the secondary market    In order to understand what I am talking about  I think it might help to step back for a moment and walk through the life of a subprime loan    A consumer decides to seek a loan to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage  or  more likely  a broker or lender approaches a consumer about a new loan  As soon as the loan settles  the broker gets a commission from both the consumer and the lender  Now heres where the secondary market comes in  Within 90 days after the consumer signs those settlement papers  the lender sells the loan into the secondary marketessentially selling the loan to Wall Street  That lender then washes its hands of the loan but keep the fees  regardless of what happens later on    Once in the secondary market  the loan is bundled with thousands of other loans into what we call a mortgage backed security  This bundle of loans then passes through one or more corporate entities on its way to the trust where it will reside  The trust is usually a private company within an investing firm  The trust then slices these bundles of loans into different categories  called tranches  and investors purchase security interests in the tranches    The trust is considered the owner of the loan  and the investors are represented by a Trustee that acts on behalf of the trust  A servicerpossibly the original lender  possibly another companyservices the loans on behalf of the trustmeaning they collect and remit payments  monitor the accounts and providing monthly reports to the Trustee  Because the servicer is the only one in direct contact with the homeowner  most homeowners think the servicer is actually the owner of their loan    If the home goes into foreclosure  it is the trust that foreclosesbut for the homeowner  they may not know who is foreclosing on them  Even if a homeowner had a predatory loan and has a good argument against foreclosure  if that homeowner cannot identify the owner of their loan and hold them liable  they cannot save their home    That is the life of a loan  And it is no wonder its a process that few understand  Essentially the loan is a hot potatoit gets tossed from the broker to the lender to the trustee  Along the way  each one wipes their hands of responsibility after they send the loan on down the chain  And when a bad deal is made  each one points the finger at the previous owner  Well  it is time to stop passing the buck  And  for me  the buck must stop with Wall Street    We cannot allow Wall Street to purchase loans without scrutinizing the details of that loan  If the trustee had to make sure each loan was a good loanthat it meets certain specific standards and practicesand the lender had to make sure it was a good loan  the brokers would have to stop making bad loans because they wouldnt be able to sell them if they did    That is why I support a strong liability standard  If a loan is made illegally or contains illegal terms  the homeowner should be able to sue the owner of their loanotherwise who do they hold accountable  Their broker and lender could both be long gonenearly a hundred subprime lenders have gone out of business in the last year aloneand then where does the borrower go to for protectionthey have to be able to reach the holder of the loan    Without assignee liability  a subprime bill has no teeth  Yes  of course  we need stronger broker and lender standards  but we also need a standard for Wall Street    Let me be clear  I am not talking about holding specific investors accountable  who act much like shareholders in a public company  They would see a reduction in the value of their stock if the company experienced financial losses  but would not be personally responsible for those losses  I am talking about the trustthe company who owns the loan  That is who must be liable    This is not a popular provision that I am calling forbut I think it is the right thing to do  We are in a crisis here in America and it is going to take bold decisions to get this system back on track    These arent just kinks that are going to work themselves out  We have seen that the industry isnt just going to police itself  Voluntary changes are needed  but the bottom line is  without accountability  we are not going to see responsible behavior    As I said at the opening of this speech  I am standing up today for the American homeowner  If we want to prevent a similar problem from happening again in 5 or 10 years time  our final subprime bill must hold Wall Street accountable  There are steps we must take today in order to help tomorrows homeownerswe cannot just kick the can down the road  Lets make sure our homeowners can get fair  sustainable mortgages  and that future homeowners are not caught in a future subprime storm  Enough is enoughit is time for real changes    I have enjoyed working with Chairman Dodd on this issue over the past few months and look forward  under his leadership  to passing a strong subprime lending bill to help millions of American families    Thank you and I yield the floor
