IMMIGRATION REFORM OUTLINES HIS VISION ON THE SENATE FLOOR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Menendez speaks about challenges  solutions and problems with the immigration deal   Wednesday  May 23  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today took to the Senate floor to outline his vision for comprehensive immigration reform  Menendez  a key negotiator in this year s closed door Senate meetings on immigration reform  has voiced strong opposition to the agreement     Nation of Immigrants  Menendez  the American born son of Cuban immigrants  spoke of America s rich history of immigration     Whether your family was part of the men and women who made the voyage on the Mayflower  part of the millions who stepped off a ship at Ellis Island  part of those who were brought to this nation against their own will  or if  like my own parents  you came to this country fleeing tyranny and searching for freedom  we all have a connection to immigration     History of Intolerance  While recognizing that there are many examples of America being a welcoming nation  Menendez cited examples showing how intolerance towards immigrants has infected the public discussion throughout history  For example  Henry J  Gardner  the Governor of Massachusetts in the middle of the nineteenth century  saw the Irish as a  horde of foreign barbarians       Today  we continue to hear hateful rhetoric used to polarize and divide our country on this issue   said Menendez   But  we must never allow ourselves to buy into the rhetoric   we must never subscribe to the policies of fear and division driven by xenophobia  nativism  and racism    Broken System  Need for Reform  Menendez discussed the need for reform of the immigration system  and the threat that without federal legislation  local governments would enact their own ordinances  many of which would violate constitutional equal protection guarantees and create a sense of division in the community      On this issue  we must be completely honest with ourselves   Our country s immigration system is unarguably broken   said Menendez   In light of these failures  we must enact tough  smart  and comprehensive immigration reform that reflects current economic and social realities  respects the core values of family unity and fundamental fairness  and upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants    Border Security              Menendez reiterated the need for tougher border security that would curtail unauthorized crossings at the border  stop human trafficking  and protect both undocumented immigrants and American workers from those wishing to exploit undocumented labor  However  he emphasized that history has proven that enforcement only measures are unsuccessful       Our goal should be neither open borders nor closed borders  but smart borders   said Menendez   The specter of terrorism in a post September 11 world creates an even greater imperative for us to succeed in this endeavor   And succeed we must   since one of the most basic responsibilities the government has is to provide for the safety and security of its people    Worker Protection  Menendez stressed the need to crack down on companies that illegally hire undocumented workers  and noted the current administration s failures on holding employers accountable  He cited the example that in 1999 alone 417 businesses were cited for immigrant violations  whereas in 2004 a mere three employers were issued notices of intent to fine by the Bush administration for similar violations    Unscrupulous companies that intentionally hire undocumented immigrants do so because they know they can exploit these people without fear of retribution   said Menendez   They know this because undocumented immigrants are forced to hide in the shadows of society and subsequently have no avenues to report labor abuses    Pathway to Citizenship              Menendez noted that to make the immigration system workable  a practical  fair and humane system must be enacted that encourages immigrants to come out of the shadows and legalize their status  Otherwise  the most massive roundup and deportation of people in the history of the world would be required        By coupling enhanced enforcement efforts with new immigration and labor laws  we will not only regulate how workers come into our country  but finally give our border and law enforcement agencies a fighting chance to fulfill their duty    Family Reunification               Menendez stressed that as written  the current legislation would tear families apart and de emphasize family connections in immigration policy  The Senator noted that he would be introducing and co sponsoring a variety of amendments to address this fundamental issue      The deal struck virtually does away with provision for family reunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy throughout our history   said Menendez   This idea not only changes the spirit of our immigration policy  it also de emphasizes the family structure     Personal Connection              Menendez  the son of Cuban immigrants  noted that many of those serving in Congress have deep personal connections to immigration and  like himself  were born to immigrants who would probably not have qualified under the proposed legislation     This deal would have prevented my own parents   a carpenter and a seamstress   from coming to this country   said Menendez   I would like to think that they  like hundreds of millions of other immigrants who have helped build our nation  contributed to the strength and vitality of America     Full text of his comments as prepared for delivery   M  President    Nation of Immigrants  From the Congressional District that I had the honor of representing for over 13 years in the House of Representatives  one can see the Statute of Liberty   Ellis Island is a place that has been the gateway to opportunity for millions of new Americans   For me  it is a shining example of the power of the American dream  a place that launched millions down their own road to success       Whether your family was part of the men and women who made the voyage on the Mayflower  part of the millions who stepped off a ship at Ellis Island  part of those who were brought to this nation against their own will  or if  like my own parents  you came to this country fleeing tyranny and searching for freedom  we all have a connection to immigration     History of Intolerance  So  America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws   And history is replete with examples of the United States of America being a welcoming nation   Unfortunately  the public dialogue through the years has been less than welcoming   Over the decades  the influx of immigrants of various ethnicities have caused concerns and in many cases heated comments against such immigrants to our nation   In some cases  there were even laws enacted to limit or ban certain ethnicities from being able to come to the land of opportunity   Before the American Revolution  Founding Father Benjamin Franklin wrote of the influx of German immigrants to Philadelphia   Those who come hither are generally the most stupid of their own nation    Henry J  Gardner  the governor of Massachusetts in the middle of the nineteenth century  saw the Irish as a  horde of foreign barbarians    In 1882  Congress enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act  which made it nearly impossible for additional Chinese to enter America   The law was not repealed until 1943  in the middle of World War II  when the U S  and China were allies against Japan   In the early 1900s  H G  Wells  a British novelist  stated that the arrival of Eastern Europeans  Jews  and Italians would cause a  huge dilution of the American people with profoundly ignorant foreign peasants    Congressman Albert Johnson  R WA   co author of the Johnson Reed Immigration Act of 1924 said that  Our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood  with all its inherited misconceptions respecting the relationships of the governing power to the governed     The day of unalloyed welcome to all peoples  the day of indiscriminate acceptance of all races  has definitely ended     Finally a 1925 report of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce stated that Mexicans are suitable for agricultural work  due to their crouching and bending habits     while the white is physically unable to adapt himself to them     These are just a few statements from that past that have taken issue with and criticized the relatives and forefathers of various segments of our nation s populace today      We must all remember that just last Congress  the House of Representatives passed H R  4437  better known as the Sensenbrenner bill   Beyond the heated rhetoric that existed during the debate on that legislation  the bill itself was short sighted and even mean spirited and would have made felons out of anyone who was here in an undocumented status   The Sensenbrenner bill would have also criminalized citizens of the United States though a much broader definition of smuggling  that would have allowed the government to prosecute almost any American who has regular contact with undocumented immigrants     Today  we continue to hear hateful rhetoric used to polarize and divide our country on this issue  But  we must never allow ourselves to buy into the rhetoric   we must never subscribe to the policies of fear and division driven by xenophobia  nativism  and racism    So the responsibility is on all of us   not just Members of Congress  but everyone in this nation   We must reject the rhetoric of hatred  division  and polarization   We must demand a comprehensive immigration policy that does not denigrate or demonize   but is tough  smart  fair  and humane     Broken System  Need for Reform  However  on this issue  we must be completely honest with ourselves   Our country s immigration system is unarguably broken     In light of these failures  we must enact tough  smart  and comprehensive immigration reform that reflects current economic and social realities  respects the core values of family unity and fundamental fairness  and upholds our tradition as a nation of immigrants   In the absence of federal legislation  many local governments in New Jersey and across the nation are passing ordinances to address issues surrounding undocumented immigration in their communities   Unfortunately  many of these ordinances violate constitutional equal protection guarantees and create a sense of division in the community     In addition to the moral impetus  our society would greatly benefit economically if we enact comprehensive immigration reform    Such reform would allow undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows and fully pay their taxes  ensuring accurate Census counts  which translate into equitable funding levels for programs and schools   Additionally  we can reduce law enforcement demands since the need for day laborers  forged documents and driver s licenses  along with the use of exploitation and human trafficking  would largely be shut down     Those that don t come forward would then be focused on and we would be able to determine who is here to pursue the American Dream and who is here to destroy it   Border Security We need to aggressively curtail unauthorized crossings at the border  protect both undocumented immigrants and American workers from corporations exploiting undocumented labor  and provide a pathway for immigrants to earn   I repeat   earn permanent residency in order to ensure that our immigration system is safe  legal  orderly  and fair to all     Our goal should be neither open borders nor closed borders  but smart borders   The specter of terrorism in a post September 11 world creates an even greater imperative for us to succeed in this endeavor   And succeed we must   since one of the most basic responsibilities the government has is to provide for the safety and security of its people     Unfortunately  we are failing to uphold our end of the social contract   We have all heard about and seen the lawlessness along our borders   Crime in our border communities is increasing and overwhelming local law enforcement s ability to address these challenges   So called coyotes  or human smugglers  charge thousands of dollars to bring people into this country  creating a multi million dollar industry for organized criminal organizations to exploit and fuel their other illegal activities   In fact  several reports have indicated that there is more money in smuggling these undocumented immigrants into our nation than smuggling drugs   However  history proves that it is not enough to rely on enforcement only   Over the past two decades  the Federal government has tripled the number of Border Patrol agents and increased the enforcement budget ten fold   Despite these efforts  12 million individuals have overstayed their visas or are undocumented     Worker Protection  Securing our borders is the first step we must take to ensure an orderly  fair  and smart immigration system  but by no means is it adequate in isolation   We must also crack down on companies that illegally hire undocumented workers   something that is long overdue   Under the Clinton administration employers were held accountable for hiring undocumented workers as 417 businesses were cited for immigrant violations in 1999 alone   In contrast  a mere three   I repeat three   employers were issued notices of intent to fine by the Bush administration in 2004 for similar violations  making it 22 times more likely for an American to be killed by a strike of lightening in an average year than prosecuted for such labor violations     What happened in the span of those five years   Did companies suddenly decide to start abiding by the law by not hiring undocumented immigrants   The answer to this is obviously no   The truth of the matter is  similar to border enforcement  this administration made a conscious decision to look the other way  in order to once again serve the interests of corporate America  to the detriment of the average American citizen   That is why I support stronger immigration enforcement at not only our borders  but at the workplace too   Unscrupulous companies that intentionally hire undocumented immigrants do so because they know they can exploit these people without fear of retribution   They know this because undocumented immigrants are forced to hide in the shadows of society and subsequently have no avenues to report labor abuses   Not only does this hurt the immigrant being exploited  it also directly impacts American citizens who must compete in the market with exploited labor   We must immediately end these abuses and in doing so create an equal playing field to ensure that the wages  benefits  and health and labor standards of the American worker are not undercut     While securing our borders and enforcing strengthened workplace employment laws will enable us to regulate the influx of new immigrants  it does nothing to solve our current dilemma of an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants that currently reside in the U S   That is why our immigration policy must be about more than simply enforcement   it must also be about providing a safe  orderly  timely and legal process that deals with the economic realities of our time    Pathway to Citizenship  In order to make our immigration system workable  we must be practical  fair  and humane in dealing with the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U S   To do otherwise would require the most massive roundup and deportation of people in the history of the world   I believe that this is both highly unlikely and impractical on many levels  including due to both the budgetary and economic impact on our nation and its economy   Such a mass deportation of the undocumented population  even assuming 20 percent would leave voluntarily if such a policy was enacted  would cost at least  206 billion over a five year period according to the Center for American Progress    So  fully securing our borders is impossible unless efforts include a temporary guest worker program and a path to earned residence for undocumented immigrants    This solution will encourage immigrants to come out of the shadows and legalize their status   By doing so  we will learn who is here to seek the American dream versus who is here to destroy it through criminal or terrorist acts   Most of the people who cross our borders come looking for work  just as many of our ancestors did   These immigrants contribute to our economy  provide for their families and want a better life for their children     I am first and foremost in favor of hiring any American who is willing to do any job that is available in this country   But let s remember what jobs we re talking about   The fruits you had for breakfast were picked by the hands and bent back of an immigrant laborer   The hotel room and bathroom we use were likely cleaned with bended knee by an immigrant worker   The chicken you had for dinner yesterday was likely plucked by the cut up hands of an immigrant laborer   If you have an infirmed loved one  their daily necessities were probably tended to by the steady hands and warm heart of an immigrant aide   We must also create an equal playing field to ensure the wages  benefits  and health and labor standards of the American worker are not undercut   But it s also in our best interest to have these workers participate in and contribute to our society  especially with a mere 4 5  unemployment rate in April 2007 and a declining ratio of American workers to retirees   By coupling enhanced enforcement efforts with new immigration and labor laws  we will not only regulate how workers come into our country  but finally give our border and law enforcement agencies a fighting chance to fulfill their duty    Family Reunification M  President  I said throughout the negotiations that with a massive  complex bill like this one  the devil is in the details   There are a number of details in this deal that would create an unfair and impractical immigration system  undercutting the more sensible provisions    That is especially true when it comes to the issue of family   The deal struck virtually does away with provision for family reunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy throughout our history  This idea not only changes the spirit of our immigration policy  it also de emphasizes the family structure   And all without a SINGLE hearing on the issue of family in our immigration system by the Senate Judiciary Committee in either the 109th or the 110th Congresses    Under this bill  they change the fundamental values of our immigration policy by making an advanced degree or skill in a highly technical profession the most important criteria for a visa   This nation has been built by immigrants who came here to achieve success  but the deal tilts toward immigrants whose success stories are already written   Family reunification will be deemphasized under this deal  serving to tear families apart   From a moral perspective  this undermines the family values lawmakers so often talk about     As the late Pope John Paul II said   The Church in America must be a vigilant advocate  defending against any unjust restriction the natural right of individual persons to move freely within their own nation and from one nation to another   Attention must be called to the rights of migrants and their families and to respect for their human dignity    Practically speaking  a breakdown of family structure often leads to a breakdown of social stability   I took it to heart when President Bush said that  family values don t end at the Rio Grande   but this agreement  like his proposal before it  belies those words   Yet here we are with a piece of legislation which the White House supports that undermines the very essence of that  Even under a new point structure that is envisioned under this bill  it seems to me the essence of family should be given much more weight and points within the context of a whole new process of how we are going to move our immigration system forward   Family is a critical value  I believe  in our country   I would like to take a little time to get into some of the details in this agreement and how they would impact families     Parents Under current law  foreign born parents of U S  citizens are exempt from green card caps when applying for legal permanent residency as they fall in the immediate relatives category   Unfortunately  the agreement removes these individuals from the immediate relatives category and sets an annual cap for green cards for parents of US citizens at 40 000   Last year  120 000 visas were given to such parents and the annual average number of green cards issued over the past fives years to parents is 90 000  so this bill would slash required green cards by more than half   So  we are automatically creating a new backlog even though the bill is intended to end such family backlogs  LPRs Another area that would be negatively impacted under this deal are the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents   The bill before us does not lift the visa cap on the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents at all  actually it lowers it  ensuring that backlogs will continue indefinitely    The separation is not only unmoral  but it exacts an economic toll  as lawful immigrants who are productive members of society move out of the country to rejoin their families   Moreover  unification with immediate family members gives rise to an undesirable incentive to break the law and live in the U S  illegally   Point System The so called  Grand Bargain  also moves us to a point based immigration system  which would turn our current immigration system on its head   It is my understanding that a point system has not received a single hearing by the Judiciary Committee during my time in the United States Senate     Yet in the agreement  we are moving to a point system that is geared towards people with degrees that are highly skilled or educated   In fact  in the point system that is contained in the bill  family would receive NO points at all   NONE   unless the applicant has obtained at least 55 points through the employment  education  and English and civics parts of the new system   So much for family values     In addition  if the applicant does meet the 55 point threshold  they would be eligible for a maximum of 10 additional points   That is out of 100 maximum points   I guess that some that preach family values don t believe that family should count for more than 10    May 1  2005 Backlog This legislation also curtails the ability of American citizens or permanent residents to petition for their families to be reunified here in America     As I mentioned earlier  there is a family backlog of people that have applied for legal permanent residency who are claimed by U S  citizens   This legislation  as currently drafted  does away with several of the family categories such as adult children of U S  citizens and lawful permanent residents and siblings of citizens   These categories will be grandfathered in and dealt with as part of clearing the backlog during the first eight years only if they filed their application before May 1  2005      As a result  an estimated 833 000 people who have played by the rules and applied after that date will not be cleared as part of the family backlog and lose their chance to immigrate under current law   So  the legislation  as currently drafted  says that if you legally applied for a visa on or after May 1  2005  you have to compete to enter under a totally new system   It is an arbitrary date that was picked out of thin air   Let s think of how fundamentally unfair that is   Imagine you are a lawful permanent U S  resident and you have fought for your country  you may have shed blood for your country and in some cases  you may have died for your country   In fact  a non citizen  Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez  originally of Guatemala was the very first U S  combat casualty in the war with Iraq    LPRs are also protecting our airports  our seaports  and our borders  They risk their lives daily in Afghanistan  Iraq  and other places around the world to protect us here at home     You have petitioned to have your sister come to join you and live in America   Under this bill  you would lose that right if you filed on or after May 1  2005     It is hard to imagine that one would have that right taken away from them     Here is another case for you to consider   You are a U S  citizen and have paid your taxes  served your nation  attend your church  and make a good living   You have petitioned to have your adult child come to America  but did so after the arbitrary date of May 1  2005   Under this bill  the U S  citizen would lose that right   However  those who are undocumented in the country after that May 1  2005 date actually get a benefit   Hard to imagine  but it is true  So M  President  these are just a few of the many shortcomings that are contained in the bill that we consider today   Personal Connection  This deal would have prevented my own parents   a carpenter and a seamstress   from coming to this country  I would like to think that they  like hundreds of millions of other immigrants who have helped build our nation  contributed to the strength and vitality of America    As I have listened to the stories of so many of our fellow colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives  I know many of their parents would never have qualified to come to this country   It seems to me a new paradigm could have been structured where family values and reunification have more of a fighting chance than under the framework agreement that we consider   The story of this legislation is not finished   We still have the historic opportunity this week to craft tough  smart  and fair immigration reform   It is my intention  through a series of amendments that get to the heart of the issues I have mentioned  to help lead a charge to improve this deal on the Senate floor   I know many of my colleagues are committed to the same issues of practicality  fairness  and family values  and I will work with them to turn this unworkable deal into sound policy that we can all support     Conclusion As we have throughout our Nation s long and proud history  I believe we must create a pathway to the American dream for those who contribute to our nation and allow them to fully participate in our economy and society   As President Bush told Congress in his 2007 State of the Union speech   Let us have a serious  civil  and conclusive debate  so that you can pass  and I can sign  comprehensive immigration reform into law       It is a rare moment   but I agree with the President   Reform is long overdue     However we got here  from wherever we came  we know that we are now in the same boat together  as Americans   And together we must make this journey a safe  orderly  and legal process that preserves and fulfills the American Dream for all   M  President  I yield the floor
