AGAINST COLEMAN AMENDMENT

enforcement of immigration law above protecting the health and safety of communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thursday  May 24  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today voiced his objections to the amendment offered by Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007  Menendez spoke on the floor against the amendment  which would outlaw state and local policies that prevent their employees  including police and health and safety workers  from inquiring about the immigration status of those they serve if there is  probable cause  to believe the individual being questioned is an undocumented immigrant  The amendment provides no exception for policies that are necessary to protect the health and safety or promote the welfare of the community                Think of the potential chilling effect that this amendment could have on the willingness and ability of immigrant crime victims and witnesses   those that have been victims of domestic abuse  or those that may need emergency health care   to seek assistance if they feared that the result would be deportation rather than assistance   said Menendez               The Senator also discussed the amendment s potential to result in racial profiling   People who look or sound foreign will be the ones whose citizenship or immigration status will be questioned   said Menendez   Under this amendment  we are asking public hospital workers  teachers  police  social workers and all public employees to decide when there is probable cause to believe someone does not have lawful immigration status   That means treating anyone who looks or sounds foreign with suspicion  That s just plain wrong     Full text of Menendez comments  as prepared for delivery   M  President  as Ronald Reagan said   here we go again      Over the last several years  especially in the House of Representatives  there have been different pieces of legislation and amendments offered and debated that would deputize state and local police to enforce federal civil immigration law     The Coleman Bond amendment would effectively prohibit state and local government policies that seek to encourage crime reporting and witness cooperation by reassuring immigrant victims that police and other government officials will not inquire into their status   So  the amendment would end state and local policies that prevent their employees  including police and health and safety workers  from inquiring about the immigration status of those they serve if there is  probable cause  to believe the individual being questioned is undocumented     Many cities  counties and police departments around this country have decided that it s a matter of public health and safety NOT to ask about immigration status when people report crimes  or have been the victims of domestic abuse  or go to the hospital seeking emergency medical care   Currently  scores of cities and states across this nation have such confidentiality policies in place  some for upwards of twenty years   The point of these policies is to make sure immigrants report crimes and information to police  and do not stay silent for fear that their immigration status   or that of a loved one   could come under scrutiny if they contact the authorities   Think of the potential chilling effect that this amendment could have on the willingness and ability of immigrant crime victims and witnesses   those that have been victims of domestic abuse  or those that may need emergency health care   to seek assistance if they feared that the result would be deportation rather than assistance     That s why states and cities have passed local laws and set policies limiting when police and city and county employees can ask people to prove their immigration status     State and local police have long sought to separate their activities from those of federal immigration agents in order to enhance public safety  Why is that    Because when immigrant community residents begin to see state and local police as deportation agents  they stop reporting crimes and assisting in investigations  It undermines the trust and cooperation with immigrant communities that are essential elements of community oriented policing   There are numerous examples of police opposing such efforts    In fact  in 2005  Princeton  New Jersey Police Chief Anthony V  Federico said     Local police agencies depend on the cooperation of immigrants  legal and illegal  in solving all sorts of crimes and in the maintenance of public order  Without assurances that they will not be subject to an immigration investigation and possible deportation  many immigrants with critical information would not come forward  even when heinous crimes are committed against them or their families     So  the police understand that relationships of trust built with the immigrant community would be ruined overnight if this provision becomes law       This amendment could also cause millions of people in this country   not just immigrants   to think twice about getting the medical treatment they need   Why would we discourage individuals from receiving medical care     Let s think about the possible consequences for a second   If you are rolled into an emergency room and you do not have insurance  would there be  probable cause  to be asked whether or not you are here legally in the United States     Assume I get rolled into an emergency room  Mr  Menendez  or maybe someone who might even be described as more characteristically Hispanic  or maybe Asian  or some other group  and I do not happen to have insurance  as unfortunately 40 million Americans who are here as U S  citizens do not have  and I get asked whether or not I am a citizen of the United States     That would be shameful   You would not ask any other citizen that   But because I happen to have the misfortune of not having health insurance  you ask me   And of course those of us who look a certain way will for sure be asked     This amendment could also encourage racial profiling   People who look or sound foreign will be the ones whose citizenship or immigration status will be questioned     Under this amendment  we are asking public hospital workers  teachers  police  social workers and all public employees to decide when there is probable cause to believe someone does not have lawful immigration status   That means treating anyone who looks or sounds foreign with suspicion   That s just plain wrong      One could argue that the Coleman amendment is a coercive action against any State  municipality  or other entity to say to that State  municipality  or other entity they must do a series of things  such as obtaining information on a person s status  like my own  which I was born in this country   So much for State rights  So much for the local municipalities know best  So much for all I have listened to in my 15 years in Congress from my Republican colleagues speaking of State rights  of local rules  of States knowing best       We do not need a provision such as this   Current law already provides ample authority for state and local police to assist federal immigration agents in enforcing the law against criminals and terrorists   What they cannot do is start asking everyone they come across for their  papers      States and localities that do want to take on a broader role in immigration enforcement can enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with ICE  receive training in immigration law  and assist in enforcement operations under ICE supervision     M  President  this amendment would create fear in entire communities  and would inevitably deter not only undocumented immigrants  but also legal immigrants and citizens from seeking the medical care  protection from an abusive spouse  or assistance after a crime that they need so much   That is why I urge my colleagues to vote down this unnecessary amendment
