PROPOSAL TO OFFICIALLY PRESSURE CHINA ON GENOCIDE IN DARFUR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bipartisan  bicameral resolution calls on China to use ties to Sudanese regime  offers reminder of Beijing Olympics   Wednesday  May 16  2007      WASHINGTON   A new movement to pressure China to help stop the genocide in Darfur is being unveiled in Congress today  with support in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle  U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Sam Brownback  R KS   along with U S  Representatives Barbara Lee  D CA  and Chris Smith  R NJ   have introduced similar resolutions in the Senate and House that would officially call on China to use its  unique influence and economic leverage  with the Sudanese regime to stop the ongoing genocide in Darfur   Text of Senate resolution    Text of House resolution   Video of Sen  Menendez speaking today on the Senate floor                 No country on earth has the same type of military and economic influence with the Sudanese regime as China   said Sen  Menendez   Strong words and deeds could go a long way with Khartoum  but China has been mostly silent and passive  The genocide has to stop  and China has to play its part  The eyes of the world will be on Beijing next year for the Olympics  It would be a shame for China if its moment on the world stage is muddied by its hands off approach to the genocide in Darfur      Sudan is committing genocide in Darfur that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced   said Sen  Brownback   Instead of condemning the atrocities committed by the Khartoum government  China has chosen to strengthen its military and economic ties with Sudan   Innocent lives hang in the balance and it is crucial that China leverage the full weight of its relationship with Sudan to end the suffering in Darfur                  China s support for the status quo in Sudan and their apparent reluctance to join the international community in condemning the atrocities being committed in Darfur have become critical factors in prolonging the ongoing genocide   said Rep  Lee    This resolution sends a clear message that China needs to join the international community in working to end this genocide                 Instead of joining the international community s call to end the genocide  China has served as enabler in chief to the atrocities that continue to take place in Darfur   said Rep  Smith   Not only have they provided Bashir with funds and weapons  but they have lavished him with gifts and a false sense of legitimacy   The money and weapons that Sudan has received from China has made the Chinese Government complicit in these crimes against humanity   Through this resolution  we are once again calling on China to finally step up to the plate and say no to this ongoing genocide                 The resolution points out that the government of China  has long standing economic and military ties with Sudan and continues to strengthen these ties in spite of the on going genocide in Darfur    For example  China purchases at least 70 percent of Sudan s oil and has reportedly cancelled approximately  100 million in debt owed by the Sudanese government   China also recently provided funds for a presidential palace in Sudan at a reported cost of approximately  20 million   In addition  the human rights organization Amnesty International recently accused China and Russia of selling weapons to Sudan that are used in violence in Darfur                  The measure calls on China to urge Sudan to allow the entry of the U N  sanctioned peacekeeping force and to comply with U N  resolutions demanding that the Government of Sudan disarm militias operating in Darfur   It also calls on China to join the international community in threatening sanctions on the Sudanese government if it continues to carry out or support attacks on innocent civilians or to frustrate diplomatic efforts to end the violence               The resolution comes as Chinese preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing are heavily underway  The resolution recognizes that the spirit of the Olympics is  incompatible with any actions  directly or indirectly  supporting acts of genocide                  By hosting the Olympics  China puts itself in the international spotlight and invites questions about their commitment to human rights  particularly with their ongoing support for the government of Sudan  despite its campaign of genocide in Darfur   said Rep  Lee   To suggest that somehow it is unfair to ask those questions is ridiculous  If China doesn t like the scrutiny  they can stop tacitly supporting genocide
