NOMINEE FOR AMBASSADOR TO ARMENIA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Tuesday  September 12  2006      WASHINGTON    United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today placed a hold on the confirmation of Richard E  Hoagland  the Bush administration  s nominee to be U S  Ambassador to Armenia  The hold  a parliamentary privilege afford to U S  Senators  is in response to the Bush administration  s refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide    The Ottoman Empire brutally tortured and killed nearly 1 5 million Armenians from 1915 to 1923 and forced half a million Armenians to flee their homeland   When asked why the administration refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide during his confirmation hearing  Hoagland responded     The U S  believes that the question of how to characterize these horrific events is of such enormous human significance that it should not be determined on the basis of politics  but through heartfelt introspection among academics  civic leaders and societies         As a leader and defender of democracy  it is our nation  s responsibility to speak out against injustice and support equality and human rights     Menendez said     But if the Bush administration continues to refuse to acknowledge the atrocities of the Armenian genocide  then there is certainly cause for great alarm  which is why I am placing a hold on this nominee       I will continue to work with my colleagues in the United States Senate to make strides toward ensuring that all people  regardless of race  religion  or ethnicity  receive protection from policies of discrimination and hate that lead to genocide              The full text of Senator Menendez  s remarks  as prepared for delivery  follows    It is well known that more than 90 years ago  the Ottoman Empire brutally tortured and killed 1 5 million Armenians   Between 1915 and1923  innocent men  women  and children were murdered or forced to flee their country and live in exile  Though the horrors suffered by the Armenian people have haunted them for the past century  many    including our very own President    have refused to label the atrocities for what they are  genocide      In my view  all Americans must recognize that the atrocities committed from 1915 to 1923 constitute genocide   We do not use that word lightly  But the word itself makes a powerful statement about the horrors suffered by the Armenian people   As Samantha Power  the leading expert on Genocide said in a letter to the editor of the New York Times    The extermination of Armenians is recognized as genocide by the consensus of scholars of genocide and Holocaust worldwide   The failure to acknowledge this trivializes a human rights crime of enormous magnitude     Recent developments have caused many to wonder about the administration  s actions regarding the Armenian genocide   Over the past few months  there has been great controversy surrounding the departure of John M  Evans  the Ambassador to Armenia   Ambassador Evans  a highly respected diplomat with a record of service  is leaving his three year assignment one year early   Under normal circumstances  this would not be cause for great alarm   However  we know that the Ambassador  s departure comes after he went against the Bush Administration  s stance and acknowledged the Armenian Genocide   The fact that he is being replaced after vocalizing that   the Armenian Genocide was the first genocide of the twentieth century     is cause for great concern among all who advocate for human rights    The Senate is planning to vote on the nomination of the next U S  Ambassador to Armenia  Richard E  Hoagland   Unlike his predecessor  Mr  Hoagland has declined to acknowledge the mass killings of the Armenians as genocide  and has said that if confirmed  he would work to represent the President  s policy   I have great concerns that Mr  Hoagland  s confirmation would be a step backward   Considering Mr  Hoagland  s refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide as anything more than horrifying events  I do not feel that his nomination is in the best interest of Armenia and her Diaspora     I simply cannot support the confirmation of a new Ambassador to the Republic of Armenia until all of questions over Ambassador Evans   replacement have been answered  I believe that the United States  Armenia  and all who are committed to human rights should support an Ambassador to Armenia who recognizes the genocide that took place there more than 90 years ago
