creation of four Technology Centers of Excellence that will serve as a specialized criminal justice technology resource for law enforcement and criminal justice practitioners  Each Center will provide expertise in a specific technology area and help introduce law enforcement technologies into practice within the criminal justice community  Today  Drakontas formally opens the doors for the Communications Technologies Center of Excellence  which will be located in Camden  NJ  Communication is critical during a crisis  be it a natural disaster or something man made  We all saw the problems that occured when first responders could not communicate on that fateful day when the World Trade Center was attacked  said Sen  Menendez  Investing in technology to ensure that the brave men and women who risks their lives to protect us daily is a priority for me  I applaud Drakontas for their commitment to ensuring the security of our nation  Our vision when we created ACIN back in 2001 was that it would help to create good paying jobs in the City of Camden by fostering growth in private sector companies that are looking to develop new technologies and products to be used in military and government applications  said Rep  Rob Andrews  Drakontas is a shining example of the type of success story we envisioned and I applaud Dr  Regli and his team for their hard work and talent in securing this important grant that will bring more jobs to Camden City and improve the ability for Americas First Responders to communicate effectively  We are honored to be selected  said Dr  Brian Regli  Chief Executive of Drakontas LLC  Over the past three years  we have worked hard to establish a new standard for innovation in the field of criminal justice communication  This selection validates our approach to innovation  which focuses on marrying practitioner needs with new communications technologies and techniques  The Communications Technology Center of Excellence will operate within the existing National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center System  NLECTCS   The NLECTC is funded by the National Institute of Justice  NIJ  within the Office of Justice Programs  and serves as a nationwide network of technology research facilities  Drakontas of Camden  N  J  is receiving over  3 6 million to establish the Communications Technologies Center of Excellence to test  evaluate and demonstrate cutting edge communications tools and technologies  The Center will establish and manage a wide range of criminal justice pilot projects  involving software defined and cognitive radios  position location technologies  wireless data interoperability  and other communications tools and capabilities  The team will also support a Communications Technology Working Group  and provide specialized communications technology assistance to law enforcement  when needed  Our outreach and assistance programs for the law enforcement community are the centerpiece of our efforts  explained Charles Stephenson  who will serve as the Director of Educational and Technical Assistance Programs for the Center  In the coming months  we will offer new resources for specialized technology assistance for state and local law enforcement that will promote voice and data interoperability using new technologies  such as software defined and cognitive radios  The Center of Excellence will be located at the Applied Communications and Information Networking  ACIN  Center  which was established in 2001 through the work of Rep  Rob Andrews and Drexel University as part of a broader initiative to promote economic development in Camden  Drakontas was founded in 2004 to transition technologies developed at the ACIN Center by researchers at Drexel University for the Department of Defense to commercial  civilian and homeland security uses Our relationship with ACIN is an essential part of our effort to deliver taxpayer value  commented Dr  Regli  We will be able to leverage the resources of more than two dozen companies who actively participate in the ACIN  as well as the research capabilities of Drexel University as the administrators of the ACIN program  This will enable the DOJ to leverage related research and development efforts underway at the DOD  The Office of Justice Programs provides federal leadership in developing the nation s capacity to
