Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University today  U S  Senator Robert Menendez called for an Apollo style project to establish America  s independence from foreign oil   Menendez told graduates that throughout the 20th century  America harnessed its unique spirit of innovation and strength of character to defeat fascism  put a man on the moon  and win the cold war  and urged a similar national commitment to end the country  s addiction to oil      The time for minor tinkerings around the edges of our energy policy has passed     Menendez said     This is not a

    The bottom line is that this plan must be focused not on finding more oil  but on using less   Conservation is not merely a   personal virtue    as some have suggested   Along with finding alternative energy sources that do not rely on fossil fuels  conservation is the key to establishing our energy independence       The full text of Menendez  s remarks are below    A Call to Public Service for the 21st Century   An Apollo Project to Break our Addiction to Oil      By Senator Robert Menendez   Commencement Address to Edward J  Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy   It is always a joy to return to Rutgers  which in many ways helped launch me on my own journey to public service years ago    This is the second commencement address I  ve given this year  and each time  I can  t help but be reminded of just last year when I was seated in the audience as the parents today are  watching my daughter Alicia graduate from college  Next year  I look forward to watching my son Bob complete his undergraduate education    For many of the parents in the audience  I know that it was just a few years ago that you sat in similar seats as you watched your children receive their undergraduate degrees and you said to yourself    Thank God they  re finally finished      Now  after two years of graduate school tuition  I know you  re sitting there saying   Please God  let them finally be finished       Graduates  congratulations   This is the culmination of one journey for you and the beginning of another   You are ready to take your place as the next generation of leaders for our state and our country   This school is a special place with a profoundly important mission   As your mission statement says    The Bloustein School is committed to a rebirth of the public service ethic in the United States      I share that belief that public service is the engine of American democracy  and that has been my life  s work as well    Many of you will no doubt find jobs in city government or state agencies  social organizations or transportation authorities  or even pursue elected office   And as you do  you will fulfill one of this nation  s most noble callings  but with it you take on a responsibility not just for yourself and your future  but for the future of your state and your country   But with that responsibility also comes opportunity  the opportunity to lead your fellow citizens to greater days ahead   Public service isn  t a passive phrase    it is an action verb   You have studied public service  and now it is time to put what you  ve learned to work    Your leadership over the coming years will be so important because the challenges our nation faces are so great    President John F  Kennedy captured the essence of leadership in public service when he said in his inaugural address    Ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country      With that call to action  he urged every American to ask more of ourselves individually and to ask more of each other as well    We must all live up to our individual responsibility  but we have always made our nation stronger when we join forces to fulfill our shared responsibilities   We are a nation of entrepreneurs  of rugged individualists who from our earliest days revealed the power that lies in our character  in our can do nature   But the true miracle of America over the past 230 years is the example we have set for the world time and time again    when we give individuals the freedom to blaze their path to success while also living up to our responsibilities to each other  there is no power on this earth as great as ours  no promise so bold  and no hope unattainable    It is the lesson that each of us learns from our parents and that we pass on to our children  that with rights come responsibilities     Over the course of our history  we have always harnessed our individual power to achieve things that many thought were impossible   Just think of what this nation did in the 20th century   In the 1940s  the country united to defeat fascism and rebuild a continent that had been devastated by war   In the 1950s  President Eisenhower built the federal highway system  which united the nation like never before  transformed our economy and connected America from coast to coast    In the 1960s  President Kennedy called on the nation to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade  and on July 20  1969  Neil Armstrong made that one giant leap for mankind   And as great as that accomplishment was  America topped it in the 1970s by inventing disco      which we have been trying to un invent ever since    In the 1980s  we defeated communism  and watched as freedom swept across Eastern Europe  inspiring millions to tear down walls and stake their claim to a free society   And in the 1990s  we made tough choices as a nation to balance our budget for the first time in three decades  which launched an economic expansion that created millions of jobs    Those noble goals were achieved because our nation  s leaders had the vision to call upon our better virtues   America responded every time by answering the challenge and unlocking new opportunities for our country     But I ask you  what is the great goal we share today   What is the challenge that can unite our country in common cause for a purpose that will bear fruit for generations to come     As I said earlier  with public service comes great responsibility  the responsibility to not just ask those questions of your countrymen  but to answer them   As you pick up your diploma today  you are also assuming the mantle of leadership that comes with it   And in the years to come  each of you may answer those questions differently    But let me do my duty as an elected leader today and suggest a goal that I believe can unite our country  one that I believe all Americans should join in pursuing   It is my belief that for the foreseeable future  America can have no greater goal than achieving energy independence that will improve our economy  protect our environment  and strengthen our national security     Earlier this year  President Bush shocked many by saying that this nation was addicted to oil   And whatever your overall opinion about his administration and its actions  in this case  his diagnosis was accurate   And if it wasn  t clear already  it has literally been driven home over the past month  as we have all felt the pain of paying three dollars a gallon for gasoline and heard analysts say that four and five dollar gasoline may be right around the corner    That is one price of our addiction  but it  s not the only one   In addition to the pain at the pump we all feel  our economy pays a price when expensive energy makes it harder to bring goods and services to market or crowds out investments in new technologies or in health care or wage increases    We also pay the price to our environment  where fossil fuel consumption has dirtied our skies and contributed to global warming that if left unchecked will threaten not just our health and our environment  but our very way of life   And as India and China continue their rapid pace towards industrialization and modernization  those countries are joining us in gobbling up more and more oil     We pay the price to our security when a corrupt regime like Iran feels emboldened to threaten its neighbors with nuclear weapons  and do so with impunity because their access to oil makes it possible for them to buy influence around the globe   As the New York Times columnist Tom Friedman has pointed out  it  s not a coincidence that when oil was  20 a barrel  both Russia and Iran launched internal reform programs to increase democratic participation   As the price of oil has soared past  70 a barrel  both of those countries have reversed course and used their burgeoning treasuries to stifle dissent and roll back democratic progress    The same story can be told across the world   From the corrupt royal governments and pseudo theocracies of Middle East  to the iron fisted dictators who hold sway in the former Soviet countries in Central Asia  to the petro populism of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela  many of the countries who sit on the largest reserves of oil are the same countries who are now resisting reform and creating global instability   If the story of the 20th century was of a tidal wave of democracy sweeping across the globe  the emerging story of the 21st century is of that wave being swallowed underneath a flood of crude   As long as the tyrants who have the lucky fortune to sit on top of massive oil reserves can prop up their regimes through huge petroleum profits  there will be no reform   Bringing down the price of oil is a key to democratic  economic and social reform in much of the world    Finally  we pay the price on both sides of the war on terror  where we pay with American lives and treasure to fight an enemy largely financed by the profits earned from our own reliance on  70 a barrel oil    No other threat to our nation has such broad implications to our economy  our security and our environment   But as daunting as the challenge is  it is not insurmountable   Like any addiction  we hold the power to treating it  we just need the will to do so    Such an effort will require bold leadership by our president and our Congress  who must join together to launch an Apollo style initiative to end our dependence on foreign oil within a generation   The time for minor tinkerings around the edges of our energy policy has passed   This is not a problem we can simply drill our way out of  and it is not a problem we can wish our way out of   We need a comprehensive plan that considers every option on the table to breaking our addiction to oil    The bottom line is that this plan must be focused not on finding more oil  but on using less   Conservation is not merely a   personal virtue     as some have suggested   Along with finding alternative energy sources that do not rely on fossil fuels  conservation is the key to establishing our energy independence    Breaking our dependence on oil also means the Congress needs to break its dependence on big oil companies   The five biggest oil companies made combined profits of  100 billion last year  with ExxonMobil alone making  36 billion in profits   Yet the Congress continues to shower the industry with billions of dollars of unnecessary tax breaks   They got  2 5 billion in new tax breaks last year  and then just this week were allowed to escape from a provision that would have repealed  5 billion of breaks they no longer need   Only this Congress could develop an addiction treatment program where step one is to give more money to the pushers themselves     Here  s what we must do instead   We need to require Detroit to make more fuel efficient vehicles  and we need to use incentives to entice them to make more hybrid cars and to develop new cars that run on flex fuels   We need to spend more money to develop alternative sources of energy  such as wind  solar  and biomass   We need to increase our investments in new forms of ethanol that come from sources other than corn   We need to reform our building codes so energy efficiency is a standard that is considered right along with public safety    The federal government needs to set the right example by becoming greener   I  m trying to do my part by making my office the first zero net carbon emissions Senate office  I will be determining what my carbon footprint is  from the electricity I use in my offices and my travel around the state and down to Washington  and offset that by purchasing clean energy from wind farms and other providers  New Jersey  s Clean Energy program has made it particularly easy for every person in the state to do their part to help cut down on the amount of fossil fuels we use  and I believe this model should be replicated throughout the country    All of these initiatives are part of the solution  but more than anything we need a focused  sustained effort that starts at the top and calls for action by all Americans    When President Kennedy called for the country to join together to put a man on the moon  he said   I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience  or some hardship  or some sacrifice      In that same spirit  a successful plan for energy will require not just discipline  but also sacrifice    But by harnessing American innovation and the strength of purpose that has made this nation great  we can deliver the benefits of energy independence   With a comprehensive program  we can decrease our trade deficit and improve our economy   We can improve our competitiveness by being a leader in the development of clean technology  which will be in demand by countries around the globe over the next century   By becoming a leader in fighting climate change  we can restore much of the respect that we have lost around the world in recent years   And perhaps most importantly  we can improve our security by helping promote democracy and undermining the very regimes that finance terrorism and spread instability throughout the world    In 2001  Vice President Cheney said   years down the road alternative fuels may become a great deal more plentiful than they are today   But we are not yet in any position to stake our economy and our way of life on that possibility      He went on to say that   the reality is that fossil fuels provide virtually 100 percent of our transportation needs and an overwhelming share of our electricity requirements   For years down the road  this will continue to be true       With all due respect to the vice president  for years down the road that cannot continue to be true if we are to have any hope of avoiding a cataclysmic crisis that impacts our economy  our environment and our security   We have the will to summon our nation to a higher purpose  to ask that Americans unite for a cause that is more important than the needs of each individual   We have the means to do it  we just need the leadership that will take us there    It is time to write our own Declaration of Energy Independence    As you enter the professional world  you are poised to provide your country that leadership   I know you are ready to do it  and I hope you will seize the opportunity before you to change your country and build a nation that is both stronger and safer   The future is in your hands    And if it doesn  t work out  maybe you can invent the next version of disco    Thank you and god bless
