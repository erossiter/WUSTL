United States Senator Robert   Menendez  D NJ  today called on Congress and the Bush   Administration to pass his legislation to permanently bar foreign   governments from controlling U S  port operations and to   support his proposal to triple funding for port security grants   and move the U S  closer to inspecting 100 percent of cargo   containers entering America        Yesterday  Dubai Ports World announced that they are   going to transfer the operations they have acquired at U S  ports    including the Port of New York and New Jersey  to a U S  entity     If that announcement means they are ending their bid to take   control of operations at American ports  than that is a victory for   the security of our country   But divestiture must include   ownership  control and operations   We have yet to see the   details  and until we do we must continue to hold the Bush   administration  s feet to the fire to ensure that there is no risk to   our security     said Menendez    It is an unacceptable risk to our   national security to turn control of operations at U S  ports over   to a foreign government   The Bush administration was wrong to   approve this sale in the first place  and the American people   stood up and said so         In February  Menendez joined with Senator Hillary Rodham   Clinton to introduce legislation to prohibit the sale of US ports   to foreign governments   The legislation includes several   provisions geared toward increasing accountability and   transparency in reviewing foreign investment in the U S   The   Ports Security Act requires the federal government to solicit   public comments while investigating proposed foreign   investment in the U S  The bill also includes specific provisions   requiring Congressional  state and local government   notification       The bill also requires the president to conduct a study on   existing foreign government owned companies operating in US   ports  and make recommendations to the Congress on how to   appropriately handle any resulting national security risks within   30 days after the law  s enactment        But the fundamental problem goes deeper than the   question of ownership of our ports  Only five percent of   containers entering our country are currently inspected  and we   know that those containers contain great risk to the safety of   our families     added Menendez       On Thursday  Menendez offered a port security amendment   that will move U S  ports closer to scanning 100 percent of cargo   containers entering the country  Currently only about five   percent of cargo is scanned when entering U S  ports  The   amendment authorizes funds to improve existing security   programs  increases funding for research and development in   scanning technologies  and helps developing countries improve   their ability to scan and inspect containers        The budget amendment will triple funding for port security   grants and move the U S  closer to scanning and inspecting 100   percent of cargo containers entering America  This measure will   work to increase port security by funding the use of scanners    providing additional funding for research and development to   improve existing scanning and port security technologies  and    increasing grant funding for port security  The amendment was   defeated along party lines   Menendez will reintroduce this   amendment on the floor of the Senate next week      President Bush  s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal calls for    600 million for a Targeted Infrastructure Protection grant   program  which would fund security efforts for a series of critical   infrastructure  including ports  chemical plants  rail  transit  and   bus systems    Industry experts indicate  600 million falls far   short of properly and adequately securing critical American   infrastructure  For port security grants alone  the American   Association of Port Authorities has called for  400 million         The 9 11 commission urged us to think   outside the box     and  to that end  our security measures should be geared toward   learning what  s in the cargo containers     Menendez said      We   cannot wait for another attack on our country before we act  We   must act now   We must act to protect our ports  the goods that   come into them  the people who work there  and the   communities that surround them
