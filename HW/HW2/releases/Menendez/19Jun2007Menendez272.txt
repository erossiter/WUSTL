19  2007       WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   an original co sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act  voiced his support for the bill providing stronger protections for unionizing     Hardworking Americans deserve the chance that this bill provides  said Menendez  They deserve a strong law that will not allow employers to skirt its meaning  a law that will protect their decisions and ensure their voices will be heard    As one of only three Hispanic senators  Menendez also pointed out the benefits that the bill would provide to minority and female workers  who are typically better served when unionized    Latinos represented by unions typically earn median wages that are 46 percent higher than non unionized Latinos  Women and African Americans typically earn more than 30 percent higher median wages when they are unionized  Soby opening the door for more workers to seek union representation  we are helping ensure a pathway to fairness and hopefully  a pathway to a better quality of life    I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act  to protect and enforce the rights of any worker to freely join a union  free from intimidation  free from back door tactics  free from fear of retribution  This is a right that no worker should be denied           Full text of remarks as prepared for delivery   M  President  I rise in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act  of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor  This bill will level the playing field for workers seeking a voice at work and ensure they have the freedom to choose to join a union without coercion  I applaud Senator Kennedy for his passion to move this bill forward and his relentless fight to improve and uphold the rights of workers    Now  some may ask why this change is needed  They may think that in 2007  in this great democratic nation  the right of an employee to seek representation in their workplace is alive and well  Well  M  President  it should be  But the fact is  under current law  there are loopholes that have been exploited  tactics that have been utilized  and actions taken against employees that have undermined the basic rights employees should be entitled to    From start to finish  workers often face roadblock after roadblock in trying to seek union representation  Active union workers are fired  employers challenge and file appeals with the NLRB  and employers can simply stall the process and prevent it from moving forward   We cannot ignore that there are some concerted and disturbing efforts that have tainted what should be a fair process    Employees are fired in roughly one quarter of all private sector organizing efforts   One in five workers who openly advocate for a union during an election campaign is fired   In 2005 alone  some 30 000 workers experienced some form of discrimination for their participation in an organizing effort  resulting in lost wages or lost jobs  And  in an increasingly common trend  a vast majority of private employers are hiring union busting consultants to fight unionization drives   Clearly  existing law has not been enough to deter these types of tactics    The Employee Free Choice Act would close loopholes that have allowed employers to abuse the labor process without repercussion  and it would beef up the penalties for violation  Part of the problem is that under current law  there is not a strong enough incentive to follow the law    While employers face stiff penalties for firing an employee based on race  gender  or disability  they face minimal penalties for firing an employee for union organizing    In addition to enacting stronger penalties  this legislation would essentially enforce the steps that are supposed to take place  but often do not  A key part of this bill is that it will bring people to the table  It would ensure that when employees make their voices heard  the process moves forward  This is not forcing the hand of employers or employees  but it simply ensures that negotiations that are supposed to take place will take place   Currently  employees can agree to join a union  but then the process is dragged out for months or years  This is not the spirit of the law  The Employee Free Choice Act will restore that spirit and uphold the meaning of the rights employees are supposed to have    M  President  improving the rights of workers is not just about fairness  it is also about equity  We know that workers who have a voice at work have better benefits and are able to provide a higher quality of life for their families  When nearly half of all Americans report having just enough to get by  it should be obvious that we need to take action to improve the economic standing of many of our workers    And the fact is  union membership means higher wages  According to the Department of Labor  union workers earn 30 percent higher weekly earnings than non union workers  thats an average of  191 dollars per week  or more than  9 000 per year    And this is especially true for minorities  Latinos represented by unions typically earn median wages that are 46 percent higher than non unionized Latinos  Women and African Americans typically earn more than 30 percent higher median wages when they are unionized  So M  President  by opening the door for more workers to seek union representation  we are helping ensure a pathway to fairness and hopefully  a pathway to a better quality of life    Hardworking Americans deserve the chance that this bill provides  They deserve a strong law that will not allow employers to skirt its meaning  a law that will protect their decisions and ensure their voices will be heard    So  M  President  that is why I support this bill  I believe a majority of voices should be upheld and I believe that our workplaces should be the very best they can be for our nations workers    I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act  to protect and enforce the rights of any worker to freely join a union  free from intimidation  free from back door tactics  free from fear of retribution  This is a right that no worker should be denied
