February 12  2007      WASHINGTON   United States Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   as well as Governor Jon S  Corzine  D NJ  and U S  Representative Donald M  Payne  D NJ   today joined together to denounce President Bush s proposed homeland security budget   a budget that will negatively impact New Jersey s ability to equip first responders  and to protect trains  buses  ports  and chemical plants  In discussing an analysis released today by their offices  the officials said the proposed budget freezes funding for critical security grant programs and slashes others by as much as 94 percent     Just months after the passage of historic ports security legislation  the president s budget proposes just half of what the new law says is necessary to protect our ports   Menendez said   The president refuses to scale back his tax cuts for multi millionaires at all   yet he has no compunction with slashing by half the funding needed to properly secure our ports  I look forward to working with my colleagues to reject this ill conceived and ill advised budget  There is too much at stake for us to sit silently while the security of our state is threatened by the President s misguided priorities and values      The president s budget offers insecurity on New Jersey s rails and roads  insecurity on Amtrak and insecurity when it comes to protecting the communities surrounding our chemical plants   Lautenberg said    More people per capita rely on public transportation in our state than in any other state in the country  but President Bush neglects transit security   New Jersey has the toughest chemical security laws in the country but the president wants to strike them down and fund his weaker measures in this budget   Together  Senator Menendez and I will help craft a federal budget that works for New Jersey      Homeland security funding should be distributed according to threat  vulnerability  and consequence   said Corzine   The state is doing its part  and now we need the federal government to step up and do the same      Denying first responders  including firefighters and law enforcement offices  the resources they need to protect our New Jersey communities is wrong and dangerous   Payne said   First responders were our heroes on September 11th  I will be vigorously opposing these short sighted budget proposals which undermine homeland security effectiveness     President Bush s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year jeopardizes New Jersey s ability to carry on its homeland security efforts in the future   The budget provides no additional funding for port security grants  transit security grants  and calls for significant cuts to first responder funding   In addition  the Bush administration proposes to cut funding for state homeland security grants and urban area grants targeted to densely populated areas with high risk targets    The successful COPS program that has added nearly 5 000 police officers on New Jersey s streets is cut by a staggering 94 percent   Included in these cuts is  140 million Congress provided for critical law enforcement technologies and interoperable communications   Critical funding to fire departments is cut almost in half   In addition  Byrne Justice Grants  which support a wide range of law enforcement activities and help local law enforcement partner with state and federal agencies  would be cut by nearly one third   New Jersey received more than  7 million in the last funding year    The president calls for no increase for transit  rail  or bus security   His budget would spend just  237 million for all surface transportation security needs  just a tiny fraction of the  4 9 billion he is proposing to spend on aviation security   This is the first year the president has requested any funding specifically for rail or transit security  but it falls far short of the  6 billion the nation s transit agencies say is necessary to upgrade security
