FAMILY VISA BACKLOG PROPOSED BY SENS  MENENDEZ AND HAGEL

protect hundreds of thousands of family members legally waiting in line for visas   Thursday  May 24  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  today introduced an amendment to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that would alter the Act s proposed remedy for the backlog of family based visa applicants  strengthening the ability of families to reunify    The amendment will be one of the first voted upon when the Senate returns after Memorial Day   Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007         Would clear the backlog of only those people who applied for legal permanent residency before May 1  2005        Would essentially place together all family visa applicants who have been waiting to enter the country legally but applied after that date behind those who are here in an undocumented status        An estimated 833 000 applicants would be impacted by this gap in the backlog clearing plan        All those impacted by the gap are family members of American citizens and permanent residents    Menendez Hagel amendment         Would move the cutoff date to January 1  2007  the same cut off date currently set for the legalization of undocumented immigrants        Would add 110 000 green cards per year to ensure that the additional applicants would not cause the backlog clearing process to exceed the eight year deadline        Co sponsored by Sen  Chuck Hagel  R NE   Richard Durbin  D IL   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Christopher J  Dodd  D CT  and Barack Obama  D IL                  This legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules will lose their place in line   said Menendez   This legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules will have to wait at least an additional eight years before they even become eligible to compete for the newly proposed merit based green cards    Menendez continued   We must make sure that people who played by the rules and legally applied to immigrate here are not arbitrarily placed at a disadvantage in respect to those who are in this country in an undocumented status     Full text of Sen  Menendez s comments as prepared for delivery   This legislation curtails the ability of American citizens or permanent residents to petition for their families to be reunified here in America     Right now  this unfair bill sets different standards for two groups of people   One that has followed the rules by having their relative that is a U S  citizen or lawful permanent residents petition to bring them into this country legally   And one that has entered or remained in our country without proper documentation   Yet this legislation  as it stands now  would punish those who followed the rules   The Menendez Hagel amendment simply states that  at a minimum  the two groups should be treated equally under this bill   My amendment is about fundamental fairness   All this amendment does  is make sure that both groups will face the same cutoff date   Right now  those who are in our nation in an undocumented status are allowed to potentially earn permanent residency so long as they entered this country before January 1  2007   All this amendment does  is say that those who followed the rules should have that same date   January 1  2007   All this amendment does  is apply the same standard  the same cutoff date to those who did follow the rules  so that those who did obey our laws and who legally applied for their green card can potentially earn permanent residency so long as they applied for their visa before January 1  2007   This is a complicated issue  so let me explain exactly what this legislation  as currently drafted does   Right now  there is a family backlog of people who have applied for legal permanent residency   This legislation  as currently drafted  does away with several of the family categories such as adult children of U S  citizens and lawful permanent residents and siblings of citizens   These categories will be grandfathered in and dealt with as part of clearing the backlog during the first eight years only if they filed their application before May 1  2005    It is important to pay attention to the May 1st  2005  date  which is nearly two years before the cutoff date for people who are here in an undocumented status    However  an estimated 833 000 people who have played by the rules but who happened to apply after May 1  2005 will not be cleared as part of the family backlog and as a result  will lose their chance to immigrate under current rules   So  the legislation  as currently drafted  says that if you legally applied for a visa on or after May 1  2005  you have to compete to enter under a totally new system   But right now  the legislation also says that if you overstayed a visa or came into this country without proper documentation before January 1  2007  you will be able become a lawful permanent resident sometime between year nine and thirteen  But if you applied for a visa and followed all the rules  there is NO guarantee that you would EVER be able to become a lawful permanent resident   My amendment would remedy this injustice by moving the cutoff date for those who legally applied for visas to January 1  2007  which is the same cut off date that is currently set for the legalization of the undocumented immigrants  My amendment would also add 110 000 green cards a year to ensure that we don t start creating a new backlog or cause the eight year deadline for clearing the family backlog to slip by a few years     Why shouldn t legal applicants be able to keep their place in line if they applied before January 1  2007   Clearly  this legislation  as it is currently written  is unfair to those who legally applied for a visa    This legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules will lose their place in line   This legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules will have to wait at least an additional eight years before they even become eligible to compete   let me say that again  compete    for the newly proposed merit based green cards   This legislation unfairly says that those who followed the rules would have to wait a total of ten years before they are eligible to compete under a new and different system  with a different set of rules and no guarantee that they will ever be given a visa to immigrate to our country   Clearly  we must  at a minimum  allow those who played by the rules to have the same cutoff date   January 1  2007   Not only is it unfair to make people who followed the rules wait longer than those who chose not to  it is also wrong to make people who applied under our current system to have to reapply under a completely different one   Those who applied on May 1  2005 or after applied under our current immigration system that values family ties and employment at a premium     However  under this bill they would now be subject to a completely different standard that is primarily concerned with education and skill levels   This is like changing the rules of the game halfway through the game   People who applied after May 1  2005 would not only lose credit for the up to two plus years they have been waiting for a visa  they would also have to apply under a completely different system than the one they originally applied for    Let s think of how fundamentally unfair that is   Imagine you are a lawful permanent U S  resident and you have fought for your country  you may have shed blood for your country and in some cases  you may have died for your country   In fact  a non citizen  Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez  originally of Guatemala was the very first U S  combat casualty in the war with Iraq     LPRs are also protecting our airports  our seaports  and our borders  They risk their lives daily in Afghanistan  Iraq  and other places around the world to protect us here at home     You have petitioned to have your sister come to join you and live in America   Under this bill  you would lose that right if you filed on or after May 1  2005     It is hard to imagine that one would have that right taken away from them     Here is another case for you to consider   You are a U S  citizen and have paid your taxes  served your nation  attend your church  and make a good living   You have petitioned to have your adult child come to America  but did so after the arbitrary date of May 1  2005   Under this bill  the U S  citizen would lose that right   However  those who are undocumented in the country after that May 1  2005 date actually get a benefit   Hard to imagine  but it is true   Right now  this bill is unfair and nonsensical  capriciously punishing those who followed the rules and legally applied for green cards   We must make sure that people who played by the rules and legally applied to immigrate here are not arbitrarily placed at a disadvantage in respect to those who are in this country in an undocumented status     As I ve said many times before  comprehensive immigration reform must be tough  practical  and fair   We must be tough on border security  be practical by providing a pathway to earned citizenship  but at the same time we must be fair by rewarding those who followed our laws   We must remain true to the principles we set forth in the beginning of this debate that any immigration reform be tough  practical  and fair   I urge my colleagues to support this family values Menendez Hagel amendment and in doing so ensure that we appropriately punish those who have broken our laws  without punishing those who have followed them
