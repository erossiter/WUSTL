SPEAKS ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS ACT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Wednesday  July 18  2007      WASHINGTON  During the Senate debate on the Higher Education Access Act  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  made the following speech   Today  I rise in strong support of the Higher Education Access Act  which takes critical steps to making higher education more accessible and more affordable for our nations young people   I would like to commend my colleague and good friend  Senator Kennedy  for standing up for our nations students and for putting forward a bill that will make a tremendous difference for students across this nation who are struggling to afford college   This bill begins to right the imbalance that has plagued student financial aid For far too long  students struggling to afford college have seen their grants shrink  their loan rates go up  and their debt explode This bill turns that trend around  by increasing grant aid for the neediest students and making a  17 billion dollar investment in student aid  the largest since the passage of the GI bill  M  President  we all know that education is the key that unlocks social mobility and economic empowerment I know that from personal experience As I have said on this floor before  without federal financial assistance  without Pell Grants  one of the key programs we are talking about today  I would not have been able to afford college  nor would I have had access to the opportunities that my college education afforded me   And I am not alone Millions of young people across this nation have dreams of earning a college degree  of having access to the key that will unlock their own economic empowerment Some dream of building a successful career  or going on to graduate education  or to be the first in their family to graduate from college  as I was   The power of those dreams is why our students and their families are making sacrifices to meet the high cost of college  why they are scraping together what they can to finance the education that will lead them to their dreams   But  the reality is that it is becoming harder and harder to achieve that goal   Every year  nearly half of all college ready students in families with incomes under  50 000 cannot go to a four year college because cost is too much of a barrier   Despite current aid  grants  and money that students earn working  many students face a growing gap between the aid they receive and the cost of college   The lowest income students at four year colleges face roughly  5 800 in unmet need  after a standard financial aid package  after their loans  and after the amount that their families contribute The fact is  for the neediest students  current aid is simply not enough   The fact is  students have been squeezed on two ends  one  by declining federal aid that has sent students the message that they are on their own  and two  by having to rely increasingly on student loans  which are supposed to provide a needed boost to students  but instead have left them with deals that are not in their best interest   So I am proud of this bill  because it will put money where it is needed most  into Pell Grants and other critical financial assistance that benefit our nations students with the most need   Instead of another empty promise to increase Pell Grants  this bill will increase the maximum Pell Grant  to  5 100 next year  and beyond that  to  5 400  There is simply no excuse for the fact that Pell Grants have not increased by even one dollar over the last five years With this bill  we are ending the neglect of our nations neediest students   We also will expand who is automatically eligible for a Pell Grant Currently  a student is eligible for Pell Grants if their family makes  20 000 per year This bill will increase that annual income limit to  30 000  so that more students can be eligible to benefit from Pell Grants   This bill works to protect students working hard to stay in college By doubling the amount a student can earn but remain eligible for aid from  3 000 to  6 000  this bill ensures a student wont lose their financial aid for simply working to make extra money    This bill also helps students who are struggling to pay back their federal loans by capping the amount they will pay at 15 percent of their income  this will help ensure they are not paying back more than they can afford This is a critical step towards ensuring loan repayments are affordable and not over burdensome for recent graduates   I am also extremely pleased that this bill builds on a proposal I have supported for some time  expanding loan forgiveness for those who are working in jobs that serve the public By providing some of our most needed public servants  our teachers  police officers  early educators  social workers  and school librarians  the chance to have their loans forgiven after they have been working hard to pay off those loans  we are sending a powerful message We are saying  if you are willing to serve the public  we will gave back If you make sacrifices in your daily job  we appreciate that sacrifice and we want to lessen the financial burden And  we will help ensure that todays students do not shy away from a career in public service simply because they think they cannot afford it   So  M  President  I am proud of the different direction this legislation takes This bill is sensible  it is reasonable  and it is fair It makes our priorities clear  instead of subsidizing lenders  we should be putting every last dollar possible into the pockets of students    In addition  we are providing  17 billion in new aid to students without charging taxpayers a dime In this bill  we are putting nearly  1 billion dollars towards deficit reduction As a member of the Budget Committee  I am pleased to see this bill recognizes the responsibility we have not just to our students  but to future generations  who do not deserve to be saddled with a our nations rising debt    M  President  this bill is integral to making higher education more accessible and affordable for more young people It is a step forward to ensuring the student loan system works for students and their families And it is key to preserving the integrity of our nations higher education system I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill    To hear segments of the Senators floor speech  visit
