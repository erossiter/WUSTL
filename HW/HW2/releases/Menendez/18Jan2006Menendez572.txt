New Jersey s Robert Menendez   was sworn in today as the newest United States Senator     Menendez took the oath of office from Senate President Pro   Tempore Ted Stevens in the Senate chamber  and immediately   pledged to fight every day for New Jersey families       This is an honor I am going to work every day to uphold     Menendez said   I have walked in the shoes of the average New   Jerseyan all my life  I know the challenges they face  and I will   keep fighting on their behalf in the Senate       Since New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine announced on   December 9 that he would appoint Menendez to fill the   remainder of his Senate term  Menendez has toured New Jersey   meeting with community leaders  civic organizations  and people   from a diverse array of backgrounds to listen to their concerns   and aspirations before he took office       As I toured New Jersey  I heard that people were concerned   about balancing the high cost of health care for their family    skyrocketing college tuition for their children  and the burden of   caring for their elderly parents   New Jerseyans want to know   that their leaders will address the real problems that impact   their daily lives   Menendez said       I have fought for average New Jerseyans my entire career    and I will carry that fight to the Senate with an agenda of   positive change       Menendez  who

took on the mayor and testified against him   in court  even though it meant wearing a bulletproof vest after   receiving threats to his life   Bob stood up to the entire political   establishment in

they prepare our children for a successful future   Now he is   fighting to make college more affordable for the next generation   of leaders        Bob believes we should honor our parents by making sure   they can retire with dignity and has introduced legislation to   make it easier for families to care for their aging loved ones     And he has led the fight to stop the privatization of Social   Security      After September 11  2001  Bob earned national recognition   for his leadership in reforming the country s intelligence and   public health systems and for fighting to establish an   independent commission to investigate the terrorist attacks on   our country   His Congressional district sits just across the   Hudson River from Manhattan and Ground Zero  and today  he is   working
