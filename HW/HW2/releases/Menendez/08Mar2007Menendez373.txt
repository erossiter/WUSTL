March 8  2007      WASHINGTON   United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today introduced legislation that would authorize  20 million in grants for a pilot program that would allow the neediest school districts across America to enter partnerships to upgrade their science laboratory equipment  develop new methods of teaching science laboratories  and train high school laboratory teachers  The legislation is an effort to improve the science laboratory experience for students in rural and low income schools  and also increase the number of women and minorities interested in studying math  science and engineering in college    U S  Representative Ruben Hinojosa  D TX  introduced an identical measure in the House of Representatives  which the House Subcommittee on Research and Science Education held hearings on today      America has always been a leader in the global economy due to our innovative and inventive spirit  but it is imperative that we not rest on our laurels   Senator Menendez said   To stay competitive we must ensure that all of our country s students are challenged academically and inspired to pursue a wide range of subjects   including hard sciences   and supplied with the necessary means to study and advance their knowledge in such disciplines  We must ensure that the typically underserved  such as women and disadvantaged students  are afforded the same opportunities as their counterparts in the study of math  science  and engineering  By diversifying those career fields we will not only promote greater equality  but we will guarantee a more competitive America in the global economy     The Menendez measure would authorize  20 million for a matching grant pilot program to be administered by the National Science Foundation  Eligible grantees are partnerships between high need or rural school districts  a college or university  and the private sector  The legislation has broad support and has to date been endorsed by the American Chemical Society  American Council on Education  ASHRAE  Business Higher Education Forum  Campaign for Environmental Literacy  Hands on Science Partnership  Institute of Food Technologists and the National Science Teachers Association     In order to ensure our nation s global competitiveness  American schools must cultivate the finest scientists  engineers  and technicians   from every part of our society   so that we can create the innovations of tomorrow that will keep our nation strong   said Catherine T  Hunt  President of the American Chemical Society    This legislation will enable more high need schools to provide their students with safe  effective learning environments that will foster scientific inquiry      Our nation must reinvest in our children if we hope to participate effectively in the international knowledge economy  we need more students to engage earlier in the areas of science  technology  engineering and math   said American Council on Education President David Ward    We must find new ways to connect with students at the elementary and high school level to spark their interest in these often demanding fields   Exposing these students to hands on science in a laboratory setting early on could prove to be the way we grow our country s next generation of scientists and engineers who can then assist in creating our future            PALS partnership grants will be instrumental in helping schools to develop and maintain a safe  well equipped lab space and bring ongoing professional development to teachers   said Dr  Gerald Wheeler  Executive Director of the National Science Teachers Association   Research based pilot programs will help fill in the gaps in our knowledge about how best to employ labs  The best practices and materials developed in this pilot program can be used as a model by stakeholders who want to strengthen high school lab science in their communities     If passed  the bill will allow school districts to use the grants in a variety of ways including  developing a plan for improving laboratory instrumentation and laboratory space  acquiring laboratory equipment and other scientific educational materials  maintaining  renovating  or improving of existing laboratories  and professional development and training for high school science lab teachers    Grants may also be used for developing instructional materials that integrate lab and classroom learning  safety training  and developing hands on laboratory experiments designed to encourage women  minorities  and the disabled to enter math  science  engineering  and technology fields
