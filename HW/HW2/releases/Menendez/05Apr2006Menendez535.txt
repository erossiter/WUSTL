April 5  2006      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   joined by Senator Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ    today introduced legislation requiring prescription drug managers  managed care  plans and other private health insurers to promptly pay health care claims submitted  by pharmacists  physicians and hospitals     Health care providers oftentimes face financial strife because prescription    drug plans and health plans either do not pay them within a reasonable time    frame  or do not pay them at all  The Menendez Lautenberg bill would require    payment within 14 days for claims filed electronically  and 30 days for manually filed    claims  Interest would be assessed and fines imposed upon companies in violation    of this bill    A federal prompt pay law is critical to ensuring that our pharmacies    and health care providers maintain adequate cash flows and are able to continue    functioning  Menendez said  They are the providers that know    their patients best and ensure that they receive the important care they need    and deserve  With the implementation of the new Medicare Prescription Drug    benefit  local pharmacies have been particularly hard hit  which has grave    consequences for American communities and the patients who depend most on Medicaid    and Medicare     Hospitals  doctors and pharmacists that serve Medicare and Medicaid    patients must be paid in a timely manner  said Lautenberg  Without    this legislation  senior citizens  the disabled and the poorest Americans could    lose access to life saving health care services    The Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act would help ensure access    to preferred pharmacies  physicians and hospitals by  requiring that group    health insurers  Medicaid and Medicare managed care plans  and the new Medicare    prescription drug mangers  pay claims to the beneficiary  hospital  physician    or other provider who filed the claim within 14 days of the filing date for    electronically filed claims and 30 days for manually filed claims     The bill will also impose rising interest rates on claims that are paid late     impose monetary penalties for violations of the Act  ensure for a private right    of action to recover unpaid claims and interest  and  not preempt state laws    that impose requirements or standards that are equal to or more stringent than    those established in this Act             The Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act of 2006    This bill will help ensure that our seniors and all patients have access to    their preferred local pharmacy and health care provider  Since local pharmacies     doctors and hospitals are the health care frontline in our communities and    often find themselves squeezed by insurance copies on the one hand and their    obligation to take care of patients on the other  this bill aims to relieve    the burden on providers by requiring prescription drug managers  managed care    plans and other private health insurers to pay health care claims in a timely    fashion  Under federal law and most state laws  there are no consequences for    Health Maintenance Organizations  HMOs  and Prescription Drug Managers  PDMs     that fail to pay their bills  Even in states that do enforce prompt payment    of claims standards  these rules do not apply to federally regulated  ERISA     health plans  Too many pharmacies  physicians and hospitals admit facing financial    strife because prescription drug plans and health plans either do not pay them    within a reasonable time frame  or do not pay them at all  Medicare is required    to pay claims within 30 days of filing  Private prescription drug managers    and health plans should also be required to pay their bills on time     Specifically  the Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act would help    ensure access to preferred pharmacies  physicians and hospitals by  Requiring that group health insurers  Medicaid and Medicare managed care plans     and the new Medicare prescription drug mangers  pay claims to the beneficiary     hospital  physician or other provider who filed the claim within 14 days of    the filing date for electronically filed claims and 30 days for manually filed    claims      Imposing rising interest rates on claims that are paid late      Imposing monetary penalties for violations of the Act      Ensuring a private right of action to recover unpaid claims and interest      Not preempting state laws that impose requirements or standards that are equal    to or more stringent than those established in this Act    Statement of Senator Robert Menendez    Introduction of the Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act of 2006   April 5  2006  Mr  President  I rise today to introduce legislation  along with my colleague     Senator Lautenberg  to preserve seniors and all patients access    to local pharmacies  doctors and hospitals  Since these providers are on the    front lines of our communities health care systems and often find themselves    squeezed by insurance copies on the one hand and their obligation to take care    of patients on the other  this bill aims to relieve their burden by requiring    prescription drug managers  managed care plans and other private health insurers    to pay health care claims in a timely fashion      The Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act bill seeks to address the    financial strains being faced by hospitals and physicians my state of New Jersey    and across the country  In addition  this legislation would address the new    financial crisis pharmacies are facing in light of the new Medicare Prescription    Drug benefit  Specifically  the legislation requires prescription drug managers     private health plans and other private health insurers to pay manually filed    claims within 30 days and electronically filed claims within 14 days  Insurers    that fail to meet these timeframes would be required to pay interest for everyday    the claims goes unpaid  Insurers that knowingly violate these prompt payment    requirements would be subject to monetary penalties    Mr  President  a federal prompt pay law is critical to ensuring that our pharmacies    and health care providers maintain adequate cash flows and are able to continue    functioning  Seniors and all patients depend on their local pharmacists and    preferred physicians  They are the providers that know their patients best    and ensure that they receive the important care they need and deserve  The    threat of local pharmacies  physicians and hospitals going out of business    has serious consequences with regards to the kind of care the community will    receive     The need for this legislation cannot be understated  In my state of New Jersey     local pharmacies have never had a more challenging financial situation  They    are encountering lower reimbursement rates from the prescription drug managers    and a 60 90 day lag time in reimbursements  which are putting many on the brink    of going out of business  Almost half of all hospitals are operating in the    red  and that number is growing  Physicians and hospitals are experiencing    rising health care operating costs and tight federal and state budgets  Untimely    payment of claims has only compounded these problems     The problem of late payments has reached such a crisis that the majority of    states  including New Jersey  have enacted prompt pay laws to    require insurers to pay their bills within a specific time frame  Unfortunately     New Jerseys law  like most similar state laws  is largely ineffective    because it lacks strong enforcement provisions and offers no incentives for    private insurers to comply  Furthermore  state prompt pay laws apply only to    state regulated plans  which only cover approximately half of New Jerseyans    that are insured    The bottom line is that pharmacies  physicians  hospitals and other health    care providers should not have to shoulder the burden of unpaid claims  These    local providers have fulfilled their commitment to care for patients  and my    legislation will ensure that private insurers assume the financial responsibilities    for the health coverage they are being paid to provide    M  President  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed    in the Record at this point
