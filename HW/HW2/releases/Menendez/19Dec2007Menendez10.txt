Prepared for Delivery  THE IRAQ WAR  What It s Costing Us Here at Home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wednesday  December 19  2007      M  President   As we celebrate this holiday season with our families  as we gather with those we love  and give thanks for our tremendous blessings  we remember how incalculable the losses have been to the families of the 3 888 soldiers who were killed in Iraq  Their losses cannot be tallied  not in the number of Christmas nights spent without the one they loved  not in the number of days since their wives  husbands  parents and children left home forever    We cannot calculate the strain on the 28 661 wounded soldiers and their families  many of whom will be spending this precious time in a military hospital  coping with their blindness  living with only one leg or arm  sleeping through nightmares of the battlefield instead of the beautiful dreams they used to know this time of year  As we hold them in our hearts  we watch our money slip away from us in Iraq  That is a casualty we can  and must  count  There is a brutal holiday irony that is no cause for festive spirit here in Washington  D C    The irony is this  President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress held hostage some key investments we need to make right here in our country  using so called fiscal responsibility as an excuse  in order to extract a promise of more money for the War in Iraq  Theyre asking for more than  150 billion dollars more for Iraq next year  but at one point they threatened to starve the entire government of funding over a difference in the federal budget that amounts to less than one tenth of what the President wants to spend on the war next year  This holiday season  we wondered if President Bush wanted to be Scrooge to America and Santa Claus to Iraq   Over the last several months I have spoken many times about what the American presence in Iraq is costing us here at home  The true costs of the  455 billion weve spent on that war and the  10 billion per month we continue to spend might be never be clearer than they are now  at a time when Congress is debating the budget for almost the entire federal government     While were here crunching numbers  American families are feeling the crunch of a few numbers themselves  the interest rate on their mortgage that may be about to jump up beyond what they can afford  the number on the gas pump when they fill their tank  the price of heating oil and natural gas  higher grocery bills  fare hikes or threats of hikes on public transportation  and the skyrocketing costs of providing medical care for themselves and their children   The Presidents consistent threats to veto funding for federal government operations forced across the board cuts to the most important programs and services that so many Americans are counting on    CHART 2  This winter  as snow and ice fall on roads across America  people are waiting for better ways to travel  They are waiting for expanded  affordable public transportation  progress on efficiency and new sources of fuel and power  They are waiting for our nation to fill our energy portfolio with something other than lumps of coal   The bill considered by Congress considered has before itthis week would inject another  1 7 billion dollars in the development of renewable sources of energy like solar  wind and geothermal  Its an important step  but it could have been much greater a small one  Republicans have consistently objected to bigger steps  Theyve said weaning us off fossil fuels is too expensive  Meanwhile  they have insisted that oil companies need more multi billion dollar tax cuts  And meanwhile  we spend enough money to pay for that entire renewable energy package in Iraq in just 5 days   CHART 3  Cancer patients going through the dark winter of their illness are waiting on life saving treatments that only intensive scientific research can discover  Congress has a bill before it to authorize funding for that research  President Bush vetoed the funding once and his allies in Congress have whittled it down as much as they could  The cost of the funding increase for that research   329 million  or less than one day in Iraq    CHART 4  This winter  while President Bush asks for billions more for security for the streets of Baghdad  he says we cant afford to bring security to the streets of our hometowns  The Senate proposed spending  55 million in part to hire police officers specially trained to stop child sexual predators  The President didnt just force that funding to be cut in half  he sliced it into less than a third of what it was  We could have made up the difference and fully funded the program to stop child sexual predators with what it costs to be in Iraq for about two and a half hours  There are too many provisions in this big funding bill that are absolutely essentialtoo many to name here    The victims of the cuts that the President and his Republican allies have called for the millions of Americans waiting for clean power that wont be produced  the cancer patients who are waiting for research that wont be allowed to happen  the communities trying to stop child sexual predators who are waiting for police officers who wont be hiredthese people are also too many to name  In that sense  even beyond more than in terms of the lives lost overseas  the cost of the War in Iraq has been incalculable    If theres one thing we all must acknowledge right now  its this  the war in Iraq is not free  No one should be pretending this war is free  The Bush Administration likes to parrot the line that were fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them here  But Americans have figured out that what they really mean is  Were spending all our money over there so we dont have it to spend here  Above all  this is as a question of values  Do we value our children  do we value our schools  do we value our soldiers and veterans  do we value our healthor will we neglect those priorities   This bill sets out  for our values  a clear and serious test  we cannot allow the budget to have a heart as cold as the ice on our front steps  we cannot let our financial stability melt away  and we cannot continue to let more of our money burn up in a war that has taken so much from so many for so long  M  President  At years end  we speak of renewal  we turn to our families  we witness a rebirth of hope  This season is about the best in us  This season  decisions we make are going to test how we operate as a government  and test what we stand for as a nation    There is no better time than now to let the best in American values guide our way  generosity  equal opportunity  and cooperation with one another  We have the power to end unnecessary suffering and waste  and the chance to approach these tasks with the fresh sense of urgency they require  As we rest and dream in the company of those we love  let us remember that December is the darkest time of the year  but it is also the turning point  when the sun begins to shine more and more every day    Together we offer our wish  our hope  our prayer  that the dreams that have carried us so far  of peace on Earth  goodwill toward all  may yet still come true
