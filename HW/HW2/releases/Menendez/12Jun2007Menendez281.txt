ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AT SENATE HEARING

Menendez questions Henrietta Fore  nominee to replace Randall Tobias as USAID Administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tuesday  June 12  2007        WASHINGTON  As the State Department undertakes a reform of its foreign assistance process and as foreign assistance programs undergo a leadership change  the Senate Subcommittee on International Development and Foreign Assistance  Economic Affairs  and International Environmental Protection today examined U S  foreign assistance  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   chairman of the subcommittee  lead the proceedings questioning Henrietta Fore  President Bushs nominee to be USAID Administrator   Let me be clear  if USAID and State simply move full speed ahead with this reform process  and make only minor changes around the edges  then the Administration will have serious problems with Congress  said Menendez  Im not saying that we may not actually agree with the way this Administration wants to run this reform process  In fact  we may agree in many areas  but I am officially putting the Administration on notice that you simply cannot go forward with this process in the non transparent  top down way it was handled in the past   Menendez discussed various issues surrounding U S  foreign assistance  including the recent power shifts from USAID to the State Department and the Department of Defense  problems with the Millennium Challenge Corporation  and the proposed idea of a cabinet level position to head development programs   Chairman Menendezs opening statement as prepared for delivery  A Time for Change   Secretary Fore  the foreign assistance reform process has been in place a little over a year  But  I believe this new foreign assistance process is seriously flawed and may be in serious trouble   That is where you come in  You have just been nominated for this job and made both acting USAID Administrator and Director of U S  foreign assistance  You have the ability to reassess the situation  to bring a new perspective  and  if confirmed  to make real change  Secretary Fore  you have the opportunity today to come before this committee and tell us what you believe needs to be done to fix the foreign assistance reform process  or  as it is often called  the F process  You have the opportunity to start fresh  with USAID employees  with State Department  with the NGO community  and with Members of Congress   Let me be clear  if USAID and State simply move full speed ahead with this reform process  and make only minor changes around the edges  then the Administration will have serious problems with Congress  Im not saying that we may not actually agree with the way this Administration wants to run this reform process  In fact  we may agree in many areas  but I am officially putting the Administration on notice that you simply cannot go forward with this process in the non transparent  top down way it was handled in the past   I believe  and I certainly hope  that the foreign assistance reform process was started with the best of intentions  Clearly  we needed more transparency in our work  We needed to know exactly how we were spending our money  and on what  We needed to eliminate overlap between programs in different areas  We needed cohesion and coherence  And I commend everyone who has worked so hard to create this new transparency and to force disparate parts of the U S  government to work together  Problems with Foreign Assistance Reform But  after the first year of reform  I have serious questions about both the design and implementation of the reform  Lets look at the problems we face now  The foreign aid reform process was carried out in an exclusive  secretive manner  People refer to the F process as a black box without any real input or consultation  except for post facto briefings  with Congress  with the NGO community  or others inside the government  The process was top down and excluded valuable input from the people in the field who know the most about what is happening on the ground  The foreign assistance reform was supposed to coordinate all of US foreign assistance  but left the Millennium Challenge Account and President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  PEPFAR   among others  out of the F umbrella  USAID is in the process of being decimated as its funding  role  and mission are reduced As a result  USAID faces serious moral problems and questions about its future  The promise the Administration made on MCC was false  MCC is not additive and instead is appears to be taking funds away from USAID and core development  The Administrations decision to shift funds from the traditional core development assistance account into an account with much more flexibility raises serious concerns and has  thus far  been rejected by the House appropriators  I would like to address a few of these issues now and then discuss specific items in more detail during the question period  I understand that the Administration has carried out an after action review and I look forward to hearing how you plan to take those results and make significant changes  Decimation of USAID I am deeply concerned that by moving decision making power from USAID to the State department  the Administration is continuing the decimation of USAID that started with the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation and may end with the new development attaches you may be creating  I  for one  do not intend to preside over the slow death of USAID  Let me be clear  USAID is not a perfect agency  and I am not against reform  But I am against taking money  power  control  and expertise away from the one agency inside the U S  government that was designed with development  and fighting poverty around the world  as its core mission   Let me remind everyone   our foreign policy agenda is not identical  and should not be identical  to our development agenda   Development should not be about the short term strategic goals that State Department must often be focused on  Development is about long term goals that dont always coincide with who we are friends with at the moment  For example  were not giving  3 billion to Pakistan over a 5 year period because Pakistan is the country most in need of development assistance  No  were providing those funds because this Administration sees Pakistan as a key ally that is helping with central foreign policy goals like stopping the war on terror  And we all know and understand that  I am also deeply concerned about whether the F process is really focusing on poverty alleviation  I know that the Administration included the goal of reducing widespread poverty into the foreign assistant framework only after the persistent insistence of the NGO community and Members of Congress  I believe that reducing poverty should have been at the center of any foreign assistance reform from the beginning  And  as we move forward  I expect to see poverty alleviation front and center in the on the ground implementation of reform  Just as I will not stand by and watch the decimation of USAID  I will not stand by and watch our core development agenda  and our poverty alleviation agenda  be swallowed by immediate foreign policy needs   ESF to DA That is why so many people are concerned about the decision to shift money from the development assistance account to the economic support fund account  This is not about semantics  or a name change  ESF funds were designed to be used in our national interests  to help our friends for strategic purposes  and to provide economic assistance  Let me quote from the language that authorized ESF  The Congress recognizes that  under special economic  political  or security conditions  the national interests of the United States may require economic support for countries or in amount which could not be solely justified  for standard development purposes   These funds have always been a strategic fund used by State and the Secretary of State   Meanwhile  our development assistance accounts have been used to fund true development  for the purpose of development itself  I see no reason to change that system  And I am deeply concerned that the Administrations decision to move these funds isnt simply about matching accounts to countries needs  but is designed to subsume development goals into short term foreign policy goals   And I find the results of the shift in these funds disturbing  In the FY08 budget  the Administration proposed shifting funds from the development assistance account to the ESF account  In addition to cutting the development assistance funding by 31  and shifting those funds to ESF  the budget also cuts total Child Survival and Health by 9 percent  International Disaster and Famine Assistance by 18 percent while increasing funding to the MCC  counter narcotics and law enforcement  among others  And while I certainly support significant increases in good governance  rule of law  and counter terrorism  I dont believe that justifies the proposed cuts in the Administrations FY08 budget to human rights  maternal and child health  family planning reproductive health  agriculture  and environment  DOD and Foreign Aid I am also disturbed by the recent trend with the Department of Defense stepping into role that USAID or the State Department has traditionally performed  DODs disastrous record in Iraq reconstruction certainly speaks for itself  DODs role has dramatically increased  In 2001  DOD had just 7 percent of total disbursements of development assistance  In 2006  DOD took 20 percent  And there are serous risks with DOD continuing to take on these tasks  As Gordon Adams said during a Senate budget Committee hearing on Iraq  the more we ask DOD and the military to do  the more they become responsible for our overseas relationships  The more we expand DOD authorities  and underfund State and USAID for such activities  the less State and USAID have the credibility and retain the competence to carry out policy leadership and program administration in these areas  This trend risks becoming a self fulfilling prophecy    Conclusion  The Future of Foreign Aid Reform I have just laid out some of the challenges we face as we move forward over the next year and a half    But I also believe we need to look toward the long term  In January 2009  we will have a new President  We need to start talking about how we can work with that new President on real  long term foreign assistance reform  I know that a number of our witnesses will suggest that we create a cabinet level position to head our development programs and I look forward to discussing this idea today  For right now  however  we have a lot to do between now and January 2009  Secretary Fore  on our second panel we have three very distinguished witnesses who have dedicated countless hours of research and writing to the issue of US Foreign Assistance  They are leaders in the field and I hope you will take their recommendations seriously   Let me be clear  I expect the Administration to make significant changes in the reform process  I expect the Administration to work with Congress  both authorizers and appropriators  I expect real transparency and inclusion in the process  I expect real change  And the Administration should expect significant and detailed oversight of foreign assistance reform from this Subcommittee and from Congress   Thank you  And I now recognize Senator Hagel for any opening statement he may make
