Robert Menendez    D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  today called on House   and Senate leaders to formalize AMT tax relief in the fiscal year   2007 budget  thereby saving over one million New Jerseyans   from the   stealth    alternative minimum tax  Without passage of   AMT relief  one in three New Jersey taxpayers will find   themselves facing an unexpected tax increase this year  in many   cases more than  1 000        Already burdened by the rising costs of education  health   care  and home ownership  the last thing New Jersey families   need is a   stealth tax   increase     Menendez said    Our first   priority should be to protect middle class American families           The AMT hits New Jerseyans harder than any other state  If   we do not act  over a million hard working people in New Jersey   will be forced to pay higher taxes as a result of skewed   Republican tax policies     said Senator Lautenberg      In a letter to Senators Chuck Grassley and Max Baucus    chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee    and to Representatives Bill Thomas and Charles Rangel    chairman and ranking member of the House Ways and Means   Committee  Menendez and Lautenberg said over one million   New Jerseyans could face an additional  1 000 in new taxes if   AMT relief is not passed         The AMT would mean a substantial tax increase for   millions of taxpayers    many will pay more than  1 000 in   additional taxes if the current AMT exemption is not extended       the New Jersey lawmakers wrote     In our state of New Jersey    more than a million taxpayers are expected to face the AMT this   year if Congress does not act   That means nearly one in three   taxpayers in New Jersey would be subject to the AMT           The alternative minimum tax was originally designed to   ensure that people making more than  200 000 paid some   income tax  but because it was never indexed for inflation  each   year it captures more and more middle class families unless it is   changed by Congress       The respective Senate and House committees are beginning     conference negotiations    to reconcile budget proposals from   both chambers of Congress  The Senate  s tax reconciliation bill    passed last November  protected middle class families from   additional taxation through the alternative minimum tax  The   House bill does not offer such protections      Menendez last month offered an amendment to the tax   reconciliation bill before the Senate  expressing the sense of the   Senate that alternative minimum tax relief for middle class   families should replace tax cuts on dividends and capital gains            The Honorable Chuck Grassley                Chairman                                                Committee on Finance                             United States Senate                                     The Honorable Max Baucus   Ranking Member   Committee on Finance    United States Senate            The Honorable Bill Thomas                      Chairman                                             Committee on Ways and Means                          U S  House of Representatives                 Washington  D C  20515       The Honorable Charles B  Rangel   Ranking Member   Committee on Ways and Means   U S  House of Representatives   Washington  D C  20515       Dear Chairman Grassley  Senator Baucus  Chairman Thomas   and Congressman Rangel       As you begin conference negotiations on H R  4297  the Tax   Reconciliation bill  we urge your consideration of an important   provision in this bill of concern to millions of taxpayers      As you know  the alternative minimum tax  AMT  was   enacted to ensure that taxpayers in higher income brackets did   not avoid paying income tax   Unfortunately  this tax has   become a trap that is ensnaring more and more middle class   taxpayers each year  who were never the intended targets of the   tax   By the end of the decade  nearly all taxpayers making   between  75 000 and  100 000 will be subject to this tax        The AMT would mean a substantial tax increase for millions   of taxpayers    many will pay more than  1 000 in additional   taxes if the current AMT exemption is not extended   In our   state of New Jersey  more than a million taxpayers are expected   to face the AMT this year if Congress does not act   That means   nearly one in three taxpayers in New Jersey would be subject to   the AMT        Taking into account the impact on taxpayers if Congress   does not extend the exemption for AMT  we would like to   reiterate that AMT should be our top priority   There have been   reports that the conference report may not be brought to the   floor unless it contains the extended reductions for the capital   gains and dividends rates  but there is simply not room for   including these reductions and AMT in one bill without adding to   our rising deficit  Now is a time for priorities   The fact is that    the reduced rate for capital gains and dividends does not expire   until the end of 2008   The real crisis facing 15 million taxpayers   now is the AMT        We are also concerned about the president  s proposal for   dealing with AMT   The budget for fiscal year 2007 only provides   a one year fix for AMT and is silent on any action after 2006     Furthermore  the proposal in the president  s budget and the   provision passed by the House in H R  4096 and would cause   additional taxpayers to be subject to the AMT   The AMT fix   passed by the Senate in H R  4297  however  would ensure that   no additional taxpayers are subject to the AMT in 2006      Therefore we urge you to include the Senate passed AMT   provision and make AMT a priority as you negotiate the   conference report for H R  4297   As you are aware  73 Senators   expressed their view that protecting middle class taxpayers   from the AMT should be a higher priority than extending the   reduction for tax cuts that do not expire until 2008   We ask that   you uphold this position in the final bill   Thank you for your   consideration
