VICK S SENTENCING  LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN U S  SENATE FOR BETTER TRACKING OF ANIMAL CRUELTY CRIMES

bill would add animal cruelty crimes to nationwide crime reporting systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Monday  December 10  2007      WASHINGTON  As NFL quarterback Michael Vick was sentenced today to 23 months in prison for his dogfighting conviction  U S  Senator Bob Menendez  D NJ  introduced legislation to aid the battle against animal cruelty  The Tracking Animal Cruelty Crimes Act would direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation to include animal cruelty crimes in its annual crime report  they are not currently included in the report  making it difficult for law enforcement  policy makers and experts to understand overall patterns or trends in animal cruelty crimes  Perhaps if there is any silver lining to the Michael Vick episode  it is that such a high profile conviction for dogfighting has made everyone aware of the repulsiveness of animal cruelty and the severe consequences that await those who participate  said Senator Menendez  While we have the momentum  we need to make sure that we establish policies that help law enforcement more effectively understand the scope of the problem and prevent offenders from going on to commit other violent crimes  The patterns of animal cruelty crimes should be tracked along with other violent crimes  and that is what we are trying to establish  This repulsive blood sport of dogfighting is a truly national problem  last year in my home state of New Jersey  officials found a dog ring in a bunker 11 feet underground  That was during a drug raid  showing how interconnected animal cruelty can be with illegal gambling  drugs  and violence  Having the ability to track animal cruelty cases anywhere in the country is a long overdue step that would not only help animals  but would also give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to prevent violent offenders from escalating their terrible behavior  said Michael Markarian  executive vice president of The Humane Society of the United States  We are grateful to Senator Menendez for introducing this important anti crime bill  for the sake of animals  and for public safety and security in our communities  We strongly support creating a separate category for animal cruelty in the FBIs National Incident Based Reporting System  said Allie Phillips  director of public policy for the American Humane Association  Research has shown that animal cruelty is closely linked to other forms of societal violence  We are thrilled that Senator Menendez has introduced this important legislation  It will finally enable local  state and federal law enforcement agencies to collect national statistics on yearly crime rates  prevent recurrence of animal cruelty  and address its connection to other societal crimes  Involvement in dogfighting and other animal cruelty crimes has proven to be a precursor to other violent crimes and tends to have a strong connection to gang and other criminal activity  The legislation gives law enforcement a critical tool for combating animal cruelty and preventing violent crime by adding animal cruelty crimes to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program  Specifically  it would   Direct the Attorney General in consultation with the FBI to add animal cruelty crimes to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program  National Incident Based Reporting System  and Law Enforcement National Data Exchange Program   Establish a twelve month window for implementation from the date of enactment  Studies has shown that people who had been prosecuted for animal abuse had a strong propensity to commit a violent crime  and a report by the Chicago Police Department found that  in a 3 year period  59 percent of those people brought in for crimes against animals were self admitted or factually established gang members  Dogfighting has become a lucrative enterprise and cruel pastime for criminal gangs across America  with champion dogs selling for as much as  25 000 on the black market  and bets on a single fight exceeding  100 000  Animal cruelty crimes are not assigned a category by the FBI in its annual crime statistics report  making the crimes impossible to disaggregate and study  With the information gathered by accepting animal cruelty as a separate category  officials can track criminal activity  monitor trends  allocate resources more efficiently  and ultimately stop these criminals before they commit worse crimes
