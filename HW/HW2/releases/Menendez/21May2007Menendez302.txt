immigration negotiations says he will offer amendments to alter legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Monday  May 21  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   a key negotiator in closed door Senate meetings on immigration reform  today voted to invoke cloture on the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 and proceed with debate on the measure  Menendez  who has voiced strong opposition to the agreement  said he would be offering a series of amendments to improve the legislation and create tough  smart  and fair immigration reform                This vote is all about our nation s values   said Menendez   Do we create the pathway to the American Dream for those who are contributing to our nation by allowing them to fully participate in our society or do we create a pathway to deportation despite their hard work and sweat  That is what is at stake this evening with this vote    It is my intention  working with my colleagues  through a series of amendments to help lead a charge to improve the deal by crafting tough  smart  and fair immigration reform on the Senate floor    I believe the  Grand Bargain  has at least three serious flaws that must be fixed  an anti family bias that will clog the system  a temporary worker program that would create a permanent working underclass  and exorbitant fines                Tonight the Senate voted 69 to 23 in favor of invoking cloture on the bill    Senator Robert Menendez s remarks as prepared for delivery   M  President  why should we invoke cloture on the motion to proceed   If you vote yes on cloture  you are voting to give this Senate the opportunity to move forward with tough  smart  and comprehensive immigration reform that secures our nation s borders    If you vote no on cloture  you are voting to maintain the status quo of failed laws and a broken immigration system that is weak on enforcement and leaves our borders and our citizens unsecured  while also allowing for continued exploitation and human trafficking     If we have to wait a couple of years  states and municipalities will pass their own laws that often violate equal protection laws  can discriminate against those who are US citizens and lawful permanent residents  and create conflict within otherwise peaceful communities   By invoking cloture  we have the opportunity to strengthen the screening process at our consulates and ports of entry  to better use technology along our borders  and to make sure that our agencies have both the necessary staff and the resources to do their jobs  thus effectively tightening our border security and workplace enforcement    By invoking cloture  we have the opportunity to create an equal playing field and ensure that American worker s wages  benefits  and health and safety standards are not undercut   By invoking cloture  we have the opportunity to realize the economic realities in our society in which undocumented workers are doing the work most Americans won t do such as picking the fruits you had for breakfast  cleaning the hotel and motel rooms for your stay  and plucking the chicken we had for dinner last night     By invoking cloture  we have the opportunity to vote to create a pathway to EARNED legalization that will take many years  considerable fines  payment of taxes  and a new English standard that will be required for permanent residency for the first time    My colleagues  this vote is all about our nation s values   Do we create the pathway to the American Dream for those who are contributing to our nation by allowing them to fully participate in our society or do we create a pathway to deportation despite their hard work and sweat   That is what is at stake this evening with this vote   We must move closer to once again controlling our borders  while restoring the rule of law and maintaining our long  proud history as a nation of immigrants   Last Thursday  the administration and a bipartisan group of Senators announced agreement on the so called  Grand Bargain    Unfortunately  there are a number of details in this deal that would create an unfair and impractical immigration system  undercutting the more sensible provisions   It is my intention  working with my colleagues  through a series of amendments to help lead a charge to improve the deal by crafting tough  smart  and fair immigration reform on the Senate floor   I believe the  Grand Bargain  has at least three serious flaws that must be fixed  an anti family bias that will clog the system  a temporary worker program that would create a permanent working underclass  and exorbitant fines   If we don t improve the  Grand Bargain   we would tear at the fabric of family reunification by eliminating four out of five family based green card categories and capping green cards for parents at 40 000 per year even though last year 120 000 visas were given   So much for family values not stopping at the Rio Grande River as the President has talked about   If we don t improve the  Grand Bargain   we would enact a truly temporary worker program that labor doesn t support and that bars most temporary workers from any path to permanent residence   Without a chance at the American dream  these workers would be driven underground and could be exploitated while creating yet another underclass of undocumented workers   If we don t improve the  Grand Bargain   we would require a family of four to pay up to  19 000 in fines and fees  which are far more than punitive  they are impractical to luring those in the shadows to come forward  be identified  and regularize their stays in this country   M  President  I believe that what this country does on immigration represents the core of American values   We are a country of immigrants and how we treat these immigrants will either show the best or worst of America   I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to stand up and allow the debate on comprehensive immigration reform to start in the United States Senate   Vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S  1348 so we can fix some of the most flawed parts of this unworkable deal and turn it into sound policy that we can all support
