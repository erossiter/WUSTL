IMMIGRATION NEGOTIATIONS VOICES HIS OBJECTIONS TO DEAL

says he can not sign onto agreement announced today   Thursday  May 17  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   a key negotiator in closed door Senate meetings on immigration reform  today voiced his objections to the agreement announced  Menendez said he could not support the limitations in the family reunification program  the temporary nature of the worker program  and the unrealistically high fees that undocumented immigrants would have to pay     There are certain issues where too much bend would create an impractical and ineffective immigration system   said Menendez   Unfortunately  that is what I believe will occur under the agreement announced earlier this afternoon    I for one cannot settle for something that isn t responsible  or something that creates a bigger problem than already exists   It doesn t have to be perfect  but it does have to be fair  humane  and practical    A transcript from the Senate floor follows   Mr  MENENDEZ  Mr  President  over the coming week the Senate has a historic opportunity to move forward with tough  smart  and fair comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders  that ensures our economy continues to thrive  that protects American workers  and that at the same time undoes the process of committing millions of people to languish in the darkness and be exploited  or we can choose to abdicate our responsibilities and tacitly maintain the status quo of failed laws and a broken immigration system that is weak enforcement  that leaves our borders and our citizens unsecured and at the same time permits human exploitation to continue      As a group  several Senators  including myself  have been meeting and negotiating on comprehensive immigration reform over the past couple of months  I appreciate the President making Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez available to try to reach an agreement that would do those things      I have come  during the course of that process with other colleagues  to a better understanding of my colleagues and their thoughts on this issue through the many hours we have spent talking together about solving the immigration problems  though I have not always agreed with them  I would like to believe our discussions were serious  thorough  and in good faith  At times they were productive  at other times they hit obstacles  but when one considers the enormity of the task at hand  along with what is at stake  one would have to be naive in thinking this would be an easy process      One thing we know for sure is that beginning next week  if cloture is invoked  an immigrating bill  in some form  will be considered on the floor of the Senate  I sincerely appreciate the commitment in regard to the time spent and the thought invested on this issue from all sides involved  The amount of work that has been put into this effort represents the interest level  not to mention the stakes      I will say  however  that in large part  part of the problem in getting agreement this year was where the administration started off in their proposal  which acted as a marker in these negotiations  From the minute I saw that proposal  it was clear to me we were no longer where we were last year on this issue      Last year  we passed a bipartisan bill  one that a majority of Americans could get behind  It was a historic effort that joined 23 Republicans with 39 Democrats to address an issue of urgent national importance  The bill is the basis of what Majority Leader Reid has scheduled a cloture vote for next Monday afternoon  I do hope we will be able to get a vote to be able to continue to proceed  I appreciate the majority leader making this issue a priority  having given us 2 months of lead time  telling us a very significant part of the Senate s calendar was being reserved for this debate  I appreciate his leadership in that regard      However  unfortunately  the administration  along with several of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  decided to radically alter their views and began the process this year with a far more impractical  in my mind  far more partisan proposal  Evidently  the White House convinced itself that it must have the support of some Republican Senators who opposed and worked to defeat last year s bill in order to pass something this year  Therefore  the White House has proposed an immigration reform plan that is far to the right of the Senate s passed bill of a year ago      Let me tell you what I believe the principles should be as to how the Senate should guide itself as it debates next week  I believe any immigration reform we pass must be tough in terms of the security of our country  it must be fair  it must be workable  it must be comprehensive in nature  that preserves  among other things  family values  keeps us safe as a country  rewards hard work and sacrifice  benefits all Americans  and promotes safe  legal  and orderly immigration  Now  I could not sign on to the agreement announced in principle earlier today because  in my mind  it does not meet the principles I just described      Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to just state that very briefly in Spanish      The PRESIDING OFFICER  Without objection  it is so ordered      Mr  MENENDEZ   Speaking in Spanish       Mr  President  what I just said is I could not sign on to the agreement announced in principle because it tears families apart  and it says to many that they are only good enough to work here but not good enough to stay  Depending upon the category of individuals  it levies rather high penalties and fines  and it does not provide the confidentiality or judicial review necessary to bring those people who are undocumented in the country out of the shadows and into the light      Now  I have serious concerns about the workability and the fairness of the agreement announced earlier because  first and foremost  it tears at the fabric of family reunification by limiting and eliminating the ability of U S  citizens and lawful permanent residents to petition for their children  their parents  and siblings to join them in this country      I took it very much to heart when President Bush said family values don t stop at the Rio Grande  that we all share those family values  Yet here we are with a piece of legislation which I gather is largely supported by the White House which undermines the very essence of that  Even under a new point structure that is envisioned under this bill  it seems to me the essence of family could get much more weighty within the context of a whole new process of how we are going to move our immigration system forward  Family is a critical value  I thought  in our country      It calls for a truly temporary and  I am concerned  potentially Bracero style worker program that labor ultimately will not support and that could repeat the same problem all over  having us face this challenge in the years ahead by the way it is devised      It does not have confidentiality and judicial review  at least not of the standard I have seen to date  it is still one of those floating things out there  The reality is  if we want people to come out of the shadows into the light  to know who is here to pursue the American dream versus who is here to destroy it  then we need to be able to have those individuals understand that they will  in fact  and should come forth so that  in fact  they can go through the process envisioned by the framework agreement but that they will have confidentiality and judicial review in the process  Without addressing those issues  the system that would be created under the proposal would do little to fix our broken immigration system in the long term      Now  I support fines for those who have broken the law  But the fines that are proposed are prohibitive  and they make a pathway to legalization a path in name only  A family of four would have to pay  10 000 in fines and fees  which is more than last year s bill even after it was amended twice on the floor to increase those fines  That does not even include the cost of their trip to  touch back  when they seek to become a permanent resident  Unable to pay these fines and fees  some of the undocumented workers will be unable to come out of the shadows and into the light of American s progress and promise      Giving people the opportunity to come out of the shadows is an essential and necessary component of immigration reform because it will allow us to recognize who is here to seek the American dream versus who is here to destroy it through criminal or terrorist acts such as those which were recently almost carried out at Fort Dix in my home State of New Jersey      If we had the right set of standards  which I envision us having in our bill  and people would come forward  we would have caught those individuals by the background checks we would have conducted  But for those people to come forth  obviously  there has to be some sense that in fact there is a real opportunity  otherwise  no one will come forward      They also propose virtually doing away with provision for family reunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy throughout our history  This idea not only changes the spirit of our immigration policy  it also emphasizes the family structure  If this system had been in place when my mother and father attempted to come to this country  they certainly would not have qualified      As I have listened to the stories of so many of our fellow colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives  I know many of their parents would never have qualified to come to this country  I would like to think that they made  and continue to make  some very significant contributions to our Nation  It seems to me a new paradigm could have been structured where family values and reunification have more of a fighting chance than under the framework agreement      As for the temporary worker program  we are inviting in temporary workers but  of course  we expect them to leave  Yes  temporary is temporary  and we are going to rotate them through  but how we do that and what pathway at the end of the day we might provide for saying you are human capital is incredibly important to this country  As if you perform enough of it  there may be an opportunity for you to adjust your status  But the way that the framework document envisions  it can simply create another undocumented workforce  It also sends the message that there are some people good enough to work here but not good enough to stay here  there are others good enough to work here and to stay here  If one didn t know what year it was  one might think we were discussing the National Origins Act of 1924  These and other problems with the proposed deal have to be improved to be able to support the type of reform that will meet the principles I have outlined      Generally speaking  it seems to me we have taken a radical departure from what we were able to collectively achieve last year  We need to take a hard look at it as we open the debate next week  For the sake of much needed reform  many Democrats  including myself  showed a willingness  even more than I would have envisioned  to make strides toward the White House s proposal  Even so there are certain issues where too much bend ultimately creates an impractical and ineffective immigration system      Unfortunately  that is what I believe will occur under the agreement announced earlier this afternoon      I  for one  cannot settle for something that isn t sufficiently responsible in terms of meeting these values  security of the country  making sure we deal with our economy in a way that doesn t depress wages but at the same time realizes certain economic sectors need help and preserves family values  and at the same time makes sure we end the exploitation that often takes place when those people are languishing in the darkness  It doesn t have to be perfect  but it does have to be fair  humane  and practical      Part of the magic of our Constitution is that it eventually allows the better parts of our nature to prevail  The better part of our national character is found in the strength we have achieved through our diversity  But that better nature must be fought for and fostered  in my mind  one of the greatest parts of America s experiment that has made it the great country that it is  I look forward to leading efforts on the floor of the Senate that will strengthen our security  protect American workers  deal with the necessities of our economy  while at the same time upholding the promise and the value of the American story that we hold so dear  We need to improve the framework document that has been announced through the legislative process next week  This is too important an issue to allow partisan politics to play a role  It is too important an issue to only be concerned about appeasing a relatively small part of a political base that is unrepresentative of the American public at large      We must come together not as Democrats and Republicans  or liberals and conservatives  but as statesmen and  in doing so  honor the traditions of the Senate as a body that values reasoning  honest debate  and compromise over sound bites  talking points  fear  and smear tactics      I know in my heart this is possible  I pray that it is practical and that we can end up with a bill next week that does these things  secures our country in a meaningful way and at the same time makes sure that we can preserve the economic interests of our country in all of the different aspects of our economy  that can say that the promise of family values we hold so dear and that has been at the core for over four decades of our immigration system can continue to be a reality  that we can end the human exploitation of people within our country  and in doing so  we actually make our country safer  more secure  and more robust in its economy  That is where I hope to lead efforts on the Senate floor next week      I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senators who have agreed to the framework agreement  I just believe it falls too short in some of the key principles for me to be supportive      I am looking forward to a bill on which we can join together and say  We did the best for the Nation  We did what is humanely right  We did what is right for the Nation in terms of its security and its economy  and we have preserved the very essence of what this Nation has been about      From my home State of New Jersey  which was a gateway to millions of people across this country  particularly during the period of Ellis Island  we can almost touch Lady Liberty  Ellis Island is a short bridge walk across  The reality is that because of those people who have contributed so dramatically to our country  we all have a relationship to immigration  whether you can trace your history to the Mayflower and the voyage of that first opportunity  whether you are part of the Daughters of the American Revolution  whether you came with the millions in the European experience that crossed a great ocean through Ellis Island and then throughout our country  whether you came  as my parents did  in search of freedom  the reality is  we all have a connection  Let s honor that connection in a way that meets these values  Let  meet that challenge      I hope we can do so next week as the Senate convenes on this historic debate  I look forward to that opportunity      I yield the floor
