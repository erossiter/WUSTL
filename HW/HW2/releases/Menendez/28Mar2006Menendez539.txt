March 28  2006      WASHINGTON   United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today called on the U S  Senate to recognize the artistic majesty and historical significance of African American spirituals by declaring the art form a  national treasure         African American spirituals are more than just songs and are about more than just lyrics   said Menendez   For an entire people  these songs simultaneously represented hope  dissent  courage and  ultimately  an abiding faith in a promised land free from the ravages of slavery and oppression  Our challenge today and every day is to not only remember the songs and lyrics  but to also commemorate the moral courage that inspired these anthems of freedom and deliverance       The Menendez led measure would be the first such honor for the African American spiritual by the U S  Senate  Rock and Roll and Blues have both been designated a national treasure but the African American spiritual has not been afforded that distinction  The resolution calls for the Senate to express the  deepest gratitude  recognition and honor to the former enslaved Africans in America for their gifts to our nation including their original music   oral history       According to American Folklore  An Encyclopedia  the African American spiritual oftentimes took many forms and the lyrics appealed to a variety of emotions and sentiment  including   sorrow  alienation and desolation    consolation and faith    resistance and defiance    deliverance    jubilation and triumph    judgment and reckoning    regeneration    spiritual progress   and  transcendence       New Jersey resident Calvin Earl  a renowned performer and educator on African American spirituals  said that the Christian lyrics became a metaphor for freedom from slavery  a secret way for slaves to  communicate with each other  teach their children  record their history and heal their pain             Full text of the resolution follows      A Resolution to Honor the African American Spiritual Recognizing the African American Spiritual as a national treasure      Whereas slavery was introduced into the European colonies in 1619 and enslaved Africans remained in bondage until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865      Whereas during this period in the United States  the enslaved African Americans created this unique American music using the English language and Christian religious faith taught to them in the new world   They stealthily weaved within the music their experience of coping with human servitude and their strong desire to be free      Whereas  as a method of survival  enslaved African Americans forbidden to speak their native languages  play musical instruments they had used in Africa  or to practice their traditional religious beliefs  relied on their strong African oral tradition of songs  stories  proverbs  and historical accounts to create this original music  now known as spirituals        Whereas Calvin Earl  a noted performer and educator on African American spirituals  remarks that the Christian lyrics became a metaphor for freedom from slavery  a secret way for slaves to  communicate with each other  teach their children  record their history and heal their pain        Whereas the New Jersey Historical Commission finds that  some of those daring and artful runaway slaves who entered New Jersey by way of the Underground Railroad no doubt sang the words of old Negro spirituals like  Steal Away  before embarking on their perilous journey north   Whereas  African American spirituals spread all over the country and the songs we know of today may only represent a small part of the total number of spirituals that once existed       Whereas Frederick Douglass  a fugitive slave who would become one of this country s leading abolitionists  remarked that the spirituals  told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension  they were tones loud  long  and deep  they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish  Every tone was a testimony against slavery and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains         Whereas the American Folklife Preservation Act  PL 94 201  finds that  the diversity inherent in American folklife has contributed greatly to the cultural richness of the nation and has fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the American people       Therefore  be it Resolved that Congress         recognizes that the African American spiritual is a poignant and powerful genre of American music that has become one of the most significant in existence    expresses deepest gratitude  recognition and honor to the former enslaved Africans in America for their gifts to our nation including their original music   oral history    requests that the President issue a proclamation commenting on the important contribution of African American spirituals to American history  and naming the African American spiritual a  national treasure
