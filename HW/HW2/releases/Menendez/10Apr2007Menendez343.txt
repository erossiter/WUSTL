April 10  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today urged his colleagues to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007  S 5   Menendez called upon President Bush  who has vetoed similar legislation in the past  to respect the wishes and hopes of those suffering from debilitating diseases and sign this bill into law                 It is time for the President to start listening to the American people and to the scientists  not just special interests   Menendez said   It s time for him to sign this important piece of legislation into law and open the door to the hope and promise of embryonic stem cell research                Menendez also cited his personal experiences with a mother suffering from Alzheimer s disease as a catalyst for his dedication to this research                My mother is suffering from Alzheimer s disease and when I look at her empty gaze and her shriveled body  I cannot help but wonder  if we had started embryonic stem cell research years ago  would she still be suffering    Menendez asked on the Senate floor   I don t want my children to be asking the same type of questions   We cannot wait any longer           The full text of his speech  as prepared  follow    M  President  we are back again  almost a year after Congress passed breakthrough legislation  discussing embryonic stem cell research and  again  I am rising in strong support of this life saving  life enhancing legislation     I am a proud co sponsor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act because I believe this bill has the potential to make a profound and positive impact on the health of millions of Americans and I believe that it does so in an ethical manner     We know that embryonic stem cells have the unique ability to develop into virtually every cell and tissue in the body   And we know that numerous frozen embryos in fertility clinics remain unused by couples at the completion of their fertility treatments   Why shouldn t they be allowed to donate those embryos to federal research to save lives   We allow people to donate organs to save lives  why couldn t a couple  if they so choose  donate their frozen embryos instead of simply discarding them   We can do this ethically and still cure illnesses  enhance lives and hopefully even save lives    But the truth is we shouldn t even be having this debate right now because if the President had done his duty last year  and not vetoed H R  810  this bill would already be law  and this country s dedicated medical researchers would be well on their way to discovering treatments and cures for many of the most savage diseases afflicting us   But  when given the opportunity to carry out the will of the people  he stood for ideology and ignorance over science and research   M  President  enough is enough   It is time for a change   I have no doubt that the Senate will pass this important legislation and thus seek to advance federally funded research on embryonic stem cells   I have no doubt that  if it becomes law  this bill will save and improve lives all over America   I have no doubt that the majority of Americans want us to pass this bill into law   My only doubt is whether or not our President will do his duty and sign it into law     During the last Congress  President Bush vetoed H R  810  crushing the hopes of millions of Americans   This year  I fear and suspect he will follow the same misguided path  But before he takes us down that route  one that leads to more heart breaks and suffering  I have one question   WHY    Why is he standing in the way of research that will save lives     Why is he keeping our parents  our children and our friends locked in wheelchairs and hospital beds   Why is he letting conservative ideology rob the lives of so many suffering Americans   The simple fact is that  whatever the claims of those who ignore science in favor of ideology  embryonic stem cell research offers one of the most promising leaps forward in the history of medicine  Speak to those who are eager to do the research and you hear of potential cures for Juvenile Diabetes  Alzheimer s  Parkinson s disease  and spinal cord injuries   If we unlock the door to this research  we can find treatments and cures for these debilitating  painful diseases  We owe it to our parents  our children  and our grandchildren to unlock that door   But President Bush prefers ignorance and pain over mercy and miracles   Where is the compassion he often speaks of   His own scientists are trying to explain the power of this research but he continues to turn a deaf ear  refusing to listen to common sense and reason   Mister President  it is time to start listening   The preamble of our Constitution says that all Americans have the right to  life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  and I believe that this implies the freedom to be physically able   By not allowing embryonic stem cell research  we are prohibiting individuals from pursuing their rights  we are blocking them from a possible cure or treatment  and we are standing in the way of their freedom     Last Congress  Story Landis  the interim chair of the National Institutes of Health s stem cell task force  bravely and bluntly spoke about the importance of embryonic stem cell research and the drawbacks of the current policy prohibiting research  saying    Science works best when scientists can pursue all avenues of research  If the cure for Parkinson s disease or Juvenile Diabetes lay behind one of four doors  wouldn t you want the option to open all four doors at once instead of one door    How can we tell our loved ones that their cure could be waiting behind a laboratory door but that the door is locked   We must pursue all avenues of research and unlock the potential that embryonic stem cell research holds   But if that isn t enough  recently in a Senate HELP Committee hearing  the Director of the National Institutes of Health  Elias Zerhouni  said that the great promise of human embryonic stem cell research is being impeded by President Bush s policy   He said    It is in the best interest of our scientists  our science  and our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells equally    So  if President Bush won t listen to his own scientists  who will he listen to   Perhaps he will listen to the American people who are crying out in unison for a change   More than 70 percent of Americans support embryonic stem cell research   Three out of four Americans understand the hope and promise that this research provides     This bill means that all the prayers for cures and therapies for Alzheimer s disease  muscular dystrophy  heart disease and countless other illnesses could be answered   This bill provides a promise that families might no longer have to see a loved one suffering   This bill means hope for the individuals challenged and fighting to live a life with dignity   I have met with children and families all over New Jersey who have shared their daily struggle with diseases and conditions that could be cured or treated if we were to pursue embryonic stem cell research     Young children have come to my office and told me about how they have to prick themselves with a needle  administer insulin shots  or use an internal pump on the side of their body in order to keep their Juvenile Diabetes under control   These children might be freed of this grave responsibility if we support embryonic stem cell research  don t we owe them the opportunity of a better life   Don t we owe it to the husband whose wife shakes uncontrollably from Parkinson s disorder to help find a cure that will restore her body   Don t we owe it to the athletes  who told me about their life altering spinal cord injuries  to give them their freedom to walk again     None of these individuals chose their current situation but we can choose to help get them out of it   We owe it to the American people  to the millions of Americans and their families suffering from life altering disabilities and diseases  to demonstrate our Nation s full commitment to finding a cure and doing all we can to help their hopes and dreams come true   Stem cell research has vast potential for curing diseases  alleviating suffering and saving lives   I know my colleagues recognize the enormous potential of this research too  and it is time for the President start listening   The question is  why does President Bush continually ignore the American people   He ignores what the American people are saying about Iraq and now he ignores what they are saying about embryonic stem cell research   Both decisions result in lost lives and both decisions cause pain and suffering   This is unacceptable to me and the overwhelming majority of Americans  but why isn t it unacceptable to President Bush   I am very passionate and dedicated to this cause because the promise of stem cell research has personally captivated my family  like it has so many other American families   My mother is suffering from Alzheimer s disease and when I look at her empty gaze and her shriveled body  I cannot help but wonder  if we had started embryonic stem cell research years ago  would she still be suffering   Would she be cured or would she at least be able to recognize her own children and grandchildren  Would she have been with me on the day I took the oath of office in this chamber   I don t want my children to be asking the same type of questions   We cannot wait any longer    The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is an ethical  life enhancing  life saving piece of legislation   I believe it is the moral obligation of the United States government  and the President of the United States  to allow this process  these potential cures  to be fully explored     Embryonic stem cell research holds the promise of hope and the possible restoration of life   We owe it to current and future generations to ensure that their lives remain as bright and prosperous as today s science allows     It is time for the President to start listening to the American people and to the scientists  not just special interests   It s time for him to sign this important piece of legislation into law and open the door to the hope and promise of embryonic stem cell research   It is time for hope and cures  not despair and disease   Thank you   I yield the floor
