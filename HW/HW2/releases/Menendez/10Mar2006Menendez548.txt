before he will offer an   amendment in the Senate Budget Committee to increase   container scanning and inspection and triple port security   grants  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today called on   senior members of the Senate Budget Committee to dedicate   specific budget dollars to fund desperately needed port security   measures   Menendez was joined on this letter by Senators John   Kerry  D MA   Patty Murray  D WA   Barbara Mikulski  D MD     Daniel Akaka  D HI   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Mark Dayton  D   MN   and Jack Reed  D RI        The 9 11 commission implored American lawmakers to   think the  unthinkable  in considering how to best protect   America s homeland   Menendez said   But  thus far  we ve been   unable to adequately handle the basics  It is not enough to only   talk about securing American ports  To make U S  ports truly   safer  we need to dramatically increase the scanning and   inspection of all cargo containers entering our country       In the letter  addressed to Senators Judd Gregg and Kent   Conrad  chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget   Committee  the eight senators pushed for dedicated funding for   port security measures       Meeting the security needs of our nation s ports has been a   critical national security issue for years  and yet we are still not   making the adequate investment needed to secure our ports     the senators wrote   Despite the clear weaknesses in our port   security  our ports still do not have the adequate funding they   need to respond       On Thursday  Menendez will offer an amendment to the   budget resolution for fiscal year 2007 that would add  965   million in new funding for port security   The measure would   increase container inspections  putting the country on the road   to 100 percent scanning of containers   It would also add funds   to improve existing programs  increase funding for research     development to improve existing scanning and port security   technologies and triple grant funding for port security       These provisions  coupled with measures to increase port   security staff and purchase needed technology  will move   American ports closer to scanning and inspecting 100 percent of   cargo containers entering U S  ports   Currently only about five   percent of cargo is inspected      President Bush s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal calls for    600 million for a Targeted Infrastructure Protection grant   program  which would fund security efforts for a series of critical   infrastructure  including ports  chemical plants  rail  transit  and   bus systems    Industry experts indicate  600 million falls far   short of properly and adequately securing critical American   infrastructure  For port security grants alone  the American   Association of Port Authorities has called for  400 million              March 8  2006     The Honorable Judd Gregg  Chairman                                                                      Committee on the Budget                                           United States Senate                                                                                                     The Honorable Kent Conrad   Ranking Member  Committee on the Budget  United States Senate       Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Conrad      As you work to craft the fiscal year 2007 budget resolution    we urge you to pay particular attention to the security needs of   our nation s ports  Keeping in mind the constraints facing the   nation s budget this year  we ask that you provide adequate   funding to secure  protect  and monitor our ports         The recent debate over our ports has highlighted a   vulnerability underlying our nation s security efforts that has   been ignored for too long   Our ports are the gateway to this   country   The cargo that goes through our ports is essential to   our economy and our nation s security   Yet our ports also pose   unique and challenging security risks   Containers could conceal   a deadly weapon or smuggle any number of items that could be   used in an attack against our nation        Meeting the security needs of our nation s ports has been a   critical national security issue for years  and yet we are still not   making the adequate investment needed to secure our ports   If   there is anything we have learned from the September 11   terrorist attacks  it is that threats to our country will come in   new and unthinkable ways   We cannot anticipate all the threats   the nation may face  but we can provide the resources to protect   our critical infrastructure        Despite the clear weaknesses in our port security  our ports   still do not have the adequate funding they need to respond   In   2003  the Coast Guard estimated it would need  7 2 billion to   implement the security requirements of the Maritime   Transportation Security Act   While Congress has provided just   under than  800 million for these efforts since September 11    2001  there is much more that needs to be done         This year  the president s budget calls for  600 million for a   Targeted Infrastructure Protection grant program  which would   provide funding for security efforts for a series of critical   infrastructure  including ports  chemical plants  rail  transit  and   bus systems    A combined funding level of  600 million does   not even come close to what is needed to ensure our nation s   safety   For port security alone  the American Association of Port   Authorities has called for  400 million  Yet  port security is not   the only aspect of our security that has been overlooked  transit    rail  and chemical plant security all pose tremendous risks and   require significant increases in funding   Passenger rail security   alone requires  1 2 billion  according to the American Public   Transportation Association  and far more is needed for our mass   transit systems   Every part of our nation s infrastructure   requires dedicated funding for security   Therefore  we urge you   to reject this TIP funding proposal and fund port security   through a dedicated grant program            Without adequate federal investment in the security of our   ports  we cannot assure the nation that we have taken steps to   ensure their safety  We appreciate your attention to this concern    and we look forward to working with you on a budget resolution   that will protect our nation and reflect the values of all   Americans                 Sincerely      Robert Menendez
