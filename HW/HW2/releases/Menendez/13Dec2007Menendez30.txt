December 13  2007      WASHINGTON  Following news reports this week that the Department of Transportation plans to implement flight schedule restrictions for New Yorks John F  Kennedy International Airport  New Jerseys U S  Senators  Bob Menendez  D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   are pressing the Department to take a more regional approach to reducing flight delays  an approach that includes action to reduce delays at Newark Liberty International Airport     In their letter to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and Federal Aviation Administration Acting Administrator Robert Sturgell  the senators cite the lack of attention paid to Newark  the nations most delayed airport  during the FAAs delay reduction process  They argue that a cap for JFK  in combination with an existing cap at LaGuardia Airport  will force all new entrants into the regional market to use Newark  I am certainly hoping that this is a two step process and that the FAA is preparing to announce action at Newark  but to this point they have taken a narrow approach to this regional problem  said Senator Bob Menendez  Travelers who use Newark are already at their wits end with all the delays and growing safety issues  Jamming more flights into an airport already filled to the brim could make the pot boil over  Travelers are tired of flights that are delayed or flat out cancelled  The Bush Administrations proposal will make the situation worse at Newark Airport  cramming too many flights into too few slots  Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said  We cannot let the Bush Administration dump these excess flights    and the problems they create    onto New Jersey  In August  Senator Menendez first urged the DOT and FAA to consider innovative ideas to reduce flight delays  including flight caps     and he has consistently pressed the FAA to take a regional approach to this issue     Senator Lautenberg included  2 5 million in new funding for passenger rights enforcement in the 2008 Department of Transportation funding bill  The money will help improve customer service for all airline passers  including those who are stranded due to flight delays  missed connections and cancellations  In November  a House Senate Conference Committee approved two measures sponsored by both New Jersey Senators to reduce delays and congestion in our region  One measure requires the federal government to send Congress a plan to reduce flight delays  the other requires the GAO investigate the Administrations proposed Airspace Redesign Plan  Text of letter  December 12  2007 The Honorable Robert A  Sturgell   Deputy and Acting Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration   800 Independence Ave  SW   Washington  DC 20591 The Honorable Mary E  Peters   Secretary   U S  Department of Transportation   1200 New Jersey Ave  SE   Washington  DC 20590 Dear Secretary Peters and Administrator Sturgell   We write you in response to published reports yesterday about a cap on flights at New Yorks John F  Kennedy International Airport  JFK   which we understand the Administration may be preparing to announce as soon as next week  It is our belief that a focus on only one of the regions overflowing airports threatens to put greater strain on the rest of the airports in the area  especially Newark Liberty International Airport  Therefore  the news that you are prepared to announce flight caps only at JFK troubles us   As Senators from New Jersey  our most immediate concern is with Newark the airport with the most flight delays in the nation  where the Government Accountability Office has found questionable safety conditions  and where we have seen a recent spike in low fuel landings  When the schedule reduction meetings at JFK were first announced  the FAA gave our offices assurances that such meetings for Newark were soon to follow  To date those meetings have not taken place  A cap on flights at JFK reflects an unbalanced approach to a regional problem  Since caps on flights are already in place at LaGuardia Airport  implementing caps on flights at JFK would force all new market entrants to use Newark Airport  This development would make our most delayed airport face the possibility of having even greater delays  Putting additional strain on Newark when it is already nearing the breaking point makes little sense  We ask you to provide us with a prompt update on your plans for schedule reduction meetings or to impose flight caps at Newark or otherwise deal with delays at Newark  If you do not believe the plan to cap flights only at JFK will adversely affect Newark  we ask for a prompt explanation  And we also ask you for an explanation of the rationale behind focusing the lions share of your delay reduction efforts on JFK  Caps only at JFK would be unfair to New Jersey travelers and would only worsen flight delay problems in our region  We thank you for your attention to the matter   Sincerely   ROBERT MENENDEZFRANK LAUTENBERG
