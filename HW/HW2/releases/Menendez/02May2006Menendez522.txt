May 2  2006      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today joined Senator Bill Nelson  D FL  to offer an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill to help America kick its   oil addiction    and put our country on a   path to real energy security     The amendment would infuse critically needed resources into next generation technologies including cellulosic fuels  alternative fuel  hybrid and flex fuel automobiles for the federal fleet  and for low emission  clean energy electricity generation systems at U S  defense facilities   Republican Senators used parliamentary maneuvering to obstruct Menendez  s measure from coming to a vote    The full text of Senator Menendez  s statement to the Senate follows    Mr  President  I rise to discuss an amendment  filed by Senator Nelson of Florida and myself  and joined by Senators Lieberman  Lautenberg  Kerry  and our distinguished minority leader  that will provide serious resources  not just lip service  to help us kick the oil addiction habit and put this country on a long term path to real energy security  At a time when American families are spending exorbitant amounts to fill their cars and heat their homes  when this nation is using ever increasing quantities of foreign oil  when our coastal communities are threatened by rising sea levels caused by global warming  we need a new approach  And for the sake of our economy  our security  and our environment  we need to act now             For years  this administration has promoted one course    more drilling  Instead of making the necessary and timely investments needed to push this country in the direction of a sustainable energy policy  the administration has beat one drum over and over again    drill  drill  drill  Drill in the Arctic  drill in our wilderness  drill off our beaches  This is not the way to kick our oil habit  The president claims to have seen the light  and now touts the virtues of efficiency and the importance of biofuels and renewable energy  But he proposes to fund the Department of Energy  s Efficiency and Renewables programs at the same level they were at in 2001  And he refuses to endorse higher mileage standards for automobiles  which are the same now as they were twenty years ago     Mr  President  our energy situation has reached a critical point  and it is truly an emergency  Secretary of Energy Bodman even admitted on Sunday that we are facing a crisis  Gas prices are nearing their record highs  rising 41 cents in the past month and over 54 cents since the Energy Bill was signed into law last August  Many of the countries that we depend on for our oil are politically unstable or have unfriendly regimes  The Iranian situation  in particular  threatens to drive oil prices far higher  We can not allow our economy to be continually held hostage by the whims of OPEC     And this is not just about economic security  It is about national security  As former CIA Director James Woolsey testified before the Energy Committee  the hundreds of billions of dollars we send abroad each year to feed our oil addiction help to fund the very organizations that preach hatred for America     We should have taken serious action years ago  but the administration buried its head in the sand  Mr  President  the American people can afford to wait no longer  The Nelson Menendez amendment provides the immediate funding we need to allow us to take control of our destiny and create a brighter  cleaner  and safer energy future for America  It provides 3 billion dollars for a wide range of efficiency  security  and research and development programs    programs the President talks about in glowing terms but doesn  t propose to actually fund     His 2007 budget barely includes half of the authorized funding for renewable energy research  and provides less than 2  for the incentives needed to encourage the installation and use of renewable energy  Our amendment would add 150 million dollars for renewable energy research and development in the Department of Energy  over 100 million in renewable energy rebates for homes and small businesses  and 200 million for the Department of Defense to do its part to meet the renewable energy goals set out by the President and in the law    The administration has tried for years to portray efficiency as a vice  something that  s totally inconsistent with the American way of life  Recently they  ve changed their tune  but not their actions  The president  s budget actually cut energy efficiency programs by 13 percent  That simply astounds me  Few things are more effective for curbing our addiction to oil than becoming more energy efficient  A 2001 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that a 7 billion dollar investment in DOE energy efficiency programs had returned 30 billion in benefits  That  s better than 4 to 1  But the president cut efficiency programs by over a hundred million dollars  The weatherization program  which helps low income families reduce fuel use and lower their energy bills  has been shown to provide well over three dollars of benefit for each one dollar spent  But the president proposed to slash that by nearly 30     Our amendment recognizes the tremendous benefit we as a nation receive by becoming more efficient  and provides an additional 300 million for energy efficiency programs  and another 225 million for weatherization grants    If we want to make a serious dent in our use of oil  however  we need to look at the transportation sector  which is responsible for two thirds of our national oil consumption  While everyone seems to agree on the need to get more flex fuel and alternative fuel vehicles on the road  and the urgency of producing cellulosic ethanol  the administration simply does not make the real financial commitment  But this amendment does  It provides 150 million for vehicle research programs  350 million for the clean cities program  200 million for biomass research and development and 250 million in production incentives for cellulosic fuels     There are also provisions in this amendment to increase the reliability of our electricity grid  encourage the federal government to purchase alternative fuel vehicles  help improve the efficiency of aircraft  and much more  It is a large amendment because this is a large problem  Our economy  our environment  and our national security are all too important to be left to the best interests of OPEC and the giant oil companies  Skyrocketing gas prices have been a wake up call for everyone  but even if we succeed in providing relief for American consumers  as my amendment last week would have done  we can not afford to go back to sleep on this issue  The American people expect us to get serious about our energy future  and they expect us to do it immediately  If we don  t act now  when do we act  I urge my colleagues to join us and support the Nelson Menendez amendment for energy security and independence  and embrace a real plan to get us to a clean and secure energy future
