Robert Menendez    D NJ   joined by U S  Representative Deborah Pryce  R Ohio 15     today implored Health and Human Services Secretary Michael   Leavitt to fully fund the Patient Navigator Program  a new law   that was spearheaded by then Representative Menendez in the   House of Representatives  This program was not marked for   funding in President Bush  s budget proposal for the next fiscal   year      The Patient Navigator Program  signed into law last year by   President Bush  ensures year round outreach to target   communities and funds patient navigators to conduct outreach    build relationships  and educate the public  while encouraging   prevention screenings and follow up treatment        We know that addressing health disparities is a complex   challenge  but establishing a network of patient navigators is   one strategy we can use to help Americans get the support and   care they need     Menendez and Pryce wrote    This program will   enhance our ability to provide culturally relevant information    tailored outreach and education  and interventions that will   improve access to care  health outcomes  and quality of life for   communities across the country        There is no better time than right now to get this program   underway         The Patient Navigator program  authorized with strong   bipartisan support in Congress  will address barriers to health   care by funding navigators to assess patient and community   needs and guide patients through a complicated and fragmented   health care system  It also ensures that navigators are available   to help patients make their way through the health care system      whether by translating technical medical terminology    explaining their insurance  making appointments for referral   screenings  following up to make sure the patient keeps that   appointment  or even accompanying a patient to a referral   appointment        The Patient Navigator bill was endorsed by a broad coalition   of health care advocacy groups  including the American Cancer   Society  the National Association of Community Health Centers    the American Diabetes Association  the National Patient   Advocate Foundation  the National Health Council  and the   American Medical Association      President Bush signed the bill into law on June 29th of last   year           March 1  2006     The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  DC 20201     Dear Secretary Leavitt      We are writing to urge the use of your discretionary   authority to establish the Patient Navigator program at the   Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA         On June 29  2005  President George W  Bush signed the   Patient Navigator  Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act   into law  thereby providing you  acting through HRSA  with the   authority to establish demonstration patient navigator programs   in medically underserved communities nationwide   As Fiscal   Year 2006 funds authorized to launch this program were not   specified during the appropriations process  we respectfully   request that you consider dedicating sufficient funds within the   Department of Health and Human Services budget now  in   advance of future appropriations   We will be working this year   to secure direct appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007              As you know  improving the health of America as a whole   depends significantly on our ability to substantially improve the   health outcomes of the uninsured  those who live in rural areas    minorities  and other medically underserved populations that   suffer from a disproportionate burden of cancer and other   chronic diseases   We know that addressing health disparities is   a complex challenge  but establishing a network of patient   navigators is one strategy we can use to help Americans get the   support and care they need       The Patient Navigator program  authorized with strong   bipartisan support in Congress  will address barriers to health   care by funding navigators to assess patient and community   needs and guide patients through a complicated and fragmented   health care system  Moreover  this program will enhance our   ability to provide culturally relevant information  tailored   outreach and education  and interventions that will improve   access to care  health outcomes  and quality of life for   communities across the country   There is no better time than   right now to get this program underway      Thank you for consideration of our request   We look   forward to hearing from you      Sincerely      Robert Menendez  United States Senate      Deborah Pryce  Member of Congress
