spending in Iraq could pay for yearly cost to keep American bridges sound Menendez  Bush administration s motto is  Spend all our money over there so we don t spend it here     Menendez  Bush administration s motto is  Spend all our money over there so we don t spend it here    Thursday  November 1  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today continued his series of floor speeches aimed at highlighting what Iraq War spending could provide in domestic priorities  Today  Sen  Menendez focused on what Iraq War spending could be providing in terms of transportation needs  earlier this week  the Senate approved an important investment in Amtrak and rail  What Iraq war spending could do for transportation here at home   22 days of Iraq War spending would cover the yearly costs of maintaining and replacing obsolete or deteriorating bridges   7 4 billion   Less than one day of Iraq War spending would cover the cost of replacing the Minneapolis bridge that collapsed this year   234 million   Less than two months of Iraq War spending would cover the cost of what the Amtrak bill that passed the Senate this week invests over six years   19 2 billion  Thinking about our transportation needs is another way to think about what we want the United States of America to look like as a nation  and those needs are yet another reason it is time to end this war  said Menendez  When it comes to the failed War in Iraq  American families are tired of being taken for a ride  It is time to soar again  It is time to reinforce with the strongest iron and steel the bridges to safety and success  time to clear off the barricades from the road to opportunity  time to put America on the highest speed track we can  and to make sure we are always first in flight    Sen  Menendez plans to deliver speeches in this series periodically  particularly when a domestic policy priority is being considered on the Senate floor  Below is the text of his remarks from today  as prepared for delivery   THE IRAQ WAR  What Its Costing Us Here at Home Part III  Iraq VS  Transportation funding   This is the third speech Ive stood up to give in a series about what the Iraq war is costing us here at home  beyond the 3 839 lives lost and 28 327 Americans injured  Since I started giving these speeches two weeks ago   5 billion more is gone from the treasury and has been spent in Iraq  It brings the total amount taken from the American peoples pockets to  455 billion  Next month  another  10 billion will be sent off to Iraqand itll be gone forever  Americans trusted the government with that money  When the numbers are that outrageously high  we all have to be constantly asking ourselves a simple question  whats going to make a bigger difference in our lives  using the money to fix the major problems we have to face every day  or fighting a war that has achieved nothing for any of us  Could America have gotten more out of that money spending it on hospitals  life saving cancer research  schools and universities  food for the needy  roads  train tracks  bridges and airportsor on the catastrophe that is the War in Iraq  The Bush Administration likes to parrot the line that were fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them here  But Americans have figured out that what they mean is  Were spending all our money over there so we dont spend it here    M  President  Ive already spoken about the massive holes in homeland security that the war funding could have closed  Ive spoken about the difference that funding could have made for millions of Americans who have to play Russian roulette with their lives because they dont have health insurance including the millions of children who would be covered under the bill currently before us  a bill the president threatens to veto while asking for  200 billion in war funding this year alone  Today Id like to talk about what America would look like if we spent the money George Bush is spending on failing to rebuild Iraq  to repair our battered infrastructure at home  There is no way to put a price tag on the immense frustration we all can feel with our systems of transportation  If youve ever slammed your hands on your steering wheel because traffic is unbearable  so youre going to miss your meeting or be late to pick up your child at school  if youve ever had your train delayed  or been jammed inside a subway car that was not built to carry the number of people who are stuffed in there  if youve ever been stuck waiting in an airport terminal  or trapped in a plane sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off for hoursthen you know our transportation systems are stretched to the limit  And sometimes they just break  Thirteen people paid the ultimate price and a hundred more were injured after the terrible  tragic collapse of a bridge in Minnesota a few months ago  Its scary how easily that could happen again  Heres a truly shocking statistic  the number of bridges that are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete in this country is enormous  its about 160 000 bridges  or 25  of all bridges  That means if youve driven over four bridges  the odds are one of them was not in great shape  Thats incredibly scary  So what does it cost to stop another tragedy like the one in Minneapolis from happening  The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the cost of maintaining and replacing obsolete or deteriorating bridges is about  7 4 billion a year  And thats just the cost of staying even and not allowing the overall quality of our bridges to deteriorate further  If we spent on transportation what we spend on the Iraq War  we could pay off that entire cost in twenty two days  Twenty two days  Thats what the War costs  Bridges you can feel confident driving over confident that youll get home safe to your family  Versus less than a month in Iraq  Today  construction is beginning on the Minneapolis bridge that will replace the one that collapsed  The cost   234 million  We spend that money in Iraq in less than one day  Americans are feeling the hassle of commuting by car or plane  especially for long distances  Oil prices are hitting record highs  Many fear that petroleum production is reaching a peak  Burning oil thickens our air with smog and stokes the fires of the global climate crisis  threatening to drown buildings on our coastlines under water and create massive droughts inland  If we dont create viable transportation options that will end our dependence on oil  America is going to be in big  big trouble  With all this in mind  yesterday the Senate passed a bill to boost funding to Amtrak  We passed that bill so the great American relationship with the railroad could be restored and brought to new peaks of excellence  Funding for the Amtrak bill would be  19 2 billion over six years  That money would make passenger transportation easier  It would improve rail security  It would make our air cleaner  And it would be a boost to the economy  But just like every appropriations bill that has come to the Presidents desk under the Democratic Congress  the Administration has argued that we just dont have the money for good public transportation  While George Bushs mouth is moving  his hand is signing checks for other things  What the Amtrak bill would spend in 6 years  the President spends in Iraq in under two months  Thats what the war costs  Vastly improved American railroads  Versus two months of bloody chaos in Iraq  The costs of this war are unimaginable  The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting that the Iraq War will cost  1 9 trillion dollars  It is incredibly hard to put that number into perspective  Just so we get an idea of how vast that sum is  paving the entire Interstate Highway System  over the course of three and a half decades  only cost  425 billion  And some estimates say the Interstate Highway System returns  6 for every  1 spent  The Iraq War has returned zero dollars for every billion dollars spent  Just so we get an idea of how vast that sum is  with the money spent in Iraq  we could pave a 4 lane American highway from Chicago to Milwaukee with an entire inch of solid gold  If you made the thickness less than one inch  you could easily gild a highway from sea to shining sea  Thats what the war costs  It costs so much  the amount of money starts to exceed what it would cost to pay for even our most ludicrous dreams  We have to use our imaginations as to where that money could go  because for a lot of it  we really dont know where its going  Billions of dollars have just gone missing in Iraq  And according to a report released by the Special Inspector General for Iraq earlier this week  the rest has largely failed to rebuild Iraqs infrastructure  Meanwhile  infrastructure in American still needs serious help  M  President  it is time for us to make a choice  will we put this country on the track to recovery  or watch it barrel down the rails to deterioration  Will we pave the highway to success for our people  or leave that road to rust and rot  Will we watch our economy take off  the aspirations and dreams of our people soar to new heights  or will we ground our nation  leaving thousands to face the congestion that gridlocks so many forms of transportation in so many places  leave thousands waiting in the terminals of frustrationwaiting  for something to change  for something finally to change  Thinking about our transportation needs is another way to think about what we want the United States of America to look like as a nation  And those needs are yet another reason it is time to end this war  Because when it comes to the failed War in Iraq  American families are tired of being taken for a ride  M  President  it is time to soar again  It is time to reinforce with the strongest iron and steel the bridges to safety and success  time to clear off the barricades from the road to opportunity  time to put America on the highest speed track we can  and to make sure we are always first in flight  high above the clouds
