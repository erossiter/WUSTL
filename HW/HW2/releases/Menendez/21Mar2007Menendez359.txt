CALL TO EXTEND SCHIP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Wednesday  March 21  2007      WASHINGTON    Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care Chairman Jay Rockefeller  Senate HELP Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy and Senators Stabenow  Menendez  Brown and Casey today called on the Senate to continue providing millions of our nation s children with the health care they desperately need by voting to extend the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP    While the Bush Administration s 2008 Budget jeopardizes the health coverage of thousands of children by failing to adequately fund SCHIP  Senate Democrats are committed to extending and expanding this successful insurance program    The Senate Democrats  plan provides up to  50 billion for the reauthorization of SCHIP  which far exceeds the insufficient funding proposed by the Bush Administration   These vital resources will not only maintain coverage for the millions of children already enrolled in the program  but will also expand health insurance to the six million children that are currently eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid benefits  yet not enrolled in the program     As the Chairman of the committee that will reauthorize the Children s Health Insurance Program  I said weeks ago that it would take about  50 billion to renew and expand health coverage for all kids eligible for this vital program  The Budget Committee responded and set the bar where it needs to be   said Senator Baucus     In my home state of Montana  more than 13 000 kids depend on CHIP for their health coverage and care   We can reach many more children across this country  if we work together to fulfill the promise of the Children s Health Insurance Program      Ten years ago we made a promise to provide health care to one of our most vulnerable populations  our kids  The time has come to renew that commitment   Senator Rockefeller said   Our budget proposal delivers peace of mind to the Moms and Dads across America  and puts Congress squarely on the record that our children must come first  One child without health insurance is one child too many  We have a moral obligation to take care of the needs of our children      When we passed CHIP a decade ago  we made a promise to working families that we would provide help with health coverage for their children   said Senator Kennedy   CHIP has been a great success  providing access to good health care for millions of children each year   Children who once were uninsured now can see a doctor to treat their earaches  their asthma  or their diabetes   CHIP can make the difference between a child burdened with disease   or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow      As lawmakers  we have a moral obligation to provide health care coverage for the millions of uninsured children in our nation   said Senator Stabenow    Health care should be a right  not a privilege in America  and covering every child is an important step towards this goal   Our budget makes good on the Democratic promise to strengthen SCHIP and ensure that children have access to the health coverage they need      I simply find it embarrassing that some in Washington   those who have some of the best health care coverage in the world   would propose to cut coverage for America s neediest children   Senator Menendez said   I am proud to stand with my colleagues in rejecting that terrible idea  We recognized that the Congress had a responsibility to fix the shortcomings of the president s budget to ensure that America s neediest children get the care and health coverage they need      In 1997 Republicans and Democrats united to establish the Children s Health Insurance program   In 2007  we should work together again to protect the progress we ve made and reach the children who still lack health insurance   This budget provides the blueprint  and I hope once we adopt it our Republican colleagues will join us in building on our earlier work   said Senator Brown   In 1992  my father  Governor Robert P  Casey  signed into law the program that became the model for SCHIP at the federal level   said Senator Casey   Encouraging progress to expand children s health insurance and not stifling SCHIP with inadequate funding and restrictions is one of the most vital issues facing the United States   In particular  we must resist efforts to restrict SCHIP to states like Pennsylvania that have expanded coverage to families earning more than 200  of poverty     Millions of low income Americans are currently insured by the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP    This program has become an important vehicle for providing health coverage to uninsured children and it must be extended   With more than 46 million Americans without health insurance  Senate Democrats believe the Congress must act quickly to guarantee the critical health care coverage our youngest Americans deserve
