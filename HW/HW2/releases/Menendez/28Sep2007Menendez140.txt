OUT IN SUPPORT OF MEASURE TO CRACK DOWN ON HATE CRIMES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Friday  September 28  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today spoke on the Senate floor in favor of the Kennedy Smith hate crimes prevention amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill  The amendment would give local  state and federal governments broader authority and resources to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnicity  religion  sexual orientation  disability or gender identity  Hate crimes violate every principle upon which this country was founded  said Menendez  The freedoms we often take for granted  freedom of speech  freedom of association  freedom of religion  become empty promises if we do not protect all those who seek to exercise these freedoms under the Constitution  This is not about providing special rights  it is about insuring Constitutional rights   Full text of Menendezs remarks  as prepared for delivery  Mr  President  Nine years ago  a young man sat at a bar having a good time  Not unlike thousands of young adults at bars across America  this young man needed a ride home from the bar  So he asked two people he had befriended for a ride  They agreed  and on the way home  they robbed him  pistol whipped him  and tied him to a fence  leaving him for dead  They committed this brutal crime for one reason  because the victim was gay   Since that time  the Congress has been struggling to enact the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act  a bill I am proud to co sponsor  It has received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate  but for some reason  we have been unable to make this bill a law  Today  I hope this will change  Hate crimes violate every principle upon which this country was founded  When our Declaration of Independence proclaimed that all men are created equal  it did not go on to say except Muslim or Sikh Americans  The freedoms we often take for granted  freedom of speech  freedom of association  freedom of religion  become empty promises if we do not protect all those who seek to exercise these freedoms under the Constitution  And  sadly  Mr  President  right now we are not protecting all of our citizens  This is not about providing special rights  it is about insuring Constitutional rights   Local  State  and Federal governments need additional resources and authority to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnicity  religion  sexual orientation  disability  and gender identity  That is exactly what this bill will do  It will allow the Department of Justice to assist in these investigations and prosecutions  and it will provide grants for State and local governments struggling with the costs and logistics of prosecuting these crimes   Some people may not think that hate crimes are a real problem in this country  They are absolutely mistaken  In 2005  the most recent year we have data on  8 380 hate crimes were reported  Of the single bias incidents  54 7  were racially motivated  17 1  were motivated by religious bias  14 2  resulted from sexual orientation bias  13 2  by ethnicity national origin bias  and just under 1  by disability bias  My home state of New Jersey experienced at least 756 bias incidents  47  of which were based on racial bias  36  were based on religious bias  and 11  were based on ethnic bias  I say at least 756 bias incidents  because we do not know how many of these vial attacks have gone unnoticed and un prosecuted due to the scarce resources currently available to local law enforcement  I am proud to have been the author of New Jerseys landmark Bias Crimes Law  We said then that we could not eradicate hate or bigotry in New Jersey with a single act  but we could send a strong societal message that such things would not be tolerated  With this Act  we can do the same for our great Nation   Of course  you dont need to rely on my numbers or my experiences to know that hate crimes are alive and well in the United States  All you have to do is watch television  Last Thursday  thousands of protesters descended on the small town of Jena  Louisiana to protest the treatment of six young African Americans  The town was a picture of racial tension  all of which came to the surface months ago when three nooses were hung from a whites only tree in the Jenna High School  Perhaps if we had stronger hate crime enforcement  this original action which provoked such violence and started the town down its path would have been properly handled and would never have escalated to the degree that it did   Make no mistake about it  hate crimes are a serious problem in the United States  A problem we can no longer afford to ignore   Some may protest that this is not the time or place to be debating hate crimes legislation  I disagree  For some  it never seems to be the right time or the right place  Members of our military are not immune to hate crimes  To the contrary  hate crimes can happen anywhere there are emotions  anywhere there are people with the capability to hate  In 1992  a Navy Sailor  Allen Schindler  was murdered by two fellow sailors because of his sexual orientation  In 1999  PFC Barry Winchell was similarly killed because his attackers believed he was gay  The military has recognized that hate crimes are a problem and sought to prevent them  but more can and must be done   Mr  President  It is absolutely appropriate to protect members of our armed forces from the vicious attacks that constitute hate crimes while we are debating the DOD authorization bill  It is absolutely the right time to enact this hate crimes legislation  After all  theyre fighting for us around the world to preserve our way of life and to promote Democracy  Let the preservation of the rights of all Americans be the essence of what they are fighting for   I will vote to invoke cloture on the hate crimes amendment offered by Senator Kennedy and Senator Smith  I urge my colleagues to do the same
