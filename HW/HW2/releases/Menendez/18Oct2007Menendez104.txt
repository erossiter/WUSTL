war spending in Iraq could pay for CHIP bill  Let s remember the Administration s motto   Spend all our money over there so we don t spend it here   That is as wrong as it gets     Thursday  October 18  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  this evening continued his series of floor speeches aimed at highlighting what Iraq War spending could provide in domestic priorities  This evening  Sen  Menendez focused on what Iraq War spending could be providing in terms of childrens health coverage  earlier today House Republicans sustained President Bushs veto of a childrens health bill that could have covered up to 10 million children from families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance     Iraq costs us  10 billion per month  said Sen  Menendez  That means with three and a half months of Iraq funding  the expansion in this bill is paid for  Thats what the war costs  Health care for 10 million children  Versus three and a half months in Iraq      Sen  Menendez plans to deliver speeches in this series periodically  particularly when a domestic policy priority is being considered on the Senate floor  Below is the text of his remarks from tonight  as prepared for delivery       THE IRAQ WAR  What Its Costing Us Here at Home  Part II  Iraq VS  Childrens Health Insurance    M  President     Yesterday I began to speak about what the failed War in Iraq is costing us here at home  to mark the fifth anniversary of Congresss capitulation to the war      Again  let me begin by saying we are all very aware of the human cost of the war  3 816 Americans are dead  More than 28 000 have come back home wounded  Iraqis have died in even greater numbers  and millions have fled their homes  The United States has been involved in the war for longer than we fought World War II      We all know that the Iraq War is a human calamity of vast proportions      It can be harder to visualize the direct damage that comes from the financial cost of the war  We are paying for this war with borrowed money  burying ourselves in massive debt  severely threatening the future of our country      We know that we have spent more than  450 billion on this war so far  We continue to spend about  10 billion every month      That doesnt just add up to a stack of bills that could have sat in the Treasury  Its equipment at ports that scan for nuclear weapons  and other measures that actually make the homeland more secure      Its children healed with better healthcare  Its more teachers in schools  better training for our jobs  energy thats clean and doesnt strengthen repressive regimes in the Middle East  payment of our debts so future generations will inherit a country that is financially viable      The Bush Administration likes to parrot the line that were fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them here  But when we add it all up  the bottom line is very clear  the Administrations motto really is  Were spending all our money over there so we dont spend it here        M  President  yesterday I spoke about how much we really could accomplish to safeguard our homeland against terrorists if we spent just a fraction of the money that weve dumped into a war that makes no sense      Today I would like to speak about what the failed War in Iraq has cost us in terms of our health  and specifically  the health of our children     Today the House of Representatives considered whether or not to support a bill to provide health insurance for children      Every time we go to the doctor or fill a prescription at the pharmacy  we remember how expensive health care can be      There are families who work every day in some of the toughest jobs in the country  but their jobs dont offer health care and their paychecks wont let them afford private coverage      Thats why the federal government and the states teamed up to start the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  or SCHIP  This year Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a bill that will continue to provide health care to the 6 million children already enrolled  and will expand the program to include a total of 10 million children across America  We knew we had to  because the children who fall into the wide abyss between Medicaid and private coverage are depending on us     But on October 3rd  millions of children got some terrible news  President Bush had vetoed the bill  He did it silently and secretly  with no cameras allowed to watch as he condemned millions of children to a lack of coverage with a single stroke of his pen      Today  families across America were waiting to see if Congress had the moral resolve to override that veto      Some of our colleagues who cast the decisive votes against childrens health raised the question of whether the bill was financially reasonable  whether 10 million uninsured American kids were worthy of funding  President Bush said that they were not     Ill add that many of my colleagues who voted against childrens health have repeatedly decided to vote for continuing the failed War in Iraq     So right now I want to speak directly to them  If were talking about whats financially reasonable  lets take a very close look at the stark contrast in costs between childrens health and the failed War in Iraq      The total cost of expanding childrens health is  35 billion over 5 years  for 10 million kids  How many dollars per child does this cost us every day  Depending on which state you live in  the answer is  as little as  3 50around the cost of a latte at Starbucks      Iraq costs us  10 billion per month  That means with three and a half months of Iraq funding  the expansion in this bill is paid for      Thats what the war costs  Health care for 10 million children  Versus three and a half months in Iraq      The impact of this bill would have been enormous in New Jersey  where families have to pay some of the highest health care costs in the nation      It would have helped support the state in keeping 124 000 New Jersey children insured  and could have covered as many as 100 000 additional children in our state     In the bill  New Jersey would have received around  350 million next year alone to cover working families and children  This program has given New Jersey families  who cannot afford private coverage  the peace of mind to know their children have health care      President Bush has told those children  no  you dont deserve the federal governments strong support  even though this country spends  330 million in Iraq every day  Again  every single day in Iraq  we spend roughly the amount of money it would take to get tens of thousands of New Jersey children coverage for a full year  I wish he had to look every child in the eye to tell them that      But thats what the war costs  Health insurance for New Jersey children  Versus one day in Iraq     In fact  with the amount Congress has spent on the failed War in Iraq  we could provide two years of health coverage for all of the 47 million Americans who dont have health insurance  who play Russian Roulette every day with their lives and their wallets  and still have  30 billion left over      Thats what the war costs  Health coverage for every single American family  Versus the failed War in Iraq      So heres the question we have to ask ourselves  as legislators  as Americans  as human beings  is a child going to get more benefit from a dollar spent keeping our military in Iraq to referee a civil war  or a dollar spent on her health insurance      Is she going to be better served by oil injected in an Abrams tank  or by a vaccine a nurse injects in her arm to save her from measles  Is her life going to be more improved by missiles in the desert or antibiotics in her medicine cabinet  more troops on the streets of Baghdad or more doctors in the hospital down the block  multi million dollar bombs that rain down on Iraqi neighborhoods with surgical precision  or orthopedic surgery for a disease like cerebral palsy that would mean the difference between a life in a wheelchair and being able to walk and run and play with the other children at school      How dare we take tax money from her family  and borrow money from foreign countries  to spend it on a war that makes no sense  while leaving her on her own to fight diseases and injuries that might claim her life      It is hard to think of a more grievous act on the part of this government than abandoning those children in order to prolong that war     The vote to override President Bushs veto was not just about political responsibility  It was not just about Constitutional responsibility  It was a question of right and wrong      Lets remember the Administrations motto  Spend all our money over there so we dont spend it here  That is as wrong as it gets        I will continue to speak on what else this war is costing us here at home  in terms of education  jobs  green energy  helping the middle class make ends meet  and the financial stability of the nation our children will inherit      America deserves to know what we could have achieved had this horrible war never happened  The Administration has spent down our finances  Republicans in the House have voted down health coverage for our children  but one thing they have not yet emptied out is our vast treasury of hope     It is tragic to think what might have been  But it is not too late to believe in what we can become
