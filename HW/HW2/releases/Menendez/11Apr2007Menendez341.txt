give Menendez straightforward answers on start to Plan B  genocide   Wednesday  April 11  2007      WASHINGTON   During a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  grilled the U S  Special Envoy to Sudan  Andrew Natsios  on the current situation in Darfur and the Bush administration s response  Despite a heated exchange  Natsios was vague regarding possible timing of the implementation of the United States  so called  Plan B  policy for Darfur  Menendez pressured him to act more swiftly to stop the killings in Sudan and to implement Plan B    It is time to get past the talk about plan B and it is time to begin to enforce plan B   Menendez said   I understand about multilateral action   But at some point in time we must lead     Natsios also refused to give Menendez a straightforward answer as to whether the conflict in Darfur can still be deemed a genocide    Menendez asked   Is the circumstances in Darfur today a continuing genocide  yes or no   Natsios never gave a definitive answer  but rather stated   There are periods of killings which could be construed as genocide that took place last fall and earlier this year           Unofficial transcript of hearing below     MENENDEZ    Thank you  Mr  Chairman           Mr  Ambassador  I appreciate your work   But I must tell you  it   seems to me that we are being waltzed by people while people die   And   the reality is  is I look at this latest report  where the United   Nations refugee agency said that militiamen had killed up to 400   people in the volatile eastern border region near Sudan leaving    quote   an apocalyptic scene of mass graves and destruction            And the attacks by the Janjaweed took place in the border area    And it goes on to say   Estimates of the number of dead have increased   substantially and now range between 200 and 400  a report by the U N    high commissioner for refugees said   The report added that many of   the dead were buried in common graves             And it says  quote   We may never know their exact number   The   attackers encircled the villages  opened fire  pursuing fleeing   villagers  robbing women  shooting the men   The agency said many who   survived the attack died from exhaustion and dehydration            You know  I want to ask you a question   Do you still stand by   what you were quoted in the Georgetown Voice  saying that the ongoing   crisis in Darfur is no longer a genocide situation           NATSIOS   Senator  I actually    there was a retraction of that   by the newspaper the following week             I actually looked at my statement very clearly   I did not say   that at the    there were three mistakes  and the Georgetown Voice              MENENDEZ    So would now tell the committee what is the situation   in Darfur    Is it a genocide           NATSIOS   In Darfur   Senator  right now there is very little   fighting in Darfur             MENENDEZ    That does not mean             NATSIOS   Senator  could I finish            CROSSTALK            MENENDEZ    The question is  do you consider             NATSIOS   Senator              MENENDEZ    Answer my question   I have a limited amount of time    Ambassador   If I ask you to be specific and answer my question           NATSIOS   I m answering your question            MENENDEZ    Do you    you can t answer if you haven t heard it       Do you consider the ongoing situation in Darfur a genocide  yes   or no           NATSIOS   What you just              MENENDEZ    Yes or no           NATSIOS   Senator  please   What you just read did not take place   in Darfur               MENENDEZ    I didn t              CROSSTALK           NATSIOS   There is very little              MENENDEZ    I m asking you yes or no           NATSIOS   There is very little violence in Darfur right now            CROSSTALK            MENENDEZ    What do you not understand           NATSIOS   Senator  I just answered your question            MENENDEZ    Is the circumstances in Darfur today a continuing   genocide  yes or no           NATSIOS   Senator  there is very little fighting between the   rebels and the government  and very few civilian casualties going on   in Darfur right now   I just told you              MENENDEZ    Ambassador  I m not asking whether diminished   fighting   I m asking whether the situation in Darfur today is a   genocide  yes or no           NATSIOS   Senator              MENENDEZ    Yes or no         NATSIOS   The situation is very volatile            MENENDEZ    All right           NATSIOS   There are periods of killings which could be construed   as genocide that took place last fall and earlier this year            CROSSTALK            MENENDEZ    You know  in the present convention that the United   Nations has on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide   it says   Genocide means any of the following acts committed with the   intent to destroy in whole or in part a national  ethnic  racial or   religious group  such as killing members of the group  causing   seriously bodily or mental harm to members of the group  deliberately   inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about   its physical destruction in whole or in part  imposing measures   intended to prevent births within the group  and forcibly transferring   the children of the group to another group            It seems to me that those clearly are elements of what is taking   place in Darfur             CROSSTALK            MENENDEZ    Let me ask you    you don t want the answer the   question yes or no            NATSIOS   I did answer the question           MENENDEZ   Let me go on to the following question   What are we   willing to accept from the secretary general   Anything less than the   agreements that we have had to date that we expect to be enforced   Do   we expect anything less than that           NATSIOS   Let me just say very clearly  sir  I follow what s   going on on the ground every day from cables  from reports and there   are acts of barbarity against people   Some of them are now being   committed by rebels   In one of the camps  the rebels have begun to   rape women   Rebels  OK               There are    there is anarchy in much of Darfur now   And there   is    300 Arabs were killed in southern Darfur              MENENDEZ   Ambassador  I appreciate your lengthy anecdotal   responses  but please just answer my question           NATSIOS   I am answering             MENENDEZ   The question is  what are we willing to accept from   the secretary general s negotiations   Is it anything less than the   agreements that we previously thought we had           NATSIOS   No  we are not willing to accept anything less           MENENDEZ   OK             Are we ready to implement plan B if the secretary general fails    yes or no           NATSIOS   We were asked    as I said earlier before you arrived    Senator  Secretary General Ban asked Dr  Rice  and asked me last week   when I met with him  for two to four weeks before we go to plan B   We   had actually intended to go it  and there was a congressional   delegation going there   And we decided not to announce it  or the   president decided not to announce             MENENDEZ   I understand all that   The question is             NATSIOS   The plan is prepared             MENENDEZ       if the secretary general fails in his efforts    I   hope he succeeds             NATSIOS   Yes           MENENDEZ       are we ready to go to plan B           NATSIOS   Yes  we are           MENENDEZ   And then  are we ready to immediately move to plan B   and implement it  in that case           NATSIOS   Well  once it s signed it will be immediately   implemented           MENENDEZ   Once it s signed           NATSIOS   Well  the president has to sign the order           MENENDEZ   My point is  are we at the point where  if the   secretary general fails  the administration is ready to move   forward             NATSIOS   I just said  Senator  if at the end of the two to four   weeks he requested  if we haven t made the progress that we believe   needs to be made  I believe the president will make the decision              I m not going to presume what the president s going to decide and   the announcement that he s going to make   It s not for my    my place   to do that          NATSIOS   But I know how angry he is and impatient he is over   this  as I am  as Dr  Rice is            MENENDEZ    Well  I think part of our problem is is that we are   quickly losing credibility in this process with Mr  al Bashir and   others   Because it s like a child   You continuously tell him   Don t   do that  don t do that     I mean  use your public opportunities to   say   Don t do that  don t do that   and they continue to do it  and   they continue to do it   And you say   Don t do that   guess what    That child never believes that in fact you are going to extract  ph  a   punishment           NATSIOS   I agree with you  Senator            MENENDEZ    And so  ultimately  we re at the point that    it   seems to me we re at that point             Let me just say  I ve got the corrected Georgetown version here    And you are quoted in the corrected version as saying   The term    genocide  is counter to the facts of what is really occurring in   Darfur             NATSIOS   Senator  I did not say that   But look              MENENDEZ    That s the corrected version           NATSIOS       that s not the point            MENENDEZ    Well  I hope that this administration             NATSIOS   The fact of the matter is              MENENDEZ        views what is happening in Darfur as genocide           NATSIOS   There is terrible              MENENDEZ    I hope that our words that  never again  are   meaningful   And those words can only be meaningful if we act   And I   hope that we will not permit this to continue to happen on our watch             I hope you take that back to the administration   It is time to   get past the talk about plan B and it is time to begin to enforce plan   B           NATSIOS   If we want to get the international community to   support our efforts under plan B  and other countries to implement   unilateral sanctions or bilateral sanctions against the Sudanese   government  we have to cooperate with them             NATSIOS   We have to talk with them   We cannot simply ignore   what everybody else is doing               As I said before  Senator  before you came in  we ve had   extensive meetings with the Europeans over the last three months over   how they might unilaterally  without a U N  resolution  impose their   own sanctions  which would be similar to ours             It would be much more powerful    much more powerful if a new set   of sanctions is both used as the dollar and the euro to enforce   We   know that from experiences in Iraq  Iran and North Korea             We are now engaged in diplomacy to get the Europeans on board    Chancellor Merkel  I believe it was two weeks ago  and the German   defense minister    they re in the presidency of the European Union      have now said  even with the absence of a U N  resolution  the   European Union may consider seriously imposing sanctions  which they   never do   They always want a Security Council resolution   This is a   big change in position             If we want to affect the behavior of the Sudanese government  we   have to have a coordinated international approach   That s what we   have right now   It takes a little bit more time to do that because   you have to talk to other people  as I m sure you re aware  Senator             If we simply do what we want to do  I would have done it a long   time ago   But Ban Ki moon    we need Ban Ki moon s support on this    If he asks for two to four weeks  we re going to give him two to four   weeks             The Europeans asked us to work with them on how this could be   done in a way that would effectively paralyze the Sudanese economy    They ve asked us how it is that we re going to do this from an   enforcement mechanism               We re working with them   We had a meeting in Washington three   weeks ago on this  on a technical level  to go through the steps   needed for them to impose parallel sanctions to what we re doing             So if we re going to do this  whether it s two weeks or four   weeks  Senator  what s    the important thing is  it has the necessary   effect on the behavior of the Sudanese government   That s the   purpose            MENENDEZ    Mr  Chairman  I know my time s over   But             BIDEN   Take your time            MENENDEZ    I listened to you  I listened to you carefully             A hundred and one days ago  you on behalf of the administration   announced plan B   Now  two to three weeks more   What does it matter   if it takes a little time             If I was sitting in those camps  I could not stand the counsels   of patience and delay   And I hope we get to the point that we   understand that             And I understand about multilateral action   But at some point in   time we must lead           NATSIOS   I agree            MENENDEZ    And it seems to me that we have not gotten to the   point where we are truly leading   And I hope that the administration   will do that sooner rather than later  because people are dying  That s the reality             Thank you  Mr  Chairman
