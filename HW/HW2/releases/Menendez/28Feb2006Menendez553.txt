United States Senators Robert   Menendez and Frank Lautenberg said today that the 45 day   review the Bush administration is conducting of the Dubai Ports   World acquisition of operations at U S  ports is a flawed process   that will yield another flawed result   In a letter to the president    they expressed concern that once the merger closes on March 2    the administration will lose its ability to block the transaction    no matter what the security investigation finds         We are concerned that once the Dubai Ports World  s  DP   World  acquisition of Peninsular   Oriental Steam Navigation    P  closes on March 2  your administration will have no legal   authority to stop the company from assuming control of specific   operations at U S  ports  no matter what the 45 day   investigation being undertaken by the Committee on Foreign   Investment in the United States  CFIUS  finds     the Senators   wrote        As of March 2nd  DP World will legally own P  with or   without any voluntary agreements related to US assets     the   letter stated        The 45 day review also does not change the previous   CFIUS decision which cleared this deal on January 17th  given   that DP World has not withdrawn its previous application     Furthermore  in its request for CFIUS review  the company   explicitly states that it will not waive its rights under CFIUS     previous approval of its merger         The Senators reiterated the need for Congress to act to   block companies owned by foreign governments from   controlling operation at U S  ports        We are concerned that the review CFIUS is about to   undertake is yet another flawed process that can only produce   another flawed result  We intend to continue to push for passage   of legislation to prohibit companies owned by foreign   governments from controlling operations at U S  ports     they   wrote      Menendez and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have   introduced  with Lautenberg and Senators Barbara Boxer and Bill   Nelson  legislation to block companies owned by foreign   governments from controlling operation at U S  ports   That   legislation would stop Dubai Ports World  s acquisition of   operations at six major U S  ports  including the port of New   York and New Jersey      The full text of the letter is below       February 28  2006           The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW  Washington  DC  20500     Dear Mr  President      We are concerned that once the Dubai Ports World  s  DP   World  acquisition of Peninsular   Oriental Steam Navigation    P  closes on March 2  your administration will have no legal   authority to stop the company from assuming control of specific   operations at U S  ports  no matter what the 45 day   investigation being undertaken by the Committee on Foreign   Investment in the United States  CFIUS  finds        DP World has voluntarily agreed to a 45 day investigation   and has said that they will resubmit their application to CFIUS     They have also maintained  however  that this 45 day   investigation will not stop them from closing their acquisition of   P on March 2nd  two days from now  As of March 2nd  DP   World will legally own P  with or without any voluntary   agreements related to US assets       The 45 day review also does not change the previous CFIUS   decision which cleared this deal on January 17th  given that DP   World has not withdrawn its previous application   Furthermore    in its request for CFIUS review  the company explicitly states that   it will not waive its rights under CFIUS   previous approval of its   merger       To better understand the specifics of this new 45 day   agreement  we would appreciate your answers to the following   questions        Given that DP World will legally own P as of March 2nd    what legal authority would you  as president  have to stop DP   World from taking control of the assets they will own in the   United States after the 45 day review    Given that CFIUS already cleared the sale of P to DP   Worlds on January 17th  and that DP World has not withdrawn   that application  what legal authority would you  as president   have to stop them from taking control of the assets    According to their press release  DP World has   voluntarily offered to create a   Hold Separate Commitment        Can you explain exactly how DP World will separate US   operations  Legally  would this entity still be part of DP World   and under control of DP World and the Dubai government  Will   DP World create a subsidiary that is not owned and controlled by   the government of Dubai  Will this be done before March 2nd      What legal authority allows initiation of a 45 day   review after CFIUS has officially cleared a transaction      If  after the 45 day review  CFIUS decides not to   approve the DP World and P merger  what will happen  Will   your administration seek to force DP World to divest their U S    assets     We believe it is critical that Congress have clear answers to   these questions so we can determine what additional legislation   to secure our ports is needed   We are concerned that the review   CFIUS is about to undertake is yet another flawed process that   can only produce another flawed result   We intend to continue   to push for passage of legislation to prohibit companies owned   by foreign governments from controlling operations at U S    ports      We look forward to your answers to these questions and to   working with you to improve this process in the future      Sincerely      ROBERT MENENDEZ  United States Senator     FRANK LAUTENBERG  United States Senator
