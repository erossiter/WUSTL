June 28  2007         WASHINGTON  After a  failed cloture vote to end debate and proceed to a final vote on the immigration  bill  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   who voted in favor of cloture  today  took to the Senate floor to express his disappointment with the bills direction  and eventual collapse    The Senate had a  historic opportunity to move forward today with comprehensive immigration reform  that truly secured our borders  that realized the economic realities of our  time  and allowed people the opportunity to come out of the shadows into the  light and to earn  to earn their legalization in this country  said Menendez   Unfortunately  the Senate decided to maintain the status quo  a status quo of  broken borders  a status quo that does not meet our economic challenges  and a  status quo that permits exploitation and human trafficking to take  place  Bush  Administration  Menendez criticized the Bush administration for its lack of success in getting Senate Republicans behind the comprehensive immigration reform legislation    Ultimately  in my mind   this came down to a President and a party that once again were there for the  photo ops and the press conferences  but werent willing to roll up their  sleeves and do the hard work to improve this bill and help it move forward for  our nation  said Menendez  The same president that used large amounts of  political capital misleading our country into a disastrous war in Iraq  but  little political capital on truly securing our nations security through tough   yet practical comprehensive immigration reform  A president that used political  capital on tax cuts for the wealthiest in our country  but not on truly meeting  our nations economic needs through fair comprehensive immigration reform  And  its either a president that has no political capital or one who just wasnt  willing to use it   Looking to the Future  Despite the bills  failures  Menendez expressed optimism for future  reform   The last phrase of Emma  Lazarus poem emblazed on  the inner wall of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty  says I  lift my lamp beside the golden door  Maybe today that lamp is somewhat dimmer  but it will shine again  The course of history is unalterable  the human spirit  cannot be shackled forever  the drum beat for security  economic vitality  and  most importantly justice will only grow stronger    To those who often  refer to those people in this debate  let me say on behalf of those people  that we have seen the light and we will not be thrust back into the  darkness           The full text of Sen  Menendezs remarks as prepared for  delivery   The Honorable Robert  Menendez Comments on Failure of Cloture Vote  on S  1639 June 28   2007  Mr  President  from my home state of New Jersey and that part  of the state in which I live  we can almost touch Lady Liberty  She is that  close to us from a state park called Liberty State  Park  an area that I have the privilege of uniquely representing  in the House of Representatives for 13 years and an area that I still obviously  represent as the junior Senator from New Jersey  It is an area that I have very  fond memories of because of the power  the power of what it  means   From that same park we can cross a bridge and get to  Ellis Island  a place in which millions came to America  to start a journey  a journey that contributed enormously to its great promise  and enormously to the great country that it is  today   So I come to the floor to discuss the recent cloture  vote on immigration with that context in mind  The Senate had a historic  opportunity to move forward today with comprehensive immigration reform that  truly secured our borders  that realized the economic realities of our time  and  allowed people the opportunity to come out of the shadows into the light and to  earn  to earn their legalization in this country   Unfortunately  the Senate decided to maintain the status  quo  a status quo of broken borders  a status quo that does not meet our  economic challenges  and a status quo that permits exploitation and human  trafficking to take place   As someone who was a part of the early negotiations back  in March of this year on the question of immigration reform  I maintained that  the administration had leaped away from the bipartisan bill of last year that  received 23 Republican and 39 Democratic votes to a much more conservative  a  much more impractical  and a much more partisan proposal this  year   So I was unable to join several of my colleagues in what  has become known as the Grand Bargain that was announced on May  17th   And I want to say I acknowledge and appreciate several  of those who advocated because we were only on the floor on immigration reform   a truly critical issue for this country  as a result of their leadership  My  colleagues such as Senators Kennedy  Salazar  and Graham who truly believe in  that opportunity and at the same time  because of the leadership of the Majority  Leader who is willing to tackle one of the most contentious  issues   It has been contentious throughout the history of our  country and I have talked before on the floor of the Senate about the language  used in those past debates   Ben Franklin referred to no longer being able to accept  those who were coming to our shores in negative terms  He was then talking  about the Germans  The former Governor of Massachusetts in the early 1900s  said that they were sending the most illiterate of their people to our shores   He was talking then about the Irish  In 1925  in  an official report of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce  they said that  Mexicans are suitable for agricultural work due to their crouching and bending  habits         while the white is physically unable to adapt himself to  them  We also had the Chinese exclusionary provisions  So  while this has always been a welcoming country  the debate has not been as  welcoming   On that day when the Grand Bargain was announced  I came  to this esteemed Chamber to express my opposition to the deal that was announced  because I believed that it was deficient in several regards and to say that I  would work to improve it  Looking back on that statement in light of todays  vote  it is strikingly clairvoyant to me  to say the  least   I said on that day that we must come together not as  Democrats and Republicans  or liberals and conservatives  but as statesmen and   in doing so  honor the traditions of the Senate as a body that values reasoning   honest debate  and compromise over sound bites  and talking points  but  especially over the politics of fear   Unfortunately  today the voices that appealed to that  fear and lowest common denominator won out  Only 12 Republican colleagues were  willing to stand up and vote to invoke cloture  almost half of those that voted  for last years bipartisan immigration bill   Only 12 Republican colleagues willing to move forward at  least on the essence of debates  amendments  and to a final vote  About half of  those who voted last year for immigration reform   Personally  I still had serious concerns about the  direction of the bill  but I voted to keep it alive because I wanted to work to  make it better and because I believe in comprehensive immigration reform as  something that is in the national interest and national security of the  United  States  And because I believe Americas promise and security should  not have been snuffed out by a single vote   I stated on that day in May that I could not sign on to  the agreement because it tore families apart  and it says to many that they are  only good enough to work here and give their human capital and sweat  but not  good enough to stay    But instead of responding to earnest concerns from those  of us willing to be supportive of comprehensive immigration reform  the appeal  was constantly made to the right of the spectrum  to those who actually achieved  some of the things they wanted in the bill  but who obviously never intended to  vote for comprehensive immigration reform  Not even to vote for it to move  forward   As it moved to the right  it got less and less support  from the right  Unfortunately  instead of working with those of us that  were willing to not only work to improve this bill  but also put our votes where  our mouths were  they kept giving in to demand after demand from conservative  Republicans  and in turn this bill moved further and further to the  right   In fact  at least two members who were at the press  conference on May 17th and got things included in this bill  voted  against keeping this process moving forward by voting against cloture  today   Ultimately  in my mind  this came down to a President  and a party that once again were there for the photo ops and the press  conferences  but werent willing to roll up their sleeves and do the hard work  to improve this bill and help it move forward for our  nation   A Republican party that was not about progress  but  about partisanship   A Republican party that was not about solving our  nations problems  but seeking political gain by stopping progress of any sort  in this Senate   The same president that used large amounts of political  capital misleading our country into a disastrous war in Iraq  but little  political capital on truly securing our nations security through tough  yet  practical comprehensive immigration reform   A president that used political capital on tax cuts for  the wealthiest in our country  but not on truly meeting our nations economic  needs through fair comprehensive immigration  reform   And its either a president that has no political  capital or one who just wasnt willing to use it   Finally Mr  President  throughout my life and most  recently on the Senate floor  I have heard the phrase those people     Those people   Those who use that phrase are the voices of division and  discrimination  They are the xenophobes that exist today and have existed at  different times in our nations history  but whose voices have ultimately been  overcome to give way to the greatest successful experiment in the history of  mankind  The Unites States of America that we know  today   The last phrase of Emma Lazarus poem  emblazed on the inner wall of the pedestal of the Statue of  Liberty  says I lift my lamp beside the golden door   Maybe today that lamp is somewhat dimmer but it will  shine again  The course of history is unalterable  the human spirit cannot be  shackled forever  the drum beat for security  economic vitality  and most  importantly justice will only grow stronger  To those who often refer to those people in this  debate  let me say on behalf of those people that we have seen the light and  we will not be thrust back into the darkness
