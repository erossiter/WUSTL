proposes education  research grants to increase awareness and treatment of PPD   Friday  June 16  2006      WASHINGTON    U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Richard Durbin  D IL  today announced legislation that aims to eradicate the devastating effects of postpartum depression on American families  The legislation  introduced in the Senate earlier this week  proposes grants to better increase education and access to screenings for new mothers and to increase research into this difficult illness  The bill also proposes grants to health care providers  to facilitate the delivery of healthcare to those suffering from postpartum depression      We must attack postpartum depression on all fronts with education  screening  support  and research so that new moms can feel supported and safe rather than scared and alone     Menendez said     Many new mothers sacrifice anything and everything to provide feelings of security and safety to their innocent  newborn child   It is our duty to provide the same level of security  safety and support to new mothers in need       The MOTHERS Act was introduced in response to a recently passed  first of its kind New Jersey law requiring doctors and nurses to educate and screen expectant mothers about PPD   This state bill was introduced by State Senate President Richard Codey whose wife  Mary Jo Codey  suffered from PPD    A major part of prevention is informing new mothers about the symptoms and providing them with the services that are available in their community   This bill helps mothers by providing important education and screening on postpartum depression that can lead to early identification and treatment   The two grants help health care providers educate  identify and treat PPD    Because the exact cause of PPD isn  t known  research continues to be the key to unlocking the mystery of this condition   This legislation incorporates House legislation  the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act  which would expand and intensify research at the National Institutes of Health with respect to PPD and psychosis  including increased discovery of treatments  diagnostic tools and educational materials for providers      Many women have successfully recovered from postpartum depression with the help of therapy  medication  and support groups     Menendez said    By increasing education and early treatment of postpartum depression  mothers  husbands  and families  will be able to recognize the symptoms of this condition and help new mothers get the treatment they need and deserve

Neonatal Nurses  Family Mental Health Institute  Inc   American College of Nurse Midwives  National Mental Health Association  The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill  Illinois Academy of
