AMENDMENT TO SUPPORT U N  PEACEKEEPING IN DARFUR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Tuesday  May 2  2006      WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  tonight offered an amendment to appropriations legislation currently under consideration by the Senate to provide  60 million to fund a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur   An estimated 200 000 to 400 000 people have been murdered and another 2 million displaced in Darfur   African Union troops in the region lack the financial and logistical resources necessary to control the situation       After the world learned the horrors of the Holocaust  America and the international community vowed   never again       Menendez said     After we saw the gruesome slaughter of approximately 800 000 Tutsis in less than 100 days in Rwanda  we said   never again       Never again   is an empty promise if we do not take action to stop the murder of innocent people when we know it is happening       The amendment would match the funding provided by the House of Representatives   The Senate is expected to vote on it later this week    The full text of Senator Menendez  s statement to the Senate follows   Last Sunday  thousands of Americans gathered here in Washington  DC and in other cities around the country to focus our attention on the horrific acts being committed a world away in Darfur  Sudan     But this wasn  t a gathering of the powerful  although politicians and celebrities were there  This was a gathering of the American community  of high school students  members of synagogues and churches  college students  people of all races  ethnicities  and religions    In fact  the movement to stop genocide in Darfur has been led by some of the youngest in our society   In New Jersey  students in middle schools have raised funds for refugees  Young people at colleges have led the movement to divest from Sudan  These are not the leaders of the future  they are the leaders of today    And I know that as I stand here calling for action  I am not alone   In my home state of New Jersey  high school students started a non profit organization called Help Darfur Now  which raises awareness and funds for the refugees in Sudan   Newark  New Jersey is the headquarters of the Darfur Rehabilitation Project  a national group started by Sudanese people living in the United States that lobbies for humanitarian aid  intervention  and conflict resolution in Sudan   And across the country  Americans are signing petitions  participating in marches  holding town hall events  and contacting their elected officials to demand that the dire needs of the Darfurian people be addressed   As representatives of the people  it is our job to act    Here in the Congress Senators Brownback  Obama  Dewine  Leahy  Levin  Durbin  and Representative Payne  and former Senator  now Governor Corzine  have led the fight for real action to address the genocide in Darfur   And I thank all of them for their hard work   The Situation in Darfur   When we talk about genocide  it is almost impossible for any of us to take the intellectual understanding of genocide  the number of people killed  over what period of time  and for what reason  and comprehend the reality of such atrocities   The truth is that each of the estimated 200 000 to 400 000 people murdered in Darfur was a father  mother  sister  daughter  or son slaughtered by their own countrymen whose ethnic makeup and religion was similar to their own   Each of these people has a family who mourns them  and a community who lost them    Many of us here cannot imagine what life is like for the at least 2 million people who have been displaced in this conflict   Those who have survived are left with the scars of watching their relatives and neighbors murdered  raped  and subjected to other horrors we cannot imagine   And for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled to Chad  the terror continues as they face new attacks in the expanding conflict   Samantha Power  a Pulitzer Prize winning expert on genocide  has pointed out that many women face a   Sofie  s choice     They can either leave their villages and camps to gather firewood facing the likelihood of rape or attack by the Janjaweed or starve inside the camps     It is in this dire context that the World Food Program announced that it will be forced to cut the rations to feed those who are affected by the conflict in Darfur    This means that people already facing a humanitarian crisis will now only receive half of the recommended level of calories per day     Even worse  are reports that at least 200 000 people have been displaced since January and that many of those cannot be reached or helped by aid agencies   A recent article in the New York Times quoted one senior humanitarian aid official    The situation for humanitarian workers and the United Nations has never been as bad as it is now    The space for us to work is just getting smaller and smaller       Not surprisingly  the Sudanese government  who is supporting the groups that conduct this campaign of death and destruction  continues to hinder any attempts by the international community to assess the situation or provide aid to the millions of needy refugees   Just this month  the Sudanese government denied entry into the country to Mr  Jan Egeland  a top United Nations official on humanitarian issues   And last week  Sudan refused to grant visas to officials who intended to conduct a UN military assessment on planning a peacekeeping operation in Darfur    So  in a region the size of Texas  seven thousand African Union troops have been put in place to protect the people of Darfur    While I believe the African Union force is better than nothing  their troop numbers are clearly too small  They are under funded  under equipped  and lack a mandate to protect civilians   I agree with many of the experts who have said that we need to at least triple the size of the African Union force as a bridge until we can get a UN force operational in Darfur   I also think the President  and others  have the right idea of using NATO forces to provide logistical support while letting countries with Muslim populations take the lead on the ground     Of course  we face many obstacles to getting a UN force into Sudan and controlling the situation   First  the Chinese continually stand in the way of UN action   Let  s make it simple  the Chinese buy oil from the Sudanese and they don  t want to stop  In fact  China  because of its rule that it doesn  t involve itself in any way in the domestic affairs of other countries  has no problem buying oil from a government committing genocide in Sudan   Then there is the issue of Osama bin Laden  who has denounced the idea of UN troops  and  in his most recent audiotape broadcast  called on Muslims to fight such a force     In the past  some steps have been taken on the part of the United States and the international community to address the crisis in Darfur    but the violence continues   Congress has appropriated funds for African Union peacekeeping  food aid  and support for refugees   The United Nations Security Council has passed various resolutions raising concerns about war crimes committed in Darfur   The government of Sudan and the two rebel groups involved in are now in negotiations  I know that Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick is there now trying to reach a final agreement with the rebels    Yet  despite all of these measures  the sad truth remains that the people of Darfur face a bleak future of uncertainty  suffering  and possibly death    It is time that we take additional action to stop the genocide in Sudan   Amendment   That is why I  m offering an amendment that would provide  60 million to support UN peacekeeping in Darfur    And I would like to thank the cosponsors of this amendment Senators Leahy  Durbin  Sarbanes  Dodd  Obama  Lautenberg  Wyden  and Stabenow    The African Union troops in Darfur are clearly overwhelmed by the challenge at hand   This amendment would provide critical funding to equip international troops and restore law and order to the region of Darfur   Although the intervention of UN troops has not yet been authorized  this amendment would ensure that when it is accomplished  the money is there and will increase pressure on the African Union  the Khartoum government  and the international community to make sure that a UN force is put in place in Darfur    For those who would question the amount proposed in this amendment  I would like to point out that my amendment adds the same level of funding to the Contributions to International Peacekeeping Account  CIPA  that has already been approved in the House supplemental appropriations bill   There is no other way to get these funds to protect the people of Darfur  They are not in the current funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 2006  I think we can all agree that genocide in Darfur does constitute an emergency  an emergency which this body has a moral obligation to respond to   Genocide   Genocide is not a new phenomenon   We have witnessed this hatred and inhumanity many times over the past century   After the world learned the horrors of the Holocaust  America and the international community vowed   never again      After we saw the gruesome slaughter of approximately 800 000 Tutsis in less than 100 days in Rwanda  we said   never again       Never again  is an empty promise if we do not take action to stop the murder of innocent people when we know it is happening   And once again we find ourselves in a position to make that choice    For even as I stand here today  I know that the number of dead and displaced persons in Darfur continues to grow   Genocide is not Sudan  s problem    it is not Africa  s problem    it is the world  s problem    And by failing to take part in a solution  we have become part of that problem  As Americans    and as human beings    we have a moral obligation to help those who are suffering and who cannot help themselves   Now is not the time to forget that obligation   And history will judge us by the actions that we take or fail to take today   Conclusion   Jan Egeland  one of the top UN humanitarian officials has said that  Africa is the biggest drama of our time  nowhere else in the world are so many lives at stake as in Africa      Now is the time to act     Some people might say that the Fiscal Year 2007 budget proposal allocates sufficient funds to help the people of Sudan   I would say that you cannot put a price on human lives   Genocide is not a horror of the past  it is a reality of the present  It is an emergency we must face today   The  60 million my amendment offers will help put an end to the senseless murder and displacement of the people of Darfur   If it were American lives at stake  I am certain we would find the money to act   Simon Wiesenthal said that    For evil to flourish  it only requires good men to do nothing      Let us act now to put an end to this evil   I hope my colleagues will see that  in the face of genocide  this is money well spent   And I ask that you support this amendment
