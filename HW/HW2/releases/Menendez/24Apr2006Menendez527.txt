                                                                                                                                                                                                 Monday  April 24  2006      JERSEY CITY    U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today introduced sweeping legislation aimed at ending the egregious marketing and business practices of some in the credit card industry and providing safeguards for American consumers  The   Credit Card Bill of Rights    follows numerous studies and personal accounts of families crushed under the weight of credit card debt  which is often times exacerbated by excessive fees  as well as intense marketing to high risk consumers and college aged students      American families are being crushed by credit card debt  and the increasingly predatory behavior of some credit card companies makes no sense beyond increasing the bottom line for the companies     Menendez said     The   Credit Card Bill of Rights   will stop some of the most egregious credit card practices while also ensuring that future generations have the information they need to make financial decisions        American families increasingly face a growing problem of rising credit card debt   In 2004  for example  the average American household had  9 300 in credit card debt  up from  3 200 just 12 years earlier   And for college students  the problem cannot be overstated   According to the Jump tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy  some colleges lose more students to credit card debt than to academic failure       When a family sends their son or daughter off to college  they should only have to worry about their report card  not their credit report     Menendez said    To fuel growth  credit card issuers have increased the number of solicitations sent to consumers 500 percent since 1990 to a record 5 23 billion in 2004  Credit card companies target college aged students for billions of solicitations and also market to   high risk    consumers who already have challenges paying their bills  One study found that Americans pay  90 billion each year in credit card penalty fees and interest payments  money that could be better spent on college tuition  health care  and homeownership    The Menendez   Credit Card Bill of Rights    is comprised of two complementary bills geared toward offering legislative protections to consumers  the Protection of Young Consumers Act and the Credit Card Reform Act    The Protection of Young Consumers Act will protect people  especially college students and other young people  against skyrocketing consumer debt and the barrage of credit card solicitations that lead to it  The proposal will  1  build on the current   opt out    provision regarding pre approved credit card offers by prohibiting credit card solicitations to consumers under 21 unless they proactively   opt in    to receive such solicitations  and 2  establish a financial literacy and education program in elementary and secondary schools to help prepare young people to be financially responsible consumers    The Credit Card Reform Act will also protect consumers against excessive fees and interest rates   It will  1  prohibit   universal defaults    in which a credit card company imposes excessive increases in interest rates for events completely unrelated to the payment history on that account  2  restrict excessive late fees  and 3  tighten regulations on credit card companies to ensure that they are not offering credit to high risk cardholders without verifying their ability to pay    Consumer advocates hailed the Menendez legislation      The National Consumer Law Center  on behalf of our low income clients  supports Senator Menendez  s efforts today to curb some of the most destructive practices by credit card companies     said Alys Cohen  staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center     These bills would put an end to abuses such as universal default  unilateral changes in terms  and unfair imposition of exorbitant late fees  and also would require a card issuer to assess a consumer  s ability to repay the debt  Consumers deserve access to fair credit including credit card terms they can afford        In today s volatile economy  family income has not kept pace with the growing costs of housing  education  and health care     said Tamara Draut  director of the Demos Economic Opportunity Program    Americans are increasingly turning to credit cards as a safety net  and an out of control lending industry has adopted abusive practices to capitalize on this fragile household economy  By addressing these industry tactics  this legislation would be a step towards a more fair and transparent lending environment for America s families
