April 11  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today joined Senator Charles E  Schumer  Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee  JEC   and Senator Sherrod Brown  D OH  for the release of a JEC report analyzing the subprime mortgage foreclosure problem and its economic impact on the most vulnerable communities nationwide  report available here      The report  entitled  Sheltering Neighborhoods from the Subprime Foreclosure Storm   argues that foreclosure prevention is cost effective and presents policy suggestions for curbing future subprime foreclosures   The report highlights seriously affected communities in New Jersey  including Camden  Newark and Edison     Increases in payment delinquencies and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market have raised widespread concerns about the possibility of increasing  concentrated foreclosures throughout the country  While lenders and banks figure out how to insure themselves from the consequences of increased subprime mortgage defaults  local communities are also struggling to stem the tide of foreclosures that impose significant costs on families  neighborhoods and cities    Some of the key findings of the JEC report are       Subprime foreclosures are expected to increase in 2007 and 2008 as 1 8 million hybrid ARMS  many of which were sold to borrowers who can not afford them  reset in a weakening housing market environment        Varying local economies  housing markets and state regulatory regimes mean that some local areas are getting hit by the subprime foreclosure crisis much harder than others and deserve immediate attention        It pays to prevent foreclosures in these high risk cities   every new home foreclosure can cost stakeholders up to  80 000  when adding up the costs to homeowners   lenders  neighbors  and local governments        Policy responses to the subprime crisis should be designed to address the local foreclosure phenomenon and include both foreclosure prevention strategies and improved mortgage lending regulations    Sen  Menendez said   What we are facing is a tsunami of foreclosures  Just a few short years after home ownership levels soared to record highs  the harsh reality brought on by unreasonable mortgages has come crashing down on millions of homeowners  This report digs past the overall story to detail the devastation in America s communities  It is clear that a number of New Jersey communities have been hit hard  as have many others from coast to coast  and I am working in the Banking Committee to solidify the mortgage system  I applaud Chairman Schumer for shedding additional light on this widespread problem    Sen  Schumer said   As subprime mortgage lenders scramble to protect their bottom lines  we need to redouble efforts to protect American families and communities who are at the losing end of this mess   The subprime mortgage meltdown has economic consequences that will ripple through our communities unless we act   Schumer said   It makes good economic sense to make sure our families and neighborhoods are protected from rogue lenders and lax government oversight     No region of the country has been harder hit than the Midwest  And no state has a higher rate of foreclosed properties than Ohio  Almost one in four subprime loans is delinquent in the Cleveland area  and statewide it is one in five  Over the past decade  foreclosures have increased almost fourfold in Ohio  We are facing a full blown housing crisis   said Sen  Brown   The JEC report includes state and local rankings by foreclosures and delinquencies using RealtyTrac s and First American Loan Peformance s data   The report shows that the Midwest  Rust Belt   Ohio  Michigan  Illinois  and Indiana   the South and West  Sun Belt   Florida  Georgia  Texas  California  Arizona and Nevada   and Colorado experienced the highest rates of foreclosures in 2006  The hardest hit metropolitan areas also include cities in the Northeastern corridor in New York  New Jersey and Pennsylvania   The report also analyzes metropolitan areas that are most at risk of rising foreclosures  using February 2007 delinquency data  employment statistics  and housing market indicators      All predictions are that we are facing a tsunami of default and foreclosures in the subprime market as homeowners face steep increases in their monthly payments and housing values remain flat  making refinancing virtually impossible   said Rep  Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Vice Chair of the Joint Economic Committee and Chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions   The specific local crises documented by this study require swift action at both the state and national level   We will be looking closely at the report s recommendations in the Financial Services Committee
