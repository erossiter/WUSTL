permanent preservation of open space a reality  Gunning Island is located in the Shrewsbury River where it flows into Raritan Bay just south of Sandy Hook  Nestled between Monmouth County  New Jersey and Staten Island  New York  Raritan Bay forms one of the outermost sections of the New York New Jersey Harbor ecosystem  The shoreline  wetlands  and uplands of the bays are ecologically important habitats for birds  marine life  and fisheries  There are few remaining parcels of open space in the watersheds draining into Raritan Bay  the most densely populated region in the United States  Gunning Island was a natural sedge island before being supplemented by dredged soil from the Shrewsbury and Navesink rivers  The augmented island has quickly filled in with native flora and fauna  and is rapidly becoming an important stopover point for migratory birds  also acting as permanent habitat to birds and other animals  The adjacent sedge islands also benefit from the conservation of Gunning Island  In addition to the protection of Gunning Island  NJ s congressional delegation is taking the lead in Congress on reauthorizing the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program  CELCP   Sen  Lautenberg is one of the primary sponsors of S  1142  the Coastal and Estuarine Land Protection Act  That bill has moved through committee and is awaiting a Senate floor vote  Similarly  NJ s representatives are the lead sponsors of the House bill  H R  1907  The Trust for Public Land is a national nonprofit land conservation organization that conserves land for people to enjoy as
