successfully included provision to encourage local energy efficiency  discusses interaction between local  national entities on energy reform   Wednesday  June 13  2007       WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  today lent his support to the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007  Menendez praised the bills efforts to increase energy independence  lower gas prices  and combat global warming    A tremendous amount of work has been put into making this a strong energy package that will help us achieve energy self reliance  lower gasoline prices  and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  said Menendez  We are headed into a new cleaner  greener and more affordable energy future  one where we do not seek to treat our addiction to oil by drilling for yet more oil in the Arctic or of the East Coast  This bill represents a bold step towards an economy that is based upon energy efficiency and renewable energy rather than fossil fuels  As we work on this bill on the Senate floor we cannot forget this central value of the bill   Menendez also touted his provision included in the legislation that would create an Energy and Environmental Block Grant program to encourage energy reform on a local level    In order to address our energy challenges we must keep these world wide impacts in mind  but that does not mean we should not act locally to achieve our national goals  said Menendez  To foster this local spirit in our cities to tackle climate change I  along with Senator Sanders  have included a provision in this bill to create an Energy and Environmental Block Grant program  This program will allow cities and counties to get federal grants to make their buildings more efficient  create new renewable energy projects and continue their leadership in reducing U S  carbon emissions          The full text of his speech  as prepared  follow   M  President  I rise today to praise the efforts of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for crafting the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee I know a tremendous amount of work has been put into making this a strong energy package that will help us achieve energy self reliance  lower gasoline prices  and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  Under Democratic Leadership we are headed into a new cleaner  greener and more affordable energy future  One where we do not seek to treat our addiction to oil by drilling for yet more oil in the Arctic or of the East Coast  This bill represents a bold step towards an economy that is based upon energy efficiency and renewable energy rather than fossil fuels  As we work on this bill on the Senate floor we cannot forget this central value of the bill   I do believe  however  that there are a few key amendments that will make this good bill even better  The most important of these is Chairman Bingamans Renewable Portfolio Standard amendment requiring that 15  of the nations electricity be produced from renewable sources by 2020  This forward thinking provision is declaration that our country is ready to be a renewable energy leader    M  President  I often hear in the halls of Congress that energy is a regional issue  If you represent a coal state  you probably support one set of policies  If your state grows corn or drills for oil  you support other policies  I understand the passionate advocacy one must undertake on behalf of ones home state  But energy can no longer be viewed as a parochial issue that only affects local interests  We in the United States Senate have a responsibility to ensure that our local interests do not jeopardize the nations interests as a whole  Nor can we stand in the way of this great nation becoming a global leader on what has become a global issue   For most of the past two centuries  this country has been blessed with an abundant supply of domestic energy bountiful enough to provide us with all the heat and power we needed  But for the last 40 years we have increasingly had to look abroad to secure supplies of oil  This quest to feed our seemingly insatiable appetite for oil has unquestionably shaped our foreign policy  We pay the price for our oil habit when a corrupt regime like Iran feels emboldened to threaten its neighbors with nuclear weapons  and do so with impunity because their access to oil makes it possible for them to buy influence around the globe  As the New York Times columnist Tom Friedman has pointed out  its not a coincidence that when oil was  20 a barrel  both Russia and Iran launched internal reform programs to increase democratic participation  As the price of oil has soared past  70 a barrel  both of those countries have reversed course and used their burgeoning treasuries to stifle dissent and roll back democratic progress   The same story can be told across the world  From the corrupt royal governments and pseudo theocracies of Middle East  to the iron fisted dictators who hold sway in the former Soviet countries in Central Asia  to the petro populism of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela  many of the countries who sit on the largest reserves of oil are the same countries who are now resisting reform and creating global instability  If the story of the 20th century was of a tidal wave of democracy sweeping across the globe  the emerging story of the 21st century is of that wave being swallowed underneath a flood of crude  As long as the tyrants who have the lucky fortune to sit on top of massive oil reserves can prop up their regimes through huge petroleum profits  there will be no reform  Finding alternatives to oil is a key to democratic  economic and social reform in much of the world   In response to this energy security challenge some of my friends and colleagues will undoubtedly advocate federal support for efforts to produce a liquid fuel from coal  They will point out that we have abundant supplies of coal and that we are the Saudi Arabia of coal  This line of thought ignores the threat of global warming  The lifecycle carbon emissions of liquid fuel made from coal is over twice that of gasoline  If we substitute oil for coal  a fuel that releases even more greenhouse gases than oil  we are setting our planet up for disaster  And that would mean we are continuing the same sort of traditional energy thinking designed to benefit our provincial energy interests at the expense of the rest of the nation and the world  Global warming is happening  it is caused by human activities and it is threatening our very existence    Recently the Environment New Jersey Research and Policy Center catalogued the impacts of global warming in my state over the next century  If we do not act quickly and decisively  Cape  May Beach will erode between 160 to 500 feet inland  the Holland Tunnel will be forced to close due to repeated floods  heat related deaths in our cities will rise five fold  and flooding around the Delaware River will cause millions of dollars in property damage   Similar devastating impacts will be seen all over the world  Floods will require the evacuation of millions in India and Bangladesh  East Asia will experience increased water shortages  Central Africa will see ever worsening drought conditions  Warmer ocean surface temperatures will lead to stronger hurricanes and cyclones   In order to address our energy challenges we must keep these world wide impacts in mind  but that does not mean we should not act locally to achieve our national goals  Just this past weekend the Washington Post ran an article with the headline Cities Take Lead On Environment As Debate Drags At Federal Level  The article details the actions mayors have taken to fill the void left by the Presidents lack of leadership on climate change  Hundreds of mayors have created energy efficiency projects  promoted renewable energy  and vowed to meet the greenhouse gas reductions laid out in the Kyoto protocol    To foster this local spirit in our cities to tackle climate change I  along with Senator Sanders  have included a provision in this bill to create an Energy and Environmental Block Grant program  This program will allow cities and counties to get federal grants to make their buildings more efficient  create new renewable energy projects and continue their leadership in reducing U S  carbon emissions   M  President  not only does the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007 lower greenhouse gas emissions and help us achieve energy self reliance  but the bill also promises to reduce prices at the pump  First  the bill creates real competition for oil by increasing the production of renewable biofuels from 8 5 billion gallons per year in 2008 to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022  Second  the bill lowers demand for oil by requiring the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to achieve a nationwide fleet fuel economy average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for passenger cars and light trucks  Third  the bill expands federal research into plug in hybrid technology so that electricity can compete against liquid fuels as a power source for our vehicles  Finally  by cracking down on price gouging  the bill will ensure that oil companies cannot drive up costs without justification  For too long oil companies have been allowed to squeeze motorists for record profits without economic justification  This bill will make oil markets more transparent and institute tougher civil and criminal penalties for market manipulation  Taken together these measures will create more supply  put downward pressure on demand  and create a more competitive marketplace  In turn this will lead to drastically lower prices for all drivers    M  President  I want to thank Chairman Bingaman and ranking member Domenici for crafting a straightforward  beneficial  and bipartisan energy compromise  Each of us comes to the United States Senate as representatives of our respective states  but our responsibilities dont end at our states borders  As national leaders  we also have a responsibility to come together and address issues such as our global energy challenges  When it comes to these issues  whether its national security or global climate change  we must rise above local interests and show national leadership  Then  and only then  will we be able to affect change that benefits consumers  improves our energy security and establishes the United States as a leader in the fight against global warming   M  President  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure    I yield the floor
