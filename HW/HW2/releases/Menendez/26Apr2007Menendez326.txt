appropriations bill on its way to president s desk  also includes provisions for vets health care  SCHIP and chem security   Thursday  April 26  2007      WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today voted in favor of the Supplemental Appropriations bill  which includes a deadline as a goal to withdraw American troops from Iraq by April 1  2008  The bill  which was approved by the House yesterday  gained Senate passage today by a 51 46 vote and is now on its way to the president s desk    Menendez spoke strongly today in favor of bringing American troops home    By passing this bill  we get the wheels turning toward the best possible strategy for success  bringing our troops home and working on a political solution in Iraq   said Menendez   The Bush administration has tried to defame this bill  This isn t about surrender  this is about success     What we have passed is the definition of supporting the troops  At once  we are ensuring they are equipped and prepared to defend themselves  we are moving them out of another country s bloody civil war  and we are providing care that has been lacking for those who return home injured    President Bush has threatened to veto this bill if passed  and today Menendez urged him not to do so    This bill reflects the realities on the ground and the will of the American people   said Menendez   The president can ensure that our troops are prepared to defend themselves and are transitioned out of the civil war in Iraq if he signs the bill  I urge him to listen to the American people and do so    Menendez also lauded other components in the bill  including veterans health care funding  money for a low income children s health care program that he has championed and provisions for chemical security   On veterans health care    The Walter Reed scandal showed the lack of readiness for the tens of thousands of our troops who have returned home with serious  and in many cases permanent  injuries  That is not how a grateful nation should treat its soldiers  This Congress under new leadership has acted quickly to take care of our troops    On SCHIP    I am proud to help lead the effort  to at least temporarily avert a shortfall in health insurance for children who need it the most  This program is especially beneficial to children and families in New Jersey  and will continue to work to solidify it in the long term    On chemical security    If states are willing to get tougher on chemical plant security than the federal government  it makes sense to let them protect their citizens  I certainly do not want to see our strong security laws in New Jersey overtaken by weaker federal ones  I am proud to have worked with my New Jersey colleague  Senator Lautenberg  on this provision  and I applaud him for ensuring that it was included in the final bill    The Supplemental Appropriations bill includes the following measures   Military        100 billion for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan          1 billion increase for equipment for the National Guard and Reserve          1 1 billion to provide housing servicemen and servicewomen          3 billion for the purchase of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles  MRAP  to protect soldiers from deadly roadside bombs         nearly  3 billion to help reform the veteran s system struggling to take care of the returning wounded  and         900 million to research and treat post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries  two of the most critical issues facing wounded soldiers    Low income children s health care       More than  650 million in emergency funding for the SCHIP children s health care program   funding Menendez helped secure that will help 500 000 children in New Jersey s SCHIP program    Security       Permission for states with stronger standards to protect chemical security plants than the federal government to avoid preemption of those standards          2 25 billion in homeland security initiatives  including mass transit security  explosives detection equipment at airports  port security  and other measures included in the 9 11 bill that has passed Senate    Other issues        6 9 billion for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita who are still struggling to rebuild their homes and their lives more than a year after the storms hit  and        Funding for pandemic flu preparations and low income home energy assistance
