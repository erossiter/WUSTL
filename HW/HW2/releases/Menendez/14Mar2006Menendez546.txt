14  2006      WASHINGTON    A bipartisan group of New Jersey   lawmakers today said Garden State residents should be afforded   the same rights as other states in voicing their opposition to   drilling off the Atlantic coast  In a letter to the Minerals   Management Service  U S  Senators Robert Menendez and Frank   R  Lautenberg  as well as  U S  Representatives Frank Pallone Jr     Frank A  LoBiondo  James Saxton and Chris Smith  called on the   federal agency to host hearings in New Jersey  thereby   acknowledging the risk shared by Garden State residents should   off shore drilling begin off Virginia  s coast      The Minerals Management Service recently announced a   five year Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program    which proposed drilling off the coast of Virginia  Such oil   exploration    just 75 miles from the New Jersey shore    could   have perilous effects on Garden State  s tourism  hospitality and   gaming industries  in addition to the overall quality of life  There   are currently public hearings scheduled for several states   including Virginia and Florida  but not New Jersey         The area proposed to be opened off the coast of Virginia is   roughly 75 miles from the New Jersey shore  more than close   enough to put our treasured beaches in danger from an oil   spill     the lawmakers wrote    The people of New Jersey are   extremely concerned about the oil and gas activities proposed   off the coast of Virginia  and we believe that the Minerals   Management Service should offer them the opportunity to   express their concerns in a public hearing           Drilling off of the Atlantic Coast is a bad idea  regardless of   where you do it     Menendez said    New Jerseyans would bear   much of the risk of off shore drilling  so they deserve the   opportunity to speak out about it           New Jerseyans must have a chance to voice their concerns   about the plan to drill for oil just 75 miles off our Shore  An oil   spill doesn  t stop at state lines  and this plan could be a disaster   for our economy and environment     said Lautenberg       The New Jersey shore and our beaches generate billions of   dollars for the state economy and tourism is responsible for 34    of Ocean County s employment   said Smith who for years has   worked to protect the New Jersey coast    An oil spill or other   accident would potentially have a devastating affect upon our   state  our economy and our citizens  lives  Therefore it is vitally   important that the voices of New Jerseyans and residents of   other coastal states be heard         The concerns of South Jersey residents should be heard   when proposals for expanded off shore drilling are being   examined  Our oceans know no boundaries  thus any potential   oil or gas spill would equally threaten the environment and   economy of Southern New Jersey as it would Virginia or   Delaware  I strongly oppose off shore drilling and will continue   to fight to ensure it is not expanded   said LoBiondo  a member   of the Congressional Coastal Caucus       It is absurd that a decision would be made on this   dangerous drilling proposal without input from all the   communities that could possibly be impacted   Pallone said      The opinions of New Jerseyans should not be ignored while the   voices of the oil and gas executives are heard        I represent the Jersey Shore from Seaside Heights to Long   Beach Island and Tuckerton   said Jim Saxton  vice chairman of   the House Fisheries and Oceans Subcommittee   I think off   shore drilling would threaten our coastal and ocean environment   and the tourism based economy it attracts  and probably the   tourism in the entire Mid Atlantic region as well         We expect MMS to give full weight to all comments   received from the State of New Jersey  its citizens  and its   Congressional delegation     the lawmakers said             The Honorable Johnnie Burton  Director  Minerals Management Service  1849 C Street  N W   Washington  D C  20240     Dear Director Burton      We are writing to strongly urge you to hold a public hearing   in New Jersey on the recently released 2007   2012 Proposed 5   year Outer Continental Shelf  OCS  Oil and Gas Leasing Program     Program    The people of New Jersey are extremely concerned   about the oil and gas activities proposed off the coast of   Virginia  and we believe that the Minerals Management Service   should offer them the opportunity to express their concerns in a   public hearing  The implication that New Jersey does not have a   voice in this matter because we do not border Virginia  as   explicitly expressed in the Program  ignores the very real   possibility of damage to New Jersey s coastline from drilling   activities in the proposed area       The area proposed to be opened off the coast of Virginia is   roughly 75 miles from the New Jersey shore  more than close   enough to put our treasured beaches in danger from an oil spill    New Jersey s tourism industry brings in over  22 billion to the   state s economy  and generates over 10  of the state s jobs    Risking that in an attempt to find our next oil or gas fix is   unacceptable to the people of New Jersey  and we believe our   voices should be heard loud and clear on this matter       We were surprised to see that the entire schedule for public   scoping meetings only included one in the Mid Atlantic region    in Norfolk  No meetings were scheduled for New Jersey or any of   the neighboring states  meaning that New Jerseyans wishing to   comment on the proposal would have to drive at least six hours   to have their voices heard  Just this week MMS added an   additional meeting in Florida  and we believe that New Jersey   should be accorded the same courtesy       MMS  decision to split the Atlantic region of the OCS into   state administrative boundaries for the purposes of oil and gas   leasing is also extremely troubling  The ocean has no   boundaries  and an oil spill will would not stop at an   administrative line  All states bordering the Atlantic have reason   to be concerned with any offshore drilling in that region  not just   those immediately adjacent to the proposed leasing region  And   yet  even though New Jersey and Connecticut have expressed   their desire to maintain the oil and gas drilling moratorium in   the Mid Atlantic planning region  the MMS proposal states     However  these two states are no longer adjacent to this   planning area   There are two disturbing implications in that   statement  that the comments of states that don t border the   immediate planning area are to be discounted  and that New   Jersey s comments might have been relevant in the past  but are   no longer because of the way the administrative lines between   states were drawn  Neither of those are acceptable to us in the   least  and we expect MMS to give full weight to all comments   received from the State of New Jersey  its citizens  and its   Congressional delegation   In addition  potential impacts on the   State of New Jersey need to be considered in the development of   the Draft Environmental Impact Statement       We look forward to your prompt reply
