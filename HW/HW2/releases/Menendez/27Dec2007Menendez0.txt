December 27  2007      Washington  DC  New Jersey  New York and Pennsylvanias U S  Senators today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill signed into law by the President Wednesday includes two measures they authored to reduce flight delays and ease congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace  One amendment requires the federal government to provide a plan to Congress to reduce flight delays in the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congested airspace  The other amendment requires the investigative arm of Congress  the Government Accountability Office  to investigate the Administrations Airspace Redesign Plan  as well as the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays  The Senators called for action after record airport delays this summer and amid major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions  Our air transportation system continues to be plagued by chronic delays  excessive noise  and dangerously overcrowded skies but the Administrations response would increase costs  congestion  and frustration for travelers  I am proud that the FAA will now be required to provide a real plan to deal with these problems  said Senator Clinton  Even with the FAA thankfully becoming much more active on this issue recently  we need the type of detailed  well researched information these reports will produce regarding the best ways to cut down the excruciating delays  said Senator Menendez  Until delays have actually been minimized  we cannot stop searching for answers  I will also be eager to see the results of an independent review of the airspace redesign  which promises to turn up the noise level for New Jersey residents but might only have a marginal effect on delays  First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero  Its time we give these heroes the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg  These amendments are an important step toward forcing the administration to take a long  hard look at the chaos in our skies  and to produce real recommendations to ensure that our congested aviation system receives some real relief  said Senator Schumer   Chronic flight delays in this region have serious economic and social consequences  and I am pleased that this provision aimed at addressing congestion has been adopted  Senator Specter said  I look forward to reviewing the Department of Transportations findings and intentions to tackle this problem   I am pleased that this legislation will force the Bush Administration to take a hard look at regional congestion problems  Anyone who has visited the Philadelphia International Airport knows that delays are a fact of life for air travelers  It doesnt need to be this way  and I will continue to support efforts to reduce flight delays in a responsible and reasonable way  said Senator Casey  Details of the FAA Plan amendment Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation  Details of the GAO amendment The measure directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports  Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less  Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport
