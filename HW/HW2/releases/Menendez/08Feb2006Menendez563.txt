Senators Robert Menendez    D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  today released a new   report showing that President Bush  s budget proposal will have a   devastating impact on Garden State families  with cuts that will   slash college financial aid  make neighborhoods less safe  raise   the cost of veterans   health care  and reduce access to health   care        The choices we make in budgets are reflections of our   values     Menendez said    By cutting everything from financial aid   for college students to health care for seniors  the president has   released a budget utterly inconsistent with the values of New   Jerseyans           President Bush  s budget is a bad budget for the people of   New Jersey     said Lautenberg    It is an assault on the needs of   our seniors and our children   The President talks about   compassion and then turns around and proposes huge cuts to   Medicare   The President talks about leaving no child behind    and then cuts education funding by more than  2 billion   The   President  s priorities are very different from those of us who live   in New Jersey         Lautenberg served as the Ranking Member of the Senate   Budget Committee from 1997 to 2000 and oversaw the first   balanced budget in decades  Senator Menendez is currently a   member of the Budget Committee        PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENT   BUSH S FISCAL YEAR 2007 BUDGET ON NEW JERSEY  February 9  2006     Offices of U S  Senator Robert Menendez  U S  Senator   Frank R  Lautenberg  New Jersey     PRESIDENT BUSH S BUDGET   Shortchanging New Jersey and Our Future On Monday  President Bush released his 2007 budget   The   budget is a statement of our national values and national   priorities   When we decide what to fund and what to cut  we are   making the surest statement of what we believe is important    what we believe is right  and what we believe is worth fighting   for      In this budget  the President has chosen to protect wealth   over opportunity  today s wants over tomorrow s needs  and   empty rhetoric over real solutions   The American people and the   people of New Jersey want honest leadership  but this budget   chooses Enron accounting gimmicks      In the State of the Union  the President claimed he was   committed to strengthening our economy and ensuring   opportunity for all Americans  This budget was his chance to put   his money where his mouth is  but instead  the President chose   to shortchange New Jersey s and America s future        The budget eliminates 141 programs for a total of  14 5   billion in cuts  which are largely health and education programs       The budget assumes unspecified draconian spending cuts   of 16  after inflation beyond 2007   The President did the same   thing last year and did not come even close to meeting his   target for these unachievable cuts in 2007   To achieve cuts of   this magnitude  ALL of the following would be required          Eliminate the COPS program  taking 4 800 police   officers off the street in New Jersey           Freeze Pell Grants  reducing aid to more than 115 000   New Jersey students who use the grants to pay for college            Completely eliminate health care for the 552 395   veterans in New Jersey            Cut food stamp payments for 150 000 New Jerseyans by   50        DEFICIT The President s own budget projects record deficits and   debt  a  423 billion deficit in 2006  which would be the largest   deficit in history          President Bush s policies have caused the largest fiscal   reversal in the history of our country   more than  650 billion     from a  236 billion surplus in 2000 to a projected  423 deficit   this year         Extending the President s tax cuts will cost  2 trillion over   the next 10 years not including interest and required fixes to the   alternative minimum tax  every penny with borrowed money       The budget projects a crushing interest burden   Even using   the President s own phony numbers  interest on our national   debt will be  473 billion per year by 2011   That means    1534 02 of every New Jerseyan s taxes will be going just to pay   interest     COMPETITIVENESS  INNOVATION Despite paying lip service to competitiveness  the President   has yet to provide funding for programs that help our   companies gain a competitive edge and continues to cut funding   for programs that encourage technological innovation        President Bush s so called  American Competitiveness   Initiative  is largely just a repackaging of other programs   4 6   billion of the  5 9 billion proposed for next year  or 78   is to   extend the already enacted research and development tax   credit       The budget would cut the Manufacturing Extension   Partnership by 55   a tremendously successful program that   helps manufacturers become competitive  from  108 million to    46 million   This critical program helped 164 small and   medium sized New Jersey manufacturing firms complete 383   projects in 2005  saving and creating more than 700 good    high paying  manufacturing jobs   The government s  1 675   million investment in this program in New Jersey had a  60   million effect in reduced costs and increased sales       In a further blow to competitiveness  the President has   again proposed to eliminate the Advanced Technology Program    ATP   which makes competitive matching grants to businesses   to do high risk  high reward R  New Jersey is the 5th largest   recipient of ATP funds in the nation  earning  110 million since   the inception of the program  ATP has more than paid for itself   over time  providing  18 billion in economic growth on  2 1   billion in investments       Once again  Bush has proposed to completely eliminate the    20 million SBA Microloan Program  which helps struggling   entrepreneurs secure loans to start their own businesses   Last   year  124 New Jersey businesses received  2 5 million of this   creative funding       The budget cuts job training for the sixth year in a row and   cuts Job Corps by  55 million   This could mean devastating cuts   for New Jersey s successful Edison Job Corps  which helps 750   disadvantaged youth gain job skills every year   In all  the Bush   budget provides inadequate funding to help New Jersey s   213 000 unemployed to find new jobs      TAXES This budget continues the administration s precedent of   taking from middle  and lower income families and providing   breaks to those in the nation s highest income brackets   While   calling for  15 billion in domestic discretionary spending cuts    this budget makes extending the tax cuts a priority  at a cost of   over  3 trillion         Making the tax cuts permanent plus required alternative   minimum tax  AMT  reforms will add  3 4 trillion to our national   debt   Of the President s tax cuts  approximately 1 3 will go to   the wealthiest 1  of Americans   Americans with an income of   over  1 million will get a tax cut averaging  136 398  while   those in the bottom 20  of the income distribution  who earn an   average of  10 264  get an average cut of  19       The budget includes only 2 3  of the  864 billion  plus    182 billion in interest  over 10 years it will cost to fix the AMT    which will hit millions of middle class New Jerseyans   Without a   fix  more than half of all taxpayers with incomes of    75 000 100 000 and 80  of all taxpayers with incomes   between  100 000 200 000 will be subject to a higher tax    EDUCATION The President s budget proposes the largest cut to federal   education funding in the 26 year history of the Education   Department   a  2 1 billion  or 3 8   reduction   This comes as   schools are still struggling to meet the requirements of the No   Child Left Behind Act         The Bush budget underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act   by  15 4 billion  leaving New Jersey to face a  233 9 million   shortfall    New Jersey will lose  3 8 million in critical Title I funds    which will leave behind 70 000 New Jersey students who would   be served in a fully funded Title I program   By failing to adequately fund its special education   commitments  the Bush administration leaves 230 000 of New   Jersey s most vulnerable students out in the cold  forcing New   Jersey taxpayers to foot the bill       By underfunding IDEA  Bush s budget leaves New Jersey    192 million short  which will increase New Jersey s property tax   burden and prevent schools from providing the services that   special education students are guaranteed by law  In other   words  the Bush budget undercuts students with special needs in   New Jersey by about  835 65 per disabled student      By shortchanging afterschool programs by  1 5 billion  the   budget leaves behind 2 million students  41 000 in New Jersey    who were promised services under No Child Left Behind        The  32 million cut to 21st Century Community Learning   Centers will mean the 14 centers across New Jersey will be even   more strained for resources       In addition  the budget eliminates 42 education programs   that benefit New Jersey schools  including the Safe and Drug   Free Schools program  which funds drug and violence prevention   activities in our nation s schools  the school dropout prevention   program  civic education  arts in education  and education   technology       HIGHER EDUCATION While the President talks about increasing our nation s   competitiveness  he provides no new initiatives to help ensure   young people attend college and no major funding increases to   ensure they have access to postsecondary education        The Bush budget freezes the maximum Pell Grant at  4 050   for the fifth year in a row  causing the real value to decrease by    563 in the last four years   The average Pell Grant  which used   to cover 80  of the average annual cost of tuition  now covers   less than half the cost of a four year public college         The average Pell Grant award will increase by a meager    18  which will do nothing to help over 115 000 New Jersey Pell   recipients with the rising cost of tuition   New Jersey students   are facing an 8 percent tuition increase and tuition costs that are   nearly  2 700 higher than the national average   As a state  New   Jersey s share of Pell funding will be lower than it was in 2003       The Bush budget again proposes eliminating Perkins loans    which benefit more than 14 000 low income students in New   Jersey and provides loan forgiveness for Perkins borrowers   serving in law enforcement  education  or nursing       New Jersey would lose nearly  27 million in vocational and   tech prep education funds that support innovative career and   technical education programs for high school and community   college students        The budget freezes the number of work study awards    which would still be below the 2004 level   These awards    funded both by institutions and the federal government  give   nearly 15 000 students in New Jersey some financial aid in   return for working a part time job     HOUSING The President s budget shortchanges New Jersey   communities by reducing crucial funding for housing assistance    community development  and revitalization        The administration is calling for a 30  cut to   weatherization assistance  which would cut weatherization   assistance to New Jersey by nearly  1 6 million  meaning up to   600 low income New Jersey families won t get their homes   weatherized  On average  weatherization permanently reduces   heating bills by 20 to 40  for low income families        The budget cuts Community Development Block Grants for   New Jersey by  20 million  leaving New Jersey property   taxpayers to make up the shortfall    Over  1 billion dollars have been pumped back into   revitalizing New Jersey s neighborhoods through the HOPE VI   program   The President has again proposed eliminating this   program  which will deprive communities most in need of the   chance for renewal       The Bush budget slashes the federal lead abetment   program  which helps states eliminate lead based paint in   housing  by 23    New Jersey is estimated to have as many as   two million homes that contain toxic lead  including nine out of   every ten homes in the City of Newark  According to some   estimates  up to 50  of Newark s children may be affected by   lead poisoning   Without federal funding  the costs of lead   abatement   about  15 000 per unit   will be passed on to   states and localities    HEALTH CARE In the State of the Union  the President made reference to   the health care crisis in this country  but his budget fails to   address the access and affordability problems facing New Jersey   families          While cutting Medicaid and Medicare  the budget includes    87 billion in new tax incentives to expand Health Savings   Accounts  HSAs   a solution only for the healthiest and   wealthiest in our society  The budget makes no serious attempt   to expand access to health insurance for the 1 1 million New   Jerseyans without coverage       The President s HSA proposal could actually increase the   numbers of uninsured by destroying what s left of the employer   based insurance market  leaving the sick and less affluent to find   affordable comprehensive coverage on their own in the more   expensive individual market       Medicaid and the State Children s Health Insurance Program   would lose  5 billion over five years and  12 billion over 10   years  cuts that mean 1 million New Jerseyans will get reduced   access to comprehensive  vital health care services  Also  an   estimated 264 129 children in New Jersey   11 5  of all New   Jersey children   are uninsured  Any cuts or caps in federal   funding for Medicaid and the SCHIP would increase this number       Heart disease  stroke and cancer continue to be the leading   causes of death in New Jersey  yet National Institutes of Health   funding dedicated to the research and training for these   diseases have been cut   Our state has the 9th highest incidence   of cancer in the nation   it has been estimated that over 43 000   new cancer cases were diagnosed  and over 18 000 New   Jerseyans lost their lives to cancer in 2005     NUTRITION   The budget cuts  2 8 billion from the Food Stamp program   next year  and would deny coverage to anyone not already   receiving welfare payments or Social Security SSI  which would   affect 250 000 people   Cuts are the last thing New Jersey   recipients need   of the 300 000 families that are eligible for   food stamps  only 150 000 actually receive them       SENIORS The President s budget hits New Jersey seniors from all   directions   The President returns to the same failed proposals   we ve seen in the past   privatizing Social Security and cutting    36 billion from Medicare  On top of that  he cuts critical   housing  nutrition and health care programs for the elderly         The President proposes to raid every penny of the Social   Security surplus for the next five years in order to give tax   breaks to the special interests and the wealthy       The President has again recklessly proposed spending    712 billion to privatize Social Security  which would add  5   trillion to the national debt over the first 20 years  risk Social   Security benefits in the stock market  and result in benefit cuts   of 30  or more for the future New Jerseyans who receive Social   Security benefits       The President plans to cut housing assistance for seniors   by 26  and for people with disabilities by 50          The budget eliminates funding for Alzheimer s disease   demonstration grants and preventive health services for seniors    and cuts funding for the National Family Caregiver Support   Program and Meals on Wheels  This is bad news for New Jerseys   1 million seniors and their caregivers        The President proposes to cut Medicare spending by  36   billion over 5 years  which would cost New Jersey  1 billion  and   negatively impact over 1 million New Jerseyans  Spared from the   budget axe are current subsidies to insurance companies        The proposed Medicare cuts would result in             Cuts to hospital reimbursement rates from 3 4  to   slightly below 3   estimated cuts of  20 billion over five years             Increased monthly premiums for higher income   beneficiaries under Medicare Part B  currently  Medicare charges    88 50 a month for this coverage   which covers physician and   outpatient care   The income requirements set to be   implemented under current law would not be linked to inflation    so while only about 3  to 6  of Medicare beneficiaries would   pay higher premiums in the near term  many more would be   affected in the future             A freeze in payments to nursing homes and home   health agencies  as well as lower payments for the use of oxygen   equipment     TRANSPORTATION Again  the President has shown his lack of support for   Amtrak  cutting funding by  400 million   In addition  he has   targeted airline passengers with another tax on the price of a   plane ticket        The President wants to slash Amtrak s budget by  400   million  or 30   The President s proposal of  900 million is just   half the  1 8 billion Amtrak needs  and would result in an   Amtrak shutdown stranding over 80 000 New Jersey commuters   who depend on the Northeast Corridor to get to work every day        The President has proposed raising the per flight airline   security fee by  2 50 for a per flight total of  5   This is a new   tax on the 30 million passengers who fly in and out of Newark   Airport each year     SECURITY The administration s statement that this budget focuses on   homeland security is bogus when you look at the real numbers   that impact security for New Jerseyans at home        Defying the will of over 70 Senators  the budget proposes   cutting the Army Guard and Army Reserve personnel strength     After losing 20  of its strength last year  the New Jersey National   Guard could now lose an entire battalion   The New Jersey Army   National Guard is an effective  cost efficient military force that   has proven itself abroad in the War on Terrorism  and at home in   a number of domestic and homeland security emergencies         The President cuts funding for construction at New Jersey s   military bases by  77 million  leaving only  35 5 million for   2007       While the budget takes a step closer to dividing homeland   security funding more fairly  it still falls short of the goal of   allocating all homeland security funding based solely on risk and   threat  as the 9 11 Commission recommended         After a  250 million cut last year  the President s budget   again cuts Homeland Security grants to states  high threat urban   areas  and first responders   The President calls for a cut of  395   million to our nation s first responders   Even worse  President   Bush proposes to eliminate grants for the Law Enforcement   Terrorism Prevention program       New Jersey has already seen its share of homeland security   funds decrease in the past two years    In 2005  New Jersey   received  60 8 million from the Homeland Security Grant   program  a decrease from the  90 million in 2004   New Jersey s   cities have suffered as a result  with Newark getting a 17  cut   and Jersey City seeing a 61  cut last year       The President s budget also cuts the Assistance to   Firefighters Grant Program from  655 million to  294 million    once again hurting our first responders  our most important first   line of defense in a terrorist attack or natural disaster        The budget cuts the COPS program by an astounding 79     a  376 million cut from last year   Included in these cuts is  140   million Congress provided last year for critical law enforcement   technologies and interoperable communications  The COPS   program has kept New Jersey safe by putting 4 800 more   policemen on the streets      MILITARY This administration claims that their top priority is fighting   the war on terror and in Iraq  However  they ve shortchanged   security  don t account for the cost of the war in Iraq  and   abandon our nation s veterans returning from combat by making   them pay more of their health care costs        The President has again proposed nickel and diming   veterans with new fees on their healthcare   His budget calls for   a new  250 enrollment fee and nearly doubling drug co pays   from  8 to  15 for some veterans based on their income and   disability levels   These proposals adversely affect many of the   more than 550 000 veterans in New Jersey        The proposal also imposes new costs on TRICARE   beneficiaries  although it does not specify what these costs are     Early indications pointed to as much as a tripling of enrollment   fees and co pays for the nearly 100 000 New Jersey military men   and women and their families eligible for TRICARE       The President pays lip service to supporting our troops  but   refuses to budget for the  387 billion CBO says will be   necessary to continue to fight the war in Iraq    ENVIRONMENT The Bush administration has shown that it is actively hostile   to preserving our environment  which cuts funding for the EPA    continues to shift the cost of environmental cleanup from   polluters to taxpayers  and cuts funding for conservation and   clean water        For the third year in a row the Bush administration   proposes to cut funding for the Environmental Protection   Agency   This year the proposal is to cut more than  300 million   dollars  giving EPA its lowest level of funding since 1999        The administration has again refused to propose   reinstatement of the  polluter pays  tax on chemical and oil   companies to pay for cleanup of the nation s worst hazardous   waste sites   Because the tax has not been reinstated  taxpayers   pay a larger share for cleanups   New Jersey has the most   Superfund sites in the country  but the administration proposes   to cleanup only 40 sites nationwide this year  half the number of   sites that were cleaned up each year in the late 1990 s        The President s budget shortchanges conservation efforts   for the Highlands Region  requesting only  2 million  Congress   overwhelmingly supported providing  10 million per year for   land conservation in this ecologically sensitive region       Once again  the President is trying to slash the Land and   Water Conservation Fund  which provides money for   conservation activities throughout the State  The budget   proposes a 25  cut in federal funding and the complete   elimination of the state grant program  which allows New Jersey   to leverage federal funds for conservation purposes  Since 2001    the President has cut funding for the LWCF by nearly 80     slashing the New Jersey conservation budget by millions of   dollars        The Administration s budget will slash the Clean Water   State Revolving Fund by nearly  200 million  For New Jersey  this   means a cut of  8 million  The CWSRF is used to provide loans to   communities to make upgrades to their water infrastructure     These funds are critical to ensure that the waters used for   drinking  swimming and other recreation are free of untreated   sewage and other contaminants
