SEASON BEGINS  SEN  MENENDEZ CALLS ON FAA TO SCHEDULE MEETING ON DELAYS AT NEWARK AND ADDRESS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ISSUE

originally wrote FAA in August urging new approaches to dealing with flight delays   Tuesday  November 20  2007      WASHINGTON  As the holiday travel season beings and travelers brace for extensive flight delays  U S  Senator Bob Menendez  D NJ  is again urging the Federal Aviation Administration and U S  Department of Transportation to consider strong actions to ease delays and to adopt a regional approach to dealing with congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace  Click here for letter or see text below  Menendez senate gov pdf 112007lettertoFAAandUSDT pdf   Sen  Menendez  who first wrote the FAA in August to urge the exploration of flight caps and other innovative ideas  said he is encouraged by the FAAs recent willingness to propose partial solutions  but remains concerned that Newark Liberty International Airport has not received specific attention and that the FAA has done little to retain experienced air traffic controllers    Air travelers want to spend the holidays sitting around the dining room table with their loved ones  not sitting on the floor in the airport  said Sen  Menendez  Its somewhat encouraging that the FAA has finally shown some initiative in dealing with the endless delays  but a few so called express lanes arent a cure all  I want to make sure the FAA isnt going to rest on its laurels  and I want to make sure that they will take a regional approach to dealing with congestion in our area    Text of letter to FAA   November 20  2007 The Honorable Robert A  Sturgell   Deputy and Acting Administrator  800 Independence Ave  SW   Washington  DC 20591   The Honorable Mary E  Peters   Secretary   U S  Department of Transportation   Federal Aviation Administration   1200 New Jersey Ave  SE   Washington  DC 20590   Dear Secretary Peters and Administrator Sturgell  I am writing to follow up on a letter I sent to you on August 21st concerning flight delays in the New Jersey New York area  Thus far I have not heard a response to this letter and while I am encouraged by some of your recent actions taken to address flight delays  I think your efforts still fall short of the mark  If delays are not improved this holiday season  then I think that should serve notice that you must act quickly and boldly to prevent even worse delays next summer    I have attached a copy of my August letter  but in summary I called on both the Department of Transportation  DOT  and the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to examine whether temporary limits on operations  otherwise known as caps  should be placed on all of the regions airports  to immediately convene a schedule reduction meeting with all relevant operators in the region  and to reexamine whether other strategies should be employed such as giving priority to larger planes    While I am encouraged that action has taken place at JFK Airport  I have noticed a complete lack of action at Newark Liberty International Airport  For instance  flight reduction meetings have already taken place at JFK  but despite an anticipated announcement  nothing has taken place yet at Newark  Further it is rumored that caps on flights are inevitable at JFK  but are not being considered in Newark  Such a piecemeal approach will never solve what is a regional issue and action at JFK only could very well make delays at Newark even worse    I would also like to raise another issue that I feel is directly related to flight delays and that is the FAAs management of its air traffic controllers  For too long the FAA has failed to treat its air traffic controllers with respect and has failed to negotiate a fair contract  This has led to a mass exodus of experienced controllers who can handle increased flight traffic  In FY07  856 air traffic controllers retired  In their place over 600 air traffic positions have been filled by new employees with no experience  In fact  this holiday season  there are 7 5 percent fewer veteran  fully trained controllers on the job nationwide than in 2006  handing 4 percent more traffic  This scenario will undoubtedly lead to disastrous delays this week and next summer    The DOT and the FAA must use all reasonable means to reduce flight delays  The industry  its workers  and  most importantly  the traveling public are depending on you to address this serious problem  I thank you for your attention to this matter  and I ask for a prompt response to this letter and to my letter sent to you in August    Sincerely  ROBERT MENENDEZ United States Senator
