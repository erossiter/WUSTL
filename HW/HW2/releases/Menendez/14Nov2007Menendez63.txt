November 14  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today continued his series of floor speeches aimed at highlighting what Iraq War spending could provide in domestic priorities  Today  on the heels of Veterans Day and President Bushs criticism of Democratic funding priorities  Sen  Menendez focused on what Iraq War spending could be providing in terms of care for our veterans  What Iraq war spending could do for veterans care here at home   4 months of Iraq War spending would cover the entire Veterans Health Administration budget  as included in the pending appropriations bill   37 billion   Two weeks of Iraq War spending would cover the cost of the new G I  bill for veterans education  as proposed by Senator Jim Webb  D VA   5 4 billion   16 hours of Iraq War spending would cover the cost of the portion of the Homes for Heroes Act that would help community and non profit organizations offer housing to low income veterans   225 million  Democrats wanted to send the bill increasing veterans funding to the President before Veterans Day  But President Bush is trying to use veterans funding as an excuse to veto other programs America depends on  said Sen  Menendez The President has also said that funding a new GI Bill for veterans education is too expensive  Never have calls for fiscal responsibility been so morally irresponsible  Sen  Menendez plans to deliver speeches in this series periodically  particularly when a domestic policy priority is being considered on the Senate floor  Below is the text of his remarks from today  as prepared for delivery  THE IRAQ WAR  What Its Costing Us Here at Home Part IV  Iraq VS  Veterans funding   M  President    Three weeks ago I began a series of speeches on the price America is paying for the failed War in Iraq  The number of American servicemen and women killed in action has risen to 3 855and with every death of a husband or a wife  a son or a daughter  a mom or a dad  the suffering of a family soars to that place where numbers dont matter  to that place where pain is beyond infinite     Ive spoken about what the war has cost us financially  Since the war began more than four long years ago  we have spent over  455 billion  Over the long run  it will cost almost  2 trillion  Again  those arent just numbers  Those were cargo scanners that could have been installed in our ports  safer bridges that could have been built  life saving cancer research that could have been donea world of possibilities that passed us all by    Ive tried to help us all imagine what were giving up by failing to wake ourselves up from the living nightmare that is the War in Iraq    Today Id like to talk about the people who have given so much up  people who will be paying for this war for the rest of their lives  our veterans and their families  On Sunday we celebrated Veterans Day  Id like to talk about how much we could do for those who served with the amount of money we used to send them into harms way     28 451 troops have come back from Iraq with horrible wounds  Some wounds are physical  Some have had their legs or arms blown off by bombs  some are blind from shrapnel in their eyes  And some wounds are mental    Denying that war can wound a brain along with the rest of the body is denying so many veterans nightmares  flashbacks  shock  or changes in personality so radical that loved ones no longer recognize the person they once knew    Today Army researchers are releasing a study showing that the full psychological impact of the war tends to hit soldiers even harder 6 months after they return from the war  So the ranks of the suffering are about to grow by many thousands    Beyond the human costs of these injuries  the financial costs to our society are tremendous  A report released by Physicians for Social Responsibility puts the cost of medical care and disability benefits for veterans returning from Iraq at over  660 billion  So in a very direct sense  the war has been more than twice as financially expensive as we might think just looking at the combat costs     The human and financial costs dont end with just health care  Heres a shocking statistic  veterans make up 1 in 4 homeless people in this countrythat means almost 200 000 vets dont have a home to go back to tonight  Experts say rates of homelessness are spiraling up faster than they did after the war in Vietnam    M  President  this is a moral outrage  These people put their lives on the line for our country  no questions asked  It is shameful that our men and women in uniform would be sent to patrol the streets of Baghdad  only to have to come back and sleep on the streets of their home towns    Thats why Democrats in Congress are working to give Veterans the support they deserve  The Senate has just passed a bill that contains the largest increase in funding for our veterans in history  Were reinvigorating our Veterans Affairs department with a record  87 billion  which is several billion dollars more than President Bush said he was willing to give   37 billion is for veterans health care  Billions of dollars are headed to expand medical services  and beef up the administrative side so vets spend less time waiting to get their benefits     Compare this to the costs of combat  We could pay for the entire Veterans Health Administration budget  all  37 billion of it  with what we spend in less than 4 months of combat in Iraq  Just as important as making sure vets have excellent health care is making sure they have the opportunity to get an excellent education  Im proud to be a cosponsor of a bill offered by Sen  Webb  that would be the biggest boost to veterans education since World War II  Preparing thousands of veterans to enter the civilian workforce through a first rate education would cost  5 4 billion next year  In other words  it would cost what it takes to fund combat in Iraq for roughly 2 weeks    Democrats in Congress are also working to end the pandemic of homelessness  I joined with Sen  Obama to support a bill called Homes for Heroes    The bill would establish permanent housing and services for low income veterans and their families    It would make more rental assistance available  assist providers of veterans housing and services  and focus more attention on vets who are homeless  Of course  the more soldiers who go off to war  the more necessary this bill becomes    The portion of the bill that helps community and nonprofit organizations offer housing to low income veterans would require  225 million to fund  Compare that to the costs of combat    We grind up enough money to house thousands of veterans in 16 hours in Iraqnot even a day  Of course the price we pay in dollars can never compare to the price our wounded warriors and their families pay  in lost limbs  in haunted dreams  in lives changed forever  Thats a price that not one more soldier should be asked to pay for a pointless war    In the meantime  we need to act fast to get returning vets the help they need  Veterans got their wounds following their governments orders  Those wounds can only heal if the government re orders its priorities    Democrats wanted to send the bill increasing veterans funding to the President before Veterans Day  But President Bush is trying to use veterans funding as an excuse to veto other programs America depends on  The President has also said that funding a new GI Bill for veterans education is too expensive    Never have calls for fiscal responsibility been so morally irresponsible  First and foremost  we can never forget that the price tag for veterans services wouldnt be so high if this administration didnt recklessly send them into harms way to begin with    The President seems to think we cant afford to spend on both veterans health and childrens health  He seems to think we cant afford to treat the wounds our soldiers suffer and fund cancer research to save civilians from that brutal killer  He seems to think we cant afford to ensure the safety of our returning soldiers and make sure all Americans find safety in the workplace  But he did seem to think we could afford to chase Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan  as we should have  and invade Iraqeven though both situations are now serious challenges    He did seem to think we could fight a 2 trillion dollar war in Iraq and give a massive tax cut to millionaires and billionaireseven though the economy hovers near recession and most American families are no better off than at the beginning of his administration     He did seem to think he could sign every bill the Republican controlled Congress sent him  running up debt to the tune of  3 trillion  borrowing money from foreign countries to pay for a war that makes no sense  ignoring pressing national priorities  underfunding care for veterans  leaving our ports vulnerable  leaving our educational system in peril  leaving the massive crisis of climate change completely ignored  leaving children without health care  leaving 47 million Americans with no health insurance whatsoever  and he thought he could get away with it    Now is the time for us to stand up and say  sometimes you cant have it both ways  But when it comes to childrens health  education  homeland security  and veterans care wed better be getting all the support we need    M  President  on Sunday  our nation devoted a day to those who devoted themselves to the nation through military service    We took that day to celebrate how lucky we are  how unbelievably blessed we are that such brave men and women rise up again and again to offer their service when they hear the call  I hope we took that day to offer not just words  but deeds of thanks  We took that day to remember the duty we have to them  because of the devotion they showed to us    Veterans Day is about a fundamental principle  When soldiers ship off to war  if we can look them in the eye and tell them theres a good reason were waving goodbye  wed better be able to look them in the eye when they come back and tell them we mean it when we say theyre welcome home    To the 171 000 troops still in Iraq  Americas message on Sunday was  we look forward to the soonest possible year when we can celebrate Veterans Day here with all of you    M  President  I yield the floor
