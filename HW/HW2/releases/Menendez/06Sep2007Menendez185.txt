September 6  2007      WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ   today applauded the Senate for accepting an amendment he joined Sen  Mel Martinez  R FL  in offering that will appropriate  45 7 million for the pro democracy movement in Cuba  The president had requested the full  45 7 million for Cuba democracy assistance programs in his budget and the House of Representatives had approved the full level of funding  but only  15 million was included in the Senate version of the State Foreign Operations Appropriations bill  Todays successful amendment adds the remaining  30 7 million to the funding     Right now  were faced with a moment of hope for the Cuban people  said Menendez on the Senate floor  Right now we face a potential tipping point for the Cuban opposition leaders and dissidents who risked their lives and well being  their security and freedom every day to speak out for democracy  So right now  we have to seize this moment of hope and increase our support for democracies inside of Cuba  If we look at the history of democracies around the world  we have learned that at just such moments  internal democratic movements need external support     The full text of Menendezs speech on the Senate floor is available below    14 12 47 NSP   MR      NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     MR  MENENDEZ  THANK YOU  MR  PRESIDENT  MR  PRESIDENT  I RISE TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE

HIM AT THE TIME    BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO JOIN HIM IN PROMOTING THIS AMENDMENT ON CUBAN DEMOCRACY  MR   14 13 52   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     CHAIRMAN    MR  PRESIDENT  THIS AMENDMENT IS SIMPLE AND FOR A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL PURPOSE  TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY INSIDE OF CUBA  NOW  I BELIEVE THAT NO MATTER WHERE WE AS MEMBERS OF THE SENATE STAND ON THE ISSUE OF U S  POLICY TOWARDS CUBA    AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DIVERGING VIEWS    EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY  HOWEVER  I WOULD SUSPECT SUPPORTS ACHIEVING DEMOCRACY IN CUBA AND  THEREFORE  SHOULD SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT  RIGHT NOW  WE RE AT A CRITICAL TIME FOR  14 14 26   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     DEMOCRACY IN CUBA  SOME WOULD ASK  WELL  WHY NOW  WHY SHOULD WE INCREASE THE

SUFFERED UNDER THE ONLY DICTATORSHIP IN THE  14 15 01   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     ENTIRE HEMISPHERE  A DICTATORSHIP OF 48       NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE SENATE PROCEEDINGS    THE RIGHT ARE NONETHELESS DICTATORSHIPS  THEY ARE AN OPPRESSION OF PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD BE AGAINST SUCH OPPRESSION  SOMETIMES I HEAR FROM SOME THE ROMANTICISM OF WHO FIDEL CASTRO IS  THEY FORGET THAT HE IS ABOVE ALL A DICTATOR AND THAT HE OPPRESSES HIS PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS  AND THAT EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF  14 15 35   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     WHAT WAS THE FORMER SOVIET UNION GIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE CASTRO REGIME  THAT WHAT DID HE DO  HE STILL RATIONED CUBAN FAMILIES  HAVING TO WAIT IN LONG LINES  AS THEY DO TODAY BECAUSE OF A REGIME THAT SEEKS TO PUT ITS MONEY IN SECURITY FORCES TO OPPRESS ITS PEOPLE INSTEAD OF FEEDING ITS OWN PEOPLE  WE SHOULD BE AGAINST SUCH REPRESSION  RIGHT NOW  WE RE FACED WITH A MOMENT OF HOPE FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE WITH FIDEL CASTRO AILING  RIGHT NOW WE FACE A POTENTIAL  14 16 07   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     TIPPING POINT FOR THE CUBAN OPPOSITION LEADERS AND DISSIDENTS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES AND WELL BEING AND THEIR SECURITY AND THEIR FREEDOM EVERY DAY TO SPEAK OUT FOR DEMOCRACY  SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT OF HOPE AND INCREASE OUR SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRAC INSIDE OF    DEMOCRACIES INSIDE OF CUBA  IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD  WE HAVE LEARNED THAT AT JUST SUCH MOMENTS THAT INTERNAL  14 16 42   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS NEED EXTERNAL SUPPORT  LOOK AT THE SIMILAR MOVEMENTS IN EASTERN EUROPE  LOOK AT POLAND S SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT  LOOK AT THE FORMER CZECHOSLOVAKIA MOVEMENT  IN EACH CASE  THESE INTERNAL MOVEMENTS WERE ALSO SUPPORTED FROM THE OUTSIDE  WE MUST REMEMBER OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE HEAR THOSE WHO FORMERLY LANGUISHED UNDER COMMUNIST RULE  WHEN WE HEAR PEOPLE LIKE THE FAMOUS POLISH HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND FORMER  14 17 18   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     PRESIDENT OF POLAND  LEK WALENSA SAY YOUR DETERMINATION AND YOUR CIVILIZATION BLOOMED WITH THE HOPE OF POLS  AND THAT IS WHY IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE INCREASE OUR FUNDS TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY IN CUBA RIGHT NOW  A FEW WEEKS AGO I PARTICIPATED IN A VIDEOCONFERENCE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT WITH CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS  POLITICAL DISSIDENTS  INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS WHO  14 17 56   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     TOOK GREAT RISKS  GREAT RISKS TO TRAVEL TO THE U S  INTRASECTION IN HAVANA FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF CUBA TO SPEAK TO A GROUP OF DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS  OF WHICH I WAS ONE  WE HEARD ONE CLEAR MESSAGE  THAT THEY ARE FACING INCREASED PRESSURE  THINK ABOUT IT ALREADY  UNDER A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP  THAT EVEN UNDER THAT OPPRESSION  THEY ARE FACING INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE REGIME AND THAT U S  FUNDS ARE CRITICAL TO THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST  14 18 27   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     REPRESSION  I WOULD ADD THAT THE DISSIDENTS AND OPPOSITION LEADERS WERE UNITED  WERE UNITED  THERE WAS WELL OVER A DOZEN OF THEM IN THIS VIDEOCONFERENCE AT THE U S  INTRASECTION AND THEY WERE UNITED ON THIS POINT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE SOMETIMES DIVIDED ON OTHER ISSUES  ON THIS POINT OF RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO NURTURE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHANGE TO TAKE PLACE  THEY WERE UNITED  IN FACT  I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THESE SAME  14 19 05   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     LEADERS WHICH SAID THEIR NEEDS WERE  QUOTE  AMONG OTHER  MEDICINE TO KEEP A POLITICAL PRISONER OR DISSIDENT FROM DYING TO FOOD  WATER FILTERS  MEDICAL EQUIPMENT  CLOTHING  SHOES  COATS  TOYS FOR THE CHILDREN OF POLITICAL PRISONERS WHO SUFFER  THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE WHO IS IN PRISON  AND SOCIAL REPRESSION  SOCIAL REPRESSION ON THE STREETS AND IN SCHOOLS  ESSENTIAL VITAMINS  OFFICE SUPPLIES  AND THE TOOLS OF DEMOCRACY  THE TOOLS OF COMMUNICATIONS  COMPUTERS  PR PRINTERS   14 19 37   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     PHONES  FAX MACHINES  BECAUSE IN A CLOSED SOCIETY  MR  PRESIDENT  IN WHICH ONLY THE DICTATORSHIP OWNS THE AIRWAVES  WHETHER IT BE THAT OF RADIO OR THAT OF TELEVISION OR THE STATE NEWSPAPER  WHEN YOU CANNOT EXPRESS YOUR GOD GIVEN RIGHT AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW AND TO SPEAK OUT AND YOU HAVE NO FORM OF EXPRESSING THAT VIEW TO THOSE OF YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN  TO HAVE THEM SEEK TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION  WHAT WE DO BY PROVIDING COMPUTERS AND PRINTERS AND PHONES AND  14 20 13   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     FAX MACHINES ARE THE VERY ESSENCE OF WHAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED HERE AT HOME  BUT FOR THEM ARE THE VERY SEEDS  THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY  THIS LETTER WAS SIGNED BY A DIVERSE GROUP OF CUBAN DISSIDENTS INCLUDING JULIO GONZALEZ  JUAN GONZALEZ FABLES  LAURA PANTELO  MR  DELGADO  GUILLERMO  14 20 48   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     FERNANDEZ  AND EL ELISARDO SANCHEZ SANTA CRUZ  THIS IS A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS  POLITICAL DISSIDENTS  AND JOURNALISTS  THEY DON T ALL AGREE  JUST AS WE DON T ALWAYS ALL AGREE HERE  THEY AGREE ON THEY ALL SEEK TO HAVE DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS  THEY MAY HAVE COME AT IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS  BUT THEY ALL AGREE THAT THEY NEED THE HELP FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS  THIS IS WHY THIS AMENDMENT INCREASING THE FUNDING IN THE BILL TO  47 5 MILLION IS IMPORTANT  THIS IS THE SAME LEVEL OF  14 21 21   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     FUNDING THAT THE PRESIDENT REQUESTED  THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE HOUSE VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE  LET ME BE CLEAR  WE ARE ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN THESE FUNDS  WE RE ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN THESE FUNDS BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY THE MOMENT TO INCREASE FUNDS FOR CUBAN DEMOCRACY  WE DO PROVIDE AN OFFSET FOR THESE FUNDS SO WE RE NOT INCREASING THE OVERALL TOTAL OF THE BILL  AND THE OFFSET IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE HOUSE PASSED VERSION OF THIS BILL  AND IT S FROM THE LARGEST  14 21 56   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     POT OF MONEY IN THE ENTIRE BILL FOR GENERAL EXPENSES  FOR EXPENSES FOR GENERAL ADMINISTRATION  I D ALSO LIKE TO REMIND MY FRIENDS THAT THESE PROGRAMS THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT FOR DEMOCRACY INSIDE OF CUBA HELPING THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS  POLITICAL DISSIDENTS  OUT BY ORGANIZATIONS WELL KNOWN TO MY SENATE CLEAGS COLLEAGUES  THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DE DEMOCRACY  FREEDOM HOUSE  OUR CUBAN DEMOCRACY PROGRAM ALSO WORKS WITH WELL KNOWN  14 22 33   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS FRANCE S REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS  THE NETHERLANDS POX CHRISTY AND THE CZECHS IN NEED FOUNDATION  I THINK WE WOULD ALL APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT THE TYPE OF ORGANIZATION IT CARRIES OUT  U S  FUNDS ADVOCATE HELPING HUMAN RIGHTS  INCLUDING HELPING WIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS ADVOCATING FOR RELEASE OF PRISON AND DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS IN JAIL  U S  FUNDS SUPPORT PRO U S  ACTIVISTS  GUARANTEES TRAINING ON DISSIDENTS ON LEADERSHIP  CIVIL SOCIETY  14 23 04   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     ACTIVITIES  FACILITATING COORDINATION AMONG ACTIVISTS AND MAKING SMALL INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPING GRANTS TO STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY OF DEMOCRACY GROUPS  AND U S  FUNDS GIVE CUBANS A VOICE IN HELP DISSEMINATE ACTIVIST WRITING AND WORK OF INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS  AND THE WORK THEY DO IS POWERFUL AND MEANINGFUL  BETWEEN 2004 AND 2005  THERE WAS A 54  INCREASE IN CIVIL RESISTANCE ACTIONS WITH INSIDE OF CUBA  89   14 23 42   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     OF WHICH OCCURRED OUTSIDE OF HAVANA IN CUBA S PROVINCES  A 2005 STUDY BY THE CUBAN DEMOCRATIC DIRECTORATE FOUND THAT ACTIONS OF CIVIL RESISTANCE HAVE INCREASED FROM 444 IN THE YEAR 2000 TO 3 322 IN THE YEAR 2005  IT IS A POSITIVE TREND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO CREATE CIVIL SOCIETY AND PEACEFUL CHANGE INSIDE OF THEIR COUNTRY TOWARDS THAT WHICH WE PROMOTE AROUND THE WORLD  HUMAN RIGHTS  DEMOCRACY  AND IGNORING THIS OPPORTUNITY WOULD  14 24 17   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     ONLY UNDERMINE THIS HISTORIC UNDERTAKING  SO IN CONCLUSION  MR  PRESIDENT  I BELIEVE THIS IS A VOTE THAT SHOULD UNITE ALL OF US WHEREVER WE STAND ON GENERAL U S  POLICY TOWARDS CUBA  LET ME REMIND MY FRIENDS  THIS IS NOT A VOTE ON THE EMBARGO  THIS IS NOT A VOTE ON BASIC U S  POLICIES TOWARDS CUBEA  WE MAY HAVE THAT DISCUSSION    TOWARDS CUBA  WE MAY HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ON SOME OTHER DAY  BY VOTING  HOWEVER  FOR THIS AMENDMENT YOU ARE VOTING TO SUPPORT THOSE IN CUBA WHO CONTINUE TO GO OUT IN THE  14 24 51   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT    STREETS EVERY DAY TO ASK FOR PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC CHANGE  WHO RISK THEIR LIVES  WHO RISK THEIR LIVING  MR  PRESIDENT  THAT S NOT AN OVERDRAMATIZATION OF THE REALITY OF THE CHALLENGE OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO CREATE CHANGE WITHIN THEIR COUNTRY AND THE COUNTRY OF CUBA FACE  I REPRESENT MANY IN NEW JERSEY WHO HAVE LANGUISHED IN CASTRO S JAILS FOR 10  20  EVEN 30 YEARS  WHAT WAS THEIR CRIME  WHAT WAS THEIR CRIME THAT THEY D LANGUISHED 10  20  OR 30 YEARS IN CASTRO S JAILS   14 25 24   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     SIMPLY TO SUGGEST  SIMPLY TO SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A BETTER WAY FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE  SIMPLY TO SPEAK OUT FOR THOSE FREEDOMS THAT WITH ENJOY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY  SIMPLY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR THAT WE CHOOSE  SIMPLY TO BE ABLE TO ELECT THOSE WHO REPRESENT US IN OUR GOVERNMENT AS WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE HERE  SIMPLY TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND ORGANIZE AND DEMONSTRATE A DIFFERENT VIEW THAN THAT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE AT ANY GIVEN  14 25 58   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     TIME  SIMPLY TO SPEAK YOUR MIND WITHOUT THE FEAR  BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF DOING SO WILL HAVE YOU LANGUISH 10  20  OR 30 YEARS IN CASTRO S GULAG  ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THAT IS WELCOME TO COME TO MY HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY  I M SURE TO THE HOME

SIMPLE DOCUMENT WITHIN THEIR  14 27 38   MR  MENENDEZ    NOT AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT     POSSESSION WERE OFTEN ARRESTED AND THROWN INTO JAIL  THE POWER OF THE THOUGHT  THE LIBERATING THOUGHT OF THE FREEDOMS AND THE REAL ATTITUDE THE UNITED STATES HAD WITH THE CUBAN PEOPLE AS TO WHERE WE WANT TO HELP THE PEOPLE  NOT THOSE WHO OPPRESS THEM  WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE REGIME COULD NOT AFFORD TO LET PEOPLE READ IT AND WOULD ARREST THEM AS THEY LEFT THE INTRASECTION  BY VOTING FOR THIS AMENDMENT  YOU GIVE THOSE WHO READ THAT DOCUMENT OR THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR OTHER DEMOCRATIC
