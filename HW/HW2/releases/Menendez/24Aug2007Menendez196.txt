August 24  2007      Washington  DC  United States Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  today sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Secretary Michael Chertoff  asking for further clarification regarding a policy announced by United States Citizen and Immigration Services  USCIS  that will require 750 000 legal permanent residents to replace their green cards  The cards  issued between 1977 and 1989  do not have expiration dates  USCIS has announced that they will not contact the card holders  will only allow 120 days to replace their cards  and will need to pay nearly  400   While I commend the Department for taking important steps to reducing fraud and improving the security of our homeland by making sure we know who is carrying a green card  I have concerns about the process in which this effort will be carried out and the impact it could have on hundreds of thousands of legal permanent residents  people who have played by the rules for 20 30 years  wrote Menendez    Menendez is asking USCIS to provide specifics as to how they will be able to handle such a large influx of applications  when delays exist for current new applications  Additionally  he is asking for USCIS outreach plan  since individual cardholders will not be contacted directly  Finally  he requests that USCIS reconsider the application fee  as many of the cardholders may be on fixed incomes and unable to handle the cost   Full text of the letter follows       August 24  2007   The Honorable Michael Chertoff Secretary of Homeland Security United States Department of Homeland Security Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff   I am writing with regard to recent reports of a proposal announced by the Citizen and Immigration Services Division of the Department that would require replacement applications and fees for legal residents carrying green cards that lack expiration dates  While I commend the Department for taking important steps to reducing fraud and improving the security of our homeland by making sure we know who is carrying a green card  I have concerns about the process in which this effort will be carried out and the impact it could have on hundreds of thousands of legal permanent residents  people who have played by the rules for 20 30 years  many of whom may be living on a limited income  and will now have to come up with almost  400 to pay these new fees in a short period of time   My first concern has to do with the proposed time frame of 120 days  in which the Department will have to process approximately 750 000 legal permanent residents applying for new green cards  In light of recent changes in passport regulations which have resulted in unexpected delays  frustration  and a huge backlog of applications  it seems questionable that 120 days is sufficient time to process and replace hundreds of thousands of green cards  As a United States Senator from New Jersey  my office was inundated with questions and requests for help on the passport issue  That is why I request that the Department outline the specific plans they will have in place to avoid or deal with such setbacks  should they occur  so I can better help my constituents impacted by this proposal   My second concern is the fact that the proposal states affected legal residents will not be individually notified  With legal permanent residents given only 4 months to come up with almost  400 to reapply for permanent residency  I would hope that the Department has a specific outreach plan for reaching those affected by this change in regulation  Therefore  I specifically request information on the Departments plans to adequately get the word out to legal permanent residents who need to apply for new green cards   Finally  I believe the fee is excessive for people who have been here contributing to our country for decades  have played by the rules  obeyed the law  and otherwise have no reason to be hit with an unexpected  400 fee  In addition  they will only have 120 days to come up with the fee  which may be impossible for those on fixed incomes    We all share the same goal  to ensure that the security of our nation is protected by knowing who is here to live the American dream and who is here to destroy it  However  I believe we have to use caution so that we are not inefficiently or unfairly treating those who are abiding by the law  That is why I request details as to how the Department plans to notify green card holders affected by this proposed regulation and to deal with the volume of requests that will be flowing in  I also encourage you to reconsider the fees these individuals will have to pay in order to maintain their legal status   Thank you for your attention to this critical issue  I look forward to your prompt response    Sincerely      ROBERT MENENDEZ  United States Senator
