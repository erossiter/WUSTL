Bayh Supports Hoosier Farmers with Tobacco Buyout Legislation Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh continued his work to help Hoosier farmers by supporting legislation to create a buyout proposal for tobacco farmers. The bill is designed to ease the transition into new crops or business ventures and provide for a more stable farming environment for those tobacco farmers who continue to grow tobacco. The legislation passed the Senate late Thursday as an amendment to the JOBS Bill and will now go to a conference committee for approval.  The buyout program will offer Hoosier tobacco farmers much needed assistance in finding an alternative to tobacco that will allow them to provide for their families and boost the local economy, Senator Bayh said. It is important that we preserve farming as part of our Hoosier heritage. These Hoosiers are facing tough times and this legislation is a step in the right direction to help educate communities about new ways to grow and develop without depending on tobacco. The buyout program outlined in the JOBS Bill amendment will provide a financial incentive for farmers to move out of tobacco production. In addition, the program will provide funds to universities in tobacco-producing states for research on other crops and to tobacco-dependent communities to help develop new industries to support their local economies. Senator Bayh is an original co-sponsor of the Tobacco Market Transition Act of 2003, the bill upon which the amendment that passed the Senate was based. The amendment will provide payments of $8 per pound to quota holders and $4 per pound to growers. The payments, based on the 2002 tobacco quota level, would be distributed over a ten-year period. The funds to pay for the buy-out program will come from manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products sold in the United States.
