Senator Bayh's Office Holds October Office Hours in Scott County Washington-- A representative from the office of U.S. Senator Evan Bayh will be available on October 5th to meet individually with Hoosiers in Scott County at the Scott County Public Library.     The federal government can sometimes seem far away and disconnected from our everyday lives, Bayh said.  My office can help cut through the red tape, address problems, and make government work for real people. On hand will be Andrew Homan, Senator Bayhs regional director for Southern Indiana.  Andrew replaces Bayhs previous regional director, Heidi Inman.  Originally from New Albany, Andrew graduated from Indiana University Southeast.  Prior to working for Senator Bayh, Andrew was a legislative assistant to Congressman Baron Hill (D-IN) in Washington, D.C.  Homan also served in the Peace Corps as a volunteer English teacher in the Kingdom of Tonga.   Hoosiers who are unable to attend the regional office hours but need assistance should contact Andrew Homan in Bayhs Jeffersonville office. The address is 1201 E. 10th Street, Suite 106, Jeffersonville, IN 47130. The phone number is (812) 218-2317. Senator Bayh said some of the most common problems his office helps Hoosiers handle include difficulties with social security and veterans benefits, questions about federal taxes, and concerns about immigration.  In addition, Bayh encourages Hoosiers to stay in touch with his office to register their opinions on congressional issues. On Friday, October 5th, Mr. Homan will be at the Scott County Public Library in the First Floor Meeting Room from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM Eastern Time.
