Congress Passes Bayh Amendment to Protect Military Families from Foreclosure Washington-- Congress last night approved the final Defense Authorization bill, which contained a pair of amendments authored by U.S. Senator Evan Bayh that will protect military families who are facing foreclosure, eviction or loan default due to financial hardship because of military service. Many military families are losing their homes in spite of an existing law protecting them from these situations because of a failure to properly educate our soldiers about their rights. Bayh's amendments would require the Pentagon to educate families about their rights and include language explaining these rights in foreclosure paperwork.  Last night's vote protect military families facing financial difficulty by ensuring that their homes are safe while they are fighting overseas, Senator Bayh said. These amendments will ensure that our troops know their rights and will make it impossible for lenders to claim ignorance of the law when they try to foreclose on our military families. Many military families are unaware that they are currently protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act from foreclosure and eviction, so they do not fight the notices they receive. Bayh's amendments offer a direct solution to the problem by taking the following steps:  Requiring the Department of Defense to develop an educational outreach program for military families during the process of mobilization and   Including information on military families' rights on notices required during the foreclosure process to ensure that families are aware of their protected status if the process manages to reach that level. An increasing number of military families are facing economic difficulties ranging from an inability to pay grocery bills to outright bankruptcy as active duty tours last longer than any in the past 50 years.
