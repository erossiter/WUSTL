Statement from Senator Bayh on President Bush's Veto of SCHIP Washington-- Following is a statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh in response to President Bush's veto of the the SCHIP bill:   Along with Senator Lugar and many Republicans, I believe that extending health care to children is both the right and the smart thing to do. This step will improve our childrens health and save money for those who already have health insurance. We should put politics and ideology aside and do whats right for both our kids and our country.
