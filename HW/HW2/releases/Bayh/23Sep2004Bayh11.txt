Bayh Announces $250,000 for Revitalization of Spring Street Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of $250,000 that he fought for to help Hoosiers restore businesses that were destroyed in a recent fire. Last winter, a fire tore through an entire city block on Spring Street, destroying several restaurants and shops in downtown Jeffersonville. The funds will be used by the City of Jeffersonville to carry out the Indiana Spring Street Redevelopment Project.  The people of Jeffersonville are working hard to restore their community and re-open their businesses that were damaged in the fire, Senator Bayh said. These funds will jump-start the renovation process and provide Hoosiers with much-needed resources to rebuild the Spring Street area and ensure that future generations are able to enjoy this historic neighborhood. The fire on Spring Street in January destroyed numerous businesses and impacted the lives of the owners, employees and all those who shopped along that historic corridor, said Congressman Baron Hill. We pledged that we would get them the assistance they needed to get back on their feet. I applaud Senator Bayh for his hard work and dedication to the people of Jeffersonville. Senator Bayh, Senator Lugar and Congressman Hill urged House and Senate appropriators this April to include funding for Spring Street renovations as part of an Economic Development Initiative (EDI) to help the city restore buildings damaged by the fire and to continue the Spring Street revitalization efforts, which were underway before the fire. Spring Street is the home of numerous historic buildings, which are occupied by local businesses. The EDI funds will be used by the City of Jeffersonville to rebuild and improve the Spring Street corridor and build new parking lots.
