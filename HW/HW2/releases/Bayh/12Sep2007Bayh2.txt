Lugar, Bayh Secure $1 Million for South Bend Public Transportation Corporation Washington-- U.S. Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh voted to secure $1 million for the construction of a new bus maintenance facility for the South Bend Public Transportation Corporation (TRANSPO).  The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate today by a vote of 88-7.   I am pleased to have a chance to support the efforts of TRANSPO to construct a new transit center.  I look forward to the increased use of alternative fuel buses at the new center, Lugar said. This new TRANSPO center will provide valuable alternative fuel and transportation options for South Bend residents, said Bayh.  Additionally, with the new maintenance center and administrative offices planned for what is currently a brownfield site, this is a significant investment in the citys overall redevelopment efforts. Funding would be utilized to build a new facility to replace the maintenance and administration facility, which has been in continuous use since the 1880s.   TRANSPOs Board of Directors indicated the new facility will be more centrally located, allowing for increased operations efficiency and the introduction of new alternative fueled vehicles into TRANSPOs fleet.  It will be located in South Bends Studebaker Corridor, a brownfields area in the industrial core.   Funding was requested by TRANSPO and supported by Mayor Stephen Luecke. This project was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 12, 2007, at the request of Lugar and Bayh.   The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives.  Should projects be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies.  The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
