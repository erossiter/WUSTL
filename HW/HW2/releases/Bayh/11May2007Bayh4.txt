Bayh Calls on Administration to Secure America's Food Supply Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today sent a letter calling on the Bush administration help secure America's food supply by stepping up screening and inspection procedures and coordinating the work of the multiple agencies responsible for enforcing food safety standards. Bayh's letter follows the announcement last week by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that chicken feed used at 38 Indiana poultry farms had been contaminated with the toxic chemical melamine by melamine-tainted feed ingredients which were imported from China. "While scientists from five federal agencies concluded this week hat there is very low risk to human health from consuming meat from chicken feed contaminated feed, it heightens how vulnerable the United States agriculture and food systems are to potentially poisonous agents that may be delivered to American citizens," Senator Bayh wrote in the letter. "We must treat this as a wake-up call to take more aggressive steps to guard against contamination of the human food supply." In the letter, Bayh noted that in addition to the contaminated chicken feed, thousands of American pets have been sickened or died as a result of tainted foreign ingredients in their food. To guard against further outbreaks, Bayh urged the administration to take aggressive action to coordinate the work of the multiple agencies charged with protecting the food supply, including the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, to ensure that imports from China and other countries are free of these dangerous substances. To track the government's progress in securing the food supply, Bayh requested that the administration provide an update on the implementation of plan developed in 2004 to protect the U.S. agriculture and food system from intentional contamination and release the FDA's Import Strategic Plan, designed to guard against accidental contamination.
