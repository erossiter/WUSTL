Bayh Introduces Resolution Marking Holocaust Anniversary Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today joined Senator Lugar to introduce a resolution designating the week of May 1, 2005 as Holocaust Commemoration Week to mark the 60th anniversary of the end to World War II and the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps. The week will serve as a solemn reminder of the brutality and intolerance inspired by prejudice and hatred, as well as the progress mankind is striving to make following this terrible event in human history.  The greatest tribute to the men, women and children who died during the Holocaust is ensuring that the lessons learned from such unthinkable hatred are never forgotten, Senator Bayh said. This resolution is a reminder to all of us to safeguard these lessons and confront hatred and bigotry wherever it is found. In the resolution, Senators Bayh and Lugar write that the Holocaust has provided people around the world with a lesson in the importance of compassion, an awareness of the dangers inherent in bigotry and racism, and an understanding of the importance of understanding diversity. Bayh and Lugar encourage Americans to use the week for reflection, acts of compassion and learning about the Holocaust. The Holocaust Museum in Terre Haute is one of the greatest examples that this spirit is still alive, Senator Bayh said. When arson destroyed the original museum, Hoosiers from across Indiana sent donations to rebuild it, leaving a bigger museum and stronger community its place. The CANDLES Museum in Terre Haute was created in 1995 by area resident Eva Kor, an Auschwitz survivor, to teach Midwestern children about the horrors of the Holocaust. In 2003, an arsonist destroyed much of the museum, but donations from area schoolchildren and others allowed Kor to rebuild. The new museum will reopen this spring.
