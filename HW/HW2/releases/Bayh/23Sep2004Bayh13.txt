Bayh Announces $500,000 for Terre Hauteâ€™s Business Incubator Washington-- A plan to attract new businesses and create new jobs in Western Indiana took a big step forward today as U.S. Senator Evan Bayh announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of his request for $500,000 for Terre Haute's new business incubator. The funding will be used by the incubator in collaboration with Rose Hulman Ventures and Indiana State University to attract new start-up businesses to the area and create good paying jobs in Western Indiana.  This collaborative effort holds tremendous promise for hardworking Hoosiers who are searching for new job opportunities, Senator Bayh said. The business incubator will play an active role in developing new businesses and attracting existing, successful businesses, which will help bring more jobs to the greater Terre Haute area. Senator Bayh urged Senate appropriators this April to provide funding for Terre Haute's business incubator project. The incubator's goal is to create and attract new businesses to the area, creating new jobs for local Hoosiers. A member of the Small Business Committee, Bayh has a longstanding history of helping small businesses access the resources they need to grow their business and create new Hoosier jobs. This August, Senator Bayh co-hosted the second annual Terre Haute Job Fair, Job Training and Small Business Summit, bringing together local job-seekers with companies looking to hire and organizations that offer job training. At this year's summit in Terre Haute, job seekers could meet with local companies that had more than 250 job openings. In addition, Bayh brought together local entrepreneurs with experts who can offer assistance in starting and growing small businesses. So far, 11 individuals have found new jobs through this year's job fair in Terre Haute.
