Bayh Alerts Hoosier Taxpayers to Claim Undelivered IRS Tax Refund Checks Washington  Senator Evan Bayh announced today that more than 1,600 Hoosiers have undelivered tax refund checks from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) totaling more than $1.2 million. The IRS released the list last week. Taxpayers can receive their refund by updating their address with the agency.    According to the IRS, nearly $110 million in tax refund checks have not been cashed by taxpayers because they were returned to the agency as undeliverable.  A refund check is normally returned as undeliverable when a taxpayer moves without updating his or her address with either the U.S. Postal Service or the IRS.  More than 115,000 taxpayers across the country are due refunds averaging $953. In Indiana alone, 1,628 Hoosiers have undelivered refunds, averaging $764 per taxpayer. Bayh also announced that his office is helping get the word out to those Hoosiers who have undelivered checks by posting the list here. Hoosier taxpayers who are owed money by the IRS deserve to get it without further delay, Senator Bayh said. By taking a quick look at the list, you could discover a refund you didnt know about. Thats good news, especially with the holiday season at hand and far too many families feeling the financial pinch this year. Taxpayers can also find out if they are on the list of unclaimed IRS refunds by visiting the IRS website at: http://www.irs.gov and clicking on Wheres my refund? under Online Tools.
