Bayh Statement on Baker-Hamilton Report Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement on the Baker-Hamilton report on Iraq. "Today's report offers the kind of changes we need to improve the current situation in Iraq, but the final answer rests with President Bush and whether or not he will take the advice he's been offered. The administration's continued insistence to stay the course has produced few results in the past three years and is weakening our overall national security. We need to try a different approach, one that puts pressure on the Iraqi people to make the tough decisions that only they can make if they are to succeed. The Baker-Hamilton Commission accomplishes this through a number of steps, including its recommendations for troop withdrawals, which sends a concrete signal to the Iraqis that we will not remain there indefinitely. "This report represents a bipartisan consensus that we need to change directions regarding Iraq. The President is changing his Secretary of Defense, but this report now raises the most important question: Is the President willing to change his mind?"
