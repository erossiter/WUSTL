Bayh Urges Hoosiers to Celebrate National Teacher Day Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today encouraged Hoosiers to celebrate National Teacher Day on Tuesday, May 9th by recognizing the outstanding work and lifelong dedication of Indiana's teachers. National Teacher Day is a national holiday sponsored by the National Education Association to recognize the important contributions that teachers make to our communities. "Every teacher touches the lives of countless children, and every adult remembers their favorite teachers and the impact they had on their lives," Senator Bayh said. "I still remember my favorite teacher, Mr. Ruge, an inspirational teacher who instilled in me a love for written English. He emphasized clear, concise prose -- not common among practitioners of my current profession. "National Teacher Day is an opportunity to honor teachers like Mr. Ruge and others across the country who inspire and nurture our children. Teachers are the foundation for a quality education, which can open doors for our students and create vibrant communities, and we need to ensure that they have the resources and support they need to succeed in the classroom," Bayh continued. As Governor of Indiana and now as Senator, Bayh has worked to make quality primary and secondary education available to every child. His proudest accomplishment as governor was the creation of the 21st Century Scholars program, which has given a college scholarship to more than 100,000 underprivileged students in Indiana. National Teacher Day has been celebrated annually since 1980. For more information on National Teacher Day, please visit http://www.nea.org/teacherday.
