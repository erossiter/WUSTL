Bayh Announces Support of 9-11 Commission Recommendations Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today joined Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Joe Lieberman (D-CT), and Arlen Specter (R-PA), to thank the 9-11 Commission, including Chairman Tom Kean and Vice-Chair Lee Hamilton, for their work on the commission and to announce plans to introduce legislation to implement the commission's recommendations.  The 9-11 Commission has done a national service in determining what led to the tragedy, Senator Bayh said. Their work will be for naught unless we translate their recommendations into action. While I don't agree with every detail of every proposal, we cannot allow inertia, bureaucratic turf protection and political gridlock to stop actions to prevent another 9-11 or something even worse. We must maintain the momentum for constructive change. It has dissipated as the shock of the attack has worn off. My endorsement of these recommendations is an attempt to regain it. At a press conference attended by Commission Chairman Tom Kean and Vice Chair Lee Hamilton, the senators praised the commission recommendations as bold and innovative and pledged to approach the task of turning them into law with the same bipartisan spirit that marked the commission's work. Senator Lieberman, the Governmental Affairs Committee ranking member; Senator McCain, the Commerce Committee Chairman; and Senator Specter, a senior member of the Judiciary and Appropriations Committee, along with Senator Bayh, a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, represent a wealth of experience in the Senate, which they plan to use to encourage their colleagues to support legislation faithful to some of the recommendations outlined in the commission's report. The senators said they plan to introduce legislation in September.
