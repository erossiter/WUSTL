Bayh Pushes for Action on SOS Act Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today urged the Senate to take action on his Stopping Overseas Subsidies (SOS) Act during a Finance Committee hearing on China's unfair trade practices. Senate leadership agreed to discuss Bayh's legislation at this hearing after Bayh blocked U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman's nomination in April. The hearing represents an important step toward enacting Bayh's legislation, providing Bayh and other supporters with the opportunity to make the case for tougher enforcement of U.S. trade laws.  The SOS Act is seen as a solution to a federal court decision from 1986 that the Commerce Department says prevents it from applying antisubsidy laws to a nonmarket economy such as China. Bayh's legislation provides a straightforward solution to the problem by allowing the Commerce Department to determine whether or not a subsidy exists regardless of whether the country in question is a nonmarket economy.
