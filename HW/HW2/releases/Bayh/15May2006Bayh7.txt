Bayh Calls on Germany to Forbid Iranian President from Attending World Cup Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh sent a letter to the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, urging her to forbid Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from traveling to Germany for the World Cup soccer tournament. In a bipartisan letter with 23 of his colleagues, Bayh stressed that the World Cup is one of the most closely-watched sporting events in the world, and President Ahmadinejad should not be given the opportunity to use such a popular forum to spread his messages of hate and destruction.  In today's media-driven world, events such as the World Cup provide an unusually large and diverse international audience, Senator Bayh and his colleagues wrote. Before such an audience, we should make it clear that the international community will not tolerate Iran's deadly threats to peace and stability in the Middle East. President Ahmadinejad has sworn to try to destroy the State of Israel, is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, and recently asked his people to imagine a world without the United States of America. Iran is the world's foremost sponsor of terror and is responsible for the deaths of Americans in Lebanon, Saudia Arabia, and across Iraq. By forbidding him from traveling to Germany, Chancellor Merkel would send a bold message to the Iranian leadership that irresponsible actions will be met with international censure. Senator Bayh, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, has been an outspoken advocate of enacting sanctions against the Iranian government and ruling elite and has urged the Bush administration to treat the country like a pariah state until it renounces its pursuit of nuclear arms. Earlier this year, Bayh introduced a Senate resolution calling on President Bush to enact a series of aggressive sanctions against Iran in an effort to stop Iran's recent attempts to restart its nuclear program.
