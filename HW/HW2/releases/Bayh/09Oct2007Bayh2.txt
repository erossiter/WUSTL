Bayh Announces $61,000 for Low-Income Housing Rehabilitation in Orange, Washington County Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the USDA Office of Rural Development awarded two $30,626 grants to Hoosier Uplands Economic Development Corporation for work in Washington and Orange County as part of the Housing Preservation Program.    The money provided by the grants will be used toward the rehabilitation of homes for very low income homeowners in both Orange and Washington counties. The rehabilitations will concentrate on increasing home energy efficiency in anticipation of higher energy costs in the near-future. The rising cost of energy affects all Hoosiers, and it creates very difficult financial choices for many homeowners, said Senator Bayh. These funds will help those who otherwise could not afford to make energy-saving improvements to their home do so, saving them money in the long-term and ensuring that they will not have their utilities shut off because of their inability to pay.
