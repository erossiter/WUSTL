Bayh Statement on President Bushâ€™s Iraq Speech Washington- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement on President Bushs Iraq speech:  I will consider what the President said. Im skeptical, however, that this is the change we need to improve the situation in Iraq. Only the Iraqis can make the hard decisions to save their country. For three years, weve stood by them in the hope that they would. That approach is not working, and the Presidents approach, in substance not rhetoric, seems to be more of the same. I will also be looking for benchmarks for progress, timelines for meeting them, and accountability for a failure to do so. Without this, the Iraqis will never do what needs to be done.
