Bayh Statement on OPEC Decision to Raise Oil Prices Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement in response to OPEC's decision to lower oil production and increase oil prices. Bayh is the lead sponsor of the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act (S.2025), comprehensive energy legislation designed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrels a day by 2026.  Just when Americans were beginning to see a drop in gas prices, OPEC members have moved to drive up the cost of oil once again. You don't have to look any further than that for proof that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is hurting America's economy and putting a financial strain on American families. Unfortunately, until we take serious steps to develop alternative fuels and more efficient vehicle technologies, Americans will remain hostage to similar decisions in the future. I have offered an energy plan, the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act, that would reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrels a day by 2026 through a combination of aggressive steps, including improving the efficiency of vehicles and increasing the production and use of biofuels. It includes new approaches for manufacturers, the federal government, scientists and consumers because it will take everyone working together to meet this challenge. There is no quick fix to our energy dependence, but there will never be a solution at all if we fail to take action in the first place. The sooner we start taking the serious, long-term steps called for in my energy plan, the sooner the American people will start to see results. When Congress returns to work next month, they should pass my plan, which already enjoys widespread bipartisan support, and help end our dependence on foreign oil.
