Bayh, Hagel Call for U.N. Resolution Condemning Iran's Anti-Semitic Statements Washington-- U.S. Senators Evan Bayh (D-IN) and Chuck Hagel (R-NB) today sent a letter to Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, calling for the United Nations to offer a strong resolution condemning recent statements by Iranian President Mohammed Ahmadinejad and by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ali Khameni threatening the existence of Israel and the United States. Bayh and Hagel, both members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, argued that the offensive statements were all the more dangerous because of Iran's recent declarations to defy its nuclear non-proliferation commitments.  Words matter. The United Nations, and indeed all international organizations, must not accept hateful, anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism as business as usual, Senators Bayh and Hagel wrote in their letter. We respectfully urge you to  marshal the international community against these falsehoods and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the letter, Bayh and Hagel made the case for issuing a swift and strong condemnation against Iran based on its leaders' recent comments and the threat the country poses through its clear desire to pursue a nuclear weapons program. The senators argue that Ahmadinejad's statements violate the United Nations Charter regarding the sovereignty of Member states and urge Secretary-General Annan to act quickly to check the growing danger posed by Iran. This month, President Ahmadinejad denied the existence of the Holocaust and earlier said that it is possible to have a world without the United States and Zionism. At the same time, Ahmadinejad has said that Iran is ready to transfer nuclear know-how to Islamic countries and that Iran is prepared to take the most far reaching steps outside the requirements of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
