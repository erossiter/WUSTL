Bayh Urges Treasury Secretary to Take Steps to Help Homeowners Avoid Foreclosure Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today, along with 10 of his colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, urged Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to focus more energy on persuading mortgage lenders and those who service mortgages to take steps to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. In a letter to Secretary Paulson, the senators expressed that concern over a possible sub-prime traffic jam that could, without a more flexible, broad-based approach, turn into a monumental pileup that would result in hundreds of thousands of homeowners losing their homes. The senators also noted Paulsons recent efforts to create a facility to help bail out banks and hedge funds that invested in or underwrote sub-prime securities. They urged Paulson to devote at least as much energy to coordinating an effort that would have sub-prime lenders help homeowners stay in their homes. Editors Note: Letter is attached.
