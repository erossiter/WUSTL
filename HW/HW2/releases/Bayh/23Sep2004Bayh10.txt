Bayh Supports Middle-Class Tax Relief for Hoosier Families Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today voted to extend a series of middle-class tax cuts designed to help Hoosier families and encourage greater economic development. Without today's vote, the child tax credit for families would have been reduced and the marriage penalty would have been reinstated.  These tax relief extensions will provide Hoosiers with the certainty they need to make future financial investments, such as purchasing a new home or planning for college, Senator Bayh said. Hoosier families are working harder than ever to succeed in today's economy and deserve to keep more of their hard-earned money. I supported this legislation because it includes the kind of tax relief we need to help our families and encourage Indiana businesses to grow and create new jobs. The bill would extend the $1,000 per child tax credit for an additional five years and extend marriage penalty relief for an additional four years. Both of the provisions have been priorities for Bayh during his first Senate term. Bayh has been a leader in the fight against the marriage penalty and introduced legislation with Senator Hutchinson to permanently repeal the penalty in 2003. The bill would also the lowest tax rate bracket, ensuring lower taxes for all taxpayers that pay income taxes. In addition to tax relief for Hoosier taxpayers, the legislation also contained significant tax relief for businesses. The most significant provision extends the research and development tax credit. Senator Bayh, a member of the Small Business Committee, has been a consistent supporter of making the research and development tax credit permanent, in order to encourage more businesses to seek out innovative, high-tech methods to help them compete and succeed in today's fast-paced, global economy.
