Bayh Co-Sponsors Bill to Support Working Families by Raising Minimum Wage Washington-U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that he cosponsored legislation to support working Americans by raising the federal minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Harry Reid (D-NV), would raise the federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour over the next two years.  Every day, countless Americans work full time but still struggle to make ends meet, Senator Bayh said. This is the longest Congress has gone without raising the minimum wage since it was introduced, and too many families are struggling as a result. By enacting a long-overdue increase in the minimum wage, we can help ensure that every American who works hard and plays by the rules is able to support a family. Because of inflation, the current federal minimum wage only buys about 80 percent as much as it did when the last increase was enacted in 1997. In addition to the impact the decreased buying power has on working families, some economists suggest that businesses suffer when wages fail to keep up with inflation, leaving consumers with less money to spend. A report released last year by the nonpartisan Fiscal Policy Institute showed that small businesses in states that have raised the minimum wage above the federal level of $5.15/hour since 1997, have actually outperformed small businesses in states that have lower minimum wage rates in a number of ways, including the hiring more workers. Senator Bayh has consistently championed the need to support workers by increasing the federal minimum wage, including cosponsoring legislation identical to the current bill in 2005 and voting for it three times as an amendment. Bayh also was one of 11 cosponsors of the Standing with Minimum Wage Workers Act, which would tie future increases in the minimum wage to increases in Congressional pay.
