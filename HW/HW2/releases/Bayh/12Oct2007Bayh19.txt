Bayh Announces $148 Million for Fort Wayne Manufacturer to Produce Military Radios Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh announced today that the Senate has approved $148 million for the militarys purchase of radio systems manufactured primarily at ITT Corporations Fort Wayne facility. The funding was included in the U.S. Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008, which the Senate unanimously approved last week.   The appropriated funds are for the procurement of Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS), which are combat radios currently used by the U.S. and allied military forces. The radios operate with both voice and data communication and are designed to be reliable, secure and easily maintained. These funds will help supply our troops with a vital communications tool that they need in to effectively execute and fulfill their mission, Senator Bayh said. ITTs role in supplying these valuable pieces of equipment to our troops is another good example of the important role Indiana companies and Hoosier workers are playing in supporting the men and women serving in our military, both at home and abroad. The men and women of ITT Aerospace/Communications Division in Fort Wayne are proud to be selected again to provide our nations war fighters with the only SINCGARS radio that exceeds the militarys stated operational requirements, said Lou Dollive, president and general manager, ITT Aerospace/Communications Division. The trust placed in us by our nations leaders and the military is a testament to the quality of work done by the entire ITT team. The defense appropriations bill now heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. The final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies.  The bill then heads to the President for his signature. Senator Bayh serves as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
