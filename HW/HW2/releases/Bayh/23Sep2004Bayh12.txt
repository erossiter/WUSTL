Bayh Announces $250,000 for Holmes Court Neighborhood Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of $250,000 that he fought for to help build more affordable housing for Hoosiers in need. The funds will be used by the City of Indianapolis in partnership with the Westside Community Development Corporation to help low-income Hoosiers become homeowners and revitalize an Indianapolis area neighborhood.  With this funding, the City of Indianapolis will be able to help more Hoosiers realize the American Dream of owning their own home, Senator Bayh said. In addition, the sense of pride that comes with home ownership will help encourage increased involvement in the neighborhood and improve quality of life for everyone in the area. Senator Bayh urged Senate Appropriators this April to include funding to help low-income Indianapolis area residents become homeowners as part of an Economic Development Initiative (EDI). The City of Indianapolis and the Westside Community Development Corporation will use the funds to further enhance rehabilitation efforts that are currently under way in the Holmes Court Housing Development. The project aims to build affordable houses on city-owned land in the Holmes Court area, which is a diverse, mixed-income neighborhood. Other projects currently underway in the Holmes Court neighborhood include a new public library branch, an affordable rental development program to help residents prepare for home ownership, a new health clinic, a HOPE VI public housing program, a rental tax credit development for seniors and new commercial opportunities along the Michigan Street corridor. The EDI funds will match local and private dollars raised to fund this initiative.
