Bayh Urges President to Reconsider Disaster Aid Decision for Flooded Northern Indiana Communities Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh today joined other members of Indianas congressional delegation in urging President Bush to reconsider Indianas request to declare several Northern Indiana counties federal disaster areas after they were hit by flooding in August. The Indiana delegation letter follows a written appeal by Governor Mitch Daniels to the President to reconsider the request. Governor Daniels initial request in September for a federal declaration was not granted. The governors appeal is based on additional information provided by the State of Indiana indicating that the damage to the private sector and public infrastructure was of such severity and magnitude that effective recovery is beyond the capability of the State and local governments, the delegation members wrote. The delegation went on to emphasize that federal disaster assistance would help alleviate suffering and hardship in these communities. Governor Daniels letter specifically requests the declaration for Lake, LaPorte, Starke and Marshall counties.
