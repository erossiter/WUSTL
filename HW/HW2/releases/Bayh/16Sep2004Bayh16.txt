Senators Bayh, Lugar Announce $1 Million for Hoosier National Forest, Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, along with Senator Richard Lugar, today announced Senate Appropriations Committee approval of $1 million they requested for land acquisition programs for the Hoosier National Forest and the Patoka National Wildlife Refuge. Both projects are slated to receive $500,000 each to acquire additional land from willing sellers.  The Patoka Refuge and Hoosier National Forest are two of Indiana's most valuable natural treasures, Senator Bayh said. I am proud to play a role in helping them grow, to ensure that Hoosiers for generations to come are able to enjoy these unspoiled natural areas. I am pleased that the residents of Indiana have the opportunity to enjoy the recreational and environmental benefits of both the Hoosier National Forest and Patoka, said Senator Lugar, a long time supporter of conservation efforts. These funds will play a meaningful role in the continued effort to improve our state's natural assets. Over the last five years, Senators Bayh and Lugar have secured roughly $7.5 million for the land acquisition program at Hoosier National Forest and the Patoka Refuge. The Hoosier National Forest consists of nearly 200,000 acres of woodland in South Central Indiana. It includes several historic landmarks and an 88-acre virgin old-growth forest. The Patoka refuge, located in Oakland City, Indiana, contains one of the last expanses of bottomless hardwood forested wetlands in the Midwest. It is an essential habitat to more than 300 species of wildlife, including the bald eagle.
