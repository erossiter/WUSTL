Bayh Announces $25,000 for Regional Theatre Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the Indiana Repertory Theatre in Indianapolis has been awarded a $25,000 grant to encourage greater appreciation for live theatre among young Hoosiers in Indianapolis. The funds will be used to perform 51 student matinees of Hamlet, reaching approximately 13,000 students.  The Indiana Repertory Theatre plays a critical role in contributing to the cultural opportunities available in Indianapolis, Senator Bayh said. Making music and theatre more accessible to the young people of Indiana will expose them to new ideas and forms of expression that can enrich their lives for years to come. The National Endowment for the Arts awards grants to professional theater companies across the nation to promote live performances of Shakespeare to schools and communities in all 50 states. Each year the National Endowment program provides information and convenient show times to 700,000 students, introducing many of them to live theater for the first time. The Indiana Repertory Theatre has been serving the Indianapolis area for 35 years and is now considered one of the leading regional theatres in the Midwest. The renovated stages date back to 1927. Throughout his career in public service, Senator Bayh has promoted the development of the fine arts in Indiana. Most recently, in a move to support the diversity of radio programming, Senator Bayh joined a bipartisan effort with Senator Lugar and Congressman Hill urging the FCC to preserve Indiana University's right to the airways.
