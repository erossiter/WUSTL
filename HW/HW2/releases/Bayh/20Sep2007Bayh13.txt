Bayh Announces over $438,000 for Youth Crisis Centers Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families has awarded $438,000 in three Basic Center Grants for several organizations in Indiana.   Under the Basic Center Grant, the Childrens Bureau, Inc. of Indianapolis will receive $150,000; the Indiana Juvenile Justice Task Force, Inc. of Indianapolis will receive $138,988; and the Crisis Center, Inc., A Youth Service Bureau of Gary will receive $150,000. The Basic Center Program is designed to address the needs of runaway and homeless youth by providing food, shelter, crisis and family counseling, and other services with the hope of successful family conflict resolution and responsible youth decision making. The services are provided outside of the juvenile justice and law enforcement system. It is important that we do all we can to help youth who may find themselves in a troubling situation and provide alternatives to living on the street, said Senator Bayh.  The Basic Center grants will give youth a safe, supportive place to stay and help them work through conflict with the goal of getting them back into a safe home environment.
