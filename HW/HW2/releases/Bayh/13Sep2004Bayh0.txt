Bayh Secures Nearly $650,000 for Hoosier SAFE-T Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that Indiana's Project Hoosier SAFE-T (Safety Acting for Everyone - Together) will receive $643,188 to further implement its integrated statewide emergency radio system. The updated radio system will allow first responders from across Indiana to communicate on the same wavelengths to coordinate efforts during a large-scale emergency.  Indiana has been a national leader in developing an integrated, statewide emergency communications system, Senator Bayh said. It is important that we continue to provide our first responders with the equipment they need to react to emergencies, and I am pleased to bring this funding back to Indiana so that we can move forward in implementing Hoosier SAFE-T. The funds for Hoosier SAFE-T will be used to continue the distribution of 800-megahertz radios to emergency personnel across the state. In addition, the grant will fund the continued construction of radio towers that will allow for greater information sharing and communication between law enforcement, emergency medical officials and fire officials. Hoosier SAFE-T is a statewide radio program aimed at improving communications between the Indiana State Police and law enforcement agencies throughout Indiana. The state initiated the effort to purchase a radio system capable of statewide communication and a more coordinated response effort among emergency personnel. In addition to the $643,188, Senator Bayh has secured $14.5 million for Hoosier SAFE-T over the course of the past five years.
