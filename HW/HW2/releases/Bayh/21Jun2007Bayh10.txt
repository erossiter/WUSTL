Bayh Cosponsors Dodd-Shelby Currency Manipulation Bill, But Urges Congress To Go Further To Ensure Fairness for U.S. Companies Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) today issued the following statement supporting the Dodd-Shelby Currency Reform and Financial Markets Act of 2007, while urging the Senate Finance Committee to go even further by approving a strong trade remedy to protect U.S. companies against countries that manipulate their currency:  American companies and workers are put at a major competitive disadvantage when China and other countries engage in massive intervention to lower the value of their currency, thereby lowering the cost of their goods.  This legislation represents an important step forward in preventing countries from undervaluing their currency to gain an unfair trade advantage by forcing the Treasury Department to stop turning a blind eye to this practice. This approach would rightfully label China as a currency manipulator, while pressing the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization to take action. But to fully address Chinas undervalued currency, we need to impose a trade remedy to force violators to reform their currency practices. That is why I introduced the Fair Currency Act of 2007 earlier this year along with Senators Bunning, Stabenow, Snowe, Levin, and Casey. Our legislation would rightfully treat Chinas currency policy as an illegal export subsidy under U.S. trade law and give U.S. companies the right to seek meaningful redress for the harm they have suffered. I hope the Senate Finance Committee will embrace this vital enforcement mechanism to protect American businesses and workers.  The Fair Currency Act is strongly supported by the China Currency Coalition, a broad alliance of industry and labor organizations whose mission is to support U.S. manufacturing by seeking an end to Chinese currency manipulation.
