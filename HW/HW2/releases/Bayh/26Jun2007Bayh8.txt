Statement from Senator Bayh In Support Of the Employee Free Choice Act Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) issued the following statement today in support of the Employee Free Choice Act, which was blocked today by a procedural vote in the Senate. Bayh is an original cosponsor of EFCA.  The rights of working people need not be sacrificed to maintain Americas economic competitiveness. What distinguishes our nation in the global economy is the ability of our businesses to generate profits while honoring the sweat of those who make companies profitable. The American labor movement helped create a vast and vibrant middle class that has brought more prosperity to more people than anywhere else in the world. More working families, not fewer, deserve access to the higher wages, better health care, and retirement security that union membership brings. Today, the Senate sought simply to reaffirm the basic proposition that every worker in this country has the democratic right to associate freely and, if they so choose, join or form a union.
