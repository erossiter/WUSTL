Bayh Sponsors Legislation to Increase Ethanol Use Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today joined Senator Lugar and a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues to introduce legislation that will increase ethanol use and help reduce American dependence on foreign oil. The Fuel Security Act, co-authored by Senators Lugar and Harkin (D-IA), calls for an overall increase in ethanol use to eight billion gallons - three billion more than last year's bill.  Ethanol is good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for our national security, Bayh said. It's not right that we're as dependent as we are on places like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia. The Fuel Security Act offers an aggressive plan for making America more energy independent. The Lugar-Harkin bill requires that eight billion gallons of ethanol be used by 2012 and includes steps to ensure that the amount of ethanol used continues to grow each year after that. Renewable fuels like ethanol help free the U.S. from the whims of foreign countries controlling the oil reserves, allowing our country to pursue a more aggressive national security plan without endangering our energy supply. This legislation taps the energy potential in American corn fields while reducing our dependence on oil from foreign countries, Senator Bayh said. I am happy to work with Senator Lugar to move our country closer to achieving greater energy independence. Ethanol is a plant-based fuel additive that can be used with or in place of regular gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide emissions, which pose health threats and environmental concerns. The proposed legislation will not only reduce dependence on foreign oil, but will also increase demand for corn and soy products and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs nationwide. Bayh has voted to support the renewable fuels standard several times in the Senate and has written many letters to the Energy Conference Committee in support of a renewable fuels standard.
