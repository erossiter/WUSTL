Senator Bayh Statement on the Fifth Anniversary of September 11, 2001 Washington-- Today Americans are gathering together in cities and towns across our nation to remember the events of September 11th, 2001, and honor the lives our fellow citizens lost during the attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Five years later, we join together to reflect on the changes we have faced and the progress we have made.  As we spend this day remembering the tragedy of September 11th, we must also remember its aftermath. In the months following the September 11th attacks, Americans came together like never before. We worked across party lines to protect our country and to begin to heal our wounds. When our country was at its most vulnerable, millions of our citizens stepped up and joined together as one red, white and blue nation to help those in need. In the midst of that unimaginable sorrow, we forged a common bond that allowed us to create a stronger nation. We will forever remember those we lost on September 11, 2001.
