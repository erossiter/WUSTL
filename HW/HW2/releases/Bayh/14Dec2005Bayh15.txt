Bayh Backs St. Francis in Double-or-Nothing Bet with Montana Senator Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that he has made a double-or-nothing bet with Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) on this Saturday's NAIA National Championship football game between Fort Wayne's University of Saint Francis and Montana's Carroll College. Bayh said he is so confident of a USF victory this year that he wanted to up the ante on a bet made last year with Baucus.  I fully expect that the Cougars will come home this Saturday as the new national champions, and to prove it, I've agreed to a double-or-nothing bet with Senator Baucus, Senator Bayh said. The Carroll College Saints won their third national championship last year in a 15 to 13 game against St. Francis. However, Bayh says he is sure of a Cougar win this year -- so sure that he's agreed to put up a bucket of Indiana-grown popcorn against Baucus' Montana beer. The 50th annual NAIA Championship game will be played Saturday, December 17th, in Savannah, Tennessee. The University of Saint Francis Cougars are undefeated this year, and if they win Saturday's game, it will be their first national title.
