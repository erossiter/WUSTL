Statement of Senator Bayh on the Passing of Rosa Parks Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement on the passing of Rosa Parks: Rosa Parks was living proof of the power that lies within each of us to overcome injustice and challenge the status quo. It was my honor as Governor of Indiana to present her with the Sagamore of the Wabash, Indiana's highest honor, in recognition of her contributions to the civil rights movement. In her quiet refusal to give up her bus seat, Rosa Parks became an inspiration for generations of American, and I am sure that her legacy will continue to inspire millions more in the years to come.
