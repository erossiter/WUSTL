Senator Bayh Announces $60,000 for Hoosier Children's Mental Health Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that $60,000 has been awarded to the Indiana Federation of Families for Childrens Mental Health (IFFCMH) as part of a Statewide Family Network Grant awarded by HHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).   The funds will be used by IFFCMH as part of their grassroots effort to improve mental health for children and families.  Their activities include education and information referral on childrens mental health issues for professionals that interact with children, such as school administrators and teachers, police officers, and child welfare officers.  IFFCMH is the only non-profit in Indiana dedicated to childrens mental health issues.   Too often mental health issues are overlooked and we fail to recognize potential problems our young people face, Senator Bayh said.  The work of IFFCMH is an important link in helping children and families connect with the valuable mental health resources available to them.  SAMHSA awards Statewide Family Network Grants for a wide variety of activities and to a broad-range of organizations provided that the organization seeks to improve mental health for children and families statewide.
