Bayh Testifies Before Judiciary Committee on Tinder Nomination to 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh issued the following statement today in support of the nomination of Judge John Tinder, an Indianapolis native, for a seat on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Bayh testified today, along with Senator Richard Lugar, before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Tinder nomination. A vote on the nomination is expected later this year.   John Tinder is the embodiment of good judicial temperament, intellect and even-handedness. He has been praised from both sides of the political spectrum for his service in the Southern District of Indiana, and I am confident will receive those kinds of reviews, as well, on the 7th Circuit. He enjoys my whole-hearted support. If we had more nominees like John Tinder, wed have less fighting around this place. Hes a good judge, hes a good lawyer, hes thoughtful, and hes non-partisan. I hope that going forward, perhaps, others of a similar mold will come before us so that we can do our duty with less acrimony.
