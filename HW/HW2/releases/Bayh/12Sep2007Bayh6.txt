The city of Bloomington is grateful for this federal funding for our community," Mayor Mark Kruzan said. "These funds will support a case manager at the Justice and Mediation Center whose task includes but is not limited to educating, training and engaging at-risk youth through mediation and restorative justice. The creation of this position is an additional asset to our community's justice system." The Edward Byrne Memorial JAG Program provides support to state and local governments to combat and prevent crime. The funds can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support and information systems. A formula based on population and crime statistics is used by the Department of Justice to allocate the money.
