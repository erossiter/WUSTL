Bayh Statement Regarding Voting Rights Act Reauthorization Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement regarding the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, which passed the Senate 98 to 0 today: The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the Voting Rights Act has been an essential tool in guaranteeing that right for millions of Americans. Significant progress has been made toward guaranteeing the right to vote for all Americans, but the job is not finished. I am proud to support its reauthorization and honor the legacy of courageous Americans like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, who fought for its passage in 1965.
