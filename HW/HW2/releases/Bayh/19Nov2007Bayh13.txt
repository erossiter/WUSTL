Bayh, Senate Colleagues Urge Review of Video Game Rating System Washington-- Citing concerns over the rating given to the recently released video game Manhunt 2, Senator Evan Bayh and three of his Senate colleagues are urging the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to revise or enhance its current rating system. Bayh and Senators Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) sent a letter today to ESRB President Patricia Vance. We are writing to suggest that it may be desirable to revise or enhance the current ESRB rating system, the four senators wrote. Following the release of a revised Manhunt 2 this fall, the ESRB changed the games rating from Adults Only to Mature. The change was made despite the fact that some of the execution kills in the game retain their original visceral and casually sadistic nature, the senators wrote, also noting that other countries have banned the game. The letter goes on to point out that the Federal Trade Commission reports 42 percent of unaccompanied children age 13-to-16 can still successfully purchase games rated Mature. The letter also notes that children playing the game on Nintendos Wii system are asked to act out each of the many graphic torture scenes and murders in Manhunt 2 rather than simply manipulating a game pad. This led one clinical psychologist to state that the realistic motions used with the Wii mean youre basically teaching a child the behavioral sequence of killing. We have consistently urged parents to pay attention to the ESRB rating system. We must ensure that parents can rely on the consistency and accuracy of those ratings, the senators said. The ESRB is a non-profit, self-regulatory body established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association that assigns computer and video game content ratings.
