Bayh Congratulates Indiana Public Libraries on National Ranking Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today congratulated Indiana's public libraries for their outstanding service to Indiana. Recently ranked as number four in the country for the second year in a row, Indiana's public libraries have a long tradition of helping Hoosiers of all ages expand their reading skills and encouraging lifelong learning.  Libraries are the information hubs of our communities, Senator Bayh said. Education is the key to personal success and libraries ensure that all Hoosiers have access to essential educational resources. I am proud of our libraries for their tradition of excellence and am happy to see that they have received national recognition for their work. In addition to the state's overall ranking of fourth nationwide, eight individual Indiana libraries ranked in the top ten for their size. The Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library, Allen County Public Library, St. Joseph County Public Library, Monroe County Public Library, Carmel Clay Public Library, Bell Memorial Public Library and Hagerstown-Jefferson Township Public Library all ranked in the top ten nationwide in their size categories. A strong believer in the educational importance of libraries, Senator Bayh has supported increased funding for libraries, especially for technology and literacy programs. For the past two years, Bayh has joined his colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support efforts to increase funding for the Library Services and Technology Act to help libraries close the digital divide and allow libraries to improve their services. He has also urged that Congress boost funding for the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program to help students increase their literacy skills and develop a love for reading. The assessment of the nation's public libraries comes from Hennen's American Public Library Ratings (HALPR), which have been published annually since 1999.
