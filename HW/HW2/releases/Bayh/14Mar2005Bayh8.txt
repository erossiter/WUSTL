Bayh Joins Lugar in Defending Indiana's Do-Not-Call Law Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today joined Senator Richard Lugar to urge the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to protect Indiana's successful Do-Not-Call law from attempts to weaken it by pre-empting its protections with a weaker federal law.  Hoosiers have demonstrated overwhelming support for our state's Do-Not-Call law and have a right to the protection it offers, Senator Bayh said. Federal law should not be used to water-down our consumer rights for the benefit of telemarketers. Under Indiana law, telemarketers that do not have established relationships with consumers are forbidden from calling Hoosier households. However, members of the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA) are asking the FCC to follow a weaker federal law, which would allow such calls, instead. If the FCC agrees, Hoosiers would be inundated with thousands of unwanted calls from telemarketers. In a letter to the FCC, Bayh and Lugar point out that Indiana's Do-Not-Call registry is the most widely used consumer protection law in Indiana's history. More than three million Hoosiers have joined Indiana's Do-Not-Call list since it was started to protect Hoosiers from telemarketers' constant calls. Indiana's Do-Not-Call law is considered one of the strongest in the nation and was in place before the federal Do-Not-Call law was passed. Each day, I hear from more and more Hoosiers concerned with this attempt to weaken our Do-Not-Call law, Senator Bayh said. Senator Lugar and I will continue to urge the FCC to protect Hoosiers from unwanted calls. Bayh and Lugar reminded the FCC that federal law should only supersede state law in interstate commerce matters when it is clear that doing so is the intent of Congress. They also make the case that Americans from several other states with strong Do-Not-Call laws would lose their added protection should the FCC rule in favor of the telemarketers and Consumer Bankers Association.
