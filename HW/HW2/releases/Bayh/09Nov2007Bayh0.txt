Statement on Confirmation Vote for Judge Mukasey as Attorney General Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh issued the following statement on his vote yesterday to confirm Judge Michael Mukasey as the Attorney General of the United States. I have previously voted against Attorney General nominees who were excessively ideological, such as John Ashcroft, or who were incompetent, such as Alberto Gonzales. Judge Mukasey is neither of those. Judge Mukasey did not condone or advocate torture, but he should have been clearer and more forceful in his condemnation of it. Torture cannot be the policy of the United States. Otherwise, he was an acceptable nominee. The real disagreement isnt with Judge Mukaseyits with the President of the United States. Any of the Presidents nominees for Attorney General will take this equivocal position on torture. So the real issue is whether we should have an Attorney General for the next 14 months or not. That position and the work of the Department of Justice are too vital to the nations well-being to leave the job vacant for such an extended period.
