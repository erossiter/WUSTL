Bayh and Lugar: Doomsday Clock Highlights Need for Nuclear Fuel Bank Washington-- With todays decision by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to move ahead the Doomsday Clock from seven minutes before midnight to five minutes before midnight, Senators Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh released the following statement: Todays decision by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to move the Doomsday Clock forward two-minutes to five minute before midnight highlights the continuing and immediate need to secure loose nuclear material. Last year, we advocated establishing an International Nuclear Fuel Bank controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The proposal would ensure access to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and prevent weapons proliferation. Countries would be able to draw fuel for their power plants, provided they agree to strict verification and inspections, and then return the spent fuel for safe oversight by the IAEA. The Nuclear Fuel Bank cuts short the debate over nuclear technology rights. Countries that refuse Nuclear Fuel Bank services will come under immediate suspicion about their weapons intentions. The Nuclear Fuel Bank would be an important compliment to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program and other international nonproliferation programs. We still face an existential threat from weapons of mass destruction falling into the wrong hands. We must continue to work vigorously to make certain that all weapons and materials of mass destruction are identified, continuously guarded and systematically destroyed. The last time the Doomsday clock was pushed forward was in 2002 amid heightened concerns about the proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons and the threat of terrorism. The Doomsday clock was established in 1947 when it was set at seven minutes to midnight  it has been moved seventeen times since. 12:00 midnight on the Doomsday clock represents nuclear explosion.
