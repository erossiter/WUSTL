Bayh Backs Colts in AFC Wager with Kerry Washington- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that he has made a wager with Senator John Kerry (D-MA) on this Sundays AFC Championship game between the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots. Senator Bayh is betting chocolate crunch, caramel corn drizzled with milk chocolate from the South Bend Chocolate Factory against New England clam chowder. I was happy to make this bet with John because the only thing I will enjoy more than watching the Colts beat the Patriots with my family, is watching the Colts win the Super Bowl while we all enjoy a bowl of New England clam chowder courtesy of Senator Kerry, Senator Bayh said. With Peyton Manning throwing, Joseph Addai running, Marvin Harrison catching, and Dwight Freeney sacking Tom Brady  I hope the Patriots know this wont be another Boston Tea Party. This year the Colts have combined their usual high-powered offense with an almost impenetrable defense that has been galloping over its opponents through the playoffs and will continue all the way to Miami.
