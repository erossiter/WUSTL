Bayh Cosponsors Legislation To Help Hoosier Families Save on Home Mortgage Insurance Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today cosponsored legislation to make home mortgage insurance premiums permanently tax deductible. This bill will help 309,000 Hoosier families that currently have mortgage insurance and 12 million homeowners nationwide. Its passage would mean an average of $300 in immediate relief for taxpayers.  This provision will empower thousands of Americans to become homeowners, said Senator Bayh. It specifically targets middle class and minority families, because they are the majority of those paying mortgage insurance premiums. In Indiana, this legislation will benefit 309,000 families, specifically minority borrowers who disproportionately rely on insured mortgage loans 44% of the time. Typically, when homebuyers make a down payment of less than 20 percent on a home, they are required to purchase mortgage insurance to assist with the down payment and to protect the lender against default on the mortgage loan. Many low and moderate income homebuyers use this option, but it can be very expensive, costing as much as $1,000 a year. The legislation would allow homeowners who have home mortgage insurance and earn less than $100,000 annually to deduct the cost of the insurance from their taxes. For taxpayers with incomes above $100,000, the deduction would be reduced by 10% for every $1,000 of income above $100,000. The tax deduction for home mortgage insurance is set to expire at years end. Under the bill cosponsored by Bayh, the deduction would be made permanent.
