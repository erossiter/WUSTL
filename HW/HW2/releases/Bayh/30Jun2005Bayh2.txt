Statement from Senator Bayh on CAFTA Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement on the Central America Free Trade Agreement: "I would like to support a trade agreement with the Caribbean Basin countries, but in this case cannot. To succeed in the global economy, America must advance an ambitious trade agenda that opens markets for American goods and services, but we cannot allow American hard work and ingenuity to be stolen by other countries that break the rules. Unfortunately, this administration has done nothing in the face of such cheating, with drastic consequences for workers and businesses in Indiana and across the country.I am opposing CAFTA because this agreement contains a major loophole giving a free pass to foreign companies that ignore international labor standards. In fact, the enforcement provisions in CAFTA are a step backward from the recent free trade agreement with Jordan. Our trade policy needs more enforcement not less and that is why I cannot support this agreement."
