Bayh Announces $100,000 Grant For Rural Development In Lawrence County Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced a $100,000 grant to help small and emerging businesses in Lawrence County. The USDAs office of Rural Development provided the funds to Lawrence County Economic Growth Council under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant.  Grants like this are essential to the continued economic prosperity of our rural communities, Senator Bayh said. The revolving loan fund created with this grant money will give local communities the ability to reinvest in their future and create much needed jobs.  The Rural Business Enterprise Grant will be used to create a revolving loan fund (RLF). RLFs serve as a source of financing for small and emerging businesses that are unable to receive a loan from a commercial bank or need to receive a loan at a lower interest rate. This project will create a projected 75 jobs, and 20 businesses will be assisted by the grant.
