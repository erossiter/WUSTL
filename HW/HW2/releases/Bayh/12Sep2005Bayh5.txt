Remarks of Senator Bayh before the Senate Judiciary Committee Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh delivered the following remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee:  Thank you Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, members of the Judiciary Committee. There isn't enough civility in Washington or in public life today. Accordingly, when asked to uphold longstanding, bipartisan Senate traditions by introducing someone from my state, I did not hesitate to accept. John Roberts grew up in Northwest Indiana and still has family living in our state. He is the proud father of two lovely children Jack and Josie and husband of Jane. At only fifty, Judge Roberts has had a distinguished legal career that would make most lawyers envious. He has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court and won 25 of them, most lawyers are lucky to argue and win one case before our nation's highest Court. There is no question that John Roberts has achieved much through hard work and great ability to reach the pinnacle of the legal profession. If confirmed as Chief Justice to the Supreme Court, Judge Roberts could serve for thirty or more years. During that time, the Court will likely hear cases that affect every aspect of the law and American life from civil rights to women's rights to property rights to states' rights. I look forward to a full and clarifying discussion of his views on these important topics and others. Because for this nominee or for anyone who aspires to this nation's highest court, it is their beliefs, even more than their biography, which should determine the result of the confirmation process. As a fellow Hoosier, I am proud that someone from our state would be so talented and so successful to be considered for a position on the highest court in the land. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, I am pleased to introduce you to a fellow Hoosier, Judge John Roberts.
