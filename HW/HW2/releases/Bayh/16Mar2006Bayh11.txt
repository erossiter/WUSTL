Statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh on Budget Resolution Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement regarding the Senate budget resolution:  This proposed budget is 'business as usual' in Washington at its worst. It contains a huge deficit financed increasingly by borrowing from foreign governments. Going deeper into debt to China and Japan undermines our economy, our national security, and is deeply irresponsible to our children who must one day pay our bills with interest. We can do better.
