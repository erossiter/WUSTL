In addition to a written application, each nominee was required to submit several letters of recommendation, and was interviewed by Senator Bayh's Academy Selection Committee, a nonpartisan group made up of community leaders and Service Academy alumni.  I am proud to be able to nominate some of Indiana's best and brightest for admission to our nation's Service Academies, Senator Bayh said. These dedicated young Hoosiers will serve our country well and they should be commended for their work to keep America safe and strong. The motivation and bravery displayed by these students will no doubt lead them along the path to becoming America's future leaders. Members of the U.S. Senate may nominate applicants to the U.S. Service Academies from their home state who meet the necessary admissions requirements. The thirty-five nominees will now compete for appointments to their respective Academies for the class of 2010. The four Service Academies are: the Military Academy in West Point, NY; the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD; the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO; and the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY.
