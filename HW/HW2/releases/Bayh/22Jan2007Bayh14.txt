Bayh Congratulates Indianapolis Teacher on National Milken Award Washington- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today congratulated Jessica Heidelberg for earning the National Milken Family Foundation Educator Award. Called the "Oscars of Teaching" by Teacher Magazine, the Milken National Educator Awards were created by Milken Family Foundation chairman and co-founder Lowell Milken to recognize and reward the highest caliber professionals in our nation's schools. Every teacher touches the lives of countless children, and every adult remembers their favorite teachers and the impact they had on their lives, Senator Bayh said in a letter to Jessica. You have helped countless young people develop the building blocks necessary to become the leaders of their generation, and the students whose lives you have touched over the years will undoubtedly help shape our society through the 21st century. The Milken Family Foundation nominates teachers based on exceptional educational talent, exemplary educational accomplishments beyond the classroom, and strong long-range potential for professional and policy leadership. Jessica teaches English and Spanish in the Harcourt district. In addition to her work with her students, Jessica spends her free time teaching other teachers in bi-literacy courses and teaching techniques. As Governor of Indiana and now as Senator, Bayh has worked to make quality primary and secondary education available to every child. His proudest accomplishment as Governor was the creation of the 21st Century Scholars program, which provides college tuition to qualifying students who pledge to remain drug and alcohol free and maintain passing grades. The Milken family foundation has been rewarding teachers for their contributions and accomplishments. For more information on The Milken Family Foundation visit http://www.mff.org/ .
