Senator Bayh Travels to Middle East Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh is traveling to the Middle East this week to lead a congressional delegation to Iraq for a first person look at the political and military situation on the ground. During his trip, Bayh will visit Israel, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The visit will mark Bayh's second trip to Iraq, where he is expected to meet with Hoosier troops and several key officials for updates and intelligence briefings.  As I travel across Iraq, I want to hear from soldiers and officials leading our efforts about the current situation on the ground and what specific challenges remain to ensure our success in Iraq, Senator Bayh said. I am also looking forward to speaking with some of our Hoosier troops, to thank them for their service and make sure they are getting the armored Humvees and other equipment they need to stay safe in Iraq. Senator Bayh is currently in Israel, where he is expected to meet with top U.S., Israeli, and Palestinian officials. Bayh, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee, will also take part in several intelligence briefings in Israel, meet with Shimon Peres, and will tour the security fence with the Israeli Defense Force there. In Iraq, Senator Bayh plans to meet with Hoosier troops and will take part in meetings with U.S. defense, intelligence and diplomatic officials regarding troop training, intelligence issues and events on the ground. In Afghanistan, Bayh is expected to take part in meetings with top U.S. and Afghan officials, including President Karzai, and hopes to meet with U.S. troops involved in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.
