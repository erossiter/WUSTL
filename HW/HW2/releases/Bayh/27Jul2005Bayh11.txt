Bayh Pushes Reform to Ensure Technological Innovation and Opportunity for Everyone Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today urged the Senate Commerce Committee to modernize the nation's telecommunications laws to ensure that all Americans are able to benefit from new technological developments and the high-tech jobs they will create. In a letter, Senator Bayh and his colleagues at the Third Way joined together to advocate for telecom reform as a necessary step to enhance America's competitiveness in the global marketplace, create jobs and ensure that America remains the world's technological leader.  Technology development and innovation is a must for Hoosier businesses competing in the global marketplace, Senator Bayh said. This is not a partisan issue. Modernizing our telecommunications laws will make sure that all Americans are prepared for the many technological developments to come, creating new jobs of the future and ensuring that every Hoosier has access to new technology. As an Honorary Chair of Third Way, an organization dedicated to progress on issues that might otherwise fall victim to partisan politics, Senator Bayh believes that our telecommunications law should reflect today's reality and prepare us for the future. Over the past ten years, our telecommunication laws have become outdated, as new technologies have revolutionized the industry. As a leading advocate for developing Indiana's high-tech economy, Senator Bayh has helped secure federal funding to expand technology access into rural communities, as well as funding for programs such as Purdue University's Nanotechnology Research Center, the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, the Life Sciences Research Initiative in Central Indiana, and the Genomics Initiative, which will help Indiana be a leader in the next generation of high-tech innovation.
