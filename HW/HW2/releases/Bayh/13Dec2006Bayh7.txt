Bayh Statement on Administration's Trade Discussions with China Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's trip to China, where Paulson is expected to arrive today for the start of a new dialogue with China regarding trade policy. "A new approach to our China trade policy is long overdue, and I hope Secretary Paulson returns from his trip with something to show for his efforts. However, given the administration's track record, I doubt the American people will see much progress on unfair trade. "If the administration is serious about enforcing trade rules, it should support the bipartisan legislation I have introduced on illegal subsidies or intellectual property theft. We need a comprehensive discussion on unfair trade with China, but the workers who have lost their jobs and the companies who have seen their ideas ripped off by foreign companies need results." Senator Bayh has been a leader in the effort to stop unfair trade from China, including currency manipulation, illegal subsidies and intellectual property theft. He and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) are the co-authors of the Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act (S.593), which would allow the U.S. to apply its anti-subsidy laws to Chinese companies that unfairly benefit from advantages such as free rent, free raw materials and government loans that are never meant to be repaid. In addition, Bayh has introduced legislation with Senator George Voinovich (R-OH) to crack down on intellectual property theft by creating a task force to focus solely on pirating, much like an existing money-laundering force (S.1984).
