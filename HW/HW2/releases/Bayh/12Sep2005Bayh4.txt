Bayh Co-Sponsors Bill to Create National Emergency Family Locator System Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today co-sponsored legislation introduced by Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) to create a national emergency family locator system that will help families find their loved ones in the event of an emergency situation. In the midst of Hurricane Katrina, people have been desperate to locate missing family members. A centralized federal database would have relieved many families' stress by making it easier for displaced individuals to let their relatives know that they are safe.  The victims of Hurricane Katrina have been forced to rely on news organizations, hospitals and various hotlines as they desperately search for loved ones, Senator Bayh said. Mothers and fathers should not have to spend days agonizing over whether their children are safe. A centralized family locator system would create a secure, simple way for families to be able to learn where their loved ones are and if they are safe. Currently, families have no central source of information about the safety of their loved ones, and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, thousands of people are calling hospitals, hotlines, non-profits and their elected representatives' offices looking for information about their relatives. The National Emergency Family Locator System Act would instruct the Department of Homeland Security to create a centralized system that families can use to locate their loved ones in the event of an emergency, and that displaced individuals can use to let their families know their location and that they are safe. After a national crisis, families should be able to call one phone number or visit one website in order to post their location or find their loved ones, Senator Bayh said. This legislation is an important part of creating a better safety net for families, in the event of another natural disaster or potential terrorist attack.
