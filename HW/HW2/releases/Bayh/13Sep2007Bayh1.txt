Senator Bayh Announces $50,000 for Combating Obesity, Related Chronic Illness Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that $50,000 has been awarded to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) as part of a Chronic Disease Control Cooperative Agreement with the CDCs National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.   The funds provided to ACSM will support a program aimed at decreasing obesity and preventing obesity-caused chronic diseases through the promotion of exercise and physical activity.  ACSMs program will consist of conferences, publications and professional education. We know that obesity is a top risk factor for a number of potentially-deadly diseases and medical conditions, but there are things that can be done, including exercise and physical activity, to reduce that risk, Senator Bayh said. The college has a long history as a leader in its research and outreach to help individuals make healthy lifestyle choices and literally save lives. These funds will help strengthen those efforts. ACSM has worked with the Centers for Disease Control on various initiatives for many years, and this grant opportunity increases and strengthens that partnership, said Jim Whitehead, executive vice president of ACSM. Health problems are growing at an alarming rate for people who do not get enough physical activity, and we will urge the American people to take control of their health through easy lifestyle changes. The American College of Sports Medicine is the largest sports medicine and exercise science organization in the world.  More than 20,000 international, national, and regional members are dedicated to advancing and integrating scientific research to provide educational and practical applications of the exercise science and sports medicine.
