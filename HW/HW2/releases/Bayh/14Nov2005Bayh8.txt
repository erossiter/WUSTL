Bayh Announces Support for Fed Chair Nominee Ben Bernanke Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced his support for Ben Bernanke as the new Federal Reserve Chairman, saying he was impressed with Bernanke's background and experience during a private meeting on Tuesday, November 1st. Bernanke was nominated by President Bush to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman when Alan Greenspan steps down at the end of his current term this January. "Ben Bernanke has made it clear to me that he understands the economic challenges our country is facing today," Senator Bayh said. "I believe he offers the right blend of intellectual ability and practical experience to face these challenges, and I will support his nomination to become our next Federal Reserve Chairman." Senator Bayh is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, which is responsible for approving the administration's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board. The Banking Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow to vote on Bernanke's nomination. "There has never been a nation that was militarily powerful and economically weak, but that is the path that we're on," Senator Bayh said. "I look forward to working with Ben Bernanke to address this challenge." Bayh, who has been a strong fiscal-conservative since his days as Governor of Indiana, has expressed particular concerns over the nation's growing deficit and the impact it has on our ability to negotiate with other countries that hold our debt. He discussed these concerns and other economic issues facing the country during a meeting with Bernanke last week. Bernanke currently serves as the chairman of Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. He served on the Fed's Board of Governors for nearly three years before taking the job at the White House in June.
