Senate Passes Genetic Nondiscrimination Act Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today voted for the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act to help protect Americans from having their genetic information used against them by insurance companies or employers. The legislation was approved unanimously by the Senate this afternoon in a vote of 98-0. Bayh, a co-chair of the Senate Medical-Technology Caucus, voted in favor of similar legislation last year.  In recent years, we have seen technology advance at lightning speed, allowing us to accomplish lifesaving feats never imagined before, Senator Bayh said. It is our responsibility to ensure that these advances are used for positive medical breakthroughs, and not allowed to restrict rights or limit access to health insurance or job opportunities. The Genetic Nondiscrimination Act will prohibit health insurance companies from using genetic information to deny insurance coverage or increase premium rates for people who may be predisposed toward certain diseases. It also forbids companies from requiring such a test in the first place. To prevent genetic information from being used against Americans in the workplace, the legislation prevents employers from requesting or requiring genetic tests. In addition, it prohibits companies from making hiring or firing decision based on an employee's genetic information.
