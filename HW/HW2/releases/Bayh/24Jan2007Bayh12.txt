Bayh Supports Amendment Providing Presidential Line-Item Veto Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today voted to support an amendment to the minimum wage bill that would provide the President with line-item veto powers in order to help reduce wasteful spending in Washington. As the number of pork barrel projects continues to grow, from 3,000 to 12,852 over the past ten years, the line-item veto represents an increasingly powerful tool for cutting out wasteful spending, much of which comes from such projects.  The effort to add the amendment ultimately failed, 49-48, Washington is overrun with wasteful spending, Senator Bayh said. Passing a line-item veto provision has the potential to save American taxpayers millions of dollars every year, and while I am disappointed we weren't able to pass the line-item veto measure this time around, I intend to keep fighting for this important tool that will help cut down on irresponsible spending in government. The line-item veto amendment was sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH), and received the support of 48 Senators. While a line-item veto wouldn't solve our deficit problems, it would help make a positive step forward toward reducing the national debt. According to the Congressional Research Service, the federal government spent $64 billion on earmarks in 2006, up from $19.5 billion ten years earlier. As both Governor and Senator, Bayh has been a leading voice for fiscal responsibility. Most recently, Bayh cosponsored the Budget Enforcement Legislative Tools (BELT) Act of 2006 with Senators Tom Carper (D-DE) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME), which combined a legislative line-item veto authority and a pay-as-you-go budget rule to target wasteful spending. Bayh also co-sponsored the Pork Barrel Reduction Act with Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and others to make it more difficult for members to insert pork barrel projects into legislation.
