Senator Bayh's Office Holds November Office Hours in Posey County Washington-- A representative from the office of U.S. Senator Evan Bayh will be available on November 14th to meet individually with Hoosiers in Posey County at the Hovey House.     The federal government can sometimes seem far away and disconnected from our everyday lives, Bayh said.  My office can help cut through the red tape, address problems, and make government work for real people. On hand will be Andrew Cullen, Senator Bayhs Regional Director for Southwest Indiana.  Hoosiers who are unable to attend the regional office hours, but need assistance, should contact Andrew Cullen in Bayhs Evansville office. The address is 101 Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, Evansville, Indiana 47708. The phone number is (812) 465-6500. Senator Bayh said some of the most common problems his office helps Hoosiers handle include difficulties with social security and veterans benefits, questions about federal taxes, and concerns about immigration.  In addition, Bayh encourages Hoosiers to stay in touch with his office to register their opinions on congressional issues. On Wednesday, November 14th, Mr. Cullen will be at Hovey House in the Meeting Room from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM Central Time.
