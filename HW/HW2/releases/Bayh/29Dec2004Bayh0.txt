Bayh, Lugar Call for Federal Aid for Snow-Damaged Indiana Counties Washington-- In the wake of record-breaking snow fall in parts of Indiana last week, U.S. Senators Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar today urged President Bush to declare the State of Indiana a Major Disaster Area. The Senators asked the President to support the request Governor Kernan made yesterday for federal assistance to help Hoosier counties recover from the winter blast. More than 22 inches of snow fell in one day in some counties, causing roofs to collapse and creating hazards that had not been experienced in certain areas for nearly 30 years. "Hoosiers in the parts of our home state that were hard-hit by last week's snow storm desperately need federal aid to help them rebuild homes and businesses that were damaged or destroyed by the snow fall," Senator Bayh said. "I am confident that the Bush administration will take the appropriate actions and declare damaged communities federal disaster areas." "The snowfall that hit parts of Indiana was tremendous," Senator Lugar said. "As Hoosiers dig out and survey the damage, federal assistance will be important to the resumption of their normal lives. I am pleased to join with the Governor, and Senator Bayh, in seeking this federal aid for Indiana." If Governor Kernan's request is approved, funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would be made available to help Indiana counties and municipalities recover from the damage caused by pelting snow across Indiana.
