Under The Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders Program, the City of Indianapolis will receive $750,000, Madison County $281,270, and the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence $83,045. The grant is used for the creation and enhancement of partnerships between criminal justice agencies, victim services providers and community organizations that deal with domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. As part of the Transition Housing Grant Program, the Salvation Army in Indianapolis will receive $255,000 to provide assistance to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking who are in need of short-term/transitional housing. Legal Aid  District Eleven, Inc. of Columbus will receive $250,000 as part of the Legal Assistance for Victims Grant Program. The funds will be used to provide legal services for low-income individuals who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking to ensure that victims receive all the available social services they need. Too often in our criminal justice system, the focus is on the suspect instead of on the victim, said Senator Bayh. These grants will help strengthen the services available for victims and ensure that they receive all the support available to them.
