Bayh Introduces Bill to Protect Children from Gasoline Accidents Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today introduced legislation to protect children from gasoline burns and other accidents by requiring all new portable gasoline containers to have child-resistant caps. The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act has already been introduced in the House by Congressman Dennis Moore (D-KS) where it has garnered bipartisan support.  My bill is a simple, common-sense measure that will help protect our children from tragic accidents involving gasoline spills, Senator Bayh said. Families across Indiana have gasoline cans stored in their garages, basements and back porches. For less than $1 per container, we can make all of these gas cans child-proof and ensure that no more children suffer severe burn injuries or death as a result of an avoidable accident with a gas container. Gasoline from portable gas cans has caused the burning deaths of at least 19 children in the United States over the past decade. More than 1,000 children are treated in emergency rooms across the country each year because of an accident with a gas can. The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates there are more than 80 million gas cans in households across the nation. The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to issue mandatory regulations requiring child-resistant gas caps for all new portable gas containers. This measure would cost less than one dollar per gas can. Currently, voluntary standards exist for gas can manufacturers, but relatively few choose to abide by them. This legislation has been endorsed by the National Fire Protection Association, the Congressional Fire Services Institute and Public Citizen, among others.
