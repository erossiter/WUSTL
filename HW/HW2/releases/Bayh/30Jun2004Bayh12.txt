Bayh Visits South Bend Small Manufacturer South Bend, IN-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today visited Clean Seal, a small manufacturer in South Bend, to spotlight its role in the local economy and emphasize the crucial role Indiana's small manufacturers play in Indiana's economy. During his visit, Bayh announced that he has introduced legislation that will significantly increase funding for a widely-popular manufacturing program that helps small manufacturers grow their businesses and hire more workers. "At a time when Indiana's small manufacturers are working harder than ever to succeed, it makes no sense to take away funding for an organization designed specifically to help them create more jobs and expand their business," Senator Bayh said. "That's why I'm calling for significant new funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, to provide more hardworking Hoosiers with jobs and more small manufacturers like Clean Seal with the tools they need to succeed in today's fast-paced, global marketplace." Indiana's MEP program helps 1,000 small businesses each year and makes an economic impact of $160 million each year. It has helped save or create more than 1,300 Hoosier jobs in the past two years. However, the administration slashed funding for the program by more than 60% this year, forcing the MEP program to close offices across the country. With the support outlined in Bayh's legislation, Indiana's MEP program could receive an addition $4 million each year to reopen its closed centers and help more small manufacturers grow their businesses and hire additional workers. Clean Seal, Incorporated, a South Bend small manufacturer that produces rubber seals for the RV and auto industries, used Indiana's MEP program to earn a manufacturing certification that helped it retain business of suppliers who required a higher level of certification for their goods. Clean Seal was able to save money by getting its certification through Indiana's MEP program and provide greater job security for its workers as a result. As a senator, Bayh has worked hard to support Indiana's small manufacturers in a variety of ways. Bayh has introduced legislation to stop illegal trade practices that give Chinese companies unfair advantages. Bayh has also called for greater support for the MEP program and has invested in Indiana's manufacturing future by supporting Indiana's life sciences, nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing centers. These steps are vital to strengthening Indiana's economy and providing new jobs and better job security for Hoosiers. Indiana has 11,000 manufacturers, 98% of which are small manufacturers. These companies employ close to 300,000 Hoosiers across Indiana, providing greater economic opportunities for thousands of Hoosier families. Clean Seal, Incorporated employs 60 area Hoosiers.
