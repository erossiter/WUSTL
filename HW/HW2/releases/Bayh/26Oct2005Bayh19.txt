Bayh Praises Decision to Reinstate Davis-Bacon for Katrina Recovery Workers Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today offered the following statement in response to the White House decision to reinstate a fair wage policy for workers helping rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. "The people that were hurt most by the President's original decision are the same hardworking Americans trying to rebuild their lives and their communities along the Gulf Coast," Senator Bayh said. "As the result of the pressure we brought to bear on the administration, these workers will get the fair pay they deserve for what will be months of backbreaking, and sometimes heartbreaking, work. These workers deserve all the support we can give them, including equal wages to support their families while they rebuild from this terrible disaster." Earlier this month, President Bush had suspended a federal law that requires workers on federal contracts to be paid according to the average wages in the region, essentially cutting wages for workers and their families while they tried to rebuild their communities. The Davis-Bacon federal law sets a minimum pay scale for workers on federal contracts by requiring contractors to pay the prevailing or average pay in the region. In the Gulf Coast, average pay for construction jobs includes $9.16 an hour for sheet metal workers in Mississippi and $10.00 per hour for laborers in Livingston Parish, Louisiana. It is now expected to be re-instated on November 8th.
