Bayh Votes to Authorize $1.5 Million for Local Columbus Projects Washington-- The U.S. Senate today approved a total of $1 million in appropriations for two local projects in Columbus. The funds were included in the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act that passed the Senate by a vote of 88-7, with Senator Evan Bayhs support. The appropriations bill now moves on to a joint House-Senate conference committee for final consideration.   The bill authorizes $1.5 million for the construction of the new Mill Race Center for Active Adults. The new center will replace the existing facility and include a health and fitness center, state-of-the-art educational area, adult day-care services, senior employment opportunities and a multipurpose room for use by other members of the community. This center will be a vital link to help local seniors access services and program they need, as well as remain engaged in the community, Senator Bayh said. The community came through with $4 million for this long overdue project; and with the $1 million from the federal government, this will become a reality for our largest growth population, Mayor Fred Armstrong said. It will be a 12-year dream come true. The bill also authorizes $500,000 for the demolition and remediation of the former Golden Castings Foundry site to eliminate possible contamination risks and prepare the site for redevelopment. The 16-acre site, located near downtown, sits adjacent to two residential neighborhoods and a building that houses social services agencies. Taking the steps to remove any potential risk at the former Golden Castings Foundry site is important to the future of the community, Senator Bayh said. The demolition and remediation of the site will not only remove possible contamination that would affect the surrounding neighborhood, but also eliminate a major hurdle to future redevelopment.
