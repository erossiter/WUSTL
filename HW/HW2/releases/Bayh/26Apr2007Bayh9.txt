Bayh Co-Sponsors Legislation Honoring American Small Businesses Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today recognized the important role that small businesses play in the American economy by co-sponsoring a Senate resolution honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses. The resolution was offered during National Small Business Week as a way for the United States Senate to honor the hard work, dedication, and importance of American small businesses.  Small businesses play a critical role in Indiana's economy, and yet all too often they are not recognized for the contributions they make to our economy, Senator Bayh said. We must continue to work and ensure that middle class families and small businesses have the full support of the federal government.  As a member of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bayh has worked to support small businesses by helping them provide healthcare to their employees and find programs that assist with worker training. Each August, Senator Bayh holds a series of Job Fairs, Job Training and Small Business Summits at locations across Indiana to help create a more skilled workforce and give business owners the tools and training they need to help their small businesses succeed.
