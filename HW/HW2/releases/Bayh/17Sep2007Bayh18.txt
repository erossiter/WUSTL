Bayh Announces $6 Million in COPS Funding for IMPD Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) has been awarded $6 million from the federal Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Technology Program.   The COPS Technology Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice. IMPD will use the funds to strengthen its capacity to share of data and communications compatibility across multiple jurisdictions in region, with the ultimate objective of increasing public safety. IMPD received the maximum amount available from the technology program.  When our local law enforcement agencies are well equipped, they are more effective in crime prevention, investigations and other duties, Senator Bayh said. This funding through the COPS program will help ensure that local law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep our communities safe. Senator Bayh has long been an advocate for the federal COPS program, which has provided millions of dollars since 1995 for local law enforcement in Indiana, including funds for 519 more local police officers around the state. Bayh is a cosponsor of the COPS Improvement Act of 2007, which would fully fund the COPS program to $1.15 billion, doubling the current appropriation. Additionally, the bill would set aside $600 million for the purpose of hiring local police officers.
