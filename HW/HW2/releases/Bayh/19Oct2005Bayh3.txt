Bayh Urges Senate Leaders to Pay for Next Katrina Supplemental Without Adding to Debt Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today urged the Senate leadership to pay for as much of the upcoming Katrina Supplemental Appropriations bill as possible, without adding to the nation's growing debt. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Bayh argued that the only way to achieve success was a compromise with a mix of spending cuts and delayed tax breaks to help pay for Katrina recovery efforts.  In a polarized nation and Congress, the only course of action with any possibility of success must include principled compromise and shared sacrifice, Senator Bayh wrote in the letter. Families in Indiana and across America understand the need to adjust their budgets when faced with an unexpected expense. It is time for the federal government to begin acting in the same way. In his letter, Bayh urges the leaders to seek a principled compromise on a way to pay for recovery efforts so that the next Katrina Supplemental does not add further to the deficit. Bayh outlines plans to introduce such a compromise when the supplemental is debated, by off-setting the cost of the supplemental with a combination of tax and spending measures. The nation's debt currently stands at $319 trillion and continues to grow. Congress has already appropriated $62 billion for Katrina rebuilding efforts, and is expected to take up a third financial aid package in the coming days. Without any financial off-sets, the cost of this rebuilding will be added to the nation's debt.
