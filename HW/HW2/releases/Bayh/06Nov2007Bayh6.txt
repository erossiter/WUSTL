Bayh Calls on President to Grant Disaster Aid for Northern Indiana Communities Hit by Tornado Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh called on President Bush to quickly approve disaster aid for Northern Indiana communities, including Nappanee, hit by a tornado and severe weather on Oct. 18.  Senator Bayh joined the rest of the Indiana Congressional delegation in a letter to the President urging him to grant the disaster declaration request for Elkhart, Kosciusko and Marshall counties made by Governor Mitch Daniels late last week. The declaration would mean Nappanee and other communities hit by the Oct. 18 storm would be eligible for federal disaster assistance. While the total number of affected people may seem small, to the small rural Elkhart County community of Nappanee, where the preponderance of the damage occurred, the effect is devastating, the delegation wrote, noting that as many as 50 percent of the towns residents could be facing employment problems as a result of the storm. -- Editors Note: Letter Attached -- Click here for associated multimedia.
