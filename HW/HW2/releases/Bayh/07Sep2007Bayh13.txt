Bayh Announces $28.6 Million Appropriation to Build Armed Forces Reserve Center in Lafayette Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced a $28.6 million appropriation to build an Armed Forces Reserve Center (AFRC) in Lafayette, where Hoosier Reservists and Guard members will receive training and preparation to maintain military readiness levels.  The funding for the center was included in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2008, which passed the full Senate today with Bayhs support. The bill now heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. The planned construction of the joint facility is a result of recommendations from the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. This first-class center will provide an excellent, centralized facility where our Guard and Reserve forces can work and train, Senator Bayh said. Its important that we take every step possible to provide the best support and resources for the men and women serving in our armed forces, both here and abroad, and this new facility will help Hoosier soldiers make vital contributions to the American armed forces. The new AFRC in Lafayette, to be completed by 2012, will be on the site of the existing National Guard Armory and will house National Guard and Army Readiness Centers that are currently located throughout Northwest and Central Indiana. The location for the new AFRC was selected to optimize the ability to recruit and retain soldiers and train and mobilize Reserve units, according to the BRAC recommendations.
