Statement of Senator Bayh on the Nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement on the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court: In my dealings with Ms. Miers, I have always found her to be a very congenial and competent attorney. However, there should not be a rush to judgment on a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, which is why I look forward to what I hope will be a respectful and informative confirmation process.
