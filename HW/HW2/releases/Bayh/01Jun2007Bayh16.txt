Bayh Secures Key Committee Approval of $4 Million For South Bend Company To Provide Up-Armored Humvees in Iraq Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that he has taken the critical first step in securing $4 million for AM General to provide additional up-armored Humvees for soldiers serving in Iraq.  The projected funding is part of a $986,409,000 total authorization for up-armored Humvees included in the Senate Armed Services Committee Authroization bill for 2008.  Year after year, the Pentagon continues to underestimate the critical role up-armored Humvees play in protecting our troops in iraq and Afghanistan, Senator Bayh said. Every day our troops on the front lines are put in danger unnecessarily because they do not have the protective equipment they need. This funding will help ensure that up-armored Humvees are available to our troops so they can stay safe while accomplishing their mission. The projected funding will also mean continued economic opportunity for the South Bend area. AM General estimates that 2,234 Hoosier jobs will be maintained as a result of this funding. Once appropriated, the funding will be used for the continued procurement of the Up-Armored HIgh Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) for the United States Army. The HMMWV is the premier light tactical vehicle in the world and it provides its crew complete ballistic protection against anti-tank and anti-personnel mines and 360-degree protection against armor-piercing munitions. Every day our troops risk life and limb to protect America, and the government has a solemn responsibility to provide them with the equipment they need to protect themselves, Senator Bayh said.  Senator Bayh is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
