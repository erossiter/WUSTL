Statement from Senator Bayh on Release of BRAC List Washington-- The following is a statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh regarding the release of the Base Re-Alignment and Closure Commission list:  On balance, today's announcement from the military is good news for Indiana. First and foremost, Crane will remain open, and Indiana stands to gain more than 2,000 new jobs because of additional work being moved to Fort Benjamin Harrison and other bases in the state. The entire Indiana delegation worked together to make the strongest case possible for Crane and all our bases, and the new jobs coming to Indiana prove that the Pentagon recognized the value of the work performed here to support our nation's military. While today's decision will bring thousands of new jobs to Indiana, some positions have been lost or marked for realignment. The Hoosiers whose jobs are on that list should know that I will continue working with other members of the Indiana delegation to fight for their jobs and offer whatever support is needed to keep them in our state.
