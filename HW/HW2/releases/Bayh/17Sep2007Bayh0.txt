Senator Bayh Announces $188,000 for Carmel School Safety Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that $188,256 was awarded to the Carmel Police Department in cooperation with Carmel Clay Schools as part of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Secure Our Schools grant.      To create a strong learning environment, children and teachers must feel safe in schools, Senator Bayh said. This grant provided by COPS will help strengthen safety efforts in the Carmel schools and keep the focus on education.  Through the COPS Secure Our Schools program, COPS will provide funding to the Carmel Police Department to purchase new camera security systems for schools in the Carmel district. Senator Bayh has long been an advocate for the federal COPS program, which has provided millions of dollars since 1995 for local law enforcement in Indiana, including funds for 519 more local police officers around the state. Bayh is a cosponsor of the COPS Improvement Act of 2007, which would fully fund the COPS program to $1.15 billion, doubling the current appropriation. Additionally, the bill would set aside $600 million for the purpose of hiring local police officers.
