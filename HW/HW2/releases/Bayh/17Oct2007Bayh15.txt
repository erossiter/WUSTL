Lugar, Bayh Secure Funding for South Bend Emergency Equipment Washington-- U.S. Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh voted to secure $200,000 for the South Bend Police Department. The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate today by a vote of 75-19.   It is essential to Hoosiers that we ensure our law enforcement officers have adequate support, equipment and training, especially in the area of communication capabilities, Lugar said.  These brave men and women fill the invaluable role as first responders and are the backbone of our communities. We owe it to our local law enforcement agencies to make sure they have the resources they need to effectively fight crime and respond to emergencies, Bayh said. In situations where every minute counts, its vital that local police and sheriffs officers have the ability to do what is necessary to keep their communities safe and protect their fellow Hoosiers. Funds will be used to obtain and operate an Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for Latent Palm Prints. Funding was requested by Mayor Stephen Luecke. This project was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 28, 2007, at the request of Lugar and Bayh. This legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. Should the funding be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies. The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
