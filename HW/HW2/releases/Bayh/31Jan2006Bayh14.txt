Bayh Statement on Passing of Coretta Scott King Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today released the following statement regarding the passing of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King:  This morning, America learned that it has lost a true hero, in the passing of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King. Through times of danger and tremendous loss, including the assassination of her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King worked to keep the dream of equality alive and strong for generations of Americans. Millions of people from around the world -- men and women, black and white -- have been inspired by her stoic fight for justice and peace. I join all Americans in keeping her family in our thoughts and prayers.
