Bayh Urges Quick Resolution to Trade Dispute Over Corn-Based Sweeteners Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today called for prompt action from the U.S. trade representative to open Mexican markets to corn-based sweeteners produced by American farmers. In anticipation of Mexican Trade Secretary Garcia de Alba's meeting tomorrow with U.S. Trade Ambassador Schwab, Bayh joined in writing a bipartisan letter urging the Mexican trade secretary to work with the United States to quickly negotiate a settlement on the corn market disagreement. "Our corn farmers are forced to compete with one arm tied behind their backs because of Mexico's refusal to fully open their markets to American exports," Senator Bayh said. "The World Trade Organization ruled that Mexico must allow American exports of high fructose corn syrup, but that ruling is meaningless until U.S. and Mexican trade officials actually reach an agreement to open the Mexican corn market to American farmers." In August 2005, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that Mexico must eliminate its discriminatory tax on U.S. exports of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Enacted in 1998, the tariff eliminated the potential demand for 200 million bushels of American corn and has depressed the price of corn by as much as 10 cents per bushel in the United States. The U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement in October to allow limited exports of HFCS to Mexico. While this progress is encouraging, Mexican trade representatives continue to drag their feet in resolving the dispute at the expense of American farmers. Senator Bayh and his colleagues urged Secretary Alba to build on the excellent trade relationship between the United States and Mexico by reaching an agreement that will benefit industries on both sides of the border.
