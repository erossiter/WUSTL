Senator Bayh's Office Holds November Office Hours in Spencer County Washington-- A representative from the office of U.S. Senator Evan Bayh will be available on November 13th to meet individually with Hoosiers in Spencer County at the Rockport City Hall.     The federal government can sometimes seem far away and disconnected from our everyday lives, Bayh said.  My office can help cut through the red tape, address problems, and make government work for real people. On hand will be Andrew Cullen, Senator Bayhs Regional Director for Southwest Indiana.  Hoosiers who are unable to attend the regional office hours, but need assistance, should contact Andrew Cullen in Bayhs Evansville office. The address is 101 Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, Evansville, Indiana 47708. The phone number is (812) 465-6500. Senator Bayh said some of the most common problems his office helps Hoosiers handle include difficulties with social security and veterans benefits, questions about federal taxes, and concerns about immigration.  In addition, Bayh encourages Hoosiers to stay in touch with his office to register their opinions on congressional issues. On Tuesday, November 13th, Mr. Cullen will be at Rockport City Hall in the City Council Chambers from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM Central Time.
