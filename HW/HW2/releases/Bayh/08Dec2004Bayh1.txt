Statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh on the Passage of the 9-11 Intelligence Reform Bill Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement regarding the passage of the 9-11 Intelligence Reform bill:  This legislation was created as a result of work by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and represents crucial improvements that will help us win the war on terror and strengthen homeland security. Today we have paved the way for real change to take place that will bring about the reforms needed to make all Americans safer at home and abroad. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am especially pleased that we now have the opportunity to greatly strengthen the effectiveness of U.S. intelligence. This could not have been accomplished without the consistent support of the 9-11 Commission and 9-11 families, whom I was proud to work with during this effort. Senator Bayh voted in support of the intelligence reform legislation. Bayh, along with Senators McCain (R-AZ), Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA), were the first to announce legislation that would implement the 9-11 Commission recommendations when the Commission released its findings on July 22nd. Bayh continued working in support of the legislation throughout the fall, urging Senate leadership not to adjourn until the legislation was approved and traveling through Indiana to speak with Hoosiers about the importance of strengthening the nation's intelligence capabilities in the war on terror.
