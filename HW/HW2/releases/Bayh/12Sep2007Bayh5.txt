Bayh Announces $17,000 for Warrick County Public Safety Program Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced a $17,741 grant for the continuation of the Drunk Driving and Drug Court Program through Warrick Superior Court Number One. The U.S. Department of Justice provided the grant as part of its Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program.   These funds are important to not only monitoring offenders, but also to helping make sure they benefit from the rehabilitation programs, while at the same time keeping our communities safe, Senator Bayh said. The Edward Byrne Memorial JAG funds will be used by Drunk Driving and Drug Court to fund part-time home verification officers, their transportation and training. The home verification officers monitor offenders in the community after they have been released as part of the Prisoner Re-entry Initiative.  The Edward Byrne Memorial JAG Program provides support to state and local governments to combat and prevent crime.  The funds can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support and information systems.  A formula based on population and crime statistics is used by the Department of Justice to allocate the money.
