Memorial Day Washington-- "Today, we gather to pay tribute to those Americans, and especially those Hoosiers, who have selflessly served our country as members of our military. As a nation, we recognize those heroic Americans who throughout our country's history have fought for peace and given their life in war. We must also honor those currently serving our nation; they are the ones who continue to sacrifice the most in order to preserve the freedom and democracy that define our nation."
