Lugar, Bayh Secure $1.25 Million for the City of Fort Wayne Washington-- U.S. Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh voted to secure $1.25 million for the Fort Wayne International Airport and the Clinton Street Bridge Replacement.  The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate today by a vote of 88-7.   I am excited to support projects in Fort Wayne, and I am hopeful that the Clinton Street bridge replacement will improve transportation access to the downtown area and spur economic development, said Lugar. These funds will mean significant investments in Fort Waynes transportation infrastructure, both economically and from a safety standpoint, said Bayh.  Moving forward with the steps necessary to meet the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) standards is important to ensuring the Fort Wayne International Airport can continue to serve the people and businesses of Northeast Indiana. $1 million would be used to replace the existing Clinton Street Bridge.  The bridge is a major artery into the downtown area, crossing the St. Marys River at Headwaters Park.   A non-federal match of 20 percent is required.   $250,000 would be used for the Fort Wayne International Airport to update signage.  At the direction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), improved signage is needed for ground and air safety.   Funding was requested by Mayor Graham Richard. This project was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 12, 2007 at the request of Lugar and Bayh.   The legislation heads to a conference with the House of Representatives.  Should projects be retained in the House-Senate conference report, the final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies.  The bill then heads to the President for his signature.
