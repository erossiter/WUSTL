Bayh Announces $116.5 Million to Produce Additional SINCGARS Radios Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that he has helped secure $116.5 million to produce more than 7,150 SINCGARS radios and other hardware necessary to help the military communicate in the midst of battle. The funding was included as part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2007, which was approved by the Senate today. The Senate bill will now be reconciled with the House version in conference committee before being sent to the President's desk for final approval.  It is vital to our troops' safety and our national security that our troops are able to communicate effectively during combat situations, Senator Bayh said. SINCGARS radios play a key role in ensuring that our brave servicemen and women get the information they need to stay safe and get the job done. This funding will help our troops fighting overseas and hardworking Hoosiers in Fort Wayne. The SINCGARS radio communication systems help our troops by providing secure voice and data capabilities. The radios are manufactured at ITT Industries in Fort Wayne, where the funding will protect 576 Hoosier jobs. The radios called for in the Defense Appropriations bill will be used by National Guard and Reserve units in Iraq and Afghanistan who have faced a shortage of high quality, reliable communications equipment, as well as by active duty service members. Over the past six years, Bayh has helped ITT Industries secure nearly $1 billion for the production of SINCGARS radios. Last year, Senator Bayh's work helped secure $300 million to provide American troops with 14,000 SINCGARS radios. Last year, ITT Industries increased production from 1,000 radios a month to nearly 5,000 to fill an emergency supplemental request from the Army. ITT is a world leader in high-technology areas, including space systems and tactical wireless communications systems.
