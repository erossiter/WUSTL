Bayh Announces $176,000 for Warrick County Habitat for Humanity Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh announced today that the USDAs Office of Rural Development has awarded $176,000 to Habitat for Humanity of Warrick County, Inc., as part of the Mutual Self-Help Housing Grant.   The dream of homeownership shouldnt be out of reach for hard-working Hoosiers and their families, Senator Bayh said. With a home comes security, stability and responsibility, which are good for families and for our communities. Habitat for Humanity has a long history of helping remove the hurdles to homeownership and making this piece of the American dream achievable for so many.  The money provided by this grant will be used by Habitat for Humanity of Warrick County, Inc. for staff, administrative, and equipment costs as they oversee the construction of eight new low-income homes for local families.  As part of the mutual self-help project, participants will assist in the construction of their home.
