Bayh Secures Nearly $2 Million for Indiana State Police Forensic Unit Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the Indiana State Police Laboratory Division's Forensic DNA Unit will receive $1,987,000 to improve the unit's ability to use DNA evidence to protect Hoosiers from criminals. The funds will allow the DNA unit to purchase the resources necessary to provide a more timely analysis of DNA evidence to Indiana law enforcement agencies across the state and address the current backlog of time-sensitive DNA work that needs attention.  This funding will provide Indiana State Police and other law enforcement agencies around our state with the tools they need to help capture criminals and ensure safety and peace of mind for all Hoosiers, Senator Bayh said. Not only will new DNA technology help convict criminals and put them behind bars, but it will also allow the Indiana State Police to clear much of their criminal testing backlog and bring justice to those deserving. The Indiana State Police Laboratory Division's Forensic DNA Unit will use the grant to pay for personnel costs, including training and overtime expenditures, equipment, supplies and contractual needs that are essential to addressing the current backlog of DNA casework. The number of cases that the DNA unit handles has continued to grow significantly over the past few years as a result of increased awareness and success among law enforcement agencies. The DNA unit has compiled a convicted offender DNA database, which is used to keep track of the DNA evidence collected during criminal investigations in order to connect criminals with crimes.
