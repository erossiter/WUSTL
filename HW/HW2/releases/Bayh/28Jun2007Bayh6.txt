Statement from Senator Bayh On Today's Senate Immigration Vote Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) issued the following statement today as the Senate voted, 53-46, against proceeding to a final vote on the Senate immigration reform bill: America is a nation of immigrants, and it is true that we must bring the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in this country out of the shadows so they can be put on a lawful path to citizenship. But America is also a nation of laws, and our current immigration system is badly broken. Unfortunately, this deeply flawed plan does not secure our borders, does not respect family unity, and does not deal fairly with the hard-working immigrants who are already living here.  I voted no because the Senates approach is not a long-term answer to this countrys illegal immigration problem. We must find a sustainable solution so that we do not return to this divisive debate again and again every few years. The approach rejected today would have left us with broken borders and broken families, driving our country further apart instead of closer together. Our nations immigrants deserve better, as do all Americans.
