Bayh Applauds New Camry Assembly Line in Lafayette Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today applauded Toyota's decision to locate a new Camry assembly line in Lafayette, which will bring more than 1,000 new jobs to the region. Toyota will now have assembly lines in three Indiana plants -- more than any other state. Production on the Camry assembly line will begin in the spring of 2007. In 1998, then-Governor Bayh succeeded in bringing Indiana's first Toyota plant to Princeton. Today, Toyota Princeton employs 4,800 Hoosiers in two truck plants that turn out 365,000 full-size pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans every year. Senator Bayh made the following statement in response to Toyota's announcement: "This new assembly line is great news for Lafayette and great news for Indiana. It will pump millions of dollars into the state's economy, reinforce our position as one of the top manufacturing states in the country, and best of all, bring good jobs at decent wages to Hoosier families. "One of my most gratifying days as governor was when we brought Toyota to Indiana for the first time. Back in 1998, Toyota picked Indiana because of our world-class workforce and first-class business climate, and I am sure that is why they are locating yet another assembly line here today. Toyota is one of a number of companies from across the globe that have recognized that the talented workforce and quality of life in Indiana make our state the best place for them to grow and succeed. I want to thank each and every Indiana official and the people at Toyota who worked to bring the Camry plant to Indiana."
