Bayh Statement Regarding New Energy Legislation Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today issued the following statement regarding the Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007, which was introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) today:  The legislation introduced today is a good first step toward making America a more energy independent nation, and I am encouraged to see much of my DRIVE Act included in the bill. However, reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil remains one of the great challenges of our generation, and meeting it will require more aggressive steps. The support my bill has received from across the political and geographic spectrum demonstrates that the Senate has the will to pass significant, ambitious energy legislation. I look forward to working with the DRIVE Act cosponsors to strengthen today's bill and ensure that it meets our nation's future energy needs. In January, Senator Bayh introduced his comprehensive energy legislation, called the DRIVE Act, which currently has 24 bipartisan cosponsors. Among the steps outlined in the bill are proposals that would: Increase availability of home-grown, renewable fuels like ethanol, so that every American who wants to use alternative energy is able to do so Provide tax credits for manufacturers who to retool their factories to build hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and flex fuel vehicles Requires federal and state vehicle fleets to cut oil use by 30 percent by 2016 and ensure that 23 percent of their fleets are advanced diesels, hybrids or plug-in hybrids to ensure that government sets an example and spurs the market for energy innovation Encourages the development and mass marketing of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and Lifts the per manufacturer cap on consumer tax credits for the purchase of hybrids and advanced diesels so more consumers receive tax incentives to purchase hybrids.
