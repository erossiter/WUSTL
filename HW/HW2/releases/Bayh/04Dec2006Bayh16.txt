Bayh Encourages Hoosier Seniors to Learn More About Medicare Part D Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today encouraged Hoosier seniors to attend free presentations held throughout Indiana this month designed to help them save money by providing unbiased information they can use to decide which Medicare-sponsored drug plan best suits their individual needs. The presentations will be held at locations throughout Indiana and are offered by the nonprofit Senior Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP). Open enrollment for the Medicare drug benefit began on November 15th and runs through the end of the year.  Choosing the right prescription drug plan is an important decision for Hoosier seniors and these presentations will help give them the tools they need to make an informed choice, Senator Bayh said. Unfortunately, the large number of plans available can make seniors feel overwhelmed. The free, local presentations provided by SHIIP help break through insurance-industry jargon, empowering seniors to choose a plan that gives them the maximum benefit for a minimal cost. SHIIP is not affiliated with any insurance company and does not sell insurance, so representatives are able to provide unbiased advice. SHIIP volunteers will conduct 20 Medicare Part D presentations through out Indiana in December. SHIIP is part of a nationwide federal network of State Health Insurance Assistance Programs. In Indiana, SHIIP is sponsored by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Indiana Department of Insurance.
