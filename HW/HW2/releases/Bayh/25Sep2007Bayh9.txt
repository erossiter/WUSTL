Lugar, Bayh Secure Funding for Infrastructure Improvements to Mount Zion Mill Pond Dam Washington-- U.S. Sens. Dick Lugar and Evan Bayh today voted to authorize funding for the Mount Zion Mill Pond Dam in Fulton County as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Report.  The bill now heads to the President for his signature.    I was pleased to advocate for the authorization of this important project at the request of the Fulton County Commissioners, said Lugar.  Projects for flood damage reduction and mitigation are criticaly important to Hoosiers living near bodies of water and in flood plains.  This funding will assist with an important infrastructure improvement for the residents of Fulton County.  With the recent bridge collapse in Minneapolis, weve been tragically reminded that we must take proactive steps to secure our nations critical infrastructure, Bayh said. Unfortunately, problems with structures like dams and bridges havent always become apparent until its too late. This funding helps us ensure that the necessary steps are being taken to protect Hoosiers from potentially devastating floods in the future. Lugar and Bayh were successful in securing the authorization of this project in the Senate WRDA bill in May of 2007. The Fulton County Commissioners requested funding to repair the dam, which is estimated to cost $1.2 million.  Congressionally authorized funding is required for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete necessary repairs to the dam.   U.S. Rep. Joe Donnelly also supported the inclusion of the project in the conference report. Funds were provided through the Dam Safety Program.  The local community must provide 35 percent of the cost using non-federal matching funds to repair the dam.
