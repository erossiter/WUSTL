U.S. Senator Evan Bayh's Response to the President's State of the Union Address Washington-- The following is a statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh regarding the President's State of the Union address:  The true test of a successful State of the Union is not in the words that are spoken tonight, but in the actions that are taken over the coming weeks and months. Too often in Washington, words are not followed by deeds. That must change. There are big challenges before the country, including the global war on terror, our rising debt and our changing economy. If we do not find a way to meet these, we risk becoming the first generation to leave our children with an America less than the one we inherited. The first step to avoiding this fate is to change the way things work in Washington. Tonight the President spoke a great deal about the rising costs of energy. We must focus on this, but in order to provide help for families who are struggling to pay their bills today, we need more than just words -- we need a real plan. I have introduced bipartisan legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil that provides concrete, measurable steps to address our nation's energy needs. If the President added his support to our legislation, it could be law in a matter of weeks.
