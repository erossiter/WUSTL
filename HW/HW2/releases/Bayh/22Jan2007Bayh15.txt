Bayh Announces $350,000 for Elderly Housing in New Albany Washington- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that the City of New Albany will receive a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help fund services that enable elderly and disabled Hoosiers continue to live independently. The grant is part of HUDs ROSS-Elderly program that provides Public Housing Authorities and nonprofit organizations with resources to support older Americans who want to continue living at home. As a result of grants like this one, older Americans who want to continue to live independently are able to do so without risking their physical safety or financial futures, Senator Bayh said. With the growing costs of health care and prescription drugs, it is important that we do everything we can to help our parents and grandparents find affordable housing options as they grow older. The City of New Albany will use the grant to provide transportation and other resources for the 1,085 unit assisted living program that helps prevent the premature institutionalization of the elderly in New Albany. The program received a similar grant three years ago, and has been able to improve accessibility and case management. The new funds will allow the program to build on the progress it has mad, and expand the services it provides. As a member of both the Special Committee on Aging and the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Senator Bayh believes that every senior deserves access to quality affordable housing. In May, Bayh joined 23 of his Senate colleagues in a letter that outlined the serious lack of available affordable housing for the elderly and urged that the program receive the same level of support it has in past years.
