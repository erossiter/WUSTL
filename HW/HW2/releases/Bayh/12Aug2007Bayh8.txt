Bayh Votes to Authorize $1 Million for Pigeon Creek Greenway Project Washington-- The U.S. Senate today approved a $1 million appropriation for the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage in Vanderburgh County. The funds were included in the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act that passed the Senate by a vote of 88-7, with Senator Evan Bayhs support. The appropriations bill now moves on to a joint House-Senate conference committee for final consideration.  The Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage is a public bicycle-pedestrian path that, once completed, will stretch 42 miles around the city of Evansville. The Pigeon Creek Greenway project is an important addition to the Evansville and Vanderburgh County community, Senator Bayh said. As weve seen in other communities around the state, greenways like this one help spur economic growth, strengthen neighborhoods, provide alternative transportation options, offer good recreation and fitness opportunities, and overall help make our communities a better place to live and work. Evansville has been working to complete the Greenway for decades in order to create a beautiful recreation area, as well as a safe place for cyclists, joggers and walkers to exercise, said Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel. With this money, we will be able to complete the first six miles of the trail plus begin the engineering and design of the second phase. About three miles of the Greenway Passage have already been completed, including the Riverfront Corridor in downtown Evansville and the Middle Levee Corridor along Pigeon Creek. Work on the first of three phases of the Industrial Corridor, which will help complete more than six miles of trail from Evansvilles north side to the Riverfront, is underway.
