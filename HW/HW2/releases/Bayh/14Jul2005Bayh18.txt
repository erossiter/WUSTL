Bayh Co-sponsors Legislation to Add Asian Carp to List of Banned Species Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today joined with other Great Lakes Senators to defend Lake Michigan against invasive species of Asian carp. Asian carp are huge fish that devastate native fish populations by damaging their habitat and consuming vast quantities of food. The Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act, co-sponsored by Bayh, amends the Lacey Act to include Asian carp as injurious wildlife, which would prohibit the intentional introduction of these species into the Great Lakes. "Asian carp are one of the most serious threats to the health of the Great Lakes," Senator Bayh said. "Unless we act soon, they have the potential to devastate the Great Lakes ecosystem. This legislation is an important step towards protecting the Great Lakes from the disastrous invasion of these species and ensuring that the lakes remain in shape for everyone to enjoy." Asian carp are voracious eaters and can grow up to six feet long and weigh 110 pounds. Unfortunately, these species were introduced into the Mississippi River, about 25 miles from Lake Michigan, wreaking havoc on the food supplies available to native fisheries. In order to prevent a similar introduction to the Great Lakes, Senator Bayh's legislation would list Asian carp as injurious wildlife under the Lacey Act. Listing Asian Carp under the Lacey Act would prevent the intentional introduction of these species by banning the interstate transportation of live Asian carp without a permit. Similar measures have been taken for a number of other injurious species, including the mongoose, fruit bats, and the zebra mussel. Senator Bayh has been a steadfast supporter of efforts to defend Lake Michigan from Asian carp and other environmental threats, including urging for the full-funding of the construction of a second dispersal barrier to prevent the species from entering Lake Michigan from the Mississippi River.
