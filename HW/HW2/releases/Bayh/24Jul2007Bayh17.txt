Senator Bayh's Statement on BP Whiting Refinery   Washington-- Following is a statement from U.S. Senator Evan Bayh responding to BPs decision to consider feasible alternatives that would lessen the environmental impact of their expansion plans at the Whiting Refinery:  BPs willingness to discuss feasible alternatives is welcome news. With the technological resources we have available to us today, economic progress and environmental protection can and should go hand-in-hand. The BP Whiting refinery has been an integral part of the local, state and national economy for decades. Its future is important to the continued economic growth of the area and vital to our nations energy independence and our ability to secure our nations oil supply. However, that doesnt have to come at the cost of our environmental resources. Im hopeful that this commitment on the part of BP will mean we can find a resolution that strengthens our economy and maintains the integrity of our air and drinking water, along with the health of Lake Michigan.
