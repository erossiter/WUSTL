Bayh Supports R Tax Credit to Help Innovative Hoosier Businesses Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh voted in favor of extending more than a dozen tax credits, including one encouraging greater research and development, that were in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 passed by the Senate late last night. If Congress had not passed the legislation before adjourning, taxpayers would not have been able to claim them when filing their taxes next April. The legislation will now go to the President for his approval.  In today's economy, American businesses must constantly innovate if they are to remain competitive with companies in Europe, Asia and around the world, Senator Bayh said. By helping businesses with the cost of research and development, we are ensuring that our companies stay on the cutting edge and investing in a brighter future for our businesses and workers. Language in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the RD tax credit through 2007 and made it retroactive for 2006, since the previous extension expired in 2005. The credit is available for qualified research, or research that is experimental, designed to advance technological knowledge and capability and is aimed at producing some new product or improving an existing product. In 2003, business claimed $5.3 billion in RD credit on their tax returns. Bayh, a member of the Small Business Committee, has consistently supported extending the RD tax credit and has cosponsored legislation to make it permanent and expand it to include small businesses and start-ups as well. Since it was first offered in 1981, the RD tax credit has been extended 11 times.
