Bayh Commemorates Hispanic Heritage Month Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today recognized National Hispanic Heritage Month, and joined millions of Americans across the nation in commemorating the contributions that Hispanics have made to our nation throughout history. "The Hispanic community has enriched America and Indiana through its important contributions in every arena of society," Senator Bayh said. "Every day, Hispanics make our communities stronger by serving as police officers, fire fighters, teachers and public servants. Today, more than 200,000 Hispanic soldiers are serving in the armed forces, fighting to protect America and American values. In Indiana and across the country, the contributions and culture of the Hispanic community enrich and strengthen the American community." During Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15th to October 15th, the nation's 43 million Hispanics, along with all Americans, will celebrate the Hispanic community's important place in America's history and in our future. These weeks were chosen because the anniversary of the independence of seven Latin American countries is celebrated during this time: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua on September 15, Mexico on September 16 and Chile on September 18. Congress has played a critical role in Hispanic Heritage Month. In 1968 Congress authorized Democratic President Johnson's proclamation of National Hispanic Heritage Week, and in 1988 the celebration was expanded to 31 days. Since his days as governor, Senator Bayh has worked to ensure that opportunities exist for all Hoosiers by eliminating financial barriers to college, creating and protecting Hoosier jobs and expanding access to quality health care and housing. Every year, Bayh holds a Hispanic Roundtable with Hispanic community leaders to get their feedback and make sure that he hears their viewpoints on important policies.
