Bayh Celebrates National American Indian Heritage Month Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh issued the following statement in the commemoration of November as National American Indian Heritage Month:   As our nation recognizes the contributions of the approximately 4.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, including more than 10,000 here in Indiana, we celebrate the richness and diversity of American Indian and Alaska Native cultures and traditions, as well as the many contributions they have made to our country. In every facet of our progress as a society, from our economy and politics, to our sciences and arts, Native American Indians have contributed their talent, vision and hard work to build a stronger and more prosperous nation.  Across the country, American Indians and Alaska Natives businesses generated more than $26.9 billion in revenues last year alone and employ approximately 191,300 people.  In Indiana over 2,000 businesses are owned by American Indians and Native Alaskans. We honor the past sacrifices and current commitment of our American Indian and Alaska Native service members. Their courage and dedication is inspiring.  Indiana and the United States are strengthened by the richness of its diversity.  I am committed to supporting and protecting the rights of American Indians and Alaska Natives and to supporting their pursuit of a better future for their families. We will continue to fight for increased economic and educational opportunities, improved health care access, and protection of the civil rights of indigenous people and for every American.
