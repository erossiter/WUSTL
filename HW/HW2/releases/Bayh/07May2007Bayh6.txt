Bayh Announces $746,000 for Rural Development in Kennard Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced $746,000 in new funding from the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Fund to help the town of Kennard strengthen its sewage system's infrastructure, which is currently unable to sustain high levels of rain or snow in a short period of time without experiencing problems with sewage overflow. The Kennard Town Council has chosen to make improvements to the existing sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment plant. Some of the funds will be used to reduce storm drainage inflow into local rivers and lakes.  The improvements made to Kennard's storm drainage and water treatment system will lower the risk of sewage overflow, Senator Bayh said. Storm drainage and sewage treatment is a major public health issue facing our water sources today. We must make a determined effort to preserve these sources so that Hoosier families can have access to healthy drinking water and safe recreational sites.  The grant will provide close to half of the total funding needed to fortify the storm drainage system, including the improvements needed by the wastewater treatment plant. These improvements will bring Kennard one step closer to being in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations making them eligible for a wider range of state funding.  Senator Bayh has continuously fought to preserve Indiana's water sources. As governor, he supported the Water Shortage Task Force, which has ensured that in times of drastic water shortages the state's sources are not depleted beyond repair. Also, Senator Bayh has played an integral part in the expansion of parks across the state, protecting Indiana's beaches, lakes, and rivers from overcrowding and pollution.
