Bayh: Julia Carson 'Has Left a Great Legacy' Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh released the following statement on the death of Congresswoman Julia Carson:   Julia Carson overcame much and accomplished much, and devoted her life to helping other people do the same. She was elected to important public offices, but never forgot who she was, where she came from or who she was there to serve. She had a great sense of humor and a great sense of style, both of which are all too often lacking in public life. She has left a great legacy and I will miss her.
