Senator Bayh Announces $1.7 Million for Indiana Health Centers Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh today announced that more than $1.7 Million has been awarded to Hoosier health centers as part of the HHS Health Resources and Services Administrations (HRSA) Health Center Initiative.  The grants are part of the Health Centers Initiative to expand health coverage to low-income and underserved counties and are financed by congressionally appropriated funds. With the funds, the centers will provide primary and preventative care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay; the medical charges are determined by an income-based sliding scale. Centers receiving funds are:  Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center will receive $600,000   North Shore Health Centers, Inc., $233,333 for services in Porter County  Family Health Center of Clark County, Inc., $520,079   Hilltop Community Health Center, Inc., $300,000 for services in LaPorte County  Indiana Primary Health Care Association will receive $80,000 to plan and develop a health center for Carroll, Newton, and Posey Counties. These funds will help ensure that many Hoosiers who are in need of health care wont have to choose between getting treated and getting by, and that they are able to access that care close to home, Senator Bayh said. As part of the Public Health Services Act, HRSA provides funding to health centers in counties that meet a minimum level of poverty and show a need for primary care providers. Approximately 25 percent of the counties receiving money have 100,000 people are more; the other 75 percent of counties are considered rural, with a population of less than 100,000.
