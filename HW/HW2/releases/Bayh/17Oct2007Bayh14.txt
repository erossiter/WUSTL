Bayh Secures Funding for Lake County Sheriff's Office Washington-- U.S. Senator Evan Bayh voted to secure $500,000 for the Lake Country Sheriffs Office to be used in updating its helicopter fleet. The funding was approved as a part of the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations Bill which passed in the Senate yesterday by a vote of 75-19.   It is important that we provide local law enforcement agencies with the resources to effectively fight crime and respond to emergencies, Senator Bayh said. Over the last several years, the role weve asked our local law enforcement to fulfill has grown significantly to include homeland security responsibilities. These funds for the Lake County Sheriffs Office will help ensure the safety of not just Lake County citizens, but also support the surrounding communities throughout the region.   The funds will be used toward the purchase of two helicopters to improve homeland security, law enforcement and emergency response capabilities in Lake County and the surrounding area. According to the sheriffs office, the helicopters currently in use by the Sheriffs Office are from 1977. The agency often assists other law enforcement agencies, including those in Northwest Indiana, Northeast Illinois and Southern Lake Michigan. This is great news for the people of Lake County, said Sheriff Roy Dominguez. These important resources will help us update our aviation fleet and ensure we have the capability to meet the public safety and homeland security needs for Northwest Indiana and surrounding area. This funding was included by the Senate Appropriations Committee in the CJS appropriations bill at the request of Senator Bayh. The bill now heads to a conference with the House of Representatives. The final legislation is voted on again by both congressional bodies.  The bill then heads to the President for his consideration.
