Bayh Cosponsors DREAM Act to Provide Educational Opportunities for Immigrant Children Washington-- Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) today announced his co-sponsorship of legislation aimed at making a college education more affordable and more attainable for many undocumented immigrant students living in the United States.    The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act of 2007 would create new opportunities for alien minors to find a legal path to citizenship. The DREAM Act would allow certain alien minors to apply for temporary legal status and eventually attain lawful permanent residency provided that they obtain either an associates degree or serve in the U.S. military.   The DREAM Act is targeted to help students who want to further their education and who believe in hard work and responsible citizenship, Senator Bayh said.  This legislation gives young people the chance to take responsibility for their legal status and receive the higher education that will help them realize the American Dream. The Dream Act would authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to change the legal status of alien minors who show good moral character, have no criminal background and meet other requirements.  Alien students who have lived in the United States for five years, entered before their 16th birthday, meet various DHS conditions, and have received a high school diploma or been admitted to a post-secondary institution would become eligible for conditional permanent resident status. Senator Bayh has co-sponsored the DREAM Act in the last three Congresses. He joins 25 other senators in the 110th Congress in co-sponsoring this legislation, including Indiana Senator Richard Lugar and Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, the author of the bill.
