WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today announced that the Senate has passed an amendment (S.A.2261) permitting qualified Reservists who have been forced from military service because of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and other force shaping initiatives to retain the use of their Montgomery G.I. Bill educational benefits following separation from the Selected Reserve. The amendment, introduced by Senator Inhofe, will extend the eligibility period for qualifying Reservists affected by force shaping measures until September 30th, 2014 and is now included in the Senate National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. 

This legislation will ensure that the Department of Defense keeps its end of the deal with those who volunteered to protect our country, but through no fault of their own, will no longer be able to continue serving in the military, Senator Inhofe said. We have offered this type of transition assistance to Reservists before, and it makes good sense to offer it again in light of this BRAC round. 

Senator Inhofes legislation offers qualified Reservists a resurrected provision of the Reserve Transition Assistance Program offered under previous BRAC rounds.
