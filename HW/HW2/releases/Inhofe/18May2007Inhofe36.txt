WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement regarding the upcoming immigration reform debate. 

While I do not yet know all the specifics of this cumbersome, 1000 page bill, initial reports indicate that this legislation will include some form of amnesty, and, as I have long said, I will not support any legislation that allows illegal immigrants to shortcut the current citizenship process.
