WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today introduced an amendment (S.Amdt.2796) to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill to prohibit the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from using any funds in FY08 to implement the Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS). The FAA has expedited their schedule for transition to this new system without giving sufficient time to plan for its implementation or providing adequate explanation for why the existing system is insufficient. By prohibiting the FAA from using any money in FY08 to implement ATCOTS, Senator Inhofes amendment would allow for additional time to examine the current system and determine where it needs to be changed.

Despite assurances to members of the Oklahoma delegation that there would be a multi-year transition to ATCOTS, the FAA has recently announced that its new training system could be fully implemented within one year, even though there is no clear transition plan for the system. There has also been no assurance that the millions of taxpayer dollars already invested in the FAA training Academy in Oklahoma City will continue to be used. 

I do not believe there has been sufficient examination of the cost/benefits of this new training program. Rather, there has been a rush to fix a system that no one has been able to explain how or if it is broken. My amendment slows the process down so that Congress can have more time to examine the shortfalls of the current training system and how the proposed ATCOTS system will improve training for air traffic controllers, if in fact it will. 

I am in my 51st year of aviation and have a great deal of respect for these controllers. I know the importance of making sure their training is perfect  important enough to take the time to adequately review the process rather than hastily implementing a new system. 

Currently, eligible air traffic control candidates attend the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City for twelve weeks to learn fundamentals of the airway system, FAA regulations, controller equipment and aircraft performance characteristics. Upon graduation from the Academy, candidates are assigned to an air traffic control facility as developmental controllers where they receive training on specific controller positions.
