WASHINGTON  Senator Inhofe (R-OK) today called on Senate Democrats to support Republican efforts to guarantee funding for our troops in Iraq: 

This stunt of calling Senators back on the weekend for a non-binding vote is indicative of the Democrats leadership and their agenda, all show and no substance. Democrats are pursuing a slow bleed process to gradually reduce funding for our troops  this is a slap in the face to our soldiers.

The Democrat leadership refuses to vote on a resolution that would guarantee funding for our troops in Iraq, Inhofe said. We cannot ask our men and women in uniform to fight a war without the full support of the U.S. government. I want to echo the comments my friend and unmatched patriot Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas delivered on the House floor yesterday, Our troops - and their families - want, need and deserve the full support of the country - and the Congress. Moms and dads watching the news need to know that the Congress will not leave their sons and daughters in harm's way without support.

The Democrat leadership has insisted on symbolic votes while ignoring calls within its own party to cut off funding for troops in Iraq. 


The New York Times stated in an editorial today that, We fear that clever maneuvers like the one proposed by Representative John Murtha, reportedly with the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to dress up a reduction in troop strength as a support the troops measure wont help contain the war or make American troops safer. [New York Times, editorial, On to the Hard Part on Iraq, Feb. 17, 2007]. 



The New York Times editorial continued, It takes no great courage or creativity for a politician to express continuing support for the troops and opposition to a vastly unpopular and unpromising military escalation. [New York Times, editorial, On to the Hard Part on Iraq, Feb. 17, 2007]. 



The Washington Post reported that the Democrat leadership in the House is solidifying around a plan to slowly choke off the war. [Washington Post, GOP Looks Beyond War Measure to Fight on Funding, Feb. 15, 2007]
