WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla) today praised the passing of S.1820 by the U.S. House of Representatives naming a Tulsa, Oklahoma Post Office, located at 6110 East 51st Place, the Dewey F. Bartlett Post Office. 

Dewey F. Bartlett exemplifies the Oklahoma spirit of innovative leadership, hard work, and public service, Inhofe said. Dewey F. Bartlett shared my dedication to a strong national defense. We also shared the goals of advocating common sense Oklahoma values including less government bureaucracy, less regulation, lower taxes and fiscal responsibility. I am proud to honor his service to our country and commemorate an outstanding citizen by naming a post office in Tulsa, Oklahoma the Dewey F. Bartlett Post Office. I hope that in so doing, future generations will be challenged by his example.

Dewey Follett Bartlett, a decorated veteran, made his home in Tulsa in 1945, shortly after his military service in World War II, to assume a managing role in his familys business. He went on to display outstanding public service, serving as both the Governor of Oklahoma from 1967-1971 and as a U.S. Senator from 1973-1979. The measure was co-sponsored by Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla).
