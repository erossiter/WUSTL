WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today received the 2006 Hero of the Taxpayer Award for his continued efforts to protect and support the taxpayers of Oklahoma and the nation. The award was sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington-based nonprofit organization dedicated to representing Americas taxpayer. 

I wish to thank Americans for Tax Reform for this award. No other group in America needs more support and representation than the American taxpayer, and Americans for Tax Reform continues to provide an invaluable service. I look forward to continuing to work for lower taxes, a strong economy, and keeping the federal budget out of the family budget.
