WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement on Senator Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) passing: 

Craig Thomas and I served together in the U.S. House of Representatives and started together in the U.S. Senate where we were friends and most recently colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He was a strong voice of reason in this chamber and I feel fortunate to have had him as a friend. Today the Senate has lost a great leader and one of the last true cowboys.
