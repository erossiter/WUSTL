WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement on his nay vote on the Ethics Reform Bill (S.1) which passed the Senate today (83-14). 

In January, the Senate passed by a huge margin the most drastic ethics and lobbying overhaul in years, Senator Inhofe said. Unfortunately, it seems the Democrats have been using the same tactics that eventually brought down the Immigration bill, crafting and changing legislation in closed-door meetings and short-cutting traditional Senate procedure and the conference process. The fact is this bill is significantly different than the bill 92 members of the Senate agreed to in January. 

The original Ethics bill included my legislation which called Senators to task for their Vote no and take the dough pay-raise hypocrisy, where members vote against cost of living increases, yet invariably take the pay increase when it is approved. My legislation would have changed the system so that a vote against a pay raise really means no pay raise. This provision is just one of many that would have increased transparency in government and reduced Washingtons culture of hypocrisy, yet it was stripped from the final bill in an attempt by the Democrats to water-down the legislation. 

How much longer will the Democrats hide behind their claims of being the most ethical party while pushing through reforms crafted in the shadows of Congress?
