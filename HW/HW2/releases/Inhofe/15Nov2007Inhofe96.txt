WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) today announced the passage of their resolution (S.Res.377) honoring the centennial of Oklahoma statehood on November 16, 2007. 

Ours is a unique state, rich with common-sense and dependable people, as well as an abundance of natural resources, Senator Inhofe said. Oklahoma serves as one of the largest producers of natural gas, wheat and cattle, and has more miles of freshwater shoreline than any other state. We also have five successful military installations, all of which were expanded when bases around the country closed in recent BRAC rounds. Oklahoma has made significant advancements in its 100 years of statehood, making us competitive in the global economy while maintaining those salt of the earth characteristics which have set our state apart since its inception.
 
As we reflect upon our centennial, its important to note the profound impact Oklahoma has had on the nation, Senator Coburn said. When the state was born 100 years ago it represented hope to the pioneers who settled here eager for a fresh start. Their entrepreneurship, innovation, work-ethic and faith is still found today in a new generation of Oklahomans who are sure to make their mark on the world. The state also has made contributions to culture, politics, sports and entertainment that far surpass its geographical size by generously lending America our sports stars, Miss Americas, astronauts, humorists, authors, war heroes and statesmen. And as a state deeply rooted in faith, Oklahoma showed the nation and the world the power of a community rallying together to help neighbors and strangers alike during times of tragedy. As we celebrate our first centennial and look forward to the next we can be confident this grand land will continue to provide inspiration and innovation.
