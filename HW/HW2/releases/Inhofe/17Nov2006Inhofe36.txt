WASHINGTON, D.C.  In his latest effort to curtail careless federal spending, U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today introduced two bills intended to reduce the spending of tax dollars in Washington. Inhofes Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2006 (S.4062) proposes to cap all federal discretionary, non-defense and non-trust fund spending at current year levels. Though Inhofe pushed this same initiative twice before in the form of Senate amendments, this is the first time he has introduced it as a stand-alone bill.

Capping federal spending at the current years levels seems to be the only way to control this Congress spending habits while not jeopardizing national security, Inhofe said. My simple one-line bill ensures that we will continue to fund defense as needed, but other discretionary spending will be held at fiscal year 2007 levels. I have proposed this before and I now renew the call for my colleagues to support this measure. My legislation reads, Beginning with Fiscal Year 2007 and thereafter, non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not exceed the previous fiscal years levels  without a 2/3 vote.

Additionally, Inhofes Exit the OECD Act of 2006 (S.4048) bill targets a Paris-based international bureaucracy called the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, much like the United Nations, draws much of their funding from U.S. taxpayers while developing and promoting tax policies that will harm the United States. Both the UN and the OECD have proposed the creation of Global Taxes to be levied on U.S. citizens and corporations, something Inhofe views as infringement on sovereign nations. 

The OECD, which receives 25% of its budget from the U.S., has used our taxpayers money to encourage and support higher taxes on the American Taxpayer; its ridiculous that we would support such a group, Inhofe said. This bill is similar to my initiative to withhold U.S. funding from the United Nations and the OECD unless they abandon the promotion of Global Taxes. Our governments only leverage for oversight of the U.N. and the OECD is to control the flow of our financial support. I refuse to allow American tax dollars to support organizations that aim to hurt the U.S. Taxpayer, as is certainly the case with the OECD.

Inhofes OECD bill reads, Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be expended to fund activities or projects undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Copies of both Inhofe bills are attached to this transmission.
