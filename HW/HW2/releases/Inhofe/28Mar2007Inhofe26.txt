WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today accepted the Taxpayers Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) for his continued efforts to protect and support the taxpayers of Oklahoma and the nation. Sen. Inhofe was ranked 4th among senators and was the highest ranked member of the Oklahoma congressional delegation for the year 2006 for his commitment to reducing federal spending, taxes, and debt. Sen. Inhofe was one of only 61 members in both the House and the Senate to receive the NTUs Taxpayers Friend award this year.

I wish to thank the National Taxpayers Union for this award, Inhofe said. No other group in America needs more support and representation than the American taxpayer, and the National Taxpayers Union continues to provide an invaluable service. I look forward to continuing to work for lower taxes, a strong economy, and keeping the federal budget out of the family budget.

John Berthoud, President of the National Taxpayers Union, stated, While many Members of Congress talk about reducing the size of government, Senator Inhofe backed up those words with votes. His pro-taxpayer score is one of the best in the entire Senate, and proves that he is a consistent and effective ally in the battle to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.

The National Taxpayers Union was founded in 1969 to work for lower taxes, smaller government, and more economic freedom at all levels. Unlike other organizations, NTUs annual rating does not simplistically focus on only a handful of votes. Instead, NTUs rating system is based on every roll call vote that affects fiscal policy. For this reason, it has received praise from both Democrats and Republicans. To see NTUs 2006 rankings, please click
