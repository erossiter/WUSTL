WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) introduced his Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act (S.1832) that aims to finance the repair and future maintenance of lands and buildings on Oklahomas Fort Reno by developing the oil and gas deposits beneath the property. 

Fort Reno is an Oklahoma landmark in desperate need of reparation and preservation to ensure its survival for future generations, Inhofe said. This legislation will provide a revenue-neutral, non-appropriated source of funding adequate to restore the historical buildings of Fort Reno. 

This bill authorizes the development of the oil and gas that lies beneath Fort Renos 6,737 acres and places those funds in a special account in the U.S. Treasury to be utilized for restoration and maintenance of those facilities. These funds will also be used to assist with handling visitors to the fort, historic interpretation and related activities. The remaining funds will be used to pay down the national debt. 

Senator Inhofe has been an active supporter of Fort Reno having secured a Save Americas Treasures Grant of $300,000 to assist a local historical organization with the costs of stabilization of exteriors on those deteriorating buildings that are most in need of renovation. In fiscal year 2004, Inhofe also arranged for an appropriation of $2.1 million for construction of two greenhouses for use in research on forage grasses that is conducted by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at the Fort Reno site. 

The Fort Reno Mineral Leasing Act is fully supported by state legislators, local municipalities, the Chamber of Commerce, farm groups, the USDA, and the ARS Administrator at Fort Reno. 

Fort Reno was established as a frontier cavalry post in 1874, and it played a key role in the settlement of the west. It is a historic site of National significance and it is listed on the National Register of Historic places. Over 9,000 visitors view the fort each year. 

Senator Inhofes legislation is under the consideration of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
