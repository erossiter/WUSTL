WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement today regarding the Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act (H.R. 4343), which passed the Senate last night by Unanimous Consent and the House by 390-0 on Tuesday.

Final passage of my language ending the FAAs Age 60 Rule is a victory for our most experienced pilots who are suffering under the current arbitrary age standards, Senator Inhofe said. Every day the Age 60 Rule remains in effect, America loses more than five experienced pilots - many of them veterans. 

The Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act instructs the FAA to immediately end the Age 60 Rule and allows American pilots to fly until age 65. It also allows unions and companies to establish benefit agreements so that pilots can still retire at 60 if they wish. 

As an active commercially-rated pilot, I can tell you that my experience alone has seen me through more than one crisis while flying. I say with firm conviction that - as long as a pilot passes FAA Medical Certification - the more years that pilot has flown, the safer the passenger. 

After almost 5 years of working to pass this legislation into law, I am pleased to finally see our most qualified pilots granted the same rights and privileges as foreign pilots. I urge the President to sign this legislation into law as soon as possible.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Age 60 Rule, adopted in 1959 with no scientific evidence to support it, came under increased scrutiny after the adoption by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of a new international retirement standard of age 65 on November 23, 2006. This new standard resulted in foreign pilots being allowed to fly within U.S. airspace while American pilots of the same age have been denied the same right. 

Senator Inhofe has introduced similar legislation in the past three Congresses, including the Freedom to Fly Act (S.65) earlier this year.
