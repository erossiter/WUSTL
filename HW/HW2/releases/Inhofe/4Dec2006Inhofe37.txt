WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement today regarding tomorrows Senate vote to approve $4.5 billion in agricultural disaster aid.

Sen. Conrads (R-ND) budget-busting $4.5 billion proposal is enormous and pure politics. Congressman Lucas (R-OK) has approached this issue much more responsibly with a competing House bill. 

Many are unaware that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill already contains $4 billion for disaster aid. I believe it would be careless to support any increased spending beyond this amount unless we first establish spending offsets.

It is my understanding that Sen. Conrads bill primarily covers disasters from 2005, however most Oklahoma farmers were worst hit in 2006. Rep. Lucas bill covers disasters in 2005 and 2006 for $700 million less than the Senate proposal and $1.3 billion less than Sen. Conrads amendment. Frank Lucas and I are very close to the Oklahoma agricultural community and it is our sense that his bill will serve Oklahoma farmers in need while saving hundreds of millions in tax dollars. 

I will continue to work to pass the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill using Congressman Lucas House language.
