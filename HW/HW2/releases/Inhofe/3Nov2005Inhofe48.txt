WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe today claimed partial victory in the continued battle against rampant federal spending. Inhofe proposed a simple, one sentence amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Bill (S.1932) stating, Beginning with Fiscal Year 2007 and thereafter, non-defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not exceed the previous fiscal years levels  without a 2/3 vote. Inhofes amendment was defeated by a (32-67) vote today, yet the Senator remains committed to attaching the amendment to as many bills as necessary until successful. Senator Inhofe made the following statement after todays Senate vote. 

This very simple amendment serves as a certain means for limiting federal spending and today we came close to victory. We are only 19 Senators short of limiting the governments out of control spending and I am confident that with the publics help we will get those additional votes soon. 

Simply put, my amendment states that every Senate appropriations bills that fit into this category cannot exceed last years funding level. Last week we passed the Labor, Health and Human Services (LHHS) Appropriation Bill by a very large margin. This is a prime example of how spending in Washington has gotten out of control as that bill increased the spending on [LHHS] by $107 billion over the previous year. Under my amendment that would not be possible without a 2/3 majority. 

Sadly last week only myself and one other Republican voted against the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. 

We must force fiscal discipline in Washington and I will continue to offer this amendment until we have built the necessary public pressure to get the additional 19 votes we need. I am confident that will happen soon.
