WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim M. Inhofe today lauded an Oklahoma victory in the Tax Extenders Act of 2006 (HR.6111) that passed the Senate early this morning by a 79-9 vote. Inhofe highlighted his successful initiatives to reauthorize Accelerated Depreciation on Indian lands and the Generalized System of Preferences trade program.

Reauthorization for Special Accelerated Depreciation on Indian Lands: This depreciation provides an approximately 40% shorter recovery period for qualified commercial property.

Several of the businesses that weve recently attracted to Oklahoma have come because of this provision, Inhofe said. Its a major draw for capital intensive businesses to locate in the state.

The incentive provides for a special accelerated depreciation schedule for property used predominantly in the active conduct of a trade or business on Indian reservations or on former Indian lands in Oklahoma. Approximately 70% of Oklahomas geographical area qualifies for this depreciation. The bill includes a two-year extension for the provision that expired at the end of last year. Congress has reauthorized the provision several times since its original enactment in 1993. On September 20, 2005, Inhofe introduced S.1728 to permanently authorize the benefit.

Reauthorization for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP): The GSP program is an effort of the United States and 19 other industrialized countries to aid developing countries through increased market access, which in turn fosters industrial development and enhanced opportunities for prosperity in some of the least-advantaged countries in the world.

Workers, consumers, and businesses in nearly 120 countries including our own will benefit from the continuation of this program, which affects the price of over 5,600 finished and unfinished goods, Inhofe said. As someone who frequently works to assist those who face the direst of circumstances in the poor countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, I feel that we must reauthorize this program as a key component of our efforts to fight poverty worldwide. 

While originally developed as a trade program to aid developing countries, GSP over the past 32 years has become an important component of the U.S. economy. American consumers enjoy lower prices on diverse products from oil to flashlights to broom-handles to cheese. Senator Inhofe introduced S.3933 on September 25, 2006 to reauthorize the GSP program.
