WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) announced today that two fire departments in Oklahoma will receive firefighter grant awards, including the Hugo Fire Department (Hugo) and the Choctaw Fire Department (Choctaw).

These grants help provide the tools and resources necessary to protect the health and safety of Oklahoma firefighters and the Oklahomans they serve and protect, Inhofe said. These awards will be used to increase the firefighting operations, fund fire fighter health and safety programs, acquire new fire apparatus, enhance EMS programs, and conduct fire prevention and safety programs. 

The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. The program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

The grant amounts breakdown as follows:

Department Grant

Hugo Fire Department  (Hugo)   $65,464
Choctaw Fire Department (Choctaw) $72,523
