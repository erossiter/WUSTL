WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today announced that his amendment transferring three retired C-130E aircraft to the Government of Iraq (S.Amdt. 2293) has been included into the managers package of the Defense Authorization Bill. The amendment, agreed to by unanimous consent, was requested by Secretary Gates, General Pace, and Admiral Fallon. 

The acceptance of my amendment will improve the war-fighting capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces by increasing their operational and logistical potential and reducing the negative impact of maintenance, Senator Inhofe said. This transfer doubles the size of the current Iraqi C-130 fleet and will support the continued transition of security functions to the Iraqi Security Forces. 

The three aircraft were retired under the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364).
