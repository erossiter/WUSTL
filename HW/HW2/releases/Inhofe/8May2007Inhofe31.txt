WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today introduced his Official English Act of 2007 (S.1335) making English the national language of the United States, except where use of another language is authorized or provided by law. Inhofes bill aims to save $1-2 billion each year in taxpayer dollars currently used to provide federal forms and perform services in languages other than English.

I have long said that this nation of immigrants and settlers requires an official language, Inhofe said. Last year an overwhelming majority of the Senate agreed with my amendment to make English the official language and I think this year we will command another majority should this bill receive a roll-call vote.

This is not just about preserving our culture and heritage, but also about bettering the odds for our nations newest potential citizens. As the President has said, English allows newcomers to go from cleaning offices to running offices. I could not agree more.

Recent polling established that a diverse majority, 84 percent of all Americans, agree with making English the national language, including 71 percent of Hispanics. Polling also concludes that 92 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats and Independents all support recognizing English as the national language.

Currently 29 states and 51 countries have declared English as their official language, but not the United States.

A recent Zogby poll shows widespread U.S. support in making English the national language. Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget estimates that it costs taxpayers $1-2 billion annually to provide language assistance under President Clintons Executive Order 13166 that created the entitlement to services and documents provided in languages other than English.
