WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement in response to todays vote to invoke cloture on the 2007 Immigration Reform Bill which passed 64-35:

I am very disappointed in the outcome of todays vote. A vote for this motion to invoke cloture is just one step closer to a vote for amnesty. Thirty hours of debate and a limited amount of amendments will not change the underlying nature of this bill. I have long said that I will not support any measure that allows illegal immigrants to shortcut the current path to citizenship and I will continue to fight to expose the flaws in this bill, helping to defeat this egregious gift of amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants. 

Its time for the Senate to listen to their constituents. The American public does not want this so-called immigration fix. What they want and what they deserve is for the federal government to secure the borders and enforce the rule of law  both of which can be achieved without an additional 800 pages of new legislation.
