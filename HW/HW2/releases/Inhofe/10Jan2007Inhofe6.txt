WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) made the following statement in response to President Bushs address to the nation.

The President made it very clear tonight, winning is an absolute, we cannot lose in Iraq. We have to understand the ramifications for the United States in this fight: we either win over there or we lose here. 

One of the most important points of the Presidents speech tonight was not just how American forces are going to change but how the Iraqis are adapting to meet the challenge. For instance, today we learned that the Iraqi government will begin pursuing all insurgents regardless of sectarian or religious affiliation. This is a positive change in the Iraqi governments practice.

Securing Baghdad is a primary concern. Dividing Baghdad into nine zones of Iraqi-led troops bolstered by coalition soldiers is a significant commitment and a step in the right direction on the part of the Iraqi government.

I was pleased to hear that the President will increase by 4,000 the number of Marines in the Al Anbar province. I have visited Fallujah in the Al Anbar province and witnessed the success of U.S. Marines embedded with Iraqi units. Fallujah has long been the model for embedding troops and they will now apply that model to the rest of Iraq.

The bottom line is that tonight the President offered an extensive plan for success in Iraq. The United States will be successful not only because of the resolve of the Administration, but also because of the cooperation of the Iraqis in wanting to achieve victory.
