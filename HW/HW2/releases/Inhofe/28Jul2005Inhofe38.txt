WASHINGTON, D.C.-Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today praised the agreement reached by Senate and House conferees on the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The legislation has been filed in the House of Representatives and once passed will move to the Senate for consideration and approval. 
Im very pleased with the agreement we have reached with House conferees, and am optimistic that SAFETEA-LU will pass quickly in both chambers and proceed to the Presidents desk, Senator Inhofe said. As much as this is legislation that will significantly boost and enhance our nations transportation system, it is also a jobs bill that will create employment opportunities for millions of Americans. According to the Department of Transportation, every $1 billion of federal money invested in highway improvements creates more than 47,500 jobs. That $1 billion also yields $500 million in new orders for the manufacturing sector and $500 million spread throughout other sectors of the economy. A safe and effective transportation infrastructure will only help grow our economy, and Im delighted were on the verge of delivering this important victory to Oklahomans and all Americans.
This bill is historic for Oklahoma. I am extremely proud of the increase in funding the state will receive from this legislation. Under the formulas, our bill includes about 32 percent more funding over the previous highway authorization bill. As Ive often said, one of my top priorities as Chairman of the EPW Committee has been to increase the rate of return for donor states such as Oklahoma. This highway bill increases Oklahomas formula rate of return to 92 cents per dollar in 2008.
The Senate version of the highway bill passed by an 89 to 11 vote in May. Senator Inhofe managed its consideration on the Senate floor. The SAFETEA-LU conference report will now move to the House and Senate floors where it is expected to be passed prior to the August recess and signed by President Bush shortly after.
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy for Users:

Provides $244 billion in guaranteed spending over the 2005-2009 period ($286.4 billion including 2004) for maintenance, and improvement of the nations roads, bridges, mass transit, and safety that creates millions of job opportunities across the country. 
Includes over 30 percent more funding over TEA-21 levels (current law). 
Provides a rate of return phased in to 92 percent by 2008 for donor states. 
Provides more than a 39 percent average annual increase over TEA-21 levels for Indian reservation roads and bridges, including new funding categories and increased flexibility, for which Oklahoma tribes are among the largest recipients. 
Consolidates existing safety programs into a new core Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) to provide increased funding and greater flexibility to states. The HSIP is designed to meet the growing safety needs and fatality and injury rates in each state through a strategic highway safety plan. 
Senator Inhofe, working with Sen. Coburn (R-Okla.), restored Congress original intent by inserting language correcting ambiguous wording in past legislation that has been at issue surrounding the Oklahoma Loyal Shawnee tribes ability to place land into trust.
