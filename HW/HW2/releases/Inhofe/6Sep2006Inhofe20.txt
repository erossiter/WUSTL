September 6, 2006
WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla) along with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla) today introduced legislation (S.3845) to name the Commerce, Oklahoma Post Office, located at 301 Commerce Street, the Mickey Mantle Post Office. Mickey Mantle spent his childhood in Commerce before making his Major League debut with the New York Yankees in 1951. In offering the resolution, Senator Inhofe outlined Mantles inspiring career and its impact on his Oklahoma hometown. The following are excerpts from Senator Inhofes speech: 

  Mickey Mantle emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, charity, and sportsmanship. He is a shining example of how commitment and dedication can lead to great success. I seek to name the post office in Commerce, Oklahoma, in Mickey Mantles honor. He is still known to Commerce by the nicknames Commerce Comet or Commerce Kid.  

  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation as we commemorate an outstanding athlete so that future generations will be as inspired by his example of sportsmanship and charity as we have been. 

The bill will now move to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for consideration.
