WASHINGTON-U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), having just returned from Iraq, made the following statement today honoring Pope John Paul II: 

Our Creator has called home perhaps his finest servant, Pope John Paul II. Regardless of religious belief or denomination, it is uncontestable that his presence on Earth brought hope, peace, and encouragement to millions of individuals. Now we give prayers of thanks for his guidance, support, and ask for peace and comfort for Pope John Paul II. Perhaps no one person in recent times has done more to promulgate faith, goodness, and God's word than this man. 

John Paul II was Pope for 27 years, yet his entire life is marked by an unending capacity for love and compassion. We know that we were all born to return to our Creator one day. And while today is a day of immeasurable sorrow, we should also celebrate the faith of this man that allowed him to so bravely embrace his final hours. 

Along with President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul IIs strong stance against communism helped break the back of the Evil Empire. Throughout his life Pope John Paul II made continuous contributions toward both democracy and freedom in all corners of the world. Today we grieve the passing of a great man whose legacy will echo long into the future.
