WASHINGTON--- Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) celebrated todays Senate vote (49-51) allowing energy exploration within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Senate resisted todays attempt to strip the ANWR exploration language out of the current Budget Resolution (S.Con.Res.18) by voting down a Democrat proposed amendment. Senator Inhofe released the following statement: 

Todays vote in the Senate is a victory for all Americans, Inhofe said. Our nation simply cannot afford to ignore developing domestic supplies of energy in an era when we are increasingly dependent on volatile foreign sources. America greatly needs a comprehensive and modernized energy policy and todays Senate action is another step toward that end result. 

The area of the coastal plain affected by energy exploration and development would cover just 2,000 acres of the more than 19 million total acres within the refuge. Additionally, within that small footprint it is predicted that we could yield an estimated 900,000 barrels of oil a day. The tired refrain that ANWR 'will destroy the environment' is out-of-date and out of touch with reality when we have the technology and the know-how to affirmatively protect the environment while meeting an important long-term national security challenge.
