WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator James M. Inhofe today issued the following statement regarding President George W. Bushs nomination of Judge Samuel Alito for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. 

I am pleased that President Bush has put forward a nomination we can all support, a high minded constructionist judge with an unprecedented amount of experience in the legal field. Judge Sam Alito has had a highly distinguished career as a judge and appears to meet the standard of excellence for Supreme Court nominees. I look forward to learning more about Judge Alitos judicial philosophy and closely examining his past decisions and writings. 

Unfortunately, Judge Alitos nomination met a wave of partisan rhetoric from Senate Democrats just as soon as his selection was announced this morning. With our recent confirmation of a new Supreme Court Chief Justice the Senate has demonstrated its commitment to fair and dignified confirmation proceedings. I hope that Judge Alitos nomination will receive the same treatment. 

Upon first glance, Judge Alitos wealth of experience and legal accomplishments present him as an ideal candidate for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I look forward to a fair hearing process and carrying out my Constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on the presidents judicial nominations.
