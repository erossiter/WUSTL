WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today made the following statement on final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 1585): 

Providing for our national defense is one of the most important roles of our federal government, Senator Inhofe said. In order to maintain the worlds most formidable military, we must provide it with the best resources, support, and technology. The threats we face in the world are varied and numerous, and we must have the best of everything to ensure our security.

I am encouraged that the bill authorizes full funding of programs such as the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the KC-X tanker program, and Future Combat Systems Non-Line of Sight Cannon which will be integrated in Elgin, Oklahoma. However, I am concerned that funding for Future Combat Systems was cut by $205 million, delaying future research, development, and procurement of this vital system. FCS is the Armys first ground combat modernization program in 40 years and is the core of our Armys transformation strategy. I am further encouraged that the bill authorizes a 3.5% across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed personnel, and prohibits increases in certain health care costs and insurance co-payments.

I am also pleased that the controversial Kennedy hate-crimes amendment was pulled out of the bill during conference. It had no place in a defense authorization bill, and was wisely removed.

While this bill authorizes $696.4 billion for FY08 national defense, the base budget for the Department of Defense of $507 billion still falls short of what is needed. In the 1990s, the Department of Defense base budget dropped significantly as a percentage of the United States Gross Domestic Product. Historically, defense spending has averaged 5.7% of GDP, but today, it is hovering somewhere around 3.6%. Considering the challenges we are facing in the world today, we need a defense budget that is at least 5% of GDP.

In the bill, Congress fully authorized funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, Congress has failed to appropriate this money, and we will soon begin seeing the repercussions of this decision. Just today it was reported that 100,000 civilian employees are due to receive furlough letters next week to free up funds for ongoing operations. This will seriously hamper U.S. efforts around the world. It is vital that Congress fund ongoing operations in the War on Terror before recessing this Christmas.
