WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement about the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill (H.R.3074) which passed the Senate 88-7. 

An efficient transportation system is vital to our nations economy. While this THUD Appropriations bill is not perfect, it provides for maintenance that is essential to improve the safety and longevity of the highways and bridges throughout our nation.

The THUD bill contains many provisions I have fought to include, not the least of which is my language increasing the mandatory retirement age for commercial airline pilots from age 60 to 65. We must protect our most experienced pilots who are in danger of losing their jobs due to this arbitrary rule and ensure that American pilots are granted the same rights and privileges as foreign pilots in accordance with international age standards. Additionally, I strongly support language included in the THUD Appropriations bill prohibiting the FAA from imposing new aviation userfees that would unfairly burden general aviation pilots around the country. 

The bill also includes my amendment prohibiting the FAA from using funds in FY08 to implement the Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS). I do not believe there has been sufficient cost/benefits analysis of this new training program, but rather a rush to fix a system without explanation of its supposed shortcomings. There has also been no assurance that the FAA training Academy in Oklahoma City will continue to be used, despite the millions of taxpayer dollars already invested in the program.

As the most fiscally conservative member of the United States Senate, as ranked by the American Conservative Union, I have long argued that the two most important functions of the federal government are to provide for national defense and to develop and improve public infrastructure. That means I am not shy about voting for increased authorization and spending on national defense needs or public infrastructure. I do hope, however, that after this bill goes through the conference process, spending will be reasonably reduced rather than swelling with unnecessary funding.
