WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) announced today that five fire departments in Oklahoma will receive firefighter grant awards, including the Kemp Volunteer Fire Department (Kemp), the Ringold Fire Department (Ringold), the Byng Fire Department (Ada), the Buncombe Creek Volunteer Fire Department (Kingston) and the Pocasset Fire Department (Pocasset).

These grants help provide the tools and resources necessary to protect the health and safety of Oklahoma firefighters and the Oklahomans they serve and protect, Inhofe said. These awards will be used to increase the firefighting operations, fund fire fighter health and safety programs, acquire new fire apparatus, enhance EMS programs, and conduct fire prevention and safety programs. 

The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments, enhancing their abilities to respond to fire and fire-related hazards in their communities. The program is administered by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

The grant amounts breakdown as follows:

Department Grant

Kemp Volunteer Fire Department  (Kemp) $35,223
Ringold Fire Department (Ringold) $66,500
Byng Fire Department (Ada) $7,743
Buncombe Creek Volunteer Fire Department (Kingston) $84,788
Pocasset Fire Department (Pocasset) $171,000
