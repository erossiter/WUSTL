WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today praised the passage by unanimous consent of legislation (S.1716) he co-sponsored with Senator Thune (R-S.D.) which corrects a misinterpretation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) of a provision in the agriculture disaster aid package (H.R.2206) passed by Congress last May. This legislative fix will ensure that aid is properly allocated to livestock producers affected by wildfire, drought and other natural disasters. 

Oklahomas agriculture producers have suffered serious setbacks in the past few years from natural disasters, Senator Inhofe said. Due to USDA interpretation of language currently in the agriculture disaster aid package, up to 90% of those eligible for livestock disaster assistance would be prevented from receiving aid. This legislative fix restores Congress original intent, providing needed disaster assistance to Oklahoma farmers and ranchers.
