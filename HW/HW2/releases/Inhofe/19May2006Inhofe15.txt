WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today declared victory in the over two decade fight to secure English as the U.S. national language. Inhofes amendment (S.A 4064) was approved today by a supermajority Senate vote (63-34). Inhofe released the following statement after the vote: 

Tonight was a victory over twenty years in the making. I am pleased to say that we are now one step closer to securing English as the U.S. national language. Another event worth noting is that today some of my fellow Senators not only voted AGAINST making English the national language, but in the process they managed to argue FOR government language entitlements. 

It is shocking that 34 Senators voted against making English the national language, especially when a recent Zogby poll concluded that 84% of all Americans and 71% of Hispanics support the idea. I am also confused as to why these Senators did not support this measure when 27 of our States and 51 countries have made English their official language. 

Senator Salazars entitlement version of this amendment was not as widely supported as mine. As a result I feel we are in a stronger position going to conference with the House. I firmly believe that our colleagues in the House will support my amendment and not the entitlement version of Senator Salazar. 

I made it abundantly clear on the Senate floor today when I told other Senators You cannot have it both ways. You cannot vote for both of these amendments and somehow pacify the public, the public is smarter than that. 

Jim Boulet, Jr. of English First 
The Inhofe amendment was the only English amendment today. Those who switched their votes showed their true colors and lack of commitment. 

Senator Inhofe continues 

We will exercise all of our effort to make sure that we get English as the national language through conference successfully. We have a national anthem and a national pledge, how 34 Senators think we should not have a national language is inexcusable to me and I think the House Conference Committee will agree.
