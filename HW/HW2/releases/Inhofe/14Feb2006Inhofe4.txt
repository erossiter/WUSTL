WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla) made the following statement after being notified that Jerome Holmes of Oklahoma City received President Bushs nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Northern Oklahoma District. 

We submitted Jerome Holmes name to the President for this position and I am delighted that the President has chosen to nominate him for the bench. Both Mr. Holmes distinguished record as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in western Oklahoma and his staggering academic achievement make him an ideal choice for this position.
