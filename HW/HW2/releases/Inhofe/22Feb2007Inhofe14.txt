WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla) today made the following statement in response to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys declaration enabling 20 additional Oklahoma counties to receive public assistance in the wake of the winter storms that hit the state in January. 

FEMAs approval of 20 additional Oklahoma counties for public assistance is welcome news, but this has taken far too long, Inhofe said. As I recently wrote in an open letter to Oklahomas news reporters, we did not have any problems with FEMA before it was put under Homeland Securitys jurisdiction. As a result, I will soon be introducing legislation that will return FEMA to its pre-911 status as a stand-alone agency. I believe this action will allow greater oversight and a higher level of service.
