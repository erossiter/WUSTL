WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement in response to General David Petraeus (Commanding General of the Multi-National Force  Iraq) and Ambassador Ryan Crockers testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today.

I recently returned from my 15th trip to the Iraq Area of Responsibility where I witnessed first-hand the progress reported today by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. 

In my two trips to the region since the surge was implemented, I observed Ramadi change to Iraqi control after being declared the Terrorist Capitol of the World just last year. Fallujah experienced a similar transformation, though more impressively it was secured completely by Iraqi Security Forces. Since the surge has taken place, groups of Iraqi citizens have volunteered to risk their lives in order to mark IEDs, identify Al-Qaeda in their towns, guard critical infrastructure, and work side-by-side with U.S. forces. I visited the Joint Security Stations in Baghdad and observed the building of trust and relationships between U.S. and Iraqi forces, and an increase in burden sharing beginning to take place between the two groups of soldiers. 

I have watched the political, economic, and diplomatic growth in Iraq over time. While it has been uneven and at times frustrating, there has nevertheless been movement in a positive direction. 

I support the recommendations made by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in their testimony to Congress and believe that while there are no easy answers or quick solutions, under their leadership, our efforts in Iraq will succeed.
