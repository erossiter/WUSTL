WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today praised the passage of the amendment (S.Amdt.2934) he co-sponsored along with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) expressing the sense of the Senate that General David Petraeus deserves the Senates full support and urging members of the Senate to condemn personal attacks on his honor and integrity, along with all members of the United States Armed Forces. 

General David Petraeus is a man of outstanding moral integrity who has had a distinguished career in the United StatesArmy serving and protecting our country for 35 years. The United States Senate unanimously confirmed his appointment as the Commanding General of the Multi-National Force  Iraq in January. He has a spotless record of service and deserves our utmost respect. 

MoveOn.orgs ad crossed the line by attacking the character and integrity of Americas top military leader in Iraq. While no American is above scrutiny, this was clearly a calculated move on the part of this organization to undermine the noble efforts of this patriot to execute the duties that we in Congress unanimously sent him to accomplish. 

Character attacks on these men of selfless service, such as those produced and advertised by Moveon.org, are reprehensible and I am disappointed in those members of the Senate that would not step forward and condemn these attacks.
