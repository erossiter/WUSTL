WASHINGTON, D.C.---Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) announced today that he will travel to Iraq over the weekend to visit Oklahoma troops and meet with Iraqi dignitaries and coalition leadership. The Senator will discuss the success of the recent elections in Iraq as well as the U.S. militarys mission moving forward from this historic occasion. 

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) will join Senator Inhofe on this trip which will be the first Congressional delegation to visit post-election Iraq. 

I am looking forward to again seeing first hand the great accomplishments of our men and women in Iraq, Inhofe said. Often times the media doesnt give us the full story on the accomplishments and daily victories of our troops. When we return I will share the most recent experiences of our troops directly from their point of view. 

Visiting and evaluating our current mission in Iraq is our Constitutional responsibility as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope that through our discussions with both Iraqi and coalition leaders we may better understand the challenges we currently face in Iraq as well as what we in Congress may do to help minimize challenges in the future. 

I know that in Oklahoma and all across America we are very proud of our soldiers and I intend to tell every troop I see just that. 

The Senators will travel to Iraq via Germany where they will visit wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the last stop for wounded soldiers before heading back home. Additionally, the three Senators will visit an Iraqi police-training program in Jordan.
