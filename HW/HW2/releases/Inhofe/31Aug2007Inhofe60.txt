WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today made the following statement after the C-130 carrying himself, Sens. Shelby (R-AL) and Martinez (R-FL), and Congressman Cramer (D-AL) was shot at while departing Baghdad en route to Amman, Jordan. The crew of the aircraft dispensed flares to defeat any potential heat-seeking missile threat and no one was harmed.

Iraq since my last trip to the region. Al Qaedas unsuccessful attempt to shoot down this C-130 aircraft was a futile effort to influence its losing fight in Iraq, and served to underscore the reality that terrorism is still a threat and that there is still work to be done. The crews impeccable training and flawless performance ensured the safety of the aircraft and all personnel on board. 

While this incident may have been harrowing, these are the kind of threats that our men and women in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world continue to face everyday. They are the front line in the War on Terror and are to be commended for their tireless service.
