WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe, (R-Okla.) today made the following statement: 

The only thing more disgusting than Senator Kerry hurling insults at American troops yesterday is his unwillingness to take responsibility for those comments this afternoon. It is hyper-hypocritical of Sen. Kerry to accuse anyone of playing politics after a performance like his today. The fact is Sen. Kerry owes American soldiers and their families an apology and his scoffing at that suggestion is merely another example of his elitist and out of touch frame of mind. 

Having just returned from Afghanistan this week, I can attest that many soldiers I met there had acquired graduate degrees from some of Americas finest colleges. Perhaps when Sen. Kerry was insulting the education of Americas bravest he overlooked Gen. Petraeus  recently in charge of the NATO Training Mission in Iraq - who has earned both a PhD and a masters degree from Princeton. Apparently, Sen. Kerry also overlooked Gen Abizaid Commander of U.S. Central Command in Iraq  who is both a West Point and Harvard graduate, fluent in Arabic and a renowned expert in Arab affairs. 

Sen. Kerrys comments are unbecoming of a U.S. Senator. While an apology is appropriate, it cannot camouflage his divisive opinions.
