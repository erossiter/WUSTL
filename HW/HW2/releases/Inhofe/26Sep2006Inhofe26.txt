September 26, 2006
WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) received the Guardian of Seniors Rights Award on September 26, 2006 for his continued support of seniors rights during the 109th Congress. This Award is sponsored by the 60 Plus Association, a non-partisan seniors advocacy group focusing on free enterprise, limited government and less taxes. 

I thank the 60 Plus Association for this award and for their dedication to free enterprise and limited government, Inhofe said. It is truly an honor to receive this award from an organization that supports the rights of seniors. I will continue to work to protect the interests of Oklahoma seniors.
