WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today released the following statement commemorating the fifth anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. 

Five years ago our nation was dealt a grievous blow. Today we mourn for those who lost their lives and we give prayers of strength for the loved ones they left behind. Americans met the daunting challenges of that day, and looking back we remember the many instances of selfless bravery that epitomize the bedrock of this country. America is forever indebted to our first responders whose heroic acts saved thousands of lives. 

Sadly, an increasing number of countries have been forced to recognize that terrorism threatens all free nations, not just ours. We have seen terrorists attack innocent civilians in Spain, Great Britain, India, the Philippines, and throughout the Middle East. This serves as a reminder as to whom we are fighting against in this long war. 

Our men and women in uniform are doing outstanding work not only in Iraq and Afghanistan, but in all corners of the world. We are proud of their accomplishments and humbled by their sacrifice. Today we pray for the safety of our soldiers and first responders as they continue to protect America.
