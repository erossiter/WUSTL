WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today made the following statement on legislation (S.Res.378) he co-sponsored recognizing the sacrifices and contributions that military families have made to the U.S. Armed Forces: 

Throughout the history of the United States Armed Forces, military families have remained a constant source of support for our troops. These families continue to make tremendous sacrifices while sharing in the dedication of our servicemen and women. I am proud to co-sponsor legislation honoring our nations military families and hope Americans will join with us in giving them much-deserved recognition and appreciation.

There are over 3 million immediate family members of troops serving in the Armed Forces. This legislation, originally sponsored by Senator Murkowski (R-AK) and co-sponsored by 39 Senators, passed last night by Unanimous Consent.
