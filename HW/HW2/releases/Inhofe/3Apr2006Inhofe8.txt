Public Assistance is provided to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities. The incident period for public assistance is December 31, 2005, to March 31, 2006. 

Every fire department and county in the state should have submitted a Request for Public Assistance (RPA) to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management (OEM). The official period to submit an RPA ended on February 21, 2006. RPAs can still be submitted and they will be reviewed on a case by case basis to determine if the request can be approved. Approval is determined based on the reason for late submittal of the RPA. Please fax RPA forms to OEM at 405-948-1509. 

The incident closing date has no impact on personal loss applications resulting from wildfires during the disaster incident period. However, any Oklahoma wildfires that occur after March 31 will not qualify for FEMA assistance under DR-1623. 

For additional information, please contact Sabrina Parker at 405-608-4381. 

Constituents can apply online using the FEMA site or they can call 1-800-621-FEMA (3362).
