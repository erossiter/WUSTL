WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) is proud to announce the designation of April 8, 2007 as National Cushings Syndrome Awareness Day. Inhofes resolution (S. Res. 127) creating the designation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Inhofe introduced this resolution to broaden public awareness and show his continued support for those suffering from this disease. 

My desire is to see my Oklahoma constituents and all Americans receive the best possible health care, Inhofe stated. Cushings syndrome often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, many times leading to death, because the initial symptoms are shared with a number of milder ailments. Since awareness of the syndrome is low, doctors do not always run the tests necessary for diagnosis, and patients do not know to ask for them. It is my hope that National Cushings Syndrome Awareness Day will help Oklahomans and everyone suffering with this disease to receive better health care.

Cushings Syndrome is an endocrine or hormonal disorder. It is caused by over-exposure of the bodys tissue to high levels of the hormone cortisol. An estimated 10 to 15 people per million suffer from this debilitating disease. Common symptoms include abnormal weight gain, skin changes, fatigue, diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression. 

Over-production of cortisol is commonly associated with the treatment of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Additionally, delayed treatment of Cushings Syndrome significantly reduces treatment options, such as radiation therapy. Thus, it is imperative that both doctors and patients heighten their awareness of Cushings Syndrome.
