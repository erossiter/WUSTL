WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator James M. Inhofe today released the following statement in response to last nights debate regarding the elimination of funding for various projects. 

I have always objected to the idea of bureaucrats in Washington determining how local and state communities spend their tax dollars. 

Let me be clear, neither of yesterdays amendments opposed by Senator Coburn saves any money, nearly all of my colleagues agreed with me in recognizing that fact. [86-13 and 15-82 respectively] 

I have always praised the way transportation bills are structured in that they do not dictate from Washington, but instead allow local communities and states to prioritize their individual needs. 

Right here in Oklahoma, our Oklahoma Department of Transportation has named important highway projects as their priorities. These projects may or may not be seen as valuable to those in other states and this is only serves to reinforce my conclusion that it is each states responsibility to set its own priorities. Conversely it is inappropriate for any Senator to overrule how a state chooses to expend its individual share of federal funding.
