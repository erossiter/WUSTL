WASHINGTON- U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) presented Inez Sitter a copy of S.Res.423, a resolution passed on November 18, 2004 to honor her 60 years of service to the Choctaw Nations Jones Academy in Hartshorne, Oklahoma. 

Senator Inhofe read the resolution to Inez Sitter and members of her family in his Washington, D.C. office this week. 

I was just ten years old when Mrs. Sitter first came to the Jones Academy. I am pleased to see the United States Senate recognize and permanently record her lifelong dedication as a public servant. 

Mrs. Sitter first came to the school in an administrative post in March of 1944, later to become the Administrative Assistant. After retiring from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1983, Mrs. Sitter immediately assumed the position as the Tutorial Coordinator for Jones Academy, the Library Services Coordinator, and the Director of the Foster Grandparents program at the school. To this day she still volunteers at the school, and is a member of many civic organizations, including the Hartshorne Edgewood United Methodist Church, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the American Legion Auxiliary. 

All Oklahomans can join me today in thanking Inez Sitter for her inspiring commitment to the community around her. 

Founded over one hundred years ago, the Choctaw Nations Jones Academy provides residential services and academic classes to predominately at risk children from over twenty Indian Tribes throughout the United States.
