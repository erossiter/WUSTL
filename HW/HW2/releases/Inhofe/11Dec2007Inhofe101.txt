WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement in response to the winter storms that hit Oklahoma this week, as well as President Bushs emergency declaration for the state. To date, the storm has claimed the lives of 16 individuals and left over 600,000 Oklahomans without power.

Oklahoma suffered an ice storm of historic proportions this week, leading to record power outages and millions of dollars in damage. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the Oklahomans who lost their lives, as well as all who are suffering during these extreme conditions. Our state has overcome devastation from natural disasters in the past, and I have no doubt we will do so again.

I commend the President for his quick action approving our states emergency declaration request for all 77 counties in Oklahoma and urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency to expedite necessary public assistance funding. We have also been in contact with the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management regarding what specific assistance he may require from the Oklahoma Congressional Delegation. I will continue working with President Bush and Governor Henry to ensure the full resources of the federal government are made available to our state, as well as closely follow the progress of FEMA and other emergency response agencies to ensure their aid efforts are swift and effective.
