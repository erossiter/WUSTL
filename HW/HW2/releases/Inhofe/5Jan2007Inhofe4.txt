WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), along with Sens. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), and Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), today introduced legislation to aid farmers and ranchers who have been severely impacted by late-Decembers blizzards and ice storms. 

The legislation (S.165) reauthorizes the Livestock Compensation Program and would allow aid for producers who suffered livestock losses as a result of the recent blizzards in Oklahoma and surrounding states. Oklahomas Texas and Beaver counties suffered from severe ice damage while Cimarron County experienced the brunt of the snow damage with immobilizing depths upward of 30 inches. 

Although the extent of the damage is not yet known, it is clear that the Oklahoma panhandle has suffered some loss, Sen. Inhofe said. I want those who are enduring this hardship to know that we are aware of what they are going through and we are trying to help in every way we can. 

We know this will be costly to our farmers and ranchers, so I have co-sponsored a bill to help get one of Oklahomas most valued industries back on its feet as soon as possible. Along with this legislation, some of my staff have been helping out on the ground and in the air spotting cattle throughout the week.

Oklahoma has been hit hard this past year, both by the drought and by the blizzard. This legislation will provide valuable, targeted assistance to those Oklahomans most affected.

Due to the urgent need for this legislation in the affected states, the senators are optimistic that the bill will move swiftly, and will work with their colleagues to secure its passage.
