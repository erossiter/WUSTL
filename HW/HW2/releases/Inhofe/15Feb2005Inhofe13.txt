WASHINGTON, D.C.---Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement today in response to the Senates unanimous approval (98-0) of Judge Michael Chertoff to be the new Secretary of Homeland Security. 

Michael Chertoffs background will greatly benefit both the Department of Homeland Security and the American people. Mr. Chertoff played a vital role in tracing the terrorist attacks back to the al-Qaeda network in the days after 9/11; he understands the challenges we face. 

Not only has Mr. Chertoff enjoyed bi-partisan support in his past Senate confirmations, but he is also respected by members of both parties for his commitment to protecting this country and his great understanding and respect for the laws of this nation. I am confident in his leadership and I pleased we have confirmed him here today.
