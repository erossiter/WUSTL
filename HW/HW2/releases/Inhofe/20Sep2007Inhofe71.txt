WASHINGTON  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today expressed deep discontent about the latest effort by Senate Democrats to cut off funding and mandate a date for withdrawal from Iraq. The amendment (S.Amdt.2924) to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R.1585) failed by a vote of 28-70. 

The Feingold amendment was never intended to be a serious consideration of Iraq and the War on Terror, stated Senator Inhofe. Its unfortunate and disheartening that some in this body continue to jeopardize our soldiers well-being by playing politics with vital military funding.

As I have stated before, by establishing a timeline for withdrawal, like some Senators attempted to do in this resolution, we are essentially telling the enemy how much longer they must wait before they can take over. Telegraphing our plans to the enemy is no way to win any conflict. A crisis is assured if we vote to leave before the job is done.

While challenges remain in Iraq, there has nevertheless been movement in a positive direction. There are no easy answers or quick solutions. I have faith in the generals and soldiers on the ground that are running this war, and under their leadership, our efforts in Iraq will succeed.
