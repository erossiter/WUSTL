WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today released the following statement having returned from an overseas trip to Afghanistan earlier this week. General Jim Jones, Supreme Allied Commander Europe who commands all NATO forces, hosted Senator Inhofe on this trip. Karen Tandy, Administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, also accompanied Inhofe. While in Afghanistan Inhofe met with U.S. and NATO soldiers at three Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the Speaker of the Lower House of Afghan Parliament Mohammad Yunoos Qanooni and British General Richards who commands the United Nations International Assistance Security Force (ISAF). Inhofe spent three days in Afghanistan before returning home.
Having just returned from Afghanistan I can attest that we are making good progress on the ground there and I am encouraged by what I have seen. In order to appreciate the progress in Afghanistan, one must realize that Afghanistan suffered total destruction under decades of war and years of Soviet occupation. Rebuilding basic infrastructure has been a herculean task, but one that Americas soldiers have championed. After visiting three Provincial Reconstruction Teams (Kunduz, Jalalabad and Parwan) and Bagram Airbase, I cannot overstate how proud I am of our soldiers and their accomplishments.
Throughout Afghanistan I witnessed our soldiers, along with other NATO soldiers, forging strong relationships with the local Afghan population. The Afghans I met seem to be grateful for our presence and aware of the progress we are making together. The PRTs are responsible for coordinating: area security, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and non-governmental organizations as well as using CERP (Commanders Emergency Response Program) funds to finance basic reconstruction projects utilizing the local workforce. 
As with any undertaking of this magnitude there are mitigating factors to swift success, and Afghanistan is no exception. In my view, corruption in the government is one of Afghanistans greatest obstacles to a functioning democracy and a population that will reject the resurgence of the Taliban. From the national government down to the local level, corruption is rampant and Afghanistans government must make every effort to eliminate it. I told President Karzai exactly that in our face-to-face meeting. 
Another obvious obstacle is the drug trade and specifically the production of poppy seeds in Afghanistan. Due to the lack of basic irrigation and agricultural processing plants, conventional crops such as wheat and corn are nearly impossible to produce in most of the country. Conversely, the poppy seems to take root in the worst of soil and conditions. This is a tall mountain to climb, but as we make progress in the reconstruction of Afghanistans infrastructure, we also progress in the fight against poppy production. 
In my meeting with President Karzai, I told him he should consider a draft to increase troop levels in the Afghan National Army (ANA). U.S. Soldiers have been responsible for the training of the ANA, but the number of soldiers trained to date is only 25% of the target. I want to be clear; this is not the fault of U.S. soldiers. U.S. Soldiers are doing a magnificent job of training the ANA and it is essential that the Afghan government increase troop levels in their army. Once trained and properly equipped, the ANA prove to be brave, fierce fighters. They are more than capable of defeating the Taliban. However, this task requires that we better equip the ANA and train them in greater numbers. 
In sum, my trip to Afghanistan with General Jones was a very encouraging visit. I have seen great strides since my earlier trips to Afghanistan at the beginning of the war. I am heartened by NATOs commitment and I am confident that the Afghan people working together with NATO forces will build a strong and democratic Afghanistan.
