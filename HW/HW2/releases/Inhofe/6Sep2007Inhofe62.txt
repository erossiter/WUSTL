WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement praising the announcement by Sinclair Tulsa Refining Co. to expand its refinery in Tulsa, increasing the refinerys output of gasoline and diesel fuels by more than 60 percent while reducing refinery emissions.

Sinclairs refinery expansion will be a positive development not only for Tulsa and the whole state of Oklahoma, but for all Americans who are suffering from soaring gas prices, Senator Inhofe said. Americans are paying more at the pump in part because we do not have the domestic capacity to refine the fuels consumers demand. I have long been an advocate of increasing refining capacity and energy supply and Sinclairs commitment to expand its refinery will prove to be beneficial for Tulsa and consumers alike.
