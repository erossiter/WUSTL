WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement regarding the death of Americas 38th President, Gerald R. Ford.

President Ford was a man of strong character and unshakable values, Inhofe said. He led the country through a tumultuous period in our nations history and restored certainty to the White House. America is forever indebted to President Ford for his leadership throughout that troubled era.

I was lucky enough to meet President Ford on several occasions and I think he was the most non-political seasoned politician I have ever known. He did not make decisions the way so many politicians do these days. Kay and I want to extend our condolences to the Ford family and all citizens who today grieve the loss of this great American.
