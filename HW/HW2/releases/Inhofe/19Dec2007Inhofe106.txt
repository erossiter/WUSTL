WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today introduced the Volunteer Pilot Organization Protection Act of 2007 (S.11), legislation that will amend the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 to include liability exemptions for volunteer pilot organizations (VPO) such as the Air Charity Network (ACN).

Volunteer pilot organizations, such as the Air Charity Network (ACN), organize volunteer pilots to provide free air transportation for people in need of specialized medical treatment at distant locations due to family, community or national crises. Over 8,000 pilots volunteer with the ACN, using their own planes, paying for their own fuel, and even taking time from their day jobs to serve people in need. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, ACN aircraft were the first to be approved to fly-in disaster-response teams and supplies. Similarly, in 2005, ACN pilots flew over 2,600 missions after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, reuniting families torn apart by the disaster and relocating them to safe housing. 

These pilots and charitable organizations provide invaluable service, yet due to a loophole in the law, are subject to frivolous, costly lawsuits. My legislation will ensure that these volunteer pilots and the organizations for which they fly are exempt from liability and able to continue providing this important service.

Senator Inhofes bill amends the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 (VPA), which was intended to increase volunteerism in the United States, to include groups such as ACN and the American Red Cross in the list of types of organizations that are currently exempt from liability. It will protect volunteer pilot organizations, their boards, paid staff and non-flying volunteers from liability should there be an accident. It will also provide liability protection for individual volunteer pilots over and above the liability insurance that they are currently required to carry, as well as liability protection for the referring agencies who inform their patients of charitable flight services.

Companion legislation, H.R. 2191, was introduced in May by Congresswoman Thelma Drake (R-VA).
