WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) this morning released the following statement in response to last nights compromise between U.S. Senate leaders: 

Last nights travesty of a compromise will have disastrous effects on our future generations. For the first time we have now legitimized a leadership-led filibuster against a judicial nominee. 

The damage from this compromise will be felt by the next generation because of a huge loophole in the compromise language, stating that the filibuster is still on the table for extraordinary circumstances. Well my question would be, What exactly have we gained by allowing the democrats to continue to unconstitutionally filibuster any judge they do not like? 

President Bush could have as many as three nominees to the United States Supreme Court in his remaining term and the Justice most likely to be replaced first is Justice Rehnquist. Rehnquist is a conservative and the liberals are now in a position to block a conservative replacement. 

It is our grandchildren who will pay for last nights blunder.
