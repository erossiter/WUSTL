WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today introduced legislation creating a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to recruit and prepare students for careers in the National Weather Service and in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs. The NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007 (S.2164) requires that recipients of the scholarship work for a branch of NOAA, including the National Weather Service, upon graduation for 24 months in return for each academic year that a scholarship is given. 

My state of Oklahoma has one of the highest rates of natural disasters per capita in the nation, Senator Inhofe said. As Oklahomans, we know the importance of NOAA, and particularly the study of meteorology, since accurate and timely reporting of atmospheric changes can mean the difference between life and death. The University of Oklahoma has developed an exceptional program for the study of meteorology that is the largest program of its type in the country. The OU School of Meteorology, home to the National Weather Center, ranks first in the nation in severe storms and mesoscale research and provides invaluable meteorological services nationwide.

While the demand for trained individuals in meteorological professions is rising, there is a shortage of American students devoting themselves to the study of academic subjects related to these fields. In order to achieve its mission, NOAA requires a cadre of young talent to enter the workforce with training in fields like meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography. This scholarship program will provide an opportunity and an incentive for students to develop scientific expertise that will continue to enable NOAA, at facilities like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma and elsewhere, to provide these valuable meteorological services. 

Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) is an original co-sponsor of the legislation. On September 17, 2007, the House of Representatives passed similar legislation, H.R. 1657, by a vote of 360  16.
