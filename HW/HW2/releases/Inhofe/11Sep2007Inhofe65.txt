WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement commemorating the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Todays anniversary will never be forgotten. We will never forget those we lost six years ago or the heroes who have stood up to defend our nation from the ensuing threat of terrorism. First-responders and members of the military put their lives on the line daily to protect this country and its citizens. Americans must always remember the selflessness of these individuals.

We offer prayers of strength for the loved ones left behind and honor the brave men and women in uniform who continue to wage the war on terrorism in all corners of the world. We are proud of their accomplishments and humbled by their sacrifice  they deserve our greatest respect.
