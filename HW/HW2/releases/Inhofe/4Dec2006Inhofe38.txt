WASHINGTON, DC - Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chairman of the Environment  Public Works Committee, released the following statement today regarding WRDA negotiations. 

Completing action on a Water Resources Development Act has been one of our top priorities as the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and as the Chairman of the subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Due to the importance of this bill, we have worked diligently to craft a compromise with the House in the Conference Committee, willing to give in to many of their demands. However, we simply cannot - and will not  include certain provisions they are requiring for us to pass this bill. Therefore, unless we can settle these issues, the WRDA bill is at an end for this Congress. 


Specific Oklahoma provisions within the WRDA bill include:

 McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation Channel  The WRDA bill directs the U.S. Corps of Engineers to continue toward construction of the 12-foot navigation channel leading to the Port of Catoosa. The deeper channel will accommodate heavier barges carrying increased loads, opening Oklahoma to a sector of business previously unattainable and keeping the Port of Catoosa thriving well into the future. Additionally, wheat farmers out west and many others in the state will be able to take advantage of an extremely cost effective method of transportation.

 Lake Texoma  Local plans for further recreational development on land previously conveyed to the State of Oklahoma at Lake Texoma are being hindered by reversionary interest language included in that conveyance. The WRDA bill would remove the reversionary interest language, thereby allowing local development plans to move forward.

 Lake Eufaula - This provision establishes recreation as a project purpose and creates a lake advisory committee that will allow citizens to give recommendations to the Corps regarding the operations of the lake. This section would also authorize a reallocation study.

 Oklahoma Lake Demonstration - The WRDA bill creates a program in Oklahoma that would encourage private development on Corps lakes. The program would create new guidelines that would benefit private developers dealing with Corps procedures.

 Remediation of Abandoned Mine Sites Program  The WRDA bill authorizes the Corps to spend $45 million a year nationwide for planning, technical assistance and construction activities to remediate abandoned hard rock mines. This program is another tool that can be used to assist in the clean up Tar Creek.

 Arcadia Lake  The City of Edmond has been in dispute with the Corps of Engineers over whether the city owes additional money as interest on water payments. The WRDA bill clarifies that the city is not liable for interest during the time when the city was not using the water.

 Waurika Lake Project  The Corps of Engineers and the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District completed the lake project in the 1980s. Well after completion of the lake, the Corps discovered an accounting error and claimed it had undercharged the Conservancy District. Language in the WRDA bill clarifies that Waurika is obligated to pay only the amount that was originally agreed to when the project was completed.
