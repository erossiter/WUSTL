WASHINGTON, D.C. Today U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla) gained unanimous Senate approval for his amendment protecting the right to prayer at United States Military Academies. Senator Inhofes amendment (S.A. 2440) enjoyed wide cosponsorship and passed unanimously this afternoon by a 99-0 vote. 

America is a nation steeped in religious tradition and throughout our history we have protected our soldiers right to prayer, Inhofe said. The problem is now we have the ACLU trying to file lawsuits against our military academies claiming that it is illegal to afford our cadets a right that is guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States. 

It is outrageous that these individuals would violate the heritage of this nation by not allowing prayer for the young men and women who serve this nation so selflessly. With my amendments unanimous approval today we have sent a strong message of Congressional intent to any judge that may rule on this topic. 

Senator Inhofe introduced his amendment in response to recent pressure from liberal groups calling for the cessation of prayer at Americas military academies. Specifically, the ACLU seeks to end such prayer at the Naval Academy and liberal groups have asked Congress to address the matter. 

The Inhofe amendment states that the U.S. military academies may allow voluntary, non-denominational prayer which indicates Congressional intent to judges for use in possible future cases on this topic. The 4th, 6th and 7th U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals ruled that voluntary, non-denominational prayer in colleges is constitutionally permissible. Additionally, Justice Scalia has written that prayer at military colleges might be said to be more, rather than less, likely to be constitutional since prayer before military mess is more traditional than group prayer at ordinary state colleges 

Senator Inhofes amendment was successfully attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (S.1042) that is expected to pass the Senate within 24 hours.
