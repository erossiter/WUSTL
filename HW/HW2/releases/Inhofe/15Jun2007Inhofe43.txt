June 15, 2007
WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today announced the passage of his resolution designating today, June 15, 2007, National Huntingtons Disease Awareness Day. Senator Inhofe introduced the resolution (S.Res.234) to broaden public awareness and demonstrate his continued support for those suffering from this disease. 

Huntingtons Disease is a devastating disorder that affects an estimated 1 in every 10,000 persons, and sadly, children who develop the juvenile form of the disease rarely live to adulthood, Inhofe stated. It is my hope that National Huntingtons Disease Awareness Day will help raise awareness and propel research toward the development of a cure for this disease that will help not only Oklahomans, but all Americans suffering from the disease.

Huntingtons Disease is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes total physical and mental deterioration over a 12-15 year period. Though Huntingtons Disease typically begins in mid-life, between the ages of 30 and 45, onset may occur as early as the age of two. The average lifespan after onset of Huntingtons Disease is 10 to 20 years. Furthermore, a child of a Huntingtons Disease parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the Huntingtons Disease gene.

Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) co-sponsored this resolution which passed by unanimous consent. For more information visit: .
