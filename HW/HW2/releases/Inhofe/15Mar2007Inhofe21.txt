WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today was presented with the Club for Growths annual Defender of Economic Freedom Award created to honor members of Congress who have a strong voting record on economic growth issues.

I wish to thank the Club for Growth for this award, Sen. Inhofe said. The Club for Growth is among the most successful groups in defending traditional conservative economic values. I look forward to continuing to work together to curtail government waste.

With his score of 94, Senator Inhofe is clearly a courageous defender of American taxpayers, said Club for Growth president Pat Toomey. As 1 of only 22 congressional members to earn this award, Senator Inhofe demonstrates a strong commitment to increasing economic freedom and improving the standard of living for all Americans.

The award is based on certain votes that the Club for Growth tracks on its scorecard. The study included a comprehensive examination of each lawmakers record on pro-growth policies and computed an Economic Growth Score on a scale of 0 to 100. A score of 100 indicates the highest support for pro-growth policies. Those lawmakers scoring 90 or higher receive the Defender of Economic Freedom Award.
