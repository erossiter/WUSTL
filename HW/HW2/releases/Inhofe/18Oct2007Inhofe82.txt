WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) today announced that he is an original co-sponsor along with Senators Voinovich (R-OH), DeMint (R-SC), Thune (R-SD), Sessions (R-AL), Graham (R-SC), Chambliss (R-GA), and Cornyn (R-TX) of legislation introduced by Senator Martinez (R-FL) reauthorizing the State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The More Children, More Choices Act provides a full re-authorization of SCHIP without the big-government expansions in the Democrats SCHIP legislation (H.R.976). 

I support the original intent of the SCHIP program, which provides health coverage for uninsured children in need, Senator Inhofe said. Our legislation will accomplish that objective by reauthorizing the SCHIP program for uninsured children at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. It also seeks to encourage greater state involvement and private coverage by creating a new federalism initiative and providing a $1400 tax credit for children in families with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level.

Congressional Democrats have been playing politics with their SCHIP re-authorization bill, using it as a vehicle to advance their long-standing agenda of socializing healthcare and creating a new middle-class entitlement. Congress needs to pass a reauthorization of SCHIP that maintains the original intent of the program by providing health insurance for the millions of uninsured, low-income children across the country, not middle-class adults. Our legislation is supported in both the House and the Senate, and gives Congress a viable alternative to reauthorize this important program quickly, without unnecessary government-run healthcare expansions.

For more information on the legislation, please see the attached section by section explanation of the legislation.
