WASHINGTON, D.C.-U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today praised the inclusion of his legislation requiring parental consent for non-emergency intrusive physical examinations in the Federal Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007 (S.1082) which today passed the Senate (93-1). Sen. Inhofe has introduced his legislation in the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses.

As I have said before, young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected to these intrusive physical exams without the prior knowledge and consent of their parents, Inhofe said. Parents have a right to know what is happening to their children in the classroom. Todays action is another step in the right direction and soon there will be definitive language in federal law prohibiting these exams without parental consent.

Senator Inhofe introduced this legislation in response to constituents concerns about their children receiving intrusive exams without their consent. While the Department of Health and Human Services administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. Code is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent, thus leading to the problem the parents encountered.
Head Start and Early Head Start are child development programs that serve children from birth to age 5, pregnant women, and their families. Additional information on Head Start may be found on the Department of Health and Human Services website:
