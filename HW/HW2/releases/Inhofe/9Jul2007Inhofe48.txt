WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today was named a 2006 Taxpayer Hero for his continued efforts to protect and support the taxpayers of Oklahoma and the nation. The award was sponsored by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), a nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government.

I wish to thank the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste for this award, Senator Inhofe said. No other group in America needs more support and representation than the American taxpayer, and the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste continues to provide an invaluable service. I look forward to continuing to work for lower taxes, a strong economy, and keeping the federal budget out of the family budget.

Actions speak louder than words, CCAGW President Tom Schatz stated. The way a member chooses to vote is the best indicator of whether a professed commitment to fiscal discipline is real. When Congress had opportunities to vote for amendments that would have removed blatantly parochial special-interest projects and demonstrated that they were finally addressing spending and ethics problems, Sen. Inhofe went against the grain and voted yes. Sen. Inhofe puts the interests of taxpayers ahead of politics by recognizing the long-term consequences of excessive spending and working to reduce the enormous debt being left to future generations.

Senator Inhofe was named a Taxpayer Hero for scoring 95 percent on CCAGWs 2006 Congressional Ratings. The average for the entire Senate was 44 percent. Since 1991, CCAGW has tracked roll call votes to separate the taxpayer advocates in Congress from those who favor wasteful programs and pork-barrel spending. As one of 19 senators with a score of 80 percent or higher, Sen. Inhofe consistently voted to cut wasteful spending, reduce the tax burden, and make government more accountable to taxpayers.
