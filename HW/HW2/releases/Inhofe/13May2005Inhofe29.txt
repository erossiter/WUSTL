INHOFE ANNOUNCES OKLAHOMA 
BRAC IMPLICATIONS

WASHINGTON---U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), made the following statement in response to todays BRAC list released from the Department of Defense:

I am very pleased to announce that Oklahomas five major installations are safe and showing huge net gains in the state in numbers of both military and civilian positions. I think that Oklahoma will again go down as one of the states that has benefited the most from a Base Realignment and Closure round. We are all very proud of our military installations here in Oklahoma and we owe a great deal of todays success to the community support that each of our five installation received across the state.
