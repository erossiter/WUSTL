WASHINGTON, DC - United States Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today announced that he will visit all five of Oklahomas military installations during a statewide tour on Friday, May 13th. The statewide tour will coincide with the official announcement of military installations on the Pentagons Base Realignment And Closure (BRAC) Commission list. 

I am confident that the BRAC Commission will recognize our very strong evidence as to why our Oklahoma bases should remain a part of the National Security establishment, stated Inhofe. In my position on the Senate Armed Services Committee I have been involved with every discussion on this very important topic and I am confident of the effort of installations and their communities have made in preparing for the BRAC process. 

Below are the tentative times and locations for Inhofes visit to each installation/community on May 13th. Final times and locations will follow shortly. 

11:00 am - Tinker Air Force Base  Air Logistics Center, Midwest City 

Air Depot Gate Parking Lot - Lot is east of the gate 

12:15 pm - Vance Air Force Base, Enid 

Directly across from Vance AFB Front Gate 

2:30 pm - Altus Air Force Base, Altus 

Altus/Quartz Mountain Regional Airport 

3:30 pm - Fort Sill, Lawton

Senator Inhofe will be joined by other members of the Oklahoma congressional delegation during portions of the tour. The public is encouraged to attend the events/visits in their community. 

As Oklahomas senior senator, Inhofe is the 2nd ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where he continues to a play a leadership role on defense and national security issues. A tireless fighter for Oklahomas military installations, Inhofe has successfully fought to win important funds for needed construction, housing, ammunition, real property maintenance, and emergency aid, directly benefiting each of Oklahomas military facilities.
