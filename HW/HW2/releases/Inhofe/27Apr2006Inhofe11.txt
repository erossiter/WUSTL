WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) released the following statement regarding his vote against an amendment (S.Amdt. 3594) that would take $1.9 billion from the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense (H.R. 4939) and apply those funds to border security. Senator Inhofe was one of only three Republicans to vote against this military funding cut. Senator Inhofe released the following statement: 

I cannot overstate the importance of securing our borders, but to fund border security on the backs of our men and women in uniform is counterproductive and shortsighted. Americas brave military men and women have gone to war for this nation and we cannot shortcut their needs, not for any reason. 

I have long stated that the role of the federal government should be to provide infrastructure and a strong national defense. This amendments solution of taking money from the military to fund border security only creates another problem. We cannot play shell games in Washington, we must adequately fund both the military AND border security. These issues are simply too important for shortcuts.
