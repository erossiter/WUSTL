WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla) made the following statement today praising his 2006 nominee, Michael Nomura of Tulsa, for the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institutes annual Angel in Adoption Gala occurring tonight in Washington, D.C. 

Michael Nomura has dedicated his life to helping children find permanency and security in adoptive families. I know I speak for all Oklahomans when I say thank you for your service and congratulations on a much deserved award. 

Michael serves as the president of the Oklahoma Adoption Coalition, is actively involved with the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, and is former director of two Oklahoma residential facilities for children, the Baptist Childrens Home and the Sand Springs Home. He is also co-director and founder of Heritage Family Services in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which provides adoption services such as home studies and placements for adoptive families and counseling for birth parents. 

The Angels in Adoption Program is the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institutes signature public awareness program and provides an opportunity to all members of the U.S. Congress to honor the outstanding efforts of constituents who have enriched the lives of foster children and orphans. Senator Inhofe has been a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption since 2001 and has nominated an Oklahoman for the honor every year.
