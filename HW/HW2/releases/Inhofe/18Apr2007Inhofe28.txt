WASHINGTON, D.C. U.S. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today praised the Supreme Court decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act that was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2003. 

I have been an ardent supporter of a ban on partial-birth abortion since legislation was first introduced in the 104th Congress back in 1995, Inhofe said. This is a victory for unborn souls in our country and I applaud the Supreme Court ruling to protect innocent life. The term partial-birth abortion, by the name itself, only begins to describe this barbaric procedure.

Today the Supreme Court voted (5-4) to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 that outlaws partial-birth abortion unless the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother. The law imposes a maximum of two years imprisonment and/or fine on whomever performs a partial-birth abortion.
