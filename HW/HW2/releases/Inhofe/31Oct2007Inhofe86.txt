WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement criticizing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote today to report the Law of the Sea Treaty to the floor of the Senate:

The Law of the Sea Treaty is a far-reaching threat to American sovereignty that will govern 70% of the earths surface, and I am extremely disappointed in its approval by the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Inhofe said. President Reagan was correct and justified in not signing this treaty for a great number of reasons that range from its economic impact, forced sharing of technology, and submission of American citizens and businesses to an international court system under the auspices of the United Nations itself.

Despite what we have been told about the Law of the Sea by its supporters, it is a dangerous treaty that we need to reject. It hampers the operations of the United States Navy, allows international taxation on American companies and our government, and exposes American businesses to the international court system.

I can only hope that the full Senate will reject this treaty; it is imperative to the sovereignty and the security of the American people.
