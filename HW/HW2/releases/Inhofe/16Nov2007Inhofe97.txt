WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement on todays failed motion to end debate on the 2007 Farm Bill (H.R. 2419): 

I am disappointed that Senate Democrats have refused to hold a single vote on the farm bill, even though the Senate began considering this legislation two weeks ago. The Democratic leadership has consistently refused Republican requests for a fair and open debate, wasting valuable time and taxpayer resources. I hope Democrats will consider the farmers and ranchers who help keep food on American tables and resume debate in a reasonable and timely fashion.
