WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today visited the members of the Oklahoma National Guard 45th Infantry Brigade training at Camp Gruber in preparation for their deployment to Iraq this year. During his visit, Senator Inhofe shared breakfast with the troops and spoke with members of the 45th during their combat life saving skills training. He also talked with soldiers on the training range about the new equipment and transformation of the 45th into a modular expeditionary combat force. 

Our Oklahoma National Guardsmen are some of the best in the country, Senator Inhofe said. Their unwavering service to our state when on duty at home and the nation while fighting abroad deserves the utmost praise and respect. Oklahomans and Americans alike are indebted to the service of these men and we will stand behind the 45th Infantry Brigade as they prepare to fight for our country in the War on Terrorism. 

The members of the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma National Guard will next go to Ft. Bliss in Texas for additional training.
