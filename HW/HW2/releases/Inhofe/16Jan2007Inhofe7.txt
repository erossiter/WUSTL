WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement regarding the recovery effort for Oklahomans affected by the recent ice storms.

In light of the response to this summers Oklahoma wildfires, I was ready to go to the Administration and the President if they did not respond to the Governor, but that was not necessary in this case, Inhofe said. FEMA is now on the ground in Oklahoma setting up an Emergency Operation Center and organizing the relief effort. I have been in touch not only with Governor Henry, but also with Oklahoma Emergency Management, FEMA and power companies throughout the state to ensure that Oklahomans will regain power as soon as possible.
