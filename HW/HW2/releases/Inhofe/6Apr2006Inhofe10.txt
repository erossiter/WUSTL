WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla) today announced that he will vote against the Senate compromise (S.3424) to the Immigration Reform Bill (S.2454) citing his absolute disapproval of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Senator Inhofe today made the following statement: 

I have always outlined my position in this debate as follows: I will oppose any program that would shortcut the current naturalization process; I would oppose any program or proposal that rewards illegal aliens for their illegal acts and I would oppose any program that does not further address the porous nature of our borders. 

Furthermore, I have proposed two amendments to this bill, which have received opposition from Senate democrats. My first amendment would make English the official language of the U.S., something I have been trying to accomplish for some time. My second amendment would allow retired law enforcement officers, who are required to retire at 57, to assist our current over-stretched force of border agents in a limited capacity. 

We simply do not have enough border patrol agents and this highly talented and well-known group of individuals is eager to help. We must secure our borders now. Not considering my amendments to this bill is merely one example of how this legislation fails to address many of the vital problems surrounding this immigration debate.
