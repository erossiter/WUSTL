WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement in honor of Veterans Day: 

Throughout the history of our country, men and women serving in our military have risked their lives in the defense of our proud nation. These veterans deserve our utmost praise and respect and our country is indebted to their service.

Thousands of Oklahomans have stood in this capacity throughout our century of statehood. Service men and women from Tinker, Altus, Vance, Tulsa, Will Rogers, Fort Sill, Camp Gruber, McAlester, members of our Active Duty, Guard and Reserve, continue to fight for freedom around the globe. I am proud to represent these men and women in the United States Senate and am humbled by their sacrifices and service.
