WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement after Senator John Warner (R-Va.) announced that he would not seek re-election in 2008. 

I was sorry to hear today that John Warner has decided to retire, Senator Inhofe said. I know that its a difficult decision for him as Ive talked to him about it in the past. He has had a long and distinguished career in the military, in the Navy, and certainly in public service, having served so many years in the United States Senate. He certainly will be missed.
