WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today praised President Bushs veto of the Iraq Supplemental Spending Bill citing Congress inclusion of arbitrary timelines for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. 

President Bushs veto today marks the end of Congressional Democrats continued and destructive delay of vital dollars for our troops in combat. I am continually shocked and disappointed by some members lack of commitment to funding equipment and training for our soldiers during a time of war.

Additionally, the Army has been forced to slow the training of Iraqi Security Forces because of these political stall tactics. I certainly hope we can work as a united Congress to get our soldiers the support they need to fight, win and come home; however, I am concerned that the Democrats will continue to play politics and delay this critical funding in the days to come.
