WASHINGTON  Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-OK) today expressed deep discontent about last nights Senate vote (48-50) to preserve an arbitrary Iraq withdrawal deadline currently within the Iraq Supplemental Spending Bill (H.R 1591).

I am deeply concerned about the withdrawal provision in the emergency supplemental funding bill, Inhofe said. Furthermore, it is unconscionable to jeopardize our soldiers well-being by playing politics with vital military funding, including dollars for implementing BRAC. The Democrat leadership has yet to come up with a plan to win the War on Terror, so they have settled on a plan for surrender  a defeat which will have devastating consequences for our troops and embolden our enemies worldwide.

As I have stated before, I have faith in the generals and soldiers on the ground that are running this war. We dont need the 535 Generals in Congress telling our troops how to win this fight. By establishing a timeline for withdrawal, like the Democrats have done in this resolution, we are essentially telling the enemy how much longer they must wait before they can take over. Telegraphing our plans to the enemy is no way to win any conflict.

The supplemental spending bill would impose a timeline for full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by March 2008. By establishing an arbitrary date for withdrawal, Democrats are ignoring the advice of the Iraq Study Group and our commanders on the ground in Iraq, among others.
