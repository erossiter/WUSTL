WASHINGTON, D.C -- U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement regarding President George W. Bushs nomination of Harriet Miers for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. 

The United States Senate has recently demonstrated its commitment to fair and dignified confirmation proceedings and I hope that Harriet Miers nomination will receive the same treatment. Harriet Miers is an accomplished member of the legal community and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure a fair and thorough review process. 

The American people need highly qualified, fair-minded and independent judges who are committed to strictly interpreting the Constitution. I intend to carefully review Harriet Miers credentials to assess her qualifications and commitment to the rule of law.
