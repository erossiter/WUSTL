WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) along with Senator Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) re-introduced the Child Medication Safety Act (S.891), legislation that prohibits making the consumption of psychotropic drugs an educational condition and further protects children and their parents from intrusive government coercion.

Schools and teachers are not equipped to make psychological diagnoses and should not be allowed to require students to take mood-altering drugs in order to continue their education; this is clearly beyond their area of expertise, Senator Inhofe said. This legislation is necessary to protect the rights of our children against improper intrusion and ensures that parents are not required by school personnel to medicate their children.

Senator Inhofes bill protects children and their parents from being forced to administer controlled substances or mood-altering drugs in order to attend a school and makes receipt of federal funds conditional upon compliance with this policy. The bill also calls for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review of what medications are being used to treat children in public schools and the effects of these medications on children.

The bill was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. A copy of Inhofes bill is attached to this press release.
