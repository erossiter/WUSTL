WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement regarding the recent Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) approved management transfer of six major U.S. seaports to Dubai Ports World of the United Arab Emirates. 

Relinquishing management oversight of major U.S. seaports to any foreign company makes little sense when one considers the logical threat this could pose to our national security. The question of foreign ownership of key U.S. businesses is not a new challenge facing our country. Last year I authored a bill and an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill attempting to fix these very loopholes in our foreign investment review process. I also testified before fellow Senate committees requesting that greater scrutiny be applied to foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses that could threaten our national security. 

As I have long stated, the CFIUS process is broken and must be fixed. My legislation called for CFIUS, to report to Congress on a quarterly basis detailed analysis of each transaction reviewed over the previous 90 day period. Increasing Congressional oversight of this process is one of the many ways we can improve its efficacy in protecting our national security. Congress should take a vital step in reforming the CFIUS review process and increasing our national security by passing my legislation. 

Senator Inhofes Foreign Investment Security Act of 2005 (S.1797) was later converted into a Senate Amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. Below is a summary of the Inhofe amendments proposed changes to the CFIUS review process for foreign acquisition of U.S. businesses: 

Extend the time to commence such investigation to 90 days instead of the current 45. 
Require the findings and recommendations of any investigation to be sent immediately to the President and specified congressional committees for review. 
Require certain factors to be considered as part of such investigation, including the effect on domestic production and long-term projections of U.S. requirements for sources of energy and other critical resources. 
Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to report quarterly to such committees a detailed summary and analysis of each transaction being, or likely to be, reviewed. 
Subject the President's decision not to suspend or prohibit a transaction to a congressional approval process
