WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement praising the Senate confirmation of Tim DeGiusti to be the district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma: 

I am pleased to announce that in the final moments before the Senate adjourned for August recess, Tim DeGiusti was confirmed as U.S. federal district court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe said. Tim DeGiusti has led a life of excellence and is no stranger to public service. He is a native Oklahoman and has served his country as trial counsel for the United States Armys Judge Advocate General Corps and in the Army National Guard and the Army Reserves as a military lawyer. 

His resume demonstrates a wide range of legal experience including commercial litigation, business torts, military law, tribal court litigation and employment law. He was listed among the Best Lawyers in America in 2007 and has received the American Bar Associations highest rating of well-qualified. I have every expectation that Tim DeGiusti will be a first-rate federal judge and will serve our nation and Oklahoma well.
