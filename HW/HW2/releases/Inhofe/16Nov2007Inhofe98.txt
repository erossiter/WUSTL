WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement criticizing attempts by Congressional Democrats to include a troop withdrawal deadline in an emergency supplemental bill, the Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Bill (H.R.4156), which failed to attain cloture by a vote of 53-45 today. The Republican alternative emergency supplemental appropriations bill (S.2340), which provided necessary funding for continuing efforts in the War on Terror without a timeline for withdrawal, also failed on a procedural vote by 45-53. 

I am very disappointed that Congressional Democrats once again attempted to withhold funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially at a time when we are turning the corner in Iraq and our troops are making remarkable progress under the leadership of General David Petraeus, Senator Inhofe said. This is not the time for political posturing. Our troops overseas and the future of our armed forces depend on this funding.

As the current war supplemental expires on November 17th, the Department of Defense will be required to start pulling from their non-wartime budget to keep our brave men and women fully-equipped in Iraq and Afghanistan. While fighting the War on Terror, we also cannot forget about our efforts to sustain and transform our armed forces. Forcing the Department of Defense to reprogram funds will jeopardize these efforts and cost us dividends in the future.

It is an absolute travesty that we did not send a clean supplemental bill to the President before recessing for Thanksgiving and I am disappointed that Senate Democrats chose politics over our troops today.

Senator Inhofe spoke on the Senate Floor last night, describing the progress he has seen on the ground in Iraq first-hand and criticizing the fact that some Democrats oppose the war and support arbitrary withdrawal deadlines without having ever visited the country.
