WASHINGTON, D.C.- U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe, (R-Okla) today made the following statement in response to the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission's vote today regarding Fort Sill, Oklahoma. 

I am pleased that today the BRAC Commission voted to support the Department of Defense recommendation for moving the Army Air Defense Artillery School to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The transfer of these air defense artillery units at Fort Bliss, Texas, to Fort Sill will create a minimum of 3,600 jobs in the Lawton area. I believe that the effects of this move will be much greater as families and businesses take root in the Ft. Sill community. This number may again rise as there remains the chance that Ft. Sill may still gain other missions as a result of this BRAC round. 

I look forward to working with both Oklahoma and Department of Defense leaders to ensure that this transfer takes place quickly and with the least stress possible on military personnel and their families.
