WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today made the following statement regarding the death of terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi: 

Todays news is a tremendous shot in the arm for both the U.S. Military and the Iraqi Security Forces. This terrorist was responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and indeed thousands of Iraqi citizens. 

This accomplishment serves as a testament to the increased cooperation we continue to receive from the Iraqi people. The number of Iraqis offering tips to our intelligence people on the ground is rising and today we have seen the fruits of their labor.
