WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement in response to President Bushs address to the nation outlining his plan to accept General Petraeus recommendations and begin reducing the American presence in Iraq.

United States can and must be successful in the War on Terror  surrendering is not an option. President Bush has resolved to follow the strategic advice of military commanders on the ground rather than be swayed by political attempts to micromanage the war from the halls of Congress. During recent months, General Petraeus successfully implemented a surge in troop levels resulting in visible military improvements. His recommendations come from first-hand experience and a distinguished 35-year long career in the U.S. Armed Forces  the President is wise to heed his advice.
