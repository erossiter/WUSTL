WASHINGTON, DC---U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) today issued the following statement on the retirement of Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor. 

Justice OConnor represents the first of what I believe will ultimately be four retirements with Justice OConnor being followed by Rehnquist, Stevens and Ginsburg, in that order. Justice OConnors retirement brings into focus the huge significance of choosing a successor capable of restraining judicial activist tendencies in the Court. A fine choice for Justice OConnors successor would be Judge Janice Rogers Brown, as she possesses these necessary qualities. 

If you revisit the most recent 5-4 vote rulings by the Supreme Court, the significance of Justice OConnors swing vote becomes quite clear. The recent 5-4 rulings to uphold affirmative action, partial birth abortion and prohibit the display of the Ten Commandments all depended on OConnors swing vote. Whomever replaces her has the capacity to change America, that is why it is imperative we confirm the proper successor. 

If you look at the recent Senate confirmation votes for District Court Judges Pryor, Brown, and Owen you will notice some peculiar voting patterns. There are Senators who voted in favor of allowing these judges their up-or-down vote on the Senate floor only to later vote against these nominees. The message there is clear; these Senators have conservative constituents who will not stand for the obstruction of good judges, yet they are attempting to appease liberals in Washington. They are trying to have it both ways. 

America needs, wants, and deserves responsible judges on all levels who strictly interpret the Constitution and do not legislate from the bench. I am looking forward to a fair Senate confirmation of Justice OConnors successor.
