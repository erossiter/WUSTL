WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) today made the following statement in response to the Iraq Study Groups final report. 

While I largely agree with the Iraq Study Groups (ISG) broad assessments of the problems facing U.S. Policy in Iraq, I disagree with some of their suggested solutions. Additionally, many of the specific fixes they propose are neither new nor innovative.

Unlike many Democrats in Congress, today the ISG stated that an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq will only breed more violence, something I have long stated. The ISG is also correct in their conclusion that adding more U.S. troops to the region will secure only a fraction of the country for a limited time. This is not a long-term solution.

Like the ISG, I believe that if we want the Iraqi Security Forces to fight and win, they must be re-equipped with modern military arms, not cold war relics. I saw this first hand in my most recent trip to Fallujah, Iraq.

I think it is nave to suggest that Iran would work with the U.S. to stabilize Iraq without demanding concessions that are dangerous to our national security, such as allowances on their nuclear program or compromises toward their support for Hezbollah. I find it hard to believe that Iran would support a democratically elected Iraq since they are now trying to overthrow a democratically elected Lebanon.

I am concerned that some of the recommendations seemingly run counter to what the new Secretary of Defense believes. In particular, the ISG report recommends that the Department of Defense continue to lead the training of the Iraqi Security Forces. However, in recent congressional testimony, Dr. Gates stated that he is uncertain that this is the best way forward.

We must set the conditions for success in Iraq, provide our military leaders everything they say they need to succeed, and demand that our military leaders deliver that success. 

Whatever needs to take place, should take place, but giving dangerous concessions to Iran and Syria is not acceptable and will ultimately only serve to weaken the national security of the United States.

I agree with the ISG that our goal is an Iraq that can govern, sustain, and defend itself. Furthermore, I concur that the success of this hinges greatly on the actions of the Iraqi people.
