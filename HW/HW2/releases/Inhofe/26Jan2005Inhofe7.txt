WASHINGTON, D.C.---Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) - Following are excerpts of statements made in support of Dr. Condoleezza Rices nomination for U.S. Secretary of State. The Senate today confirmed Dr. Rices nomination by a 85-13 vote. Dr. Condoleezza Rice is no stranger to the international scene. Her long record of accomplishments is well-known to all of us, and her record of exemplary service to this country is without parallel. ... 

As President Bushs National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice has played a vital role in protecting our nation both here and abroad, while providing the President with everything he needed to know to defend the American people and advance the cause of freedom. The experience, along with her prior knowledge, makes Dr. Rice the ideal Secretary of State for these difficult times. ... 

Being Secretary of State is one of the toughest jobs I can imagine. The person in that job has to be an expert on everything, from Albania to Zimbabwe. Over the last twenty-five years, Dr. Rice has studied foreign policy in the academy and lived foreign policy in the trenches, and she is a master of both theory and practice. ... 

But Dr. Rice has both the expertise and the vision to chart Americas course in the international community. The path ahead of us is clear. It is a path that Dr. Rice knows, believes in, and can articulate better than anyone else. I have no doubt that she will continue the great tradition of American diplomacy with honor, competence, and the utmost dedication. ... 

You know, I used to say that Richard Nixon was the guy who really knew foreign policy. He could stand up and talk for two and a half hours without any notes - Condoleezza Rice can do the same thing. She is brilliant, she's the right choice...
