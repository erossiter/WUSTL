WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) made the following statement praising todays failure of the Senate Democrats most recent amnesty legislation, the DREAM Act (S.2205).

Though Americans across the political spectrum weighed in on this issue during debate on the immigration bill in June, Senate Democrats once again overlooked the will of the people and attempted to push through a path to amnesty for illegal immigrants. 

This bill undermines the rule of law by expediting the path to citizenship for some of the illegal immigrants in our country. As Ive said before, any shortcut provided to illegal immigrants is simply an injustice to those immigrants who have gone about the citizenship process legally. Furthermore, the attempts by some on the other side of the aisle to cloak this legislation as a humanitarian gesture were simply disingenuous.
