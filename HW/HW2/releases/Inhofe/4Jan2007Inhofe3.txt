WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Jim M. Inhofe (R-OK) today took to the Senate floor to introduce his bill (S.113) demanding that the new Congress immediately complete action on the Military Construction Act of 2007 (H.R. 5385). The Military Construction Act of 2007 was overwhelmingly authorized by both chambers of Congress last October but was not completed. The following are excerpts from Senator Inhofes floor speech (as prepared for delivery):

  The partisan issues that some people are trying to tie up the floor with are nowhere near as important as this. The other appropriations bills can be dealt with through a continuing resolution, but military construction cannot. This is a crisis! This is about supporting our troops. That phrase gets thrown around a lot, and sometimes it is abused. But make no mistake, Military Construction and Quality of Life directly affects the foundation of our Armed Forces. It is the literal bedrock of training, movement and readiness. It provides the roofs over the heads of our soldiers and their families. It funds the programs of our supporting infrastructure. It is the keystone of our militarys present stability and the lynchpin of our future modernization plan. And the fact is we are at war.

Over the past few years the military has sought to reshape itself out of its Cold War footing and into a modern, more modular force. It has also tried to reconstitute its equipment, exercising cost savings where it could, while at the same time as fighting a war in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been forced to come to Congress with supplemental funding requests just to meet the bare minimum of these requirements. We have stretched them every way we can, cutting into almost every program. Essential initiatives like the Future Combat Systems have been moved far to the right as we adjust the militarys requirements to conform to our fiscal comfort level.




The Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction and Quality of Life Appropriations Bill was not passed into law. The Continuing Resolution, as currently enacted, does not allow the Department of Defense to proceed with over $17 billion in new construction and BRAC projects authorized by Congress in the 2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. 

  We have recruited and retained the soldiers, purchased individual force protection equipment, repaired and replaced weapons, and established a training plan, but now we are faced with the real possibility of not having facilities ready for training, maintenance, communications and command activities. We will have soldiers at installations across the country that are ready to fight, ready to lead and ready to defend this country, but wont have adequate places to train, work, and sleep.

Every action we take in this area has far-reaching ramifications that directly affect our warfighter and our success in the War on Terror. And the fact is that by procrastinating we are not saving any money. We are delaying what has to be built anyway, robbing Peter to pay Paul. And we will end up paying morethe Continuing Resolution undermines predictability and efficiencies which will result in higher construction costs. The Air Force estimates cost increases of 5-10% for every year we wait. 

Yet our problem is not benign as a simple waste of money. During the 1990s we allowed our military infrastructure to suffer through inadequate funding. We cant afford to do this again. The first action of this Congress should be to pass this legislation. If it does not then the first action of this Congress will have been to dramatically cut defense funding to military families and readiness. This is the infrastructure of our national security, these are soldiers lives, and they deserve better!

Senator Inhofe is currently adding cosponsors to his bill and will work to secure a vote by the end of next week.
