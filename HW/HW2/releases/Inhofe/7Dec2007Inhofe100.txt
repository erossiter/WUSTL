WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI) today announced the passage of their resolution commemorating the 66th anniversary of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

Every American owes a debt of gratitude to the men and women who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Inhofe said. They gave all they had in selfless service to the nation. We recognize the contributions and sacrifice of the survivors of the attack who went on to secure our freedom and our cherished way of life. In the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges and countless unknowns, they never demanded praise, they never presumed eminence. 

They taught future generations the importance of recognizing and remaining vigilant against tyranny in all forms. We also remember the families of the fallen service members. They bore the greatest burden and bravely perpetuated the dignity and the memories of the heroes taken from us on that infamous day.

Senator Akaka:

This Wednesday, my good friend and colleague Senator Inhofe and I introduced a Senate Resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding National Pearl Harbor Remembrance day and paying tribute to those service members and civilians who died in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 as well as the current members of the Pearl Harbor Survivor association, Akaka said. I also had the honor of attending the Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day Ceremony hosted by the White House Commission on Remembrance.

On this day, the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, I urge the citizens of this nation to remember that it was the sacrifices made by ordinary men and women who rallied in defense of freedom, liberty, and the great promise of our democracy that preserved our nations freedom and liberty. Their sacrifices represent the greatest heroism and patriotism in the service of our country.

On December 7, 1941 the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force attacked the United States on its own soil at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While more than 2,400 Americans, both service members and civilians, were killed there are over 4,900 who compose the membership of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.
