	Deal will Allow Wilmington Post Office to Stay in Current Location until New Facility is Ready                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wilmington, DE – After several months of talks and negotiations, Senator Tom Carper has successfully facilitated a deal between Wilmington Trust and the United States Postal Service (USPS) that will allow the Wilmington Post Office to remain in its Rodney Square location until its new location is available.    

“I am thrilled that Wilmington Trust has agreed to a lease extension for the Wilmington Post Office and thank them for their willingness to act in the best interests of the City of Wilmington,” said Senator Carper. “This extension will save taxpayers money and ensure that residents and businesses in Wilmington have access to uninterrupted quality postal services.  I would also like to thank Mayor Jim Baker for his invaluable assistance.”   

In June 2004, it was announced that Wilmington Trust did not plan to extend their lease with the Wilmington Post Office past September 2005.  Concerns mounted over where the post office would relocate.  Shortly thereafter, Senator Carper, along with the rest of the Delaware Delegation, wrote a letter to Post Master General Potter expressing support for the post office to stay within downtown city limits and was subsequently told that it was the USPS’s goal to keep the post office in Wilmington.    

In April 2005, Senator Carper, who sits on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that has jurisdiction over the postal service, was approached by the USPS and asked to contact Wilmington Trust to request a lease extension.  Senator Carper then met with Ted Cecala, Chair and CEO of Wilmington Trust.  In the meeting, the Senator requested that Wilmington Trust consider the lease extension for economic development, financial and continuity of mail services reasons.  In subsequent meetings with Senator Carper and his staff, the two parties were able to work out an agreement that will allow the Wilmington Post Office to remain in their present location until November 2006. ### Return
