	Calls for Bi-Partisan Solution to Reduce Global Warming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON (February 2, 2007) -- Senator Tom Carper today issued the following statement on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.  The panel, consisting of nearly 2,500 scientists from more than 130 nations, today announced findings suggesting that it is “very likely” that human activities - led by the burning of fossil fuels – are directly related to global warming.  The report represents the most authoritative science on global warming to date.  
“This report is further proof that global warming is real and that our planet is already feeling its effects.  We have ignored this problem for far too long and we must begin to take steps to curb the activities that cause global warming.  
We have passed the tipping point in terms of the environmental debate and we must work together to solve this problem.  There is growing support in the Senate for taking steps to reduce the types of activities that contribute to global warming and I am committed to working with my colleagues – both Democrat and Republican – to forge common sense legislation that will help ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a planet that is both healthy and sustainable.”  
Senator Carper is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, and plans to re-introduce in the next several weeks legislation that would dramatically reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide.    ### Return
