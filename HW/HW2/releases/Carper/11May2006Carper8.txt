The Senator will start his morning by participating in the 2006 Ozone Kickoff, presented by The Air Quality Partnership of Delaware. The Partnership educates the public on the health hazards of air pollution.  On May 3, 2006, saying we need to do more to reduce air pollution and begin to address global warming, Sen. Carper and a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on the floor of the United States Senate that would significantly reduce mercury and ozone pollution from power plants, while setting the nation’s first-ever carbon dioxide cap.  Carper is the ranking Democrat on the Senate clean air subcommittee and will outline his proposed legislation at the event.  

Senator Carper will then head to Harrington to recognize volunteers of the Retired Seniors Volunteer Program (RSVP).   Since 1973, RSVP has been inviting seniors to get involved in their communities.  Volunteers decide how and where they want to serve, including tutoring, building houses, planting community gardens, and offering relief services.  Over 350 seniors will be attending the luncheon and about 12 awards will be presented.    

Finally, the Senator will visit the newly opened office of the American Red Cross of Southern Delmarva.  He will tour the new office and talk with Red Cross disaster volunteers who provided help to Hurricane Katrina victims.  On April 10th, Senator Carper was in New Orleans, where he was part of a Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management field hearing to examine reports of inflated prices, excessive layers of contracting and inadequate oversight of three key programs related to the recovery effort along the Gulf Coast at the Supreme Court Building in New Orleans. The Senator will discuss the findings with those volunteers and hear about their experiences, as the 2006 hurricane season begins in just over two weeks.
