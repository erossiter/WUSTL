This project will realign Wyoming Mill Road so that it intersects with Hazlettville Road at the entrance to the Village of Westover.  This will result in three improvements to the City of Dover.  First, 12.5 acres of land will be donated to the City of Dover to annex to Schutte Park, which is much needed space for thousands of children who play soccer, softball and baseball at Schutte Park throughout the year.  It will also create a signalized intersection, solving morning rush hour problems for the residents of Village of Westover. Lastly, moving the road also moves the existing intersection further away from the main entrance to Schutte Park, making both intersections safer for drivers.      

As a member of the congressional committee that crafted the final transportation bill, Senator Carper helped secure a 30 percent increase in Delaware’s highway and safety projects.
