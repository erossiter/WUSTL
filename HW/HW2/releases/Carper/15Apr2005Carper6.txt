The series of fairs are free and open to the public.  Free mortgage pre-qualifications will be available and representatives from every step of the home-buying process will be on hand to provide information and answer questions. Registration begins at 8:45 a.m. and home-buyer education seminars begin at 9:30 a.m.      

This statewide strategy was developed in partnership with the Fannie Mae (FNM/NYSE) Corporation and Senator Carper, with major assistance from Delaware Federation for Housing Counselors, various lenders, and local churches.     

The three-part process works in the following way:    
·        Homeownership workshops are sponsored by trusted neighborhood organizations, such as churches;    
·        Those interested can register for follow-up housing counseling sessions with Delaware Federation for Housing Counselors;    
·        Once the mortgage is ready, the customer’s loan file may be transmitted electronically from Home Counselor online to a participating lending partner, thereby streamlining the mortgage application process.
