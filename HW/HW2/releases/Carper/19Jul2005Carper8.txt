	 WASHINGTON (July 19, 2005) - Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement on President Bush's decision to nominate Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to the Supreme Court:    
   "I look forward to examining Judge Roberts' legal record over the next several weeks.  With so much at stake, I think it's important that we don't rush to judgment, one way or the other.   We now have a responsibility to fill in the Senate - to fully vet Judge Roberts' record and question him about his judicial philosophies and opinions on some of the most important legal issues facing this country.     Judge Roberts has big shoes to fill.  Sandra Day O'Connor was a principled, fair justice, and we need to make sure that whoever fills her vacancy is of similar  character."     ### Return
