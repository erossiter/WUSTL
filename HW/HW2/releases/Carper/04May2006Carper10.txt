Students will be in attendance as well.  The Senator will offer remarks and participate in Q about this year’s theme, "Separate Branches, Balanced Powers."      

Senator Carper then heads to Kent County to participate in the Foster Grandparents Annual Recognition Luncheon.  About 500 seniors take time out of their schedules to be foster grandparents and the Senator will be there to thank them for their commitment to children and the community.      

The Senator will then help celebrate National Charter School Week with a visit to Positive Outcomes Charter School.   The Senator will visit every classroom and talk with students and teachers about the role charter schools play in Delaware.  He will also help give out the “Student of the Month” awards. Positive Outcomes was founded in 1996 and provides educational opportunities for students who have experienced academic difficulty in a traditional school setting. For the past nine years, they have served children from throughout the state of Delaware.  Now 66 graduates of Positive Outcomes Charter School are living, working, and going to college in Delaware and nearby states.  Carper is a long-time advocate of charter schools and as Governor, his administration created the legislation that guides charter schools in Delaware.    
The Senator will then see progress being made on the Veteran’s Home in Milford.   The official groundbreaking was in August of last year and the building is scheduled to open in December 2006.  The 100,000 square foot building will provide a home for 150 of our veterans and will be able to staff 200.  This $29 million project received 65% of its funding from the federal government, which is $19.4 million, and the state provided the rest.  The Senator will be joined by Anthony Davila, the Director of the Delaware Commission of Veteran’s Affairs.
