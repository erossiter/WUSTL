	 WILMINGTON, DE (June 30, 2005) – Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., issued the following statement on today’s announcement that Bank of America will purchase MBNA:    
“MBNA is a world-renowned credit card company with strong ties to Delaware’s economy and its people.  In discussions with Bank of America this morning, I urged company officials to recognize and appreciate MBNA’s history in Delaware and its expertise in the credit card world as the merger progresses.  MBNA’s first-rate infrastructure and employee base should be valuable assets to Bank of America and should lessen potential job losses in our state.  

As proof of the value the company places on the Delaware operation, Bank of America has already named Bruce Hammonds, MBNA’s CEO, to head the merged company’s credit card operation, which will be based in Wilmington.    

Delaware remains a great place to do business and I look forward to working with Bank of America as it continues MBNA’s tradition of innovation, charitable giving and community service here at home.”  ### Return
