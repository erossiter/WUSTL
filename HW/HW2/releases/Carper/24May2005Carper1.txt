	 WASHINGTON (May 24, 2005) -- Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement about the compromise reached last night by a bipartisan group of senators to avert a showdown in the Senate over judicial nominees:    

“Overall, this compromise is good news for the American people.  It will preserve our government’s system of checks and balances and ensure that the Senate will not become a rubber stamp for the president’s judicial nominees.  It also sends a clear message to the president that he must consult with Congress -- not only on the issues of judges but on legislation, too.  If he works with the Senate and thoughtfully engages Democrats when nominating judges, the Senate will likely confirm them.  If he works with the Senate to develop common-sense legislation and foster goodwill between the two parties, then there’s a lot we can get done.  I hope the trust that helped forge this compromise can be transferred to solving the most important issues facing this country:  controlling the costs of health care, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, winning the war on terror and improving our nation’s air quality.  With this compromise, the prognosis for progress on Capitol Hill is better, and we can now get to work.”
