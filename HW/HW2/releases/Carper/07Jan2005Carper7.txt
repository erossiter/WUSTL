	Professional Counseling Resources to receive money for mentors to children of prisoners                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Wilmington, DE – To help celebrate National Mentoring Month, Senator Tom Carper and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Director for Faith-Based Initiatives Robert J. Polito will present Professional Counseling Resources with a $2.1 million check to help provide mentors to children of prisoners on Monday, January 10, 2005.       

This grant is part of a $45.6 million nationwide program aimed at helping some of the two million children who have at least one incarcerated parent.  In 2004, the Delaware Delegation –Senators Joe Biden and Tom Carper and Congressman Mike Castle—wrote letters of support for Professional Counseling Resources and worked closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to help secure this money.      
Research has found that significant physical absence of a parent has profound effects on child development. Children of incarcerated parents are seven times more likely to become involved in the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems. Parental arrest and confinement often lead to stress, trauma, stigmatization and separation problems for children. These problems may be compounded by existing poverty, violence, substance abuse, high-crime environments, child abuse and neglect, multiple caregivers and/or prior separations.     
The grants are administered through U.S. Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, which received 581 applications this year for new grant money. The mentoring children of prisoners program is a three-year initiative fully funded this year by Congress. So far, approximately 6,000 kids have been mentored, with an expectation of 33,000 additional youth served as a result of these grants.     
As Governor, Carper helped recruit thousands of mentors as part of the Creative Mentoring program and was actively involved in recruiting individuals and corporations to mentor Delaware's at-risk children.
