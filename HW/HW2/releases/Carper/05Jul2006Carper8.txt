The Senator will start his day with a canoe tour of Blackbird Creek Estuarine Reserve to learn more about nature conservancy and how federal appropriations have improved the area.  With almost $4 million in federal funding secured by the Delaware Delegation this tour will allow the Senator to view the changes and learn about future appropriations requests from The Nature Conservancy.  The State has matched these funds.      Senator Carper will be joined by DNREC Secretary John Hughes, members of Delaware Coastal Management and Delaware Fish and Wildlife, and officials from The Nature Conservancy     Conservation for this area is a collaborative effort that will help protect core forests, farms, and wetlands in Southern New Castle County.  Senator Carper has long been a leader in preserving Delaware’s natural habitats and protecting our environment.       Senator Carper will head to New Castle Senior Center, where he will eat lunch with members, make brief remarks, and tour the facility.      Next stop is a tour of BrightFields, a new environmental remediation company in Wilmington.  Formed in 2003, BrightFields’ slogan is “We turn brownfields into brightfields.” The Senator will meet with employees and tour the new Justison Landing site.  Currently, BrightFields (formerly WIK Associates) is implementing DNREC’s Final Plan of Remedial Action and performing remediation activities, Environmental Health & Safety Monitoring and Soil and Groundwater Management during construction of the Justison Landing project.       The Senator will then end his night by kicking off two events: first, for the Tour de Lance, where nearly 1000 participants are expected; second, serving the first ball and making remarks at the opening night of Delaware Smash, featuring Anna Kournikova.
