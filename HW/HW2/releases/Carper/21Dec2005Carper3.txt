Tom Carper, D-Del., issued the following statement after the Senate voted against proceeding to the fiscal 2006 defense spending bill because it included controversial language allowing oil and gas drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).      

“A bill designed to fund our troops should do just that – fund the troops.  It shouldn’t be used as a vehicle to pressure senators into voting for something as controversial as allowing oil and gas drilling in Alaska.  We all support our troops, and we shouldn't leave town until we pass a better and 'clean' defense spending bill.  Sen. Stevens should abide by his promise to take out the Alaska oil-drilling language so that we can provide our troops with the resources they need.  Our troops deserve no less.”
