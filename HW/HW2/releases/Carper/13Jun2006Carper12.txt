	  WASHINGTON (June 13, 2006) – Delaware’s congressional delegation – Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper and Rep. Mike Castle – today released the following statement on the Air Force Accident Investigation Board’s report on the April 3rd C-5 crash near Dover Air Force Base:  
“The investigation by the Air Force has been thorough, and we are satisfied with the results.   We look forward to working with the Air Force to make sure there is a comprehensive review and update of all training procedures as needed.  As we expected, the C-5 continues to be one of the safest planes in the air.  The report by the Air Force appears to confirm that the new avionics equipment installed in the C-5 had nothing to do with the crash, and we believe there is every reason to continue with the modernization program.”  ### Return
