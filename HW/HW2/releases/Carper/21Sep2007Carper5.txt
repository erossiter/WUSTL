	Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement early this morning concerning the shooting of two Delaware State University students in Dover early this morning. Sen. Carper said:  One week ago today, I was fortunate to join a number of Delaware State students and DSU President Allen Sessoms on a far happier occasion to celebrate the passage of the Higher Education Act.  Today our hearts are heavy again, as they were a month ago, following the murder of three Delaware State students in New Jersey.  Last nights shootings are unimaginable for a college that has been through so much tragedy. We will continue to pray for the two students who were injured and the entire Del State family. ### Return
