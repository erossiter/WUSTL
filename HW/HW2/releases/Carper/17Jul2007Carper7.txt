Funding for these projects was included in the FY 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill which has been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration before it is reconciled with similar bills passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.Once the final Senate/House compromise bill is passed, Congress sends the funding bills to the president for final approval.  Our beaches have built a tremendous national reputation over the years, said Sen. Biden. Theyre an integral part of our tourism industry and a beautiful and vibrant piece of our ecosystem. Im glad we are able to help them remain as the standard by which other coastlines are measured.  The rivers, ocean and beaches in Delaware a source of pride for all Delawareans, said Sen. Carper.It is a privilege to work with Sen. Biden to continue preservation of our natural treasures.
