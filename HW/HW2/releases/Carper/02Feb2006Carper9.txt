	 WILMINGTON – “Bank of America’s decision proves once again what those of us in Delaware know so well – that our state is a great place to do business. Throughout the merger process, I assured officials with both Bank of America and MBNA that Delaware and its elected officials would come through for them – that we’d be able to do what was necessary to address the new bank’s various needs.     

My thanks to the governor, the state legislature and all the concerned citizens who helped make this happen.  Also, thank you to Bank of America and MBNA for putting their trust in Delaware.  Although today's announcement is certainly great news for our state, it's still unclear how the merger will affect jobs here at home.  I pledge to continue working with the governor and other interested parties to provide Bank of America whatever assistance is necessary to ensure job security in the First State." ### Return
