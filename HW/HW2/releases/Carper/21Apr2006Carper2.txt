                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Wilmington, DE – On Monday, April 24, 2006, Senator Tom Carper will spend the day in New Castle County.    

Senator Carper will start off his day at the official groundbreaking at the Wilmington Senior Center’s Lafayette Court Senior Apartments.  Named after General Lafayette, who used the original site to plan the Battle of the Brandywine, the original Section 8 apartments were closed in January 2002 due to lack of handicapped accessibility and a configuration that was no longer adequate for providing the type of housing now needed by the elderly.  With a new architectural design, there are 18 new units, five efficiencies and 13 one-bedroom units. Among the new features are elevators, updated bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms and major upgrades of all mechanical, electrical, heating, air conditioning and plumbing systems. Senator Carper helped secure $700,000 in federal funding for the $2,125,020 project.   Senator Carper will also be joined by Congressman Mike Castle, Mayor Jim Baker and State Senator Margaret Rose Henry.  

The Senator will meet with 15 Bosnian students who are here as part of the Delaware 4-H/Bosnia Youth Leadership Program. The program, designed to help participants understand the concepts of civic participation and the responsibilities of citizens in a democracy and allow them to develop leadership skills among secondary school students in Bosnia, has been sponsored annually since 1999 by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo. This year, Delaware 4-H was selected from among many applicants to host the program. The Bosnian students arrived in the U.S. on April 9, 2006 and will depart on May 6, 2006.
