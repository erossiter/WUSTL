Tom Carper, D-Del., will discuss his views on the president’s Social Security plan with seniors in Georgetown on Monday, March 7th.  Carper has said Republicans and Democrats should keep an open mind on how to restructure Social Security to make it stronger for both old and young workers alike, but he has come out against the president’s privatization initiative, saying it would increase the nation’s debt and cut benefits for seniors.
