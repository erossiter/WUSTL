	 Delawares Congressional Delegation, Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper (both D-Del.) and Congressman Mike Castle (R-Del.), today announced that the United States Department of Education has awarded $456,000 in federal TRIO Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Grants to the University of Delaware ($225,000) and Delaware State University ($231,000) to help prepare disadvantaged students prepare for doctoral study.  The University of Delaware and Delaware State University were awarded the grants to support the schools' projects designed to provide effective preparation for doctoral study to disadvantaged college students with strong academic potential. These services are offered through research opportunities, seminars, and other activities such as summer internships, tutoring, academic counseling, assistance in securing graduate admission and financial aid, mentoring, and exposure to cultural events.  The overall goal of the program is to increase the number of students from these underrepresented segments of society in doctoral programs. As a delegation, we have supported TRIO grants for a long time, said Biden, Carper, and Castle. TRIO programs offer assistance for low-income students to help them get the most from their college education.The delegation will continue to fight for these students  there is no more deserving recipient of this help than someone seeking to increase his or her knowledge.  The University of Delaware is appreciative of the support of the U.S. Department of Education and Delawares congressional delegation for this important program that is making such a difference in the lives of students, UD President Patrick Harker said. Were particularly proud of the fact that since the McNair Scholars Program began at UD, 100 percent of our participating scholars have been admitted to graduate school and obtained funding to pursue their goals.  DSU President Allen L. Sessoms said the federal Trio McNair Grant helps the Delaware State University fulfill its mission as a land-grant institution to provide opportunities for students that are not from an economically prosperous background. This TRIO McNair Grant not only assists disadvantaged college students, but also helps them shoot for the stars beyond undergraduate and masters degree program, Dr. Sessoms said. This funding helps us focus these students on higher standards of excellence that will put them in a position to make great impacts in their profession and in the world. ### Return
