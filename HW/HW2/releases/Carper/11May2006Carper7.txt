The Senator will start his morning with a visit to LLuminari, Inc.  LLuminari Inc. is a prestigious network of the best-known evidence-based health experts who believe that communicating about health is as important as practicing medicine. They work as a team to form a more complete understanding of health – across medical disciplines, schools of thought, genders and ethnicities. Their integrated, multi-media programs reach communities, employees and consumers through the generous support of corporate partners.   

Named to evoke the idea of illumination, LLuminari was founded by two of the country’s leading surgeons and communicators, Susan Love, M.D. and Nancy Snyderman, M.D., along with Elizabeth Browning, a former DuPont Company executive with a passion for health.  Since its creation, LLuminari has grown to be the most prestigious team of health communicators. Today, nearly 30 experts collaborate on original content and programming for all media – print, television, on-line and radio. LLuminari is an independent team and does not endorse specific products or services. Its programs are made possible by corporate sponsorships.  

Senator Carper will then participate in the rededication of the Wilmington Head Start Northeast Center in honor of the late Executive Director, Leslie Johnson.  Wilmington Head Start’s Northeast Center will be renamed the Leslie A. Johnson Center.  Ms. Johnson was the Executive Director of Wilmington Head Start from 1983-1998.   She died suddenly in August 2004.  It was her vision that prompted the purchase of the building through funding from the city of Wilmington and other groups. In addition to her family, Mayor Baker will also be in attendance.   

The Senator then presents a keynote lecture at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce Environmental committee Monthly Meeting.  On May 3, 2006, saying we need to do more to reduce air pollution and begin to address global warming, Sen. Carper and a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on the floor of the United States Senate that would significantly reduce mercury and ozone pollution from power plants, while setting the nation’s first-ever carbon dioxide cap.  Carper is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Clean Air Subcommittee and will outline his proposed legislation at the event.
