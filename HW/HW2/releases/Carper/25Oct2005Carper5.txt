	 WASHINGTON (October 24, 2005) – Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today released the following statement on the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank:      

 “Mr. Bernanke has some big shoes to fill.  During his 18-year tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan has been a principled and thoughtful steward of our country's fiscal policy.    

Mr. Bernanke has an impressive resume, having served in the public and private sectors, as well as academia.  With our budget deeply in the red, gas prices at record highs, and fears of inflation beginning to rise, Mr. Bernanke may face challenges on several fronts.  I look forward to hearing his views on these important issues, as well as the future of the housing market and regulation of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), when he appears before the Senate Banking Committee later this year.”
