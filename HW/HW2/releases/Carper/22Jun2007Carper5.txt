	U.S. Senators Joe Biden (D-DE) and Tom Carper (D-Del.), co-sponsored legislation this week that will set aside the week of June 29th to July 6th as National Clean Beaches Week, a national effort to highlight the importance of clean, sustainable beaches in American life. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent.  According to Biden, the health and vitality of Delawares beaches are crucial to the states economic and recreational well-being.  People from all over the country come to Delaware to enjoy our beaches, and we must do all we can to ensure that our beaches remain among the cleanest in America, said Senator Biden. Beaches are not just places to relax with our families. They are habitats for wildlife, vital resources that need to be protected by their caretakers: you and me. I hope this week shines light on the work necessary to maintain our pristine coastline.  Delawares beaches are a natural treasure. Every summer millions of people enjoy the sands, waves, ocean breezes and friendly atmosphere, said Sen. Tom Carper. National Clean Beaches Week provides an opportunity for Delaware to showcase the beauty of our coastline and our continued efforts to protect the state's many treasures.  About six million tourists are expected to visit the Delaware beaches this summer, contributing an estimated total of nearly $1 billion dollars to the states economy.  Delaware has 24.5 miles of beaches, nearly half of which are contained within state parks. They are the states most popular recreation areas and were rated by the Clean Beaches Council as among the cleanest in the nation. ### Return
