	 WASHINGTON (July 7, 2005) – Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., issued the following statement today regarding the series of bombings in London earlier this morning:  

“My heart goes out to the people of London, especially to those families who have lost loved ones today.  These attacks are yet another tragic reminder of the world we live in, and why we need to remain vigilant against terrorism.    

Today is also a reminder that we need to take every necessary precaution to protect our subways, rail and transit systems from potential attacks.  Since September 11th, many of us in Congress have worked to pass legislation that would better secure our transportation networks and provide additional funds to hire more security guards and purchase more bomb-sniffing dogs, surveillance cameras and other emergency equipment.  Unfortunately, Congress has failed act -- even after last year’s devastating attacks in Madrid that left almost 200 people dead.    

Amtrak and our commuter railroads are doing all they can to keep riders safe, but the federal government needs to do its job and provide additional resources.  I will continue to work with my colleagues this year to make sure that the federal government is doing all it can to keep our rail and transit systems as secure as possible.”
