Senator Carper will help the Dover Little League kick off its 50th year of little league play by presenting a congratulatory letter from the President of the United States and the American flag that flew over the Capitol in honor of Dover Little League.       
The Senator will then join prospective homeowners at Mt Zion AME Church for a faith based homeownership fair.  These fairs are being held in every county to help increase homeownership rates among minorities using new outreach strategies and technology to streamline the home-buying process.    
Based around the faith-based communities in Delaware, these fairs are free and open to the public.  Free mortgage pre-qualifications will be available and representatives from every step of the home-buying process will be on hand to provide information and answer questions.  Registration begins at 8:45 a.m. and homebuyer education seminars begin at 9:30 a.m.
