	Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement late Monday, noting that last year his family visited the campus with their son while touring prospective colleges:    The events at Virginia Tech are heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who were killed and injured today. I join with the people of Delaware and the nation in sending our sympathy and support in this difficult time.### Return
