Senator Carper is donating to help kick off the Blood Bank’s Summer Blood Challenge.  Created in 2003, the Summer Blood Challenge is a way to increase blood donations and blood bank membership among local companies and organizations during summer months, when, due to vacation schedules, the Blood Bank finds it more difficult to recruit the 300 blood donors needed every day on the Delmarva Peninsula.   

“It is important for the community to be reminded of the importance of blood donation,” said Senator Carper.  “I know many companies are invested in this successful effort.  I am proud to announce that my Delaware staff is competing in the Challenge this year and I hope my donation encourages others to get involved.”    

The Summer Blood Challenge runs through September 3rd, and participating companies compete for points by signing up new blood bank members, getting people to donate blood, and having people participate in the 5K on July 23rd, sponsored by the Blood Bank.    

The Blood Bank of Delmarva needs 300 donors every day to meet the demands of local hospitals.  Emergencies happen every day, and blood donors help ensure that Delaware is prepared to deal with such emergencies.  Accident victims, children with leukemia, and surgery and cancer patients depend on blood donors to contribute.  Last year, more than 20,000 patients were helped with the 75,000 donations given by volunteer donors.    

Blood donation only takes about an hour; the donation itself is between five and seven minutes.  To give blood, you must be 17 or older, weigh at least 110 pounds, and be in general good health.  To schedule an appointment, please call 1-888-8-BLOOD-8.
