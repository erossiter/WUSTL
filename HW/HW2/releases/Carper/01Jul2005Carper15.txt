Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement on the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor:  

“As the first woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O’Connor is a pioneer and an inspiration.   During her 24 years on the court, Justice O’Connor has been a thoughtful and principled judge, one whose opinions, more often than not, represented the center of the court and the majority of Americans.  It’s my hope that President Bush appoints someone like Justice O’Connor to replace her, someone who will defy traditional political labels and act as an independent and moderate voice on a deeply divided court.  

I also hope the president engages and consults with the Senate in choosing Justice O’Connor’s successor.  After a long and hard fight earlier this year over other federal court nominees, it’s imperative that the president reach out to the Senate to find a consensus candidate that can bring this country together.”
