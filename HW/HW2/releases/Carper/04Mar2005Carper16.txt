Tom Carper, D-Del., will discuss his views on the president’s Social Security plan with seniors in Georgetown on Monday, March 7th.  Carper has said Republicans and Democrats should keep an open mind on how to restructure Social Security to make it stronger for both old and young workers alike, but he has come out against the president’s privatization initiative, saying it would increase the nation’s debt and cut benefits for seniors.  At the event at the CHEER community center Monday, Carper will speak on the president’s plan, and then follow it up with a Q and A session.    

Senator Carper then heads to Salisbury University, where he will spend the afternoon talking with students.  First, the Senator joins Dr. Janet Dudley-Eshbach, President of the University, and the College Democrats for lunch.  Immediately following, Senator Carper will join President Dudley- Eshbach and Dr. Harry Basehart of Salisbury University’s Institute for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement (PACE), for a joint announcement of an inaugural internship partnership.  This program affords SU students an opportunity to get a unique insider’s look into the political process.  This is SU’s first internship program with a Delaware politician.  Finally, Senator Carper will deliver a lecture to the American National Government Class, which is a freshman level political science class.
