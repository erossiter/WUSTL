Wilmington, DE – Senator Tom Carper will spend Thursday, August 18, 2005, in Kent County, Delaware.      
Senator Carper will help recognize 120 Delaware State Parks AmeriCorps volunteers for their work at a celebration in Dover.  These graduating members increased the protection, promotion, and services available to visitors in Delaware’s State Parks in 2005. As part of an AmeriCorps team, they have provided and expanded high quality recreation, environmental education, cultural and historic programming, and conservation and preservation activities.  They worked as part of the park team, alongside park professionals and volunteers.  Upon successful completion of their service, members receive an educational award which can be used for future educational expenses or for current student loans up to seven (7) years after their completion of service. The Senator will talk about the importance of volunteerism and watch the “Year in Review” presentation.      
Senator Carper will speak at the Capital City Rotary Club Meeting.  The Senator plans to talk about his new role as vice chair for the Democratic Leadership Council, as well as the local economic benefits of the recently-passed transportation and energy bills.     
The Senator will then announce $1 million in federal funding for street enhancement in the proposed Lincoln Park Center.  The City of Dover has been seeking funds to improve the existing road configurations in the growing West Side neighborhood.  The project will further the City and the Delaware Department of Transportation's strategic plan for the West Side, a predominately African-American neighborhood that is currently burdened with inefficient road networks, unused vacant lots, dilapidated and abandoned industrial and commercial buildings, substandard housing.    

The project would extend Clarence Street 750 feet north to the proposed Lincoln Park Center commercial park.  This would create an additional north-south connector between North Street and the Forrest-Loockerman Street Corridor, the two main east-west corridors into downtown Dover and an area that carries nearly 20,000 automobiles a day into and out of the city.  The project will demolish 15 structures currently situated on the future site of the Lincoln Park Center, a major employment and service center anchoring the West Side of downtown.    
The Senator’s last stop of the day will be a tour of Dover’s House of P.R.I.D.E.    The House of P.R.I.D.E. is a non-profit organization dedicated to community revitalization, through empowerment, educational development, housing, and cultural interventions.  It works with substance abusers and their families to help them regain self-sufficiency and to take their place again in society.   The Senator has been to the center numerous times, while Governor and Senator, and is going to learn about their progress and meet some of the clients they serve.
