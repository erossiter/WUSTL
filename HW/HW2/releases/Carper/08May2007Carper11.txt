	Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued a short statement in response to reports this afternoon that the Dover Air Force Base may have been one of the targets of the six people the FBI arrested for an alleged plot to kill soldiers at Ft. Dix, N.J.    At any given time, there are 5,000 to 6,000 active, reserve and civilian personnel at the Dover Air Force Base.    Sen Carper said:    We are constantly working to improve security at Dover Air Force Base, and at American bases throughout the world to address new threats. The disruption of a planned attack on Ft. Dix serves as a valuable, yet chilling reminder of the importance of the ongoing diligence and hard work of our men and women in uniform and in the intelligence community.### Return
