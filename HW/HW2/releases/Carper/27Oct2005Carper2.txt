“I am disappointed that Harriet Miers decided to withdraw her nomination before the Senate had a chance to examine her background and qualifications.  In choosing the next replacement for Justice O'Connor, the president needs to pick a candidate with impeccable qualifications, who also represents the mainstream values of most Americans.  There are many well-qualified, mainstream conservatives the president could choose, and I hope he does that instead of trying to appeal to his conservative base.  Supreme Court nominations have become too much about ideology.  They should be about competence and character.”
