The Senator will be riding along with UPS Delivery Truck Driver Chad Rogers, who has been with UPS for 13 years, employed as a driver for the last six.       The Senator’s next stop is to tour the newly opened Community Bank in Lewes. Opened June 1st in its temporary location, while construction on its permanent location is slated to begin in the fall, the idea of Community Bank Delaware was to create a bank that would take the mystery and intimidation out of banking.     Senator Carper will then head to Laurel Library for a USDA check presentation.  The Senator will be joined by Congressman Mike Castle and USDA Rural Development State Director, Marlene Elliott and they will announce more than $30,000 in federal grant funds that will help pay for furniture to support the recently completed expansion project.  The library held an open house on May 20th to showcase their new state-of-the-art facility, which tripled in size and now supports technology for the 21st century.     Senator Carper’s last stop of the day is at the Bethany Beach National Guard Training Facility, where he will speak to cadets and watch drills of those participating in the Summer Leadership School for the Air Force JROTC Program.   Eighty cadets from six high school programs in Delaware are attending the ten-day Leadership School, where they will practice leadership skills, gain a better understanding of the US Air Force, and work on academics and skills training.
