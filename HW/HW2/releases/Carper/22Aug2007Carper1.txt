	The Delaware Congressional Delegation  Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper (both D-DE) and Rep. Mike Castle (R-DE)  released the following statement today after Gov. Ruth Ann Minner announced that she is requesting a drought disaster declaration for Delaware farmers from the United States Department of Agriculture:  We strongly support Governor Minners request for federal emergency aid to Delawares farmers. When a severe drought strikes, the impact on the economy, the environment and the agricultural sector can be devastating. USDAs assistance during these crucial periods helps the livelihoods of our farmers in Delaware. ### Return
