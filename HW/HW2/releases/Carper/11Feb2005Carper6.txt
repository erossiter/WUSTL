	 WASHINGTON (Feb. 11, 2005) – Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., issued the following statement, clarifying his position on the president’s Social Security plan:  

“I’ve consistently said I would be open to the idea of establishing personal retirement accounts, but not if they result in an increase in our nation’s debt nor a reduction of benefits for seniors.  From what I understand thus far from the president, his proposal does not meet this crucial test.  I believe that our government functions best when both Republicans and Democrats work together to find solutions to common problems, and that’s why I believe it would prudent for Congress and the president to create a truly bipartisan commission, like the one established in 1983, to find a way to strengthen and preserve our Social Security system and increase savings for young and old workers alike.”
