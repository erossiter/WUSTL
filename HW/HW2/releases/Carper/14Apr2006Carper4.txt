Senator Carper will start his day off by helping to announce $500,000 in federal funding that was awarded to Compact Membrane Systems, Inc.  The Delaware Delegation helped to secure the funding for CMS’s ethanol research and has been supportive of CMS’s efforts to create clean diesel technology and reduction of nitrogen oxide in non-road diesel engines.    

CMS will demonstrate their biodiesel engine, built to burn cleaner and cooler, reducing nitrogen oxide formations by more that 50%.  These newly created membranes are more effective, have longer life, and lower operating costs than alternatives.   

They will also be discussing the polymer membrane package for producing ethanol, which will help slow down carbon dioxide rates in the air, helping to mitigate global warming.  In addition, CMS’s technology will help the United States provide environmentally responsible energy, less dependence on foreign oil, and replace potentially harmful MTBE.   

CMS is a technology development company in Wilmington.  Learn more at www.compactmembrane.com.   

The Senator will then speak to a hundred seniors at the Academy of Life Long Learning at the University of Delaware about current events.  He will talk about the Middle East and immigration. There also will be a question-and-answer session following.    

Senator Carper will end his day by joining Mayor Baker, Lt. Governor Carney, and Rob and Chris Buccini for the ribbon cutting at The Residences at Christina Landing.
