	Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) is a co-sponsor of the Restoring Truth in Regulator Travel Act introduced today by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). In the wake of revelations about 30 trips taken by the current and previous Chairs of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that were funded by industries they regulate, the legislation would prohibit such travel for federal regulators.The reports of the industry-funded travel come as the CPSC is under intense scrutiny for allowing toys containing lead into the hands of American children.This is good, common-sense consumer legislation, said Sen. Carper. We are demanding more transparency for congressional travel, and the same should be expected of the appointed officials charged with protecting consumer products for all Americans.Other co-sponsors include Sens. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), and Barack Obama (D-IL).### Return
