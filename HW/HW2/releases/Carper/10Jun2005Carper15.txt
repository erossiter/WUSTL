Senator Carper has been a strong advocate for charter schools. The first piece of legislation he sponsored as a Senator was the "Empowering Parents Act", a measure encouraging choice for students trapped in failing schools. It passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support and was included in the landmark education legislation signed by President Bush.
