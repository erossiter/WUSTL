	Bill Would Expand Federal Research into Life-Saving ArenaWASHINGTON (July 18, 2006) – Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today praised Senate passage of legislation (on a 63-37 vote) that would expand federal research of stem cells:  

“Stems cells hold a great deal of promise for people who are affected by a wide variety of conditions from paralysis to juvenile diabetes to Parkinson’s disease.  The administration’s current policy on stem cells is limiting the kind of research that can be done in the United States.  That’s not just hurting the people who could benefit from the research, but also the competitiveness of America’s research and scientific community.  This legislation will allow us to take the next steps in stem cell research by expanding the number of stem cell lines that would be eligible for study.  I would urge the president not to veto this important legislation.  It’s time that we fully explore this potentially life-saving field.” ### Return
