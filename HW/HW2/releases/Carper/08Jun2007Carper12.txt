	Sen. Carper Disappointed Immigration Legislation Failed in the Senate This Week Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement in response to the failure in the United States Senate to reach an agreement late Thursday night to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation.  I am disappointed the Senate could not reach a compromise agreement to pass important and necessary immigration reform. It is difficult to craft a compromise on immigration reform, but this bipartisan legislation would have been a step in the right direction.  I believe Americans want comprehensive immigration reform that is tough, fair and practical.It must be tough in securing our borders and tough in enforcing employer sanctions. And immigration reform must be fair to American workers, fair to citizens who play by the rules, and fair to taxpayers who pay their fair share.  Finally, we must be practical in how we address the 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the United States today.It is just not realistic to think we can deport millions of people in a timely fashion.We need a practical solution that allows the 12 millions immigrants to come forward, without granting amnesty, and puts them on a path to full, legal citizenship. ### Return
