	WILMINGTON-- Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement today on the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.     In one word, this is a tragedy, said Carper. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was a courageous woman and a brave leader. My prayers are with her family, the people of Pakistan and with the families of those who also lost their lives today.    Bhutto served her nation twice as prime minister. She returned to Pakistan after her exile in Dubai to explicitly rekindle her political base in an attempt to bring different political voices to a population under President Pervez Musharrafs rule. She held true to her firm commitment to build a secular, sustainable democracy in Pakistan.    Benazir Bhutto was an ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism, and was viewed as a real democratic leader in a country where democracy doesnt exist. It is my hope that Bhuttos death will not have been in vain  that those who supported her and her beliefs will continue to work towards peace and stability and that her vision of democracy will prevail.     The government of the United States should stand ready to offer assistance to Pakistan and to work together to bring the murderers to justice. Together, we will honor the life and the vision of Benazir Bhutto.### Return
