	 U.S. Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper (both D-Del.) released the following statement today after President Bush vetoed funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education:  In a time when we need to prepare our future generations for an increasingly competitive world, the president today refused increased support for Head Start, the National Institutes of Health, and the historically under-funded No Child Left Behind.  In addition, funding from this bipartisan bill would have gone directly to hard-working Delawareans, like those at St. Francis Hospital, the University of Delaware, and the Urban League, while also spurring our economic and research infrastructure for years to come. We cannot expect to retain our position as a world leader in the research and science fields unless we prove we are committed to them. U.S. Sens.
