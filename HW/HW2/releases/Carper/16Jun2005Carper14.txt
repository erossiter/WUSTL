	 WASHINGTON (June 16, 2005) - The United States Senate yesterday unanimously approved legislation to name the State Route 1 Bridge over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal after the late Senator William Roth.    
The legislation, co-sponsored by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. and Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., will designate the bridge the “Senator William V. Roth, Jr. Bridge.”  Sen. Roth was instrumental in securing federal funds to construct the bridge, which was completed in December 1995.  
“Senator Roth was an extraordinary man and dedicated public servant,” said Senator Carper.  “Naming this bridge after him will be a fitting tribute to the dedication and service of Senator Roth to the people of Delaware and the nation.”  
“Bill Roth was a trusted colleague and a close personal friend for nearly three decades,” said Senator Biden. “Over the years, I came to know him as a practical and pragmatic man who knew what was important, and very quietly and effectively did what he knew was right for the people of Delaware.  It will be nice to have a lasting tribute to a man who did so much for the State.”    Senator Roth was first elected to the House in 1966, serving two terms, before being elected to the Senate, where he served for 30 years.   He also won the Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Army during World War II.   He died in 2003 at the age of 82.
