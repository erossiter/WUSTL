WILMINGTON, DE (April 10, 2006) –  Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement on Bank of America’s decision to close its Dover call center, a move that would result in the loss of more than 600 jobs in Kent County:    

“When Bank of America announced its merger with MBNA, we knew that Delaware would not escape unscathed.  Nonetheless, today's announcement is deeply disappointing and will be a hard pill to swallow for the people of Kent County.  I’ve been to the Bank of America call center in Dover many times.  It has a dedicated, energetic and proud workforce.  It's imperative that the state Department of Labor immediately reach out and provide assistance to the families and individuals affected by this decision.  In my discussions with Bank of America this morning, I expressed my fervent hope that this is the last set of job losses we'll see from the MBNA merger in Delaware.”
