	Carper Says Money Would Help State Reduce Water Pollution 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WASHINGTON (July 20, 2005) – The amount of money Delaware receives from the federal government to upgrade sewer and water treatment facilities and prevent polluted "runoff" from entering rivers would double under legislation approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Thursday.    

The panel unanimously approved legislation, titled the Water Infrastructure Financing Act of 2005, to change the distribution formula under the popular “Clean Water State Revolving Fund,” which states use to finance various water infrastructure projects.  The bill would change the distribution formula, effectively doubling the minimum percentage that states would receive.     

Last year, Delaware received $5.5 million under this fund.  If signed into law, Delaware could be receiving upwards of $11 million annually.      

“This money would help the state lay the groundwork for cleaner water and a healthier environment for all Delawareans,” said Carper.  “The state will be able to use this additional money to construct and upgrade wastewater systems, control runoff from farms, replace failing septic tanks, and protect the Delaware Estuary.”    

In addition to doubling the minimum percentage that states would receive under the clean water fund, the bill would also reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Fund at current levels and create a research and demonstration program to develop new water and wastewater treatment approaches and technologies.
