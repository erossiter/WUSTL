	Chairman of Senate's Clean Air Committee Calls for Prompt Action on Global WarmingSen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement in response to a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court today confirming that greenhouses gases can be regulated as a pollutant by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act.    Sen. Carper is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety which has jurisdiction over the Clean Air Act.    Of this landmark Supreme Court ruling, Sen. Carper said:    Now the highest court in the land has joined with citizens, states, businesses and scientists to call upon this Administration to move quickly to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.    I urge this Administration to quickly respond to the court's ruling by providing leadership, not excuses, and to begin to develop an action plan to finally combat global warming.    As chairman of the Senate's clean air subcommittee, I will work hard to ensure the Environmental Protection Agency implements new standards that reduce the amount of greenhouse gases polluting our atmosphere.### Return
