Sanford was chosen as one of fifty schools nationally by the National Association of Independent Schools to participate in the “Challenge 20/20” program.  This program is named after the book, High Noon, by J.F. Rischard.  The book identified 20 problems plaguing the world and Sanford School students and their teachers are charged with looking at one of the twenty problems – the issue of global warming.  Students from the lower, middle and upper schools are involved in this project.    

Students have invited Senator Carper to talk with them and answer questions because of the work he has done in Congress on clean air legislation.  Carper is the ranking member of the clean air subcommittee and has co-sponsored legislation that would curb CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming.
