	 Dover, DE – On Monday, February 20, 2006, Delaware high school students with dreams of attending the nation’s elite service academies after graduation will have the opportunity to talk with representatives in person at the 5th Annual Academy Information Night, proudly hosted by United States Senator Thomas R. Carper, with the cooperation of Delaware Technical and Community College.     

“Some of the great heroes for America’s future could be right here in Delaware,” said Carper, who was the mission commander of a P-3 aircraft in Southeast Asia during Vietnam and the Cold War.  “They will be the military leaders who continue the proud tradition of protecting the freedom of the United States of America.”      

The session will allow interested students to gather advice on gaining an edge in the competitive application process.  Senator Carper’s remarks will be followed by remarks from Lincoln’s own Alexandra Stamatiou, who has received appointments to both the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy.  Breakout sessions and personal visits with Academy and ROTC representatives will follow.     

Each year, members of the U.S. Congress are charged with nominating top candidates from their home state, ensuring the best and brightest are considered for admission to the nation’s leading military academies.  The process begins in the spring of the junior year of high school.
