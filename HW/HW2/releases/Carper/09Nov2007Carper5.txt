The defense appropriations conference report (H.R. 3222), which passed the House(400-15)and was approvedin the Senate by voice vote, now goes to the president for his signature.  The legislation, supported by Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper (both D-Del.)and Rep. Mike Castle (R-DE),provides funding forthe Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and other military priorities. It includesfunding fora 3.5 percent pay raise for all military personnel,forArmy and Marine Corpspersonnel growth next year by7,000 and5,000 respectively,for counselors, teachers, and child care providers for military families,and for improvements in military medical care.  Thebillalso includes $11.63 billiontobuild and transport to Iraq MineResistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)vehicles, a move spearheaded by Sen. Biden and something Sen. Carper and Rep. Castle strongly supported. In May, Lieutenant General Ray Odierno, the lead ground commander in Iraq, asked to replace every Army up-armored humvee with an MRAP.The Commandant of the Marine Corpshas said that those in MRAPs have a 300% better chance of surviving an improvised explosive device (IED) attack than those in an up-armored humvee.These additional funds willallow over 15,000 MRAPs to get to Iraq and Afghanistan by next fall.  Additionally, for the second straight year, the bill includes a provision authored by Rep. Castle in the House and backed by Sen. Carper in the Senate, which would prohibit bonuses from going to defense contractors who fail to meet their contractual requirements.  We have no higher obligation than to protect those we send to the front lines, said Sen. Biden. The fifth year of this mismanaged war has been the deadliest for our troops, and the vast majority of American casualties are caused by roadside bombs. I am heartened to know that my amendmentwith the support of Democrats and Republicans working togetherwill provide technology and equipment that will save American lives on the ground in Iraq.  Sen. Carper said: This defense bill provides essential funding for our nations military forces. And closer to home, it provides nearly $33 million for a variety of defense projects across the state of Delaware that benefit our entire armed forces.  The men and women who serve our country represent the very best among us, and this bill will ensure they have the tools and equipment they need, said Rep. Castle. It is also crucial that we make certain this funding is spent efficiently, and I am pleased that the final bill includes provisions to fight spending waste. Here in Delaware, we have often led the way in developing cutting-edge military technology and this bill guarantees this innovation will continue.  This bill also allows the military to pursueimportantdefenseresearchand production work being done inDelaware, including:   $1.6 million for University of Delaware Millimeter Wave Imaging  Sensor Technologywhich will allow the military to see through obstacles like smoke or sand;  $6.6 million for University of Delaware-Center for Composite Materials work for the Army, including $1.6 million for work for the Army onanadvanced,lightercomposite armored ambulance,$3 million for a composite armored truck cab able to add various armor packages, and $2 million for work on lighter composite add-on vehicle armor.    $9.4 million for Biological Defense work being done in Delaware, including $4 million for plant vaccine development,$3 million forthe development of a nano-technology basedBiological Agent Identifier;and $2.4 million for work on an automated, integrated biological defenseplanner for warfighters;    $1.6 million for Micropore, Inc.'swork on Reactive Plastic CO2 Absorbent Production Capacity,a critical technology improvement for rebreathersused by SEALS, subs, mines, etc.  $1.6 million for DuPont'swork on an lightweight fuel-cell power source for soldiers;  $4 million for the DE Air Guard, including $800,000 forthe DE Air Guards166th Information Operations Squadron to continue vital intelligence activities; and $3.2 million to replace out-datedC-130 radars with AN/ANP-241radars;   $8.16 million for W.L.
