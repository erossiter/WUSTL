	Congressional Delegation Secured More Than $9.6 Million for Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             GEORGETOWN, DE (Jan. 28, 2005) – Sen. Tom Carper and Congressman Mike Castle, along with representatives from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and the Army Corps of Engineers, will help celebrate the formal kick-off of the beach replenishment project for Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach.  Delaware’s congressional delegation, including Carper, Castle and Sen. Joe Biden have secured $9,693,000 million in federal funds in 2003 and 2004 for this project.    

The project involves placement of approximately 1.7 million cubic yards of sand to create a beachfill-and-dune system along 2.5 miles of ocean front from the northern end of Rehoboth Beach to the southern end of Dewey Beach. The sand will be pumped in from an offshore borrow area approximately 2.6 miles east of Indian River Inlet.    

Work will start Feb. 1 in the middle of Dewey Beach in the vicinity of Dagsworthy Street and proceed south to Indian Beach, then north to the town limits. Once that section is completed, the operation will move into Rehoboth Beach, where the goal is to have all construction substantially complete by Memorial Day weekend.    

“Our beaches are vitally important to Delaware's economic well-being," said Senator Tom Carper. "These replenishment projects, when completed, will encourage more tourism for Sussex County and other areas in the state, bringing more business to shopping centers, restaurants and the hotel industry."    

“We are committed to demonstrating the importance of this project at the federal level by stressing its impact on the economy, tourism and recreation in our great state,” said Congressman Mike Castle. “Thousands of visitors come to Delaware each summer and this business is critical to the economy of Sussex County. I am proud the federal government has led the effort to secure this funding."    

Hurricanes and winter nor’easters have eroded our popular beaches and leave businesses, public infrastructure and homes in coastal communities vulnerable to flooding and storm damage.  Wider beaches, therefore, are important to Delaware’s economic well-being.  The cost of maintaining our state’s beaches is large, and is a cooperative effort shared by local, state and federal governments.
