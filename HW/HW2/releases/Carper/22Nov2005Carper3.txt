	 WASHINGTON (Nov. 22, 2005) – Delaware’s congressional delegation – Sens. Joe Biden and Tom Carper and Congressman Mike Castle – today announced that Delaware would receive nearly $13 million in specific projects under the recently passed HUD-Transportation fiscal 2006 appropriations bill.    

“I am pleased that in tight budgetary times, we were able to secure important funds for essential projects in our community like the House of Joseph II, the Wilmington Senior Center and Easter Seals. These organizations provide vital services to those in need," said Senator Biden.      

“From improving I-95 to continuing our work on the Newark commuter rail line, this legislation will help curb congestion and allow commuters to get to work faster and safer,” said Carper.  “I’m also pleased we were able to secure funds to invest in our communities, including housing for AIDS victims, improving our state’s nursing facilities and expanding educational opportunities for low-income kids.”    

"This broad bill provides critical funding for many of our most important economic development projects in our state.  I am especially pleased with the continued funding for Beebe Medical Center Nursing School to address the nursing shortage in our state and the additional infusion of funding for the hydrogen storage research program at Delaware State University which I believe will be integral to moving towards an environmentally-friendly energy policy," Castle said.
