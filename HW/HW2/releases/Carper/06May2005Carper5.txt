Tom Carper will spend Saturday, May 7, 2005, in Sussex County.  

The Senator will begin his day at the opening ceremonies of the Nanticoke Little League in Seaford.  Nanticoke Little League has over 700 players ages 6-18.  Senator Carper will help honor alumni, including Delino DeShields, a 13-year Major Leaguer and Mike Neill, an Olympic Gold Medalist.    

Senator Carper will then head over to Georgetown to host his faith-based homeownership fair to help increase homeownership rates among minorities using new outreach strategies and technology to streamline the home-buying process.  The fair is free and open to the public.  Free mortgage pre-qualifications will be available and representatives from every step of the home-buying process will be on hand to provide information and answer questions. Registration begins at 8:45 a.m. and the home-buyer education seminar will begin at 9:30 a.m.  

This statewide strategy was developed in partnership with Senator Carper and the Delaware Federation for Housing Counselors, with assistance from Fannie Mae (FNM/NYSE), various lenders, and local churches.   

The three-part process works in the following way:  
·        Homeownership workshops are sponsored by trusted neighborhood organizations, such as churches;  
·        Those interested can register for follow-up housing counseling sessions with Delaware Federation for Housing Counselors;  
·        Once the borrower has completed counseling and is ready to apply for a mortgage, the customer’s loan file may be transmitted electronically from Home Counselor OnlineTM to a participating lending partner, thereby streamlining the mortgage application process.
