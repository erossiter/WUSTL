	WASHINGTON (Dec. 6, 2006)  –  Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement on his decision to confirm Robert Gates as the new Defense Secretary:  

“At his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Robert Gates presented lawmakers with a candid assessment of the situation in Iraq and pledged to keep all options on the table to achieve a lasting success in Iraq and the Middle East.  Mr. Gates is a seasoned and well-qualified candidate.  My hope is that he will make good on his promise to be a candid and honest broker within the Bush administration and help the president quickly forge a bipartisan consensus on how to successfully change course in Iraq.” ### Return
