	 “A mother, wife, gifted musician, and author, Coretta Scott King used her words and actions to spread the message of racial equality and justice throughout the world.  I hope her vision, as well as the vision of her late husband, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., will live on in all of us.  This morning, my thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones.”     ### Return
