	Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) issued the following statement in response to the loss of Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), who died late Monday:Like every one of my colleagues, I was saddened to learn that Craig has passed away. It was my privilege to have known and served with him for almost 25 years.Even in the last year of his life when he was fighting leukemia, he was an inspiration to many of us. Despite the challenges he faced, he didnt let them get him down. He remained friendly, upbeat and kind to everyone he met. He was a joy to be with and work with, and I will miss him.### Return
