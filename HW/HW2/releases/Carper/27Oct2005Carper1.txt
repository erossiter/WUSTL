(QLI), a cutting-edge software development firm located in Newark, Delaware, has been awarded a contract by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA).    

A member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Senator Carper will recognize QLI for their receipt of the contract – to develop an innovative information sharing system to meet the growing needs of the U.S. emergency responder community – at Quantum Leap’s headquarters in Newark.    

Those in attendance will hear about the cutting-edge technology being developed at QLI, tour the state-of-the-art facility, and see an exciting demonstration, conducted by members of QLI staff who have created an intricate program for connecting emergency response teams for almost any type of disaster.    

The ability for emergency responders to communicate with one another and exchange critical data regarding an emergency incident is a top priority for those on the frontlines when a man-made or natural disaster occurs. The emergency responder community has a need to acquire, synthesize, communicate and share critical information.  Friday’s demonstration will show attendees the possibilities for the future with a system that is similar to one being created under the contract.   

Delaware-based Quantum Leap Innovations will compete under this contract with three other world class firms to build an information technology architecture that will enable firefighters, police, National Guard, and others responsible for protecting the public to coordinate their response to a crisis.
