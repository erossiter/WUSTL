The “center” is a consortium of individuals and programs that span a continuum from fundamental basic science to targeted and applied research.  It is a Center of Excellence for research, education, and outreach programs related to poultry production and avian biosciences. The University of Delaware Center for Avian Biosciences will provide services, conduct research, and train others to enhance profitability of the poultry and allied industries and to improve the production of poultry as a food source.  Specifically, the UD Avian Bioscience Center will:      •	Conduct basic and applied research in poultry health, avian genomics, environmental compatibility, food safety and quality, and facility engineering and management;  •	Provide diagnostic and surveillance services to ensure poultry health;  •	Serve as a repository for certain viral and bacterial isolates, including emerging strains;     •	Provide educational and training opportunities; and   •	Serve as an unbiased source of information.     Also scheduled to attend: Senator Biden, Congressman Castle, Governor Minner, UD President David Roselle, and members of the poultry community.      The Senator’s next stop is to tour the new Total Joint Center at Bayhealth-Milford Memorial Hospital.  Opened in November 2005, the Joint Center is a healing environment for patients requiring total joint replacement surgeries.  The Center has seven private rooms with the newest technology and room for a family member to stay with the patient.       Senator Carper’s last stop is to tour Easter Seals in Georgetown, where he will take an in-depth tour and talk with participants.  He will see first-hand how federal monies impacted the project and talk about needs for the future. The new 25,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art facility combines three previous locations in Georgetown and Millsboro and will service Sussex and the region with direct services such as day services for adults with physical and cognitive disabilities, rehabilitative therapies, early childhood intervention, and more. Last year, Easter Seals served more than 3,000 people in the Sussex area alone.
