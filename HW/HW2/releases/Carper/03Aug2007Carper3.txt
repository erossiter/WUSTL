	Includes Carper-Voinovich Proposal to Improve America's InfrastructureAt midnight last night, the Senate unanimously passed the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007 legislation to address the deteriorating condition of Americas roads, bridges, drinking water systems, dams and other public works.The legislation, which was co-sponsored by U.S. Senators George V. Voinovich (R-OH), Tom Carper (D-DE), Norm Coleman, (R-MN) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY), was passed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) two days ago and was passed through the Senate last night.This legislation, which was introduced in early March to establish a National Commission on Infrastructure, was approved by the full EPW Committee to enhance economic growth by ensuring the nations infrastructure can meet current and future demands. Sens. Voinovich, Carper, and Clinton, three of the bills original sponsors, serve on the EPW Committee.This infrastructure improvement bill is an important first step to revitalize Americas weakening infrastructure. Hurricane Katrina, alone, made evident the serious need for the repair and improvement of aging infrastructures and waterway systems. And this weeks tragedy in Minnesota underscores this importance. There is a $1.2 billion backlog of unfunded Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance projects. The tragedies of Hurricane Katrina and the bridge collapse in Minnesota make painfully clear the urgent need for improvements to our aging infrastructure, Sen. Voinovich said. Our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient funding. And the deterioration of our nations waterways and infrastructure systems are impacting our economy, our environment and the overall welfare of the American people. This legislation gets to the heart of the problem by establishing a commission that will provide concrete recommendations for future infrastructure needs. When enacted, this commission will lead the way in providing long-term solutions to the dire problems we currently face.The I-35W bridge tragedy was proof that this nation is long overdue for an infrastructure overhaul, said Sen. Coleman. We simply can not allow what happened in Minneapolis to occur anywhere else in this country. But before that can happen, we must take a long and honest look at the condition of our nations bridges, dams and public works. Weve seen what the price is for not addressing the problem, and this bill will put in place a plan to strengthen our national infrastructure over the next thirty years.### Return
