	 WASHINGTON (Sept. 4, 2005) -- Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., today issued the following statement on the passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist:      
   "I am deeply saddened by Chief Justice Rehnquist's passing and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family.  He served this country with distinction for the past 33 years.  His love for the law and for the integrity of our nation's judicial system was only surpassed by his love for family and for those with whom he worked.  He will be missed.     We are now entering an extraordinary time.  The president and the Congress must now fill two vacancies on the Supreme Court and appoint a new chief justice.  The president has already nominated Judge Roberts to fill the vacancy left earlier this summer when Justice O'Connor resigned, and I look forward to learning more about his record and judicial philosophy in the coming weeks.      As the president considers another appointment to the Supreme Court, as well as who should become the new chief justice, I would again urge him to consult with Democrats and choose a moderate voice for the Court.  In these difficult and turbulent times, it's of utmost importance to nominate someone who can bring this country -- and a divided Court -- together."    ### Return
