	The Senate approved, by voice vote, a bipartisan compromise to increase fuel economy standards by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years. The compromise legislation, offered by Senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Thomas Carper (D-Del.), was endorsed today by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).    The Stevens-Carper-Feinstein-Snowe legislation fully achieves the goals of the original Feinstein-Snowe Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy legislation.    The compromise legislation raises the fleetwide average fuel economy standards for all cars, trucks and SUVs by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years  or from 25 to 35 miles per gallon by Model Year 2020. (A list of key differences between the compromise legislation and the Ten-in-Ten bill follows).    By 2025, the fuel economy increases for cars and light-duty trucks would:This bipartisan deal achieves the largest fuel economy increase in more than two decades  and it keeps the goals of the Ten-in-Ten legislation intact, Senator Feinstein said. So, let there be no doubt, this is a victory for the American public. This bill would increase the fleetwide average fuel economy of cars, SUVs, and light trucks by 10 miles per gallon over 10 years. And it does so in a way that ensures that the U.S. auto industry has the flexibility needed to meet the new fuel economy targets for each class of vehicles. The bill will achieve serious savings for oil, make substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and put money back in the pockets of American consumers.    This compromise is a significant step towards keeping this legislation moving forward, said Senator Stevens, Vice Chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. The measure is designed to ensure that vehicles that are important to the nation, and my home state of Alaska, are available. I am pleased to see that increasing fuel efficiency standards will be an essential part of this bill.    The bipartisan compromise we have reached will move use towards finally making substantive changes in CAF standards for the first time in a generation. That both parties would come together to chart a new energy policy is a landmark moment for this institution and frankly comes not a moment too soon, Senator Snowe said. By increasing CAFE standards, our country is not only forming a foundation of energy security, but promoting a critical element in addressing climate change on the federal level. Weve had the technology to make these advancements, but now we have the political willpower to finally achieve these goals and improve the future of our environment for generations to come.    We have reached a compromise on the CAFE provisions of the Senate energy bill that responds to many concerns voiced to us in recent weeks, said Senator Carper. At the end of the day, when we pass a CAFE increase, the goals remain to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce emissions of harmful matter into the air, while not undermining the competitiveness of our domestic auto industry. I believe this bipartisan compromise on CAFE amendment brings us closer to reaching these larger energy goals.    The Committee is pleased that all of these members have come together and continued to work in a bipartisan manner to produce a product that preserves the core of the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, said Senator Inouye, Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.    This compromise is an important breakthrough that will help bring more efficient vehicles to consumers. For 25 years, there has been little change in fuel efficiency standards. because its time we did the right thing to help push our country toward energy independence, said Senator Dorgan.    Weve been trying to get something like this done for a long time now, and this is an important step toward breaking our addiction to foreign oil, said Senator Nelson.    I am very proud that weve ensured that Americans will be able to buy cars and trucks in a wide variety of styles that can use alternative fuels, said Senator Cantwell. This is huge step forward in letting Americans drive further on a tank of gas.    Senator Boxer said, This is a good day for American consumers and the environment, since we finally have gotten on the right path to better fuel economy.    Todays compromise will help American consumers. Its increased fuel economy standards not only make environmental sense but also economic sense, said Senator Klobuchar. A family with teenagers can save almost $1,000 by moving to more fuel efficient vehicles. Those are real savings  especially when gas prices hover around three dollars a gallon and middle class families are working to make ends meet.
