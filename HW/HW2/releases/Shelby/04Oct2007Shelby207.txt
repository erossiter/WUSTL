      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    Shelby Delivers Floor Statement on NASA Spending    October 4  2007  Washington  D C     U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala    ranking member of the Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee  today made the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate to urge his colleagues to support adequate funding for NASA  Senator Shelbys comments  as prepared   I want to express my strong support for the amendment the Chairwoman has introduced today  Senator Mikulski and I have worked hard to craft a bill that addresses the priorities of our members   Yet  despite our generous allocation  the funding necessary for NASA to aggressively pursue the Presidents Vision for Space Exploration can not be accommodated without this amendment  Since the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Columbia breaking up during re entry in February of 2003  NASA has spent  2 7 billion to make the shuttle program as safe as possible to ensure our nation continues to be the leader in space exploration   Unfortunately  the NASA budget requests have not adequately restored the necessary resources in their subsequent requests  Instead  the costs have been absorbed from within NASA   Science funding has been cut significantly and programs not directly associated with the exploration vision are being deferred  delayed or cancelled   By slowing down the cutting edge science carried out by NASA  we are mortgaging our future   The foundation for technological leadership and the successes of tomorrow are built on the investments we make in NASA today   NASAs research and cutting edge technological advancements have driven science and innovation in this country since the dawn of the space age   We are shortchanging our future by not fully funding science  innovation  and space exploration  This critical knowledge will be needed in the years to come to make human exploration of the moon and other planets a reality   These effects cannot be ignored any longer if we are to maintain our leadership and presence in space   With the burden of correcting the dramatic Presidential budget cuts in critical justice programs and in NOAA  it is increasingly difficult for this Committee to find the resources necessary to keep NASA on the right track   To balance the lack of support for NASAs science and aeronautics programs in the budget request  there are few options left to consider   The adoption of this amendment will not only respond to the pressing needs brought about by a tragic accident  but will also send a clear signal that Congress is serious about ensuring that the U S  retains its leadership position in space exploration  I would urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment                                                         October 2007 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                  Current record                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
