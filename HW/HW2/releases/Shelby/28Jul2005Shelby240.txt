      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SENATE PASSES ENERGY BILL CONFERENCE REPORT       July 29  2005   WASHINGTON  D  C     U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  commended Senate passage of the conference report to accompany H R  6  the Energy Policy Act of 2005   By a vote of 74   26  the Senate approved the legislation which is now headed to the Presidents desk for his signature   Senator Shelby made the following statement regarding passage of the bill                  After nearly five years of debate and consideration  the United States Congress has finally passed a comprehensive energy policy   This legislation encourages increased domestic production so that our country will lessen its dependency on foreign oil   The bill also creates incentives for alternative energy production and conservation efforts  including improved fuel efficiency   I am encouraged by the bills strong focus on energy reliability   Without a long term strategy to ensure steady  reliable supplies of energy  we put our economy and the way of life it supports at risk                     The conference report contains numerous production incentives for oil and gas exploration  and establishes programs to maintain the nations coal production capacity   In addition  H R  6 fully funds President Bushs Clean Coal Power Initiative  which provides  200 million annually to be applied to clean coal research in coal based gasification technologies                     Further  the conference report includes important language to promote investment in the electricity transmission infrastructure throughout the country as well as critical new electricity reliability standards  These are provisions that I have long supported  and I am hopeful that they will help prevent future wide spread blackouts like those experienced in the northeast in 2003                       I am pleased to have worked with Chairman Domenici and the conferees to include language that further expands the Senate passed provision to ensure that States and local agencies will be able to participate and influence safety and security decisions during the application process and monitor safety at operational LNG terminals   I believe that State and local governments have a keen understanding of the needs of their communities  and this language guarantees their role in this process                      The conference report also maintains a Senate provision that will allow Alabama to receive a share of the royalties from oil and gas leases in federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf  This will provide over  16 million a year for conservation  master planning and infrastructure development for Alabamas coastal areas   In addition  I am pleased the conference report requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an inventory and analysis of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources   This analysis will provide a better understanding of the available offshore oil and gas reserves                     In an effort to promote energy efficiency throughout all sectors of our environment  the conference report also includes a number of provisions that could collectively achieve a reduction in future growth of our countrys energy needs by as much as 40    These provisions include new efficiency standards for new homes  manufactured homes  and appliances  as well as tax incentives for use of energy efficient products                     I am proud to have supported the first comprehensive energy policy passed by Congress in over a decade   Todays passage reflects our nations commitment to increasing our energy independence through diverse measures in order to end our reliability on foreign sources of oil          30                                                            July 2005
