      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY COMMENDS ALABAMA BRAC DECISIONS         August 26  2005   WASHINGTON  DC    Following three days of deliberations by the Base Realignment and Closing  BRAC  Commission  U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  commended the BRAC Commission for recognizing Alabama s contributions to our national defense       Senator Shelby said  I am extremely pleased with the overall results of the BRAC Commission s deliberations   Since the Department of Defense  DoD  first made its recommendations in May  we have worked closely with Alabama s military installations to provide solid arguments to the Commission regarding the military value of our bases      Our most significant victory was the BRAC Commission s decision to reverse DoD s recommendation to transfer more than 1000 jobs from Maxwell Gunter Air Force Base to Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts   I believe we made a strong argument to the Commission that relocating the Operations and Sustainment Systems Group  OSSG  did not provide any cost savings or synergistic gains  and the Commission s decision to strike this recommendation showed that our case was rock solid   Keeping the OSSG at Maxwell Gunter is good for the warfighter  has significant military value  and will keep over 1000 jobs in the Montgomery community   This decision illustrated the Commission s recognition of operational expertise of the mission  which could not be realistically duplicated anywhere else in the nation  Shelby added      Redstone Arsenal will also see significant gains  as this installation will be the new home to the Army Materiel Command  AMC  headquarters  the Space and Missile Defense Command  SMDC  headquarters as well as significant assets from the Missile Defense Agency  MDA         Senator Shelby said  Moving AMC s headquarters to Redstone Arsenal will result in cost savings and collocation with similar missions  and I look forward to welcoming General Griffin and Command headquarters to Huntsville   I believe the decision to move SMDC headquarters and parts of MDA to Redstone makes perfect sense as Redstone is currently home to a majority of SMDC s missions and a number of MDA functions   Further  the collocation of these two missions will significantly improve joint activities   This move will establish a Missile Defense Center of Excellence and enhance jointness between MDA  SMDC  the Aviation and Missile Command  AMCOM   and NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center      I was also very pleased with the Commission s decision to keep the 117th Air Refueling Wing in Birmingham   Over the last several months  we worked closely with The Adjutant General and the Alabama Air National Guard to reinforce the 117th s value to the Commission   I believe we made strong arguments that demonstrated the importance of the unit to our nation s security   The Commission made the right choice for our nation by keeping the 117th open to serve our country  Shelby continued       In addition  Alabama will benefit from the gains at Ft  Benning in Georgia   Ft  Benning will see more than 2 300 permanent troops and 8 000 students annually realigned from the Armor School in Ft  Knox   Senator Shelby said  This is great news for Phenix City and neighboring areas   The potential economic growth in East Alabama will be significant      However  with the positive developments during the BRAC Commission s deliberations  there were also some disappointments   Both Anniston Army Depot and Ft  Rucker had expected to gain thousands of jobs due to realignment of assets from other bases       Senator Shelby said  Upon learning of the decision to keep Red River Army Depot in Texas open  I was disappointed because I continue to believe that Red River has excess capacity and that there is significant justification for closing this depot   However  despite the fact that we will not gain from the elimination of excess capacity at Red River  I have every confidence that the Anniston Army Depot will continue to serve the maintenance needs of the Army now and into the future       Further  I strongly disagreed with the Commission s decision to leave the Aviation Logistics School at Ft  Eustis rather than relocate it to the Aviation Center and School at Ft  Rucker   I believe that the consolidation of institutional training with other aviation units at a single installation promotes force stabilization and consistency in training and would have created manpower savings   I am confident that Ft  Rucker will continue to grow in the future as the Army brings forth new missions and platforms for the aviation branch  Shelby added        The final outcome of the BRAC process has Alabama situated well into the future  and it is clear that the Commission recognized the value of our installations   Throughout this process  the Congressional delegation  Governor Riley and Alabama s military base communities worked diligently and provided strong arguments to the Commission based on military value  facts and statistics   It was always our goal to underscore why Alabama plays an integral role in the defense of this country  and I believe we made an effective case and were able to increase our already strong military presence  Shelby concluded      The BRAC Commission will submit its final report to President Bush by September 8   At that time  he will review the report and either approve or disapprove it in its entirety   If approved  the President will forward the report to Congress for legislative action       30
