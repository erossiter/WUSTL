CONFERENCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE FUNDING FOR WIREGRASS    September 26  2006  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced conference committee approval of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  The legislation includes important funding for the Wiregrass area  The bill will soon be voted on in the House  The Senate will consider the bill following House approval  after which it will be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  The funding approved by the conference committee will support important defense related programs in order to strengthen our national security  said Senator Shelby  These programs are critical to the stability of our nations military infrastructure and readiness  and todays approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens and the strength of our military  In total  this bill provides  436 6 billion for defense related needs  including  70 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror  GWOT   JOINT COMMON MISSILE     30 million Designed as a next generation  multipurpose replacement for the Hellfire  Longbow  and Maverick air to ground missiles currently used by the Army  Navy  and Marine Corps  the Joint Common Missile  JCM  was slated for termination by the Department of Defense in Presidential Budget Decision 753  issued in December 2004  Senator Shelby was a leader in working to restore funding for the JCM in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to ensure that the program remains viable  The Joint Common Missile is a critical program for keeping technological superiority in our missile arsenal  said Senator Shelby  The JCMs termination was ill conceived because it ignored the opinions of our top military leaders and would deprive our servicemembers of a new capability that cannot currently be replicated  Restoring funding for this vital program is essential because it will bolster our warfighting potential and provide our servicemen and women with a new capability to ward off the unconventional threats of the 21st century  There are over 150 jobs associated with the program including manufacturing  government program management  and subcontractors throughout Alabama  and overtime will bring approximately  280 000 000 to the Troy area in the way of salary  wages  and other costs  JAVELIN MISSILES     170 968 million The Defense Appropriations bill included  83 782 million to procure 300 Javelin missiles for the Army as well as  76 815 million for the replacement of Marine Corps Javelin wartime expenditures  said Senator Shelby  Javelin missiles give our ground forces a critical tactical fire capability and are produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy  keeping our servicemembers safe and keeping Alabamas economy strong  In addition  the bill included  10 371 million for modifications to the Javelin missile  HELLFIRE MISSILE     132 662 million    Hellfire missiles  produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in  Troy    help to ensure our military aviators are the best equipped warriors in the sky  said Senator Shelby  This bill includes  32 662 million for hellfire missiles for the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  UAV   Additionally  the Global War on Terror supplemental funding includes  100 million for the Marine Corps to procure Hellfire II missiles   JOINT AIR TO SURFACE STANDOFF MISSILE     167 165 million The conference committee approved  167 165 million for the Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile  JASSM  for the Air Force and Navy  said Senator Shelby  This long range missile system is designed to destroy high value  well defended targets while its significant standoff range keeps our warfighters out of danger from enemy air defense systems   JASSM is produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy  NON LINE OF SIGHT LAUNCH SYSTEM     324 23 million The Non Line of Sight Launch System  NLOS LS  is a program focused on beyond line of sight fires for the Army s Future Combat System  FCS   said Senator Shelby  The NLOS LS program is a containerized  platform independent multi mission weapon concept which will serve as an enabling technology element for the FCS  The NLOS LS provides rapid response and lethality in packages requiring significantly fewer personnel  decreased logistical support and lower life cycle costs  while increasing survivability compared to current direct fire gun and missile artillery  NON LINE OF SIGHT CANNON     112 237 million The Non Line of Sight Cannon  NLOS C  provides networked  extended range targeting and precision attack in support of the warfighter with a suite of munitions that include special purpose capabilities  said Senator Shelby  The NLOS C provides sustained fires for close support and destructive fires for tactical standoff engagement  I believe this project is necessary for the warfighter to best do his or her job  ARMY HELICOPTERS  The fiscal year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill includes funding for a number of helicopter systems vital to the Army  and the mission at Fort Rucker and in the Wiregrass region

Appropriations bill includes  for a second year  language that prohibits the transfer of research  development  acquisition  or program authority relating to tactical UAVs from the Army  said Senator Shelby  The language ensures that the Army will retain responsibility for and operational control of the Extended Range Multi Purpose  ERMP  UAV  UAVs provide support for tactical ground combat operations for the Army  and it is important that the Army maintain control of tactical UAVs because they are vital for ground combatants   UAV research and development is conducted at Redstone Arsenal  and the Army UAV Center of Excellence is located at Ft  Rucker                                                            September 2006 News Releases                      Year
