      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY CHAIRS HEARING ON COMMERCE DEPARTMENT BUDGET    May 26  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   Chairman of the Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Subcommittee  today heard testimony from Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez regarding the FY 2006 budget for the Commerce Department   Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  is included here    Good Morning   I want to welcome Secretary Gutierrez to his first appearance before the newly created Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies   Thank you for joining us his morning to discuss the fiscal year 2006 budget for the Department of Commerce        We look forward to hearing from you about your vision for the Commerce Department  and the challenges you see in the coming fiscal year   Given the tight budget constraints we are facing  this Committee will need your assistance in making some very tough choices about the distribution of resources and your guidance regarding the true priorities of the Department               The fiscal year 2006 budget request for the Department of Commerce is  9 4 billion   This includes  3 7 billion for the President s Strengthening America s Communities Initiative   With the initiative  the Department s total budget increases by  3 billion  or 48 percent over last year s funding level   Without the initiative  however  the Department s total budget decreases by  656 million         While this initiative has laudable goals  I believe there may be some obstacles ahead  The program consolidates eighteen federal economic and community development programs from a variety of agencies into a single direct grant program to be housed within the Commerce Department   Legislation has not yet been introduced to authorize the program and the details of the initiative are still unknown   I hope that today you will provide the Committee some of the details that have been lacking about the initiative as well as your plans to move it forward       The Department s budget also proposes significant increases for the Census Bureau  Patent and Trademark Office  PTO   and the Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS    I understand the increase for the Census Bureau primarily supports the Decennial Census  and the increase for PTO reflects full access to its fees and will support minimizing application processing time and enhancing the quality of products and services for the patent process and the trademark process   I hope we can discuss these increases in further detail today   We would also like to discuss whether the increases proposed for the Bureau of Industry and Security are sufficient to support BIS critical mission of regulating the export of sensitive goods and technologies         Your budget does include some programmatic decreases that concern us   Mr  Secretary  the Administration proposes to cut funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  by 8 5 percent   This cut comes at a time when the Presidentially appointed U S  Ocean Commission recommended doubling our federal expenditures on ocean and coastal research    Given the recommendation  the Committee finds such a decrease puzzling       Mr  Secretary  following your confirmation I am sure you were surprised to learn that NOAA makes up 65 percent of your budget   While we appreciate that you must balance many important priorities within the Department of Commerce  you will find on this committee  there is significant interest in NOAA       NOAA produces nautical charts and tide predictions critical to trade and commerce  it manages fish and shellfish for world consumption  it provides weather and climate predictions vital to the agriculture and energy sectors  and to commerce as a whole   Mr  Secretary  I hope that as you begin to write your first budget request for the Commerce Department  you will consider carefully the concerns of this committee regarding funding for NOAA       I am pleased that the Administration continues to show support in this budget request for the laboratories of the National Institute of Standards and Technology  better known as NIST  by proposing  426 million  a 12 5 percent increase above last year s appropriation   The NIST labs play a vital role in the development of measurements  standards  and technology to enhance productivity  facilitate trade  and improve the quality of life   NIST s measurements and standards contribute to the development of such things as bullet proof vests  mammogram technology  DNA analysis  computer security  nanotechnology  voting machines  and manufacturing         Unfortunately  the Administration proposed to terminate the Advanced Technology Program and reduce the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Program by over 50 percent   I am sure you will find  Mr  Secretary  these programs enjoy bipartisan support from a number of Members here in the Senate   I plan to work with Senator Mikulski to ensure that all of NIST s programs are funded so that it can carry out its mission of  standards  and  technology            In addition  the budget proposes to terminate the Public Telecommunications Facilities  Planning  and Construction Program grants which provide support for public broadcasting s digital conversion  The proposal assumes these grants can be provided through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting s  CPB   even though CPB s assistance has traditionally been more limited   I would like to discuss the impact this shift of responsibilities will have  especially on rural stations        Secretary Gutierrez  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the Commerce Department s budget request  and       I look forward to working with you on these and the many other important issues facing our Nation         30                                                         May 2005 News Releases
