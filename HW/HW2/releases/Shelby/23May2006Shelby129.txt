      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     SHELBY OUTLINES REASONS FOR OPPOSITION TO THE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL     May 24  2006  Washington  D C     In a speech made yesterday on the floor of the United States Senate  U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  voiced his strong opposition to S  2611  the Immigration Reform Bill  The full text of Senator Shelbys floor statement is included below  Mr  President  while S  2611 contains important titles addressing border security and worksite enforcement  the bill also contains titles relating to amnesty for illegal aliens and the creation of a massive new guest worker program which will undermine true immigration reform  The most problematic provisions of S  2611 are as follows   One  I want you to know  I opposed amnesty twenty years ago  It didnt work then and I dont believe it will work now  Mr  President   Two  our first priority should be to secure our borders  Any discussion of amnesty takes away from that priority  in my judgment   Three  supporters of these amnesty provisions say it is not amnesty  but what they call earned legalization  I am not here to argue about semantics or labels  Whether you call it amnesty  status adjustment or guest worker  the result is  Mr  President  that individuals that came here illegally will now be considered legal workers and on their way towards citizenship  Thats the bottom line   Four  under this so called compromise thats working here  those who have broken the law the longest are treated the best   Five  those who can prove that they have been here two to five years still do not have to leave the country  and are hence  still treated better than those waiting to enter legally   Six  the bill has minimal requirements for proving that an illegal alien has worked or  Mr  President  will work in the future  What few provisions there are seem very vulnerable to fraud   Seven  this bill mandates that illegal workers are paid a higher wage than many American workers in the same position with the same qualifications   Eight  the supporters of this bill claim that back taxes will be paid for past labor  but a close reading of the bill shows these back taxes will only be paid  Mr  President  if at all  8 years down the road when applying for a green card  not as a requirement to receive the H2 C Visa   Nine  this bill  Mr  President  drastically increases the number of employment based green cards issued annually  What will happen to the American worker when unemployment goes up  and so many foreign workers who are willing to work for less have been given citizenship   Ten  today  before the implementation of any reforms  the ability of our immigration officials to process applicants who are following the law is severely taxed  Mr  President  this bill will surely have a negative impact on those foreign workers who have followed the rules and are waiting patiently in their home country  to legally come to this country   Eleven  while others say that comprehensive immigration reform must include these amnesty provisions  I feel strongly that they will only serve to encourage further illegal immigration  in the years to come   And my twelfth reason  the bottom line is that this bill  in my judgment  requires past lawbreaking and encourages future lawbreaking  I am willing to bet  Mr  President  that if this bill is enacted  we will only revisit this problem twenty years down the road or perhaps before  Only then  Mr  President  we could be talking about 20 30 million illegal immigrants   Those are some of the reasons   and there are many others   why I will vote no on the final passage of this bill                                                             May 2006 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Current record                                                                                                         Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
