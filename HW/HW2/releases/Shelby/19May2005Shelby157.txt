      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY INTRODUCES FLAT TAX LEGISLATION     May 24  2005   WASHINGTON  D  C     Late Monday  U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  introduced S  1099  the Tax Simplification Act of 2005   This bill would repeal the current Internal Revenue Code and replace it with a flat tax rate that would apply to all taxpayers   Senator Shelby has been calling for fundamental tax reform for more than two decades  and has introduced flat tax legislation every Congress since 1984    Senator Shelby said  Now more than ever  we have an opportunity to fundamentally reform our tax code   President Bush has acknowledged that tax reform is one of his top priorities   Earlier this year  he created an Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform  whose charge is to advise the Secretary of the Treasury on options to reform the tax code to make it simpler  fairer  and more pro growth   I believe S  1099 achieves these goals       S 1099 would repeal the current Internal Revenue Code and replace it with a single tax rate for all taxpayers  seventeen percent when the tax is fully implemented   The legislation would also eliminate the many marginal rates  all itemized deductions and credits  the alternative minimum tax  and the taxation of Social Security benefits   In place of itemized deductions  each taxpayer would be given a generous standard deduction of  12 790  or  25 580 in the case of a couple filing jointly   Taxpayers would receive an additional  5 510 standard deduction for each dependant   Therefore  a family of four would need to make over  36 600 before they would pay a single penny of taxes   I believe my flat tax legislation provides for a fairer system  while still protecting those who are most in need       Today our tax code and its regulations total more than 60 000 pages which are complex  confusing and costly to comply with  Were a flat tax in place now  taxpayers would file a return the size of a postcard  and every American would be taxed equally and at the same rate   Rather than spending hours poring over convoluted IRS forms  or resorting to professional tax assistance  the flat tax allows taxpayers to determine their taxes quickly and easily   Everyone will fill out the same simple return  everyone will be taxed at the same rate  and everyone will pay their fare share  Shelby concluded       S  1099  which was numbered to reflect one of the many forms that taxpayers are required to complete  will be referred to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration            30                                                          May 2005 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Current record                                                                                                                                       Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
