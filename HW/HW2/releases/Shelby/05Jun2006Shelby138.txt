      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     SHELBY FIGHTS TO PROTECT MARRIAGE      June 6  2006   U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  today delivered a speech on the floor of the United States Senate in favor of SJ  Res  1  the Federal Marriage Amendment  a constitutional amendment which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman   Full text of Senator Shelbys remarks as prepared   Mr  President  I rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Marriage Protection Amendment   If you had told me 10 years ago  or even 5 years ago that I would be standing before the United States Senate advocating a Constitutional Amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman I would have thought you had lost your mind  Why in the world would you ever need to do that  doesnt it go without saying that men and women get married   Yet  I stand here today advocating a Constitutional Amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman  What was once thought preposterous is now a reality  We are faced with this new reality because activist judges throughout this great nation have decided to redefine marriage  The courts  not the people  not the states  are redefining a fundamental institution of our society  the very foundation of our civilization   Ironically this new definition of marriage runs contrary to what a majority of Americans believe  In fact  45 of the 50 states have either a state constitutional amendment or a statute defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman  On average  those measures have passed with more than 70 percent support   And Mr  President  today the voters in my home state of Alabama will vote on a state constitutional amendment regarding marriage  Regardless of the outcome  no judge should be able to impose his or her moral will on Alabama if the voters have decided otherwise   What appears to be a broad consensus throughout the country for protecting the institution of marriage is being undermined and redefined by activist judges  These judges have struck down numerous state laws intended to protect the traditional definition of marriage  State courts in California  Georgia  Maryland  New York and Washington have overturned laws or amendments protecting marriage  and a federal judge in Nebraska invalidated a state amendment prohibiting same sex marriage   I have long thought that it was the role of the judiciary to interpret the law  not make the law  However  these activist judges across the country have taken it upon themselves to make laws that  in many cases  redefine the definition of marriage  These judges have taken it upon themselves to make decisions reserved for state legislatures who have worked to be responsive to their constituencies and define marriage in the traditional sense  The difference is that these activist judges do not have to be responsive to anyone and are accountable to no one   Abraham Lincoln reminded us in the Gettysburg Address that we have a government of the people  by the people and for the people  Activist judges  accountable to no one should not be allowed to govern  The basic foundation of our Constitution does not invest total control in the judiciary  it is not government by the judiciary  rather it is government by the people  And Mr  President  on this issue the people have spoken   Activist judges should not be permitted to redefine the sacred bond of marriage  For generations  humanity has defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman upon which families are built  It is the institution of marriage upon which our society has flourished   Mr  President  States must be allowed to continue to exercise their will  States that pass laws or constitutional amendments should not be over ridden by an overactive judiciary who believe they have the power to redefine the moral character upon which our nation was built   I believe the President summed it up appropriately when he said  The union of a man and woman in marriage is the most enduring and important human institution  For ages  in every culture  human beings have understood that marriage is critical to the well being of families  And because families pass along values and shape character  marriage is also critical to the health of society  Our policies should aim to strengthen families  not undermine them  And changing the definition of marriage would undermine the family structure   Therefore  Mr  President  I stand before you today in strong support of this Constitutional Amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman   Mr  President  I yield the balance of my time                                                          June 2006 News Releases                      Year            County
