SHELBY  WE MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT ALS    May 11  2005   WASHINGTON  D  C     U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL   a member of the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Subcommittee  participated in a hearing today discussing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ALS   also known as Lou Gehrigs disease   Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  is included here    I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for being here today to discuss the issues surrounding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS   This month is ALS Awareness month and today is the ALS Association s Advocacy Day  so I can think of no better time to be holding this hearing     I also want to thank Senator Specter for agreeing to hold this hearing   This is an important issue that affects many of our constituents and I am pleased that so many folks were able to join us here today  including some of my own constituents     Appearing before us today are two ALS patients  a number of their advocates  both local and celebrity as well as a leading researcher in the field and I look forward to hearing from each of you     ALS is a tragic disease that we know little about and have little or no treatment for at this time   I have seen first hand how rapidly this disease robs one s ability to function and how quickly it can take our loved ones from us   Just last year I met with some Alabamians about ALS and I am sad to report that one of the individuals that we spoke about during that meeting is no longer with us   His beloved wife  however  continues her efforts to promote increased research for ALS and I for one  greatly appreciate her efforts on behalf of those suffering from ALS     Federal funding for ALS research is critical and while we have worked diligently to increase funding  more is left to do     I am hopeful that this hearing today will provide a forum to discuss the issues that must be addressed by researchers   There is so much basic research that must first be done if we are to find the cause and cure of ALS    I also believe that we must continue to work to find immediate opportunities to slow its progression and provide patients with every option available     Again  I hope this hearing will serve to increase awareness of ALS and our need to do more on the behalf of ALS patients and their families   Thank you all again for being here today and I look forward to hearing from each of you  Shelby remarked     The hearing included testimony from  Story Landis  Ph D   Director  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  Lucie Bruijn  Ph D  Science Director and Vice President  The ALS Association  Mr  Eric Obermann  Huntsville  AL  Mr  Rob Borsellino  columnist  The Des Moines Register  Mr  Tommy John  former Major League Baseball player  Mr  David Cone  former Major League Baseball player  and Ms  Kate Linder  actress     ALS is a progressive  fatal disease that attacks motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord  ultimately resulting in a loss of voluntary muscle control  paralysis and death  The average life expectancy for people with ALS is two to five years from the time of diagnosis  and there is no known cause  cure or means of prevention for the disease     An estimated 20 000 Americans have ALS  with about 5 000 new cases diagnosed each year   The disease most commonly strikes people between 40 and 60 years of age   Ninety percent of ALS patients die within five years of being diagnosed  Risk factors include an inherited genetic defect  which accounts for 5 10  of cases of familial ALS     There is no known cure for ALS  nor is there a proven therapy that will prevent or reverse the course of the disorder   Therefore  treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms  The only drug used in the treatment of the disease is Riluzole  the first drug that has been shown to prolong the survival of ALS patients by an average of two to three months   There is no specific clinical test that can identify ALS   Diagnosis is made by physical examination  a thorough patient medical history  and neurological testing      30                                                          May 2005 News
