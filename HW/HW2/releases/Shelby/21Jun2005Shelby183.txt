of the Senate Appropriations Committee  today announced funding for Alabama agriculture projects included in the Fiscal Year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Bill    Senator Shelby said  I believe the Agriculture Appropriations Bill goes a long way toward helping farmers and rural communities in Alabama and across the country  by funding advanced research methods with the ultimate goal of eliminating devastating diseases and increasing agricultural productivity levels       Fish Vaccine and Microbe Research    1 2 Million   Senator Shelby secured funding for aquaculture and fish disease research to be conducted at the Agricultural Research Service facilities located at Auburn University  This bill includes  1 2 million in funding for the project which will provide greatly needed scientific research for the development of safe and effective vaccines for the prevention of diseases in catfish to increase productivity  fish efficiency  and reproduction    Senator Shelby said  I am pleased to provide funding so that Auburn can continue its important research activities into the diseases that affect our catfish        Food Safety and Detection Program    1 146 million   Senator Shelby said  This bill includes funding for Auburn University s ongoing research to ensure consumer access to safe food supplies   These funds will allow Auburn to continue research to improve the safety of the U S  food system by developing the science and engineering required to rapidly identify  pinpoint and characterize  through an integration of sensor and information technology  problems that arise in the food supply chain       Improved Crop Production Practices    1 45 million   Senator Shelby said  This funding will allow Auburn University  Alabama A  M and Tuskegee University to conduct joint research of conservation tillage  precision agriculture and management of poultry litter       National Soil Dynamics Laboratory    1 4 million    Senator Shelby said  This bill includes funding for research activities  including studies in soil hydrology  weed ecology  and soil physics to be conducted at the Agricultural Research Service  ARS  Soil Dynamics Laboratory at Auburn University   Historically  droughts have resulted in millions of dollars in losses to Alabama s row crop producers  It is imperative that we investigate ways to reduce drought related risks and find ways to address them in an effort to increase production and producer s profitability     This funding represents a  300 000 increase over the fiscal year 2005 bill and will be used to conduct research on cropping systems practices   The goal of this research is to raise the level of water quality to federal standards particularly in the Sand Mountain region of Alabama   This research will enable us to move closer to a disposal method of poultry litter that is more ecologically sound and economical  Shelby added        The bill also includes language allowing ARS to conduct a study on the feasibility of relocating the laboratory to a periphery location on Auburns campus       Tri State Peanut Joint Research    591 000   Senator Shelby said  This bill includes  591 000 for Tri State Peanut Joint Research  These funds will allow continued research into several factors affecting the peanut industry including pests  soil quality  water quality  nutrients  and overall production environments  The goal is to increase yields with crop rotations and conservation        Catfish Genome     1 million   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased these funds were included in the bill to conduct important research at Auburn University to identify genes that convey virulent traits  to identify pathogens and to identify factors that influence expression of traits in catfish       Alabama Wildlife Federation Conservation Education Center    446 000   Senator Shelby said  This bill includes  446 000 for a cooperative program with the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources  DCNR  for conservation education   The DCNR will work cooperatively with the Alabama Wildlife Federation to provide a hands on education about a variety of

information to public health officials who monitor beef products        Horn fly research    166 000   Senator Shelby said  This funding will assist Auburn University in their efforts to develop a horn fly vaccine   Economic losses due to horn fly stress on beef and dairy cattle continue to be significant  proving the necessity for this invaluable research   This anti feeding vaccine in development is easily administered  species targeted  long lasting and environmentally acceptable       Precision Agricultural Partnership    250 000   Senator Shelby said  This bill includes  250 000 for the Precision Agricultural Partnership  which conducts research to increase farm and forest productivity  This project uses technologies such as remote sensing  geographic information systems and global positioning systems to aid traditional methods of farming and forestry         Alabama Association of Conservation Districts    200 000   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the legislation includes funding for this program  which aims to educate students about rural and urban conservation practices       Seafood Antibiotic Testing    500 000    In the report language  the Committee
