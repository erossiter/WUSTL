      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     FINAL PASSAGE OF DEFENSE FUNDING FOR SOUTH ALABAMA    September 29  2006  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced final passage in the Senate of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  The legislation includes a number of projects for South Alabama  The bill will now be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  The funding approved by the Senate will support important defense related programs that strengthen our national security  said Senator Shelby  These programs are critical to the stability of our nations military infrastructure and readiness  and the Senates approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens and the strength of our military  In total  this bill provides  436 6 billion for defense related needs  including  70 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror  GWOT   JOINT CARGO AIRCRAFT  JCA     72 million The Senate approved  72 million for the procurement of two Joint Cargo Aircraft  JCA  airframes  Senator Shelby fought to restore funding to the program and ensure that the program remained under the acquisition control of the Army  The Army has an immediate need and clearly defined requirements for the cargo plane  which the Air Force will procure in subsequent years  The Army is currently on schedule to award a contract for the JCA in 2007  The Joint Cargo Aircraft will enhance the combat readiness of the Army and Air Force and is a vital asset to both the Global War on Terror and homeland defense  Senator Shelby said  Funding is imperative to maintain the current contract award schedule  The  72 million included within the Army funding line will allow us to maintain the schedule and ensure that program control remains with the Army  Without the JCA  the Army will continue to transport soldiers and supplies to remote locations through its overburdened helicopter fleet and ground convoys  placing our warfighters lives at risk by exposing them to an increased risk of improvised explosive devices  IEDs   If the Raytheon EADS team is selected  the Mobile Regional Airport will be the final assembly and delivery site for the Joint Cargo Aircraft and the the new facility will create more than 150 jobs at full production rate  KC 135 TANKER RECAPITALIZATION PROGRAM    70 million Senator Shelby has been a leader in working to restore funding for the Air Forces Tanker Recapitalization Program  The  70 million included in the fiscal year 2007 DoD Appropriations bill will ensure that the Tanker Program remains on schedule to award a contract in 2007  Adequately funding this program is imperative to allow the Air Force to maintain its schedule to award a contract in fiscal year 2007 and the  70 million included in this bill will allow the Air Force to progress with this program  said Senator Shelby  It is vital that we ensure that our servicemembers have the best military equipment available and I continue to believe that if the Northrop Grumman EADS team is able to participate in a fair and open competition  their proposal would win  Such success will mean significant jobs and investment in Alabama   particularly South Alabama  LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP  LCS     520 67million This  520 67 million will be used to procure two Littoral Combat Ship  LCS  prototypes  One version of the LCS prototype is currently being produced by Austal Ltd  in Mobile  AL   The Senate approved  520 67 million for continued development of the Littoral Combat Ship program  said Senator Shelby  The LCS represents an important capability for the Navy and will give our naval forces a new  transformational system with the ability to network manned and unmanned air and sea assets from the single ship configuration up to participation in a Carrier Battle Group  Additionally  the LCS provides the Navy the maneuverability to operate anywhere   DD X  DESTROYER    2 568 billion This  2 568 billion will be used to procure 2 new DD X  Destroyers  The DD X  is built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Operations of Pascagoula  MS  and employs over 1 000 Alabamians  The DD X  destroyer is currently being constructed as a replacement for the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates and Spruance class destroyers  said Senator Shelby  The DD X  will provide land attack support for ground forces as well as perform anti air  anti surface  and undersea warfare  As the Global War on Terror takes our servicemembers to various theaters of war  it is critical that they have the best technology available to protect themselves  LHA R   AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT SHIP    1 135 billion This  1 135 billion will be used to procure one amphibious assault ship  The LHA is built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Operations of Pascagoula  MS  and employs over 1 000 Alabamians  The Tarawa class LHA provides the Marine Corps with a superb means of ship to shore movement by featuring expanded aviation capabilities  said Senator Shelby  The largest of all amphibious warfare ships  the LHA Replacement will have the ability to carry between 20 and 25 of the multi service  multinational Joint Strike Fighter  JSF                                                         September 2006 News Releases                      Year            County
