      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY ADVOCATES FULL REPEAL OF THE DEATH TAX        June 7  2006   In a speech made today on the floor of the United States Senate  U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  voiced his strong support for the full repeal of the Estate Tax  commonly referred to as the Death Tax   Senator Shelbys floor statement  as prepared  is included below    Mr  President  I rise today to voice my strong and unwavering support for a full repeal of the Estate Tax  or the Death Tax as it is often referred   Mr  President  until World War I the United States government only imposed an estate tax or inheritance tax to raise revenue to fund expenses directly related to the necessities of war  Even then  the rate was measured   However  that practice changed after World War I and unlike four previous occasions  the tax was not repealed once a peace agreement was reached  In fact  the tax continued to increase until it reached 70 percent during Franklin Roosevelts Administration   Mr  President  what was once a means to finance war  eventually became a significant revenue stream that funded all aspects of a burgeoning federal bureaucracy  Today  the estate tax continues to provide a significant revenue stream to the federal coffers and functions as a redistribution of personal wealth and punishment to those successful business owners seeking a better way of life   The death tax places an undue burden on our nations family owned farms and small businesses  These individuals work tirelessly day in and day out to make their own way  to contribute to society and the economy only to be told their loved ones will be punished when they die  Too often  I hear of sons and daughters forced to sell a piece  if not all  of the legacy that their parents worked to create and sustain  simply to pay estate taxes   Mr  President  that scenario is just wrong  We should not punish hard work and entrepreneurship  we should reward it  We should reward those that choose to continue their family businesses rather than shut them down  These people work hard to promote prosperity and growth in their local communities  only to be told by the federal government that in addition to the taxes they have paid each and every year  they must now pay an additional tax  the death tax  because someone died   Mr  President  taxing death has a negative impact on the desire of Americans to invest and save  A basic economics class will teach you that savings and investment are positive for individuals  families  and our economy  Punitive taxes such as the estate tax  capital gains tax  dividend tax and the gift tax all have a negative impact on our overall economic growth   In 2001  Congress acted to eliminate the estate tax by January 1  2010  Unfortunately  this provision sunsets in 2011  just one year after it is fully repealed  As it currently stands  in 2011  the tax code is set to completely reverse all progress we have made to reduce the tax burden on our nations entrepreneurs  So  those who are not fortunate enough to die in 2010  will be faced with the prospects of their loved ones being responsible for as much as 55  of the estates assets   Whether it is a construction company  a cattle farm  a medical practice  or any of a hundred other businesses  they all require significant capital investment in land  equipment  and or materials that quickly overcome the threshold we will return to in 2011  These investments are not part of the business    they are the business   I am also concerned  that like the other taxes I mentioned earlier  the estate tax serves as a second bite at the apple  Our current tax system too often taxes income and then asks for more  The estate tax is one of the more egregious examples of this situation   Mr  President  I believe the Federal government should work to minimize the burden on the American taxpayer and simplify our tax system  The estate tax is contrary to both of these purposes  It not only taxes assets a second time  it also is one of the more complicated taxes to comply with in our bloated tax code   Mr  President  I believe repeal of the estate tax is one of many steps we  as elected representatives of our respective states  should take to spur economic growth  remove the burden on small business  and simplify our tax system and I urge my colleagues to support immediate and full repeal   I yield the floor                                                          June 2006 News Releases                      Year            County
