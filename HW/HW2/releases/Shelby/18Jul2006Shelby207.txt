      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY DISAPPOINTED WITH PASSAGE OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH BILL     July 18  2006   Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  was disappointed with the passage of H R  810  the embryonic stem cell research bill to expand federal funding to new stem cell lines  and made the following statement explaining his opposition to the measure    As a prostate cancer survivor  I understand the importance of furthering lifesaving medical research through federal funding  said Senator Shelby  I have worked diligently with my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees funding for the Department of Health and Human Services to double funding for the National Institutes of Health over the past few years  and I am encouraged by the progress that has been made  Moreover  I have been supportive of federal funding for adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research  both of which are yielding results    While scientists tell us that embryonic stem cell research holds great promise to cure diseases and heal injuries  it also comes at a great price  I am not a scientist  but I do know that embryonic stem cell research necessitates the destruction of human embryos  As such  I strongly believe that we must draw a moral and ethical line that respects and protects the dignity of human life  particularly when it comes to the lives of the most vulnerable and helpless members of the human race  In my judgment  the responsible path to take is to continue to channel taxpayer dollars to research that holds this line    We must not deviate from our strong protection of human life  Crossing the boundary medically only calls into question our future protection for life  If we do not draw the line here today  where will the line be drawn    The Senate also approved two other stem cell research related bills which Senator Shelby supported  The first measure  sponsored by Sens  Brownback and Santorum  prohibits the solicitation or acceptance of tissue from fetuses developed purely for research purposes  The second bill  sponsored by Sens  Santorum and Specter  encourages the National Institutes of Health to research and develop ways to obtain stem cells with the same qualities as embryonic stem cells without harming or destroying human embryos                                                            July 2006 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Current record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
