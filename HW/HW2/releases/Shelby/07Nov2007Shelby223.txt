the House of Representatives  The Senate will consider the bill following approval by the House of Representatives  It will then be sent to the President for his consideration  The funding approved by the Conference Committee will support important defense related programs that strengthen our national security  said Shelby  These programs are critical to the stability of our nations military infrastructure and readiness and the Committees approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens and the strength of our military     DDG 1000 Destroyer     2 807 billion This  2 807 billion will be used to procure two destroyers  The DDG 1000 is built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Operations of Pascagoula  MS  and employs over 1 000 Alabamians  The DDG 1000 destroyer is a replacement for the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates and Spruance class destroyers  said Shelby  The DDG 1000 will provide land attack support for ground forces as well as perform anti air  anti surface and undersea warfare  As the Global War on Terror takes our servicemembers to various theaters of war  it is critical that they have the best technology available to protect themselves  LHA R   Amphibious Assault Ship     1 375 billion This  1 377 billion will be used to procure an amphibious assault ship  The LHA is built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Ingalls Operations of Pascagoula  MS  and employs over 1 000 Alabamians  The Tarawa class LHA provides the Marine Corps with a superb means of ship to shore movement by featuring expanded aviation capabilities  said Shelby  The largest of all amphibious warfare ships  the LHA Replacement will have the ability to carry between 20 and 25 of the multi service  multinational Joint Strike Fighter  JSF   Littoral Combat Ship  LCS      339 5 million This  339 5 million will be used to procure one Littoral Combat Ship  LCS  prototype in fiscal year 2008  The bill also fully funds LCS 1 and LCS 2  One version of the LCS is currently being produced by Austal Ltd  in Mobile  AL   The Conference Committee approved  339 5 million for continued development of the Littoral Combat Ship program  said Senator Shelby  The LCS represents an important capability for the Navy and will give our naval forces a new  transformational system with the ability to network manned and unmanned air and sea assets from the single ship configuration up to participation in a Carrier Battle Group  Additionally  the LCS provides the Navy the maneuverability to operate anywhere   KC 135 Tanker Replacement Program    114 5 million Senator Shelby has been a leader in working to restore funding for the Air Forces Tanker Replacement Program  The  114 5 million included in the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill will ensure that the Tanker Program is awarded a contract in 2008  Adequately funding this program is imperative to allow the Air Force to award a contract in fiscal year 2008 and the  114 5 million included in this bill will allow the Air Force to progress with this program  said Senator Shelby  It is vital that we ensure that our servicemembers have the best military equipment available and I continue to believe that if the Northrop Grumman EADS team is able to participate in a fair and open competition  their proposal would win  Such success will mean significant jobs and investment in Alabama   particularly South Alabama                                                         November 2007 News Releases                      Year            County
