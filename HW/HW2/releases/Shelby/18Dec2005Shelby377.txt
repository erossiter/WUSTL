included in the bill for the continuation of the Joint Common Missile  JCM    This program is critical for keeping technological superiority in our missile arsenal   The JCMs termination was ill conceived because it ignored the opinions of our top military leaders and deprives our servicemembers of a new capability that cannot be currently replicated   We were able to restore funding for this vital program  which will bolster our warfighting potential and provide our servicemen and women with a new capability to ward off the unconventional threats of the 21st century       JOINT AIR TO

on beyond line of sight fires for the Army s Future Combat System  FCS   The NLOS LS program is a containerized  platform independent multi mission weapon concept as an enabling technology element for
