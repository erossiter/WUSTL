      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY DISAPPOINTED IN SENATE VOTE ON THE ANTI FLAG DESECRATION RESOLUTION                June 27  2006   U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  today expressed his disappointment in the failure of Senate Joint Resolution 12  the Anti Flag Desecration Resolution  Senator Shelby was a cosponsor of the measure  which failed by a vote of 66 34  The Resolution received a majority of the votes  but because its intent was to bring forth a constitutional amendment  it needed two thirds of the Senates vote for approval  I am disappointed that the Anti Flag Desecration Resolution did not pass the Senate  said Shelby  This resolution would have reinforced that the American flag is not a symbol to be used for demonstration  but a true monument that represents our freedom and liberty   Senator Shelby gave the following remarks on Monday on the floor of the Senate   Mr  President  I rise today to express my strong support for the Anti Flag Desecration Resolution that is before the Senate this afternoon   Mr  President  229 years ago this month  the Continental Congress adopted a resolution giving the United States a flag  the Stars and Stripes  the American flag that we know today  There is no greater symbol of our freedom and our liberty  The Stars and Stripes epitomize the underpinnings of the United States  that which was envisioned and created by the Founders of this great Nation  solidified by the Framers of the Constitution  and represented at that first Continental Congress  Old Glory was raised at Iwo Jima  was placed on the moon  and drapes the coffin of every servicemember who has sacrificed their life for our Nation  Our flag is emblematic of liberty and democracy  It honors all those who have defended our Nation from enemies at home and abroad  and all those who carried it into battle and never returned   Yet there are some throughout this country who have chosen to express their views and opinions by defacing and even burning the flag  They believe the flag is simply a piece of fabric upon which stars and stripes have been sewn  They refuse to respect and revere the flag as a true monument to the freedoms and ideals of our great Nation  These notions were bolstered by a 1989 Supreme Court decision that protected the desecration of the flag   Throughout the history of our Nation  the flag has been protected by laws  In fact  before the Supreme Court decision in 1989  48 states and the District of Columbia had laws regulating the physical misuse of the American flag  Even today  a majority of Americans continue to believe the flag should be protected  that the Court was basically wrong in their decision   It is that strong support and my firm belief that we must protect the flag that has sent me here today to advocate for this resolution  While some have argued that we should simply accept court interpretations of First Amendment issues as final  irreversible truths  I disagree  Our system of government is based upon checks and balances and allows for legislative reactions to judicial decisions   While rarely invoked  amending the Constitution is a reasonable reaction to a controversial and clearly wrongheaded court decision  The American system of government provided for amendments  and there are some issues that deserve that attention  I believe protecting the flag is one   In debating this issue  we must look beyond burning the flag and protecting ones freedom of expression  This issue must be considered in a broader context  We must remember that this issue is about respecting the single unifying symbol of this great democracy  the American flag   Defacing the U S  Capitol or the Washington Monument would never be considered legitimate acts of free speech  The flag should be entitled to the same considerations  The flag is a national treasure  a monument  even  and like other national treasures  it deserves to be protected and respected   Our flag is a unique national symbol that represents common values  shared aspirations  and the sacrifices of millions of Americans  The argument is not about legitimate free speech  in my judgment  but  rather  the extent to which free people must tolerate offensive acts   While some will say that a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning unduly inhibits free speech  I respectfully disagree   Let me be clear  It will not diminish the Bill of Rights  in my judgment  to allow Congress to define and enforce a law which protects the American flag much like other national treasures are protected  To desecrate the American flag  in my judgment  is to desecrate the memory of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their lives to keep our flags flying  It is to destroy everything this country represents   There are some things that just need to be treated with respect and reverence for no other reason than to honor all those who have served and died for this country   When we look at our flag  I believe we should see something more than a piece of fabric colored red  white  and blue  We should see our Nation and all that it symbolizes  Our Armed Forces put their lives on the line daily to defend what Old Glory represents  We have a duty and a responsibility to honor their sacrifices by giving the flag the constitutional protection it deserves
