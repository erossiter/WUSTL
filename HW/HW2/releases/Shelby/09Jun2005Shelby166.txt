legislation includes  68 million for the acquisition of two CASA aircraft  CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft  by the U S  Coast Guard   These aircraft are integral to the Coast Guards mission       In

the U S  Coast Guard Mobile Air Training Center in Mobile         Center For Domestic Preparedness    57 Million   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the Subcommittee agreed that the Center for Domestic Preparedness  CDP  at Ft  McClellan is the cornerstone of our nation s emergency responder training facilities  The  57 million included in this legislation will allow CDP to increase its training capacity for first responders so that we may respond to terrorist attacks quickly and effectively   These first responders include law enforcement personnel  firefighters  and emergency medical personnel who are trained by CDP to prevent and respond to incidents of domestic terrorism       In fiscal year 2004  CDP trained over 50 000 first responders  and is expected to train 60 000 more by the end of fiscal year 2005   In addition to training our nations local first responders  CDP works closely with a number of federal agencies including the Department of Agriculture  USDA   Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   and others to develop new integrated counter terrorism training programs       Since the September 11  2001 attacks on our country  the importance of first responders has become evident   Ft  McClellan s Center for Domestic Preparedness provides the necessary training for professionals to rapidly respond and react to terrorist attacks  Shelby concluded          14 Mile CSX Railroad Bridge on the Mobile River    5 Million   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the Subcommittee recognized the need to provide continued funds to replace the 14 Mile CSX Railroad Bridge on the Mobile River   Replacement of the bridge will ensure safe marine navigation on the Mobile River  which is critical to maintaining the efficiency and reliability of waterways commerce through the Port of Mobile and along the Black Warrior Tombigbee waterway system        The replacement of the bridge will save shippers millions of dollars

grants   10 million for inter city bus security grants  and  5 million for trucking industry security grants  I believe these funds are crucial in our efforts to improve homeland security   We have made great strides in improving our nations aviation security  but Americans deserve to have the governments full attention devoted to the security of every mode of transportation       These funds will be administered by the Office of the State and Local Government Preparedness and Coordination within the Department of Homeland Security         Firefighter Assistance Grants    615 Million
