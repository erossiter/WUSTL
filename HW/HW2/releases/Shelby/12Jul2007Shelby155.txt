      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    Shelby Announces Food Safety and Agriculture Funding for Alabama   July 19  2007 U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala    a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  today announced funding for several projects in Alabama included in the fiscal year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill  Following todays action by the committee  the legislation will now go to the Senate floor for consideration   I believe the Agriculture Appropriations bill goes a long way in helping farmers and rural communities in Alabama and across the country  said Shelby  The legislation funds advanced research methods  keeping in mind the ultimate goal of eliminating devastating diseases and increasing agricultural productivity levels  The bill also takes critical steps to strengthen our food supply by bolstering the Food and Drug Administrations food inspection capability  Food Safety Inspection    48 407 Million The United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world  but recent issues with domestic productsfrom spinach to peanut butterhave shown that better inspection and response capabilities are needed  In addition  though each year the amount of food imported from overseas increases greatly  the FDA inspects less than 2 percent of food products that enter the United States  Foreign producers  particularly in South East Asian aquaculture  have repeatedly shown a willingness to use products banned for use in food to increase their profitability  It is the federal governments responsibility to protect the public from these risks  The bill allocates  48 4 million  nearly  38 million above the Presidents request for food safety  The increased funding will allow FDA to reverse the trend of the last four years  when the number of inspectors dropped by 230  and begin to hire new inspectors  The funding will also allow the FDA to develop a rapid response team to counter potential outbreaks and conduct much needed research on food safety  Food safety is a national priority that affects every man  woman and child and we must ensure the security of the food supply from all forms of contamination  said Shelby  Whether it is home grown spinach  Chinese shrimp and catfish  or tainted pet food  we must have a safety net in place that reduces risks and ensures that dangerous products never make it to the dinner table or our pets food bowl  Research Center on Detection and Food Safety    2 5 Million In addition to funding included for food safety at the FDA  the bill includes specific allocations for food safety research at Auburn University  This program will educate a new generation of engineers and scientists to continue Auburn Universitys cutting edge research to improve food safety  The results of their research will ultimately lead to a system that monitors food products from production to consumption  thereby eliminating or significantly reducing the threat of food borne illnesses  This year has shown the shortcomings in our nations food safety capabilities  said Shelby  This funding will enable researchers to continue to develop the science  technology and engineering required to rapidly detect pathogens and toxins that may arise at any point in the food chain and quickly resolve the problems before they enter the market place  Fish Vaccine and Microbe Research    1 06 Million The aquaculture industry is a significant economic engine in West Alabama and the Southeast United States as a whole  Though the industry has made significant advances  fish diseases continue to have an alarming effect on the aquaculture industry and production systems causing considerable financial losses in the industry  The ability to prevent these diseases remains a vital component to ensuring a healthy national food supply and maintaining the economic development activity of the region   Better disease management is a top priority for Alabamas aquaculture industry  said Shelby  To date  the results of the research conducted at Auburn University have led to the commercialization of two vaccines  which helped reduce the loss of catfish infected by disease  The ability to better manage disease threats is important to the overall success of fisheries both in the short term and long term  This funding will provide the opportunity for continued advances in disease prevention Catfish Genome    878 046 This funding will continue Auburn Universitys research to identify genes  pathogens and factors of traits in catfish  Alabamas catfish industry continues to be a major source of economic development in the state  said Shelby  However  the industry faces significant threats from foreign competition  For this reason  we must ensure that our catfish population is strong and healthy  as well as capable of withstanding both endemic and emerging diseases and disorders  National Soil Dynamics Lab    1 11 Million The research conducted at the National Soil Dynamics Lab includes studies in soil hydrology  weed ecology and soil physics  This research will develop tools  practices and products for better management of soil to reduce production costs and assist in sustaining agricultural production   Alabamas soil is particularly sensitive to degradation processes that significantly impact profitability  said Shelby  Research at the National Soil Dynamics Lab uses a system approach to better understand the threats to soil productivity and develop methods to reduce the risk of degradation  Improved Crop Production Practices    1 38 Million In an average row crop production year  Alabama producers inject  700 million in cash receipts into the Alabama economy  After the drought in 2000  producers lost  329 million and the 2007 crop year is projected to eclipse the 2000 losses  The research will be based at the ARS National Soil Dynamics Lab in Auburn and conducted in conjunction with researchers at Auburn University  Tuskegee University and Alabama AM University  Researchers will focus on conservation tillage  intensive rotations and site specific management to reduce the impact of drought and increase profits  The drought in Alabama has created a dire situation across the state with long term ramifications affecting both the row crop producer and consumer  said Shelby  This year is proof again that we must continue to develop methods and technologies that reduce our crops susceptibility to drought  Peanut Research    591 000 Years of intensive planting methods have left the soils of the lower coastal plains severely lacking in organic matter and water holding capacity  resulting in low crop yields and forcing many farmers to abandon the farming business  This project will increase the amount of organic material and carbon storage in the soil and will restore productivity to vast peanut growing regions in Alabama and the Southeast United States   Auburn University and its partners continue to look for a solution to the long term viability of the peanut industry in the tri state area  said Shelby  The goal is to develop a crop rotation system that is customized to the needs of the soil and production practices of the southeastern United States  Alabama Wildlife Conservation Education Center    300 000 This funding will allow the Alabama Wildlife Federation to expand its mission to educate Alabamians about the proper use  management and restoration of our environment through hands on educational experiences  These funds will be used towards the development of an additional 1 000 feet of boardwalk and viewing decks to teach Alabama students about the outdoors and wise stewardship of our natural resources  Alabama Wildlife Federation will be equipped with the tools necessary to enhance its educational programs and continue the progress towards science education through a hands on experience  said Shelby  The benefits of science education programs for our students are far reaching  Studies have shown that students who are engaged in nature based education programs improve their academic performance in math  science  social studies and language arts  Precision Agriculture Research in Alabama    599 000 The research conducted at the Tennessee Valley Research Center will help improve the profitability and efficiency of the forest products industry  agriculture and natural resource based enterprises Alabamas natural resource based industries are facing increased pressures from foreign producers of wood fiber and agriculture products  said Shelby  The research in Alabama will work to develop new and innovative tools that use cutting edge geospatial technology to make forestry and agriculture production more efficient and competitive in the global market  The following nationwide programs will also be funded through the fiscal year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill  Rural Water and Wastewater Grants    550 469 Million The bill includes funding for a competitive grant and loan program for communities in Alabama and across the country  Local officials with an interest in the program should contact their local Farm Service Agency office for information on the application process  Rural communities across Alabama are in need of financial assistance for the development of water and waste disposal systems  Shelby said  This program will provide the resources necessary to allow communities to ensure they have a clean and safe water supply  Circuit Riders    13 612 Million This funding will provide technical assistance for water systems located in rural areas  Many times small communities do not have the resources to comply with the Environmental Protection Agencys water regulations  Senator Shelby said  This funding will provide on site field assistance to assist these communities in compliance with regulations regarding arsenic  radon and other chemicals that may be in water  Rural Water Training    3 713 Million This funding will provide technical assistance and training to rural communities throughout Alabama to improve water and waste disposal problems  These communities would also receive assistance in preparing applications for water and waste grants made available at the State level   It is imperative that all Americans have access to safe and clean drinking water  said Shelby  This funding will allow communities across Alabama the resources necessary to ensure they have a clean and safe water supply                                                         July 2007 News Releases
