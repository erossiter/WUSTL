      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     CJS Hearing on DEA  USMS  and ATF Budget   Shelby Addresses Virginia Tech Massacre  Alabama Church Arsonists   Conviction  and Making Huntsville Federal Explosive Capital during Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Hearing    April 19  2007  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala    Ranking Member of the Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee  CJS   today made the following opening statement at the Subcommittees hearing to examine the proposed budget for fiscal year  FY  2008 for the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  ATF   the Drug Enforcement Administration  DEA   and the United States Marshals Service  USMS    Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  Thank you all for joining us to discuss the FY 2008 budget for the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  the Drug Enforcement Administration  and the United States Marshals Service   The total Department of Justice budget request for FY 2008 is  20 181 billion  This is a  771 million decrease below the FY 2007 Joint Resolution funding level   The Department faces a  500 million shortfall in the FY 2008 budget  Just as I said last year  the budget constraints placed upon us by the War on Terror and the recent hurricane seasons will once again force us all to make tough decisions   I would be remiss if I didnt mention the tragedy that took place on the Virginia Tech campus Monday morning  My heartfelt thoughts go out to everyone who was affected by this horrible event   The ATF has been one of the lead investigative agencies in this horrible disaster and has done an outstanding job thus far  ATF agents quickly identified ballistic evidence linking a weapon used in the first shooting to the second shooting   Acting Director Sullivan  I commend your personnel in the labs and on the ground for their quick and professional response  This somber day will be one mourned and remembered for many years to come   Also  I once again commend the ATF for its contributions to the quick capture and conviction of the Alabama church arsonists that were sentenced to prison last week   The ATFs FY 2008 request is  1 013 billion  The request is  29 8 million over the FY 2007 Joint Resolution total   The ATF is the premier agency for gun crimes  gang activity  arson  and explosive related crimes  I am committed to ensuring that you have the tools and training facilities you require to fulfill your explosives mission   The National Center for Explosives Research will be a world class addition to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville  Alabama  which is already home of the FBIs Hazardous Devices School   I am working collaboratively to expand the federal governments explosive infrastructure and expertise in Huntsville  This will assist us in our number one priority  terrorism prevention and a safe homeland  Redstone Arsenal should and will be the law enforcement capital of explosives research and training  Acting Director Sullivan  I would like to offer you congratulations on your nomination to be the permanent Director of ATF  Your experience as a U S  Attorney in Massachusetts will serve the ATF and the country well   Administrator Tandy  thank you for coming today  The Drug Enforcement Administrations budget request for FY 2008 is  1 8 billion  a  57 6 million increase over the FY 2007 Joint Resolution total  The role of the DEA has shifted from being solely focused on narcotics to include an intelligence mission and a position on the front line of the War on Terror   As former Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  I know all too well the link between global drug trafficking and terrorism   I understand the detrimental impact a hiring freeze has on DEAs ability to carry out its mission  Senator Mikulski and I will be working together in the FY 2008 process to see to it that you have the manpower you need to carry out your mission  By the same token  as we address the budget shortfalls and hiring freeze  I received a disturbing letter from the Department of Justice on March 6 stating that the cost of the Clandestine Laboratory Training Facility has doubled from  8 million to  16 million   This letter  combined with the disastrous cost escalations  poor estimations and project management of DEAs Information Technology Center that jumped from  7 1 million to  38 million  show a disturbing and unacceptable trend we must correct   I will reserve any further judgment on this matter until we hear the recommendations of the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office  Methamphetamine use continues to poison our nation  knowing no boundaries of age  gender  class  or race  The majority of this drug is shipped into our country from Mexico  I commend DEA and the Department of Justice in the recent success of Operation Imperial Emperor where more than 400 individuals were arrested  and  45 million in U S  currency and 18 tons of illegal drugs were seized from a Mexican drug cartel   Violent Mexican drug cartels have turned our Southwest Border into a battle zone  where our DEA agents put their lives on the line every day  These cartels have their own advanced telecommunications towers and encrypted radios making their communications systems virtually impenetrable with our current surveillance equipment  I hope that you will explain this problem to the subcommittee and let us know how we can put cutting edge technology in our agents hands to infiltrate their systems and cut off this drug pipeline   Director Clark  the United States Marshals Service budget request for FY 2008 is  899 8 million  This is an  80 million increase above the FY 2007 Joint Resolution total   The core responsibilities of the Marshals Service include providing judicial and courthouse security  safeguarding witnesses  transporting prisoners for court proceedings  seizing forfeited property  and apprehending fugitives  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that there are over 600 000 sex offenders in the U S  More than 100 000 of them have failed to register  The Adam Walsh Act tasks Marshals with the removal those unregistered offenders from our streets   Last year  the U S  Customs and Border Protection Agency received funding to hire an additional 2 000 Border Patrol agents  Marshals bear the primary burden of transporting illegal alien prisoners taken into custody by Border Patrol Agents  meaning there will be fewer Marshals removing unregistered sexual offenders from our neighborhoods and streets  This is a problem we must address   The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 authorized the permanent creation of Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces which are comprised of Federal  state and local law enforcement authorities in designated regions  Through this Act  the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force  headquartered in Birmingham  Alabama  was created  Last May 31  at approximately 8 00 a m   a young female lawyer was kidnapped at gunpoint in a parking lot just a few blocks from my office in downtown Birmingham  Some of you might remember seeing video of this as it was captured on a security camera and shown on network news channels all over the nation   Through the efforts of the Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force  the kidnapper was captured and the woman returned to her family without serious bodily injury nine hours later   This is just one example of an exceptional job in a high profile case where these task forces have produced rapid  life saving results because of their coordination with law enforcement agencies at all levels   Finally  the reprehensible working conditions and inadequate security resources our Marshals endure in the District of Columbia Superior Court building have recently been brought to my attention  Stale ventilation  flooding hallways  poor plumbing  malfunctioning lights that are needed to illuminate prisoner traffic areas monitored by security cameras  an archaic prisoner tracking system  and antiquated prisoner scanning devices are conditions that are not acceptable   Director Clark  I understand you visited this facility last Friday  I look forward to hearing about your visit and what we can do together to resolve this very serious matter   I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at the Justice Department and I deeply express my appreciation for all they do to keep America safe                                                        April 2007 News Releases
