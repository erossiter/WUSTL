      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY FIGHTS FOR TANKER FUNDING     July 18  2006 U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  today delivered a statement to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense regarding the omission of  203 932 million in funding for the replacement of the KC 135 tanker  which will potentially be built in Mobile  Alabama  and is critical to our nations efforts in the War on Terror   It is imperative that this program be adequately funded in fiscal year 2007 so that the Air Force can award the contract in a timely manner  said Senator Shelby  I continue to believe that if the Northrop Grumman EADS team is able to participate in a fair and open competition  their proposal would win  Such success will mean significant jobs and investment in Alabama   particularly South Alabama   Senator Shelbys statement   Mr  Chairman  I appreciate the difficulties in putting this bill together and appreciate your hard work and efforts  However  I did want to let you know of my concern about the reduction of funding for the KC 135 Tanker Replacement   Like you  one of my top priorities is to keep our nation safe  and I am working to ensure that our servicemembers have the best equipment  Our Air Force has a fleet of aging refueling tankers that are currently experiencing problems  I do not believe we can wait 35 years to replace them   I understand the fiscal constraints the subcommittee was under  being allocated  9 billion less than the Presidents budget  however I believe that the tanker replacement is vital to our national security and to our servicemembers fighting abroad   While I understand that the subcommittees recommendation to reduce funding was based upon their belief that there is sufficient funding remaining in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 to support systems development and demonstration  the Air Force has stated that they would need at least  70 million in fiscal year 2007 to move forward and award a contract in 2007   I appreciate the Chairmans assistance with this program and look forward to continuing to work with you and the subcommittee to replace our aging tanker fleet   Funding History   The Presidents FY 2007 budget request included  203 932 million for the KC 135 tanker replacement program   The House Armed Services Committee cut  87 million from the tanker program   The House Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations fully funded the tanker at the Presidents budget request of  203 932 million in their FY 2007 bill   The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced funding for the tanker program by  199 million   According to the Air Force  the tanker replacement program has  119 8 million in unobligated funding from FY 2005 and FY 2006  Senator Shelby plans to work to restore funding for the program during conference on the bill                                                             July 2006 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Current record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
