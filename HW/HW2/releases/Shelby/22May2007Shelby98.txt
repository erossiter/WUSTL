for Alabama included in the fiscal year 2007  FY07  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  This legislation will now go to the President for his signature  As we continue our military operations abroad  it is my goal to work in every possible way to make sure that General Petraeus and our troops have my full support  both morally and materially  to carry out their mission  said Shelby  This legislation reinforces the U S  Senates commitment to warfighters in harms way and I was proud to vote in favor of it   Global War on Terror     94 7 billion The bill provides  94 7 billion in emergency spending for the Department of Defense to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom   It is our duty to ensure that our armed forces engaged in combat have the best

 9 4 million will be used for construction of the Recruiting Brigade Operations Building at Redstone Arsenal in FY07  These funds restore the money cut in the FY07 Joint Resolution and will allow the BRAC timeline to remain on schedule  allowing the Department of Defense to rotate forces  train our warfighters  and maintain the overall readiness of our armed forces  Including the  3 1 billion cut in the FY07 Joint Resolution was vital to keeping the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations on schedule  said Shelby  Fully funding the BRAC budget request for 2007 was one of my highest priorities  as it is critical to military readiness and quality of life and to the Department of Defenses transformation efforts   Agriculture Disaster Assistance    3 5 billion  Alabamas agriculture industry has been plighted by severe weather conditions in past years  This funding will allow the Department of Agriculture to address the needs of farmers that were not met through the normal recovery programs  The assistance will cover crop years 2005  2006  and any crops planted by February 28  2007   I have always and will continue to work to protect and preserve Alabamas family farms  said Shelby  Farms are the workhorse of Alabamas rural economy and it is important that we help Alabamas farmers recover from devastating droughts  freezes  and hurricanes from previous crop years   Alabama Coosa River System Dredging Project    3 million The Alabama Coosa river system was seriously damaged when Hurricane Dennis wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast  The state of the river system has significantly strained existing industry that relies on the river  As an example  the silting and shoaling as a result of Dennis is increasing the transportation costs of a single industry on the river by  100 000 each month  The Army Corps of Engineers will use this funding to begin dredging the system to alleviate the problems that have plagued barge traffic over the past several years   The Alabama Coosa River runs through an economically depressed area of the state in serious need of industry and good paying jobs  said Shelby  If the Alabama Coosa can achieve full operational status  jobs and industry will follow  We must not forget the damage these counties have endured  The dredging will ensure that this vital waterway is restored to the people of Alabama  NOAA Direct Assistance to Gulf Coast Fishermen    85 million The Gulf of Mexico is home to a significant share of the U S  fishing industry  accounting for almost 20 percent of all commercial landings  In addition  the recreational fishing industry contributes billions of dollars to the economy of the Gulf Coast each year   Gulf Coast fishermen continue to experience financial hardship as a result of both the 2005 Hurricane Season and rising fuel prices  said Shelby  This funding will help provide much needed assistance to Alabamas fishermen as they continue to recover   State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance    50 million This bill includes  50 million for the Edward Byrne Grant Program  Alabama will receive approximately  17 987 million to assist state and local law enforcement with the increased costs incurred from hurricanes and tornados  Byrne grants are essential to local law enforcement efforts because they provide funding directly to our crime fighters  said Shelby  I firmly believe that those individuals serving on the front lines of our communities know best what they need to successfully do their jobs  We must do all we can to support local law enforcement as they help keep Alabama safe  FBI Hazardous Devices School at Redstone Arsenal    8 1 million The bill includes  338 million for the FBI  of which  8 1 million is for the Hazardous Devices School  HDS  at Redstone Arsenal  The funding will be used to train federal  state  and local bomb technicians  to acquire electronic counter measure training skills  and to equip the HDSs new secure training facility at the FBI Hazardous Devices School  said Shelby  As we continue to fight the Global War on Terror  it is critical that state and local bomb technicians and our FBI agents have the knowledge and training necessary to protect our communities from ever evolving threats     Port Security Grants    110 million This bill includes  110 million for port security grants  Port security is a vital part of Alabamas transportation infrastructure and economy  said Shelby  Under this program  Alabama can apply for additional funding to continue their efforts to implement and enhance critical security measures to protect our state port facilities  As long as terrorist threats exist  it is critical that we protect our state ports from possible attacks  Transit Security Grants     100 million Transit Security Grants fund intercity rail passenger transportation  freight rail  and transit security grants  Security enhancements to our transportation system are vital to the overall security of our nation  As witnesses to the attacks in London and Madrid  we must remain vigilant and ensure our transportation infrastructure is secure
