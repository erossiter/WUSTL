      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     CJS HEARING ON NOAA AND NSF BUDGET   Opening Statement of Ranking Member Richard Shelby   March 8  2007  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R Ala    Ranking Member of the Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee  CJS   today made the following opening statement at the hearing of the Subcommittee to examine the proposed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  and National Science Foundation  NSF  budget for fiscal year 2008   Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  Thank you  Madam Chairman  And thank you Admiral Lautenbacher and Dr  Bement for joining us today   This is an important hearing because it gives me the opportunity to talk about the critical roles the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation play in the economic  scientific  and intellectual growth of this nation  Science and technology drive the engine of our countrys economic future   Cutting edge technology creates a better quality of life for us all  The strategic Federal investment in scientific research  particularly the funding support at NSF  has led to innovative problem solving and technological developments that have dramatically increased the countrys economic growth  NOAAs budget request for Fiscal Year 2008 is  3 8 billion  This is a decrease of  100 million from the funding level provided in the Joint Resolution for Fiscal Year 2007  In stark contrast to the budget for NOAA  the budget request for NSF is  6 4 billion  an increase of  513 million over the 2007 Joint Resolution level   Last Thursday  my home state of Alabama was devastated by a storm system that spawned killer tornados that claimed the lives of 10 people  destroyed hundreds of homes and a school  and severely damaged another school   In Southeast Alabamas Coffee County  a tornado slammed into Enterprise High School  collapsing a roof killing eight students  Not far from the school in Enterprise  an elderly woman was killed by flying storm debris  In West Alabamas Wilcox County  the storm claimed the life of a Millers Ferry father who was crushed in his home   While we will never recover from the loss of life  I am certain that the people in Alabama will work to rebuild even stronger communities and I will continue to do everything in my power to get them the resources they need to do so  It will take time and resources for the damaged communities to begin to heal and erase the scars of this destruction   Our nation as a whole needs to do more to protect our citizens  not just with storm prediction  but also with disaster response and community preparedness  We must improve short term forecasting and gain a better understating of long term climate change   After forecasting  we must explore what can be done in advance communications so that warnings can reach communities quicker  We must find better ways to respond  Emergency coordination after a severe storm is a critical but often overlooked function in saving lives  The people of Alabama are resilient and have already begun cleaning up and planning to rebuild    I saw this firsthand when I toured some of the damaged area with President Bush this past Saturday  But how can we ensure that they rebuild safer homes and schools to withstand the next storm  I dont have to be a NOAA weather forecaster to predict that another devastating storm will hit Alabama again    its just a matter of time  Will our citizens be any safer  Hurricanes Ivan  Katrina  and Rita showed us how vulnerable we are to natural disasters  Last week  we were grimly reminded that we still have a long way to go in finding answers to the lessons taught to us by those hurricanes  Science  technology  and research hold many of these answers   Today  Admiral  I will be asking for your support and guidance on how we can better respond to these natural disasters  Last weeks storms claimed 20 lives from Alabama  Georgia  and Missouri  We cannot eliminate severe storms  but we should envision a day when we can live with them more safely   Overall  I am concerned about the health of NOAAs science budget  Congress continually receives a budget request from the Administration that downplays critical science activities when compared to the previous years funding levels  The NOAA FY 2008 request is less than what the agency received in 2007  2006  and 2005  In past years  the Joint Ocean Commission has clearly and objectively laid out the budgetary requirements to better support ocean related science research and education  NOAAs budget request boasts a  123 million increase for ocean related activities  while NSFs request to study marine ecosystems and associated human impacts contains only a  17 million increase  These modest figures represent only a fraction of the true budgetary needs for the marine community   I am pleased to see that the American Competitiveness Initiative  or ACI  has continued to receive support from the Administration through the National Science Foundations budget request  The ACI will keep the competitive edge that our nation expects in the world economy through research and innovation  by focusing on the ingenuity of our people  and tying our capabilities to policies that will keep us at the forefront of scientific and technical advancement for generations to come   The ACI provides a tremendous opportunity to maintain our national technological advantage in more competitive world  However  I do not think that it goes far enough to take advantage of our existing federal investments  The funding of the ACI includes an increase of  366 million in the Research and Related Activities account at NSF  While this benefits current research  I am concerned about what we are doing to encourage the next generation of researchers   The long term vision must include increasing opportunities for colleges and universities across the country to participate in innovation  Many of the funds provided to NSF as part of the ACI will go to traditional research schools that have historically fared well in obtaining research grants   We should find ways to raise the bar of competitiveness to reach out to universities that have not traditionally been taken into consideration  We also need to provide the funds to increase the level of science education through better curriculum and inspiring K 12 science teachers  NSF is the ideal place to begin such a long term investment   I am concerned about the number of American students enrolling in science and engineering fields of study  The most recent report from the Council on Competitiveness states that foreign students account for most of the growth in Ph D s in science and engineering  despite the progress being made by females and minorities in this area   Our lack of new scientists and engineers will eventually become a crisis  We are not attracting enough young students into these disciplines and are relying too heavily on foreign students  These same students return to their homeland where competitive jobs are becoming increasingly available  To remain at the cutting edge of innovation  we need to act now in cultivating our own next generation of engineers and scientists  There is much untapped potential within our own borders  we must make this a priority   The Office of Science and Technology Policy states that the goal of ACIs goal is not to introduce entirely new government programs  but to increase fundamental research capacity  While there is significant Federal investment in research and innovation  there should be a much broader vision to include agencies beyond those already included in the ACI  while not diluting current efforts  Along these lines  it is discouraging to see that the Administration wants to see the Nation at the forefront of innovation  yet chooses to exclude NOAA from the initiative  NOAA stands out as an international leader in marine and atmospheric science  and as a cornerstone of our nations research community  NOAAs education and outreach activities appear to fall directly in line with ACIs educational goals  As I stated here in last weeks Department of Commerce hearing  I am concerned why this agency is not recognized as a candidate for the ACI program  I want to thank the Chairman for having this hearing today and I look forward to the statements of Admiral Lautenbacher and Dr  Bement                                                          March 2007 News Releases                      Year            County
