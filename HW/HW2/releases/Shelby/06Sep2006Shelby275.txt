      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     SHELBY  PLANNED RESPONSE TO FUTURE DISASTERS IS ESSENTIAL        September 7  2006    U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL   a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  today attended a subcommittee hearing on disaster preparedness and the lessons learned after Hurricane Katrina  Senator Shelbys submitted an opening statement for the record  which highlights the need for planned responses to future disasters to ensure our efforts are both efficient and effective   Below is Senator Shelbys opening statement  as submitted for the record  Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this important hearing today  Admiral Allen  Under Secretary Foresman and Under Secretary Paulison your presence is essential because the Senate needs to hear directly from each of you about your agencys needs and the challenges you anticipate facing in the future   Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive natural disasters to ever hit our nation  Peoples lives were shattered  families were broken apart  and homes were destroyed  In my own state  whole communities were devastated by this terrible tragedy   But that devastation pales in comparison to our neighboring Gulf States where they suffered immensely and are still trying to recover today   Alabamians and the entire Gulf community have an amazing resolve and they are working to restore the strong economic engines that existed in the region prior to Katrina  They could not have made it where they are today without the assistance of our Chairman   On behalf of the people of Alabama  I would like to thank you  Mr  Chairman  for your support of the recovery of the Gulf Coast  In addition to the panel before us now  we will also hear from Bruce Baughman and Stanley Ellis  These gentlemen represent the interests of state and local emergency managers  As Alabamas Director of Emergency Management  Mr  Baughman was intricately involved in Hurricane Katrina preparation and recovery  His leadership helped Alabama move quickly down the road to recovery  His decades of experience at both the federal and local level will provide the committee some valuable insights into disaster management and preparedness  As we move forward we must look carefully at the progress that has been made since Hurricane Katrina but we must also carefully examine the failures  both in terms of response and recovery  It is critical that we  as a nation  are better prepared to respond to all disasters whether they are acts of God or acts of man  While the risk of another terrorist attack is just as real today as it was five years ago  we must also recognize the impact that loss of life  property  and employment from natural disasters can have on our communities   I hope to hear more today about how the Department is balancing the risks  needs  requirements  tasks and jurisdictions of its roughly 20 agencies to prepare for the next event  whatever it may be   The Senate has a responsibility to make sure the Department is adequately funded so that it may carry out the planned response to future disasters  but it would be imprudent for us to go about this blindly  We want to make sure that you are better organized and that you have learned from the mistakes of the past  The governments response to Katrina could have been better and I look forward to learning about the steps that have been taken to eliminate the response shortfalls and what steps remain  A plan without proper execution is merely words on paper  Proper execution can only occur with well trained  properly equipped first responders  Whether it is a FEMA recovery team  a state emergency management group  or a volunteer search and rescue squad  we must do everything in our power to ensure that those responsible for executing the plan are well equipped  fully trained  and prepared to execute the plan appropriately to save lives and property from further destruction   Mr  Chairman  I am hopeful that the individuals appearing before us today will provide the Committee with a better understanding of the remaining needs in all facets of preparedness  response and recovery   I am particularly interested in hearing about the Departments efforts to effectively train the men and women that are willing to put themselves in harms way when duty calls  Again this is a critical hearing and I applaud the Chairman for holding it today  It is always important to look back and learn if we are to move forward                                                         September 2006 News Releases
