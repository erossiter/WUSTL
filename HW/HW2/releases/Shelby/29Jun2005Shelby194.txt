      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY STATEMENT BEFORE BRAC COMMISSION      June 30  2005   ATLANTA  GA    U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   as head of the Alabama delegation in the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  process  testified before the BRAC Commission during todays hearing in Atlanta   After providing opening remarks  Senator Shelby focused on two aspects of the Department of Defenses recommendations   He was then followed by remarks from Senator Jeff Sessions  R AL   representatives from Alabamas base communities  and Governor Bob Riley  R AL    Each of the presenters at the hearing devoted their time to different issues to ensure that Alabamas military priorities were clearly articulated to the Commission   Senator Shelbys statement  as prepared  is below                  I would like to thank the Commissioners for being here today to further examine the important role Alabama s military installations play in our national security   I am joined today by Senator Sessions  Congressmen Cramer  Everett  Bachus  and Rogers  Governor Riley  mayors  state officials  and elected and appointed community leaders from Alabama s military base communities                     Overall  the BRAC recommendations were favorable for Alabama  and we appreciate the Department of Defense recognizing and reinforcing Alabama s contributions to our nation s defense                       Alabama is the heart of the Army s extensive missile and space research and development  RD  programs         It is home to Army Aviation  provides the full spectrum of Air Force education initiatives  and maintains every tracked vehicle in the Army inventory   Alabama has an unsurpassed network of universities  research facilities  and industrial expertise not duplicated anywhere else in the United States   Every major defense and aerospace technology company is present in Alabama  Alabama provides worldwide leadership in missile technology  launch capabilities  and aviation RD  Alabama represents a critical mass of unique assets and capabilities essential to protecting our nation s security interests  and its strategic position is critical to our national defense                      We were pleased with the majority of the BRAC recommendations   Overall  Alabama will increase in both missions and personnel with the addition of           The Army Materiel Command    Headquarters for the Space and Missile Defense Command    Extensive Missile Defense Agency missions    The Aviation Logistics School    And an addition of both C 130s and    F 16s for our National Guard                           The recommendations increase efficiency  support consolidation  and realign the force to support research  development  and training in ways that will enhance our military   I am pleased to see DoD has recognized Alabama s bases  role in our national security                     However  there are five recommendations we respectfully ask you to reexamine                       We believe that the recommendations in these areas either deviated substantially from DoD s military value criteria or that the issues were not properly assessed  resulting in flawed recommendations   As Alabama continues its testimony today  I urge the Commission to further investigate these matters                     Today you will hear not only from me about the BRAC recommendations  but from Senator Sessions  a variety of community leaders  as well as Governor Riley   Further  we have included the testimony from Alabama s Congressmen in your package   I will now briefly address two of the five issues we would like the BRAC Commission to reconsider                       First  Fort Rucker  already home to Army and Air Force rotary wing training is slated to receive enlisted aviation training as well   This consolidation makes sense   We fight jointly   we must train jointly and I fully support this recommendation                       However  one piece of the rotary wing puzzle is missing   Navy rotary wing training was not included in the consolidation   The Army and Air Force have been successfully training together for 30 years   It makes perfect sense to train all three Services at the same location   In a warfighting environment that is becoming ever more joint  in a future filled with common airframes  shared services  and dual hatted commanders  the Navy s helicopter training should be co located with the Army and Air Force at Fort Rucker                     The Navy will argue that their training is unique  because it is necessary for Navy aviators to train over water and replicate landing on carriers   The Navy will contend that Whiting Field should remain as their site for rotary training   However  the Navy overlooks these facts                       Fort Rucker s rotary training already meets or exceeds all of the Navy s requirements for over water training   Fort Rucker is only 30 minutes from the water and trains Army  Air Force  and foreign countries  pilots in over water survival training and provides dunker training for simulating in water crashes   Every aspect of Navy rotary training can be accomplished at Fort Rucker                       Fort Rucker s training airspace is the size of South Carolina                       Fort Rucker is rated number 7 in military value among all Army training installations and higher than Whiting Field in 6 of 7 military value criteria                       Fort Rucker has every simulator and training device necessary to train aviators of all Services  while Whiting Field s simulation assets are already overextended                       With the capacity to easily expand to host Navy rotary training  it is apparent that this consolidation would be both cost effective  saving DoD approximately  100 million dollars  and synergistic   It just makes good sense to consolidate all three Services  rotary flight training  and I ask the Commission to consider relocating the Navy rotary wing pilot training to Fort Rucker                       The second issue I wish to address is consolidation of resources   In many cases  consolidation saves money and eliminates duplicative services  but it does not make sense in every situation                       Many aspects of national security operations need to be redundant   sustained in several geographic areas or by multiple commands   If one goes down  another can seamlessly replace it                       That is why DoD s recommendation to combine the Operations and Sustainment Systems Group  OSSG   located at Maxwell Gunter Air Force Base  with other information technology assets into a new information systems RD center at Hanscom Air Force Base is perplexing   This appears to be a simple consolidation of RD information system functions at one location   However  that is not the case                       The underlying flaw in this recommendation is that the OSSG has a 24 7 operations and sustainment mission for Air Force  DoD  and joint information technology systems   It is not an RD group   The OSSG is the sole agency overseeing the operations and sustainment of Air Force IT missions                         The OSSG is co located at Maxwell Gunter with the Defense Information Systems Agency  DISA    the organization that is similarly responsible for the operational side of DoD IT networks   The operational expertise that exists in these two organizations and their associated contract workforce could not be realistically duplicated  hired  or replaced in a timely manner   Its loss would result in a direct reduction of support to our combat forces during a time of war                     If the OSSG were moved to Hanscom  all of its operational functions would have to be reconstituted  resulting in significant additional costs with no efficiency or synergistic gains   Additionally  the existing relationship between OSSG and DISA would be destroyed                     As you listen to our presentation today I ask that you consider the following              Does this recommendation fit the BRAC concept of Centers of Excellence or meet the BRAC criteria    Does it increase military value or decrease risk for the warfighter    Does it increase the ability to operate jointly    Does the relocation save money                      I support consolidation   when it makes sense   However  moving the OSSG to Hanscom does not appear to provide cost savings or any synergistic advantage   According to a COBRA model that used current endstrength and contractor data  it would actually cost  413 million over 20 years to reproduce the OSSG mission at Hanscom   It is clear that in this instance  consolidation does not make sense   I ask the Commission to consider amending DoD s recommendation so that the OSSG remains at Maxwell Gunter                     The speed and intensity of modern war means that the United States will not have time to leisurely build up forces or construct new bases in the future  as we have in the past   Therefore  we need to ensure that the decisions made today do not adversely affect the way we fight tomorrow                       Again  I would like to thank the Commission for this opportunity to discuss the role Alabama s installations play in our nation s defense and the impact of the BRAC recommendations   Thank you
