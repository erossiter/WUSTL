      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY INTRODUCES CONSTITUTION RESTORATION ACT   Legislation limits jurisdiction of federal courts in certain cases  Promotes federalism  March 3  2005   WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Sen  Richard C  Shelby  R Ala   today introduced legislation to address the judicial activism so evident in our federal courts   The Constitution Restoration Act  which was first introduced by Senator Shelby in the 108th Congress  aims to reinforce states rights by clarifying that the Supreme Court and district courts do not have jurisdiction to hear cases brought against a federal  state or local government or officer for acknowledging God as the sovereign source of law  liberty  or government    Senator Shelby made the following remarks about the legislation     I am pleased to introduce this important piece of legislation that goes to the very foundation of our country and the legitimacy of our system of government   Over the years  we have seen a disturbing and growing trend in our federal courts to deny the rights of our states and our citizens to acknowledge God openly and freely   These tortured legal decisions distort our constitution  our nation s history and its tradition in an effort to secularize our system of government and divest morality from our rule of law     Five years ago  the Supreme Court determined that students could not engage in voluntary prayer at a school football game   More recently  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it was unconstitutional to recite the words one Nation under God in the Pledge of Allegiance  and a district court in my State of Alabama ruled it was unconstitutional to display the Ten Commandments     It is unfortunate that we have these examples to point to because the simple fact is  our government and our laws are based on Judeo Christian values and a recognition of God as our Creator    The Declaration of Independence by which we justify the very foundation of our political system holds these truths to be self evident  that all Men are created equal  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights  that among these are Life  Liberty  and the Pursuit of Happiness That to secure these Rights  Governments are instituted among Men  deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed     Without a recognition of these basic moral truths  we cannot speak of liberty since it would it would no longer be an inalienable right  and we cannot speak of justice since our laws would have no moral reasoning and therefore no legitimacy     Our motto is In God We Trust    It is enshrined on our currency     Our national anthem recognizes our motto as In God is Our Trust     As a federal official  I took an oath of office   The President takes a similar one   State and local officials and our military personnel all swear a similar oath    Jurors and witnesses in our state and federal courts take an oath as do witnesses before Congress    We all swear to uphold the Constitution or tell the truth  so help me God     Our courts  including the Supreme Court  recognize God in their official proceedings  both the House and Senate acknowledge God through an opening prayer every morning   Our public buildings and monuments honor this heritage through various depictions of the basic moral foundations of our laws and system of government     My point is that you simply can not divest God from our country   Our country has no foundation without a basic recognition that God invests us at birth with basic individual rights  such as the blessings of liberty  that we all enjoy as Americans     I believe that the Courts have exceeded their power   This legislation recognizes the rights of the states and the people as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution  ninth and tenth amendments  to acknowledge God     I am pleased to have introduced this bill today and look forward to ushering this legislation through the United State Senate as quickly as possible  Shelby concluded     Representative Robert Aderholt  R AL 4  introduced a companion version of this bill in the House of Representatives      30
