SENATE PASSES SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL   Shelby Announces Important Alabama Defense Programs to Benefit  April 21  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R Ala   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced Senate passage of the fiscal year 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill   By a vote of 99   0  the Senate approved this legislation  which includes funding for programs and projects that benefit Alabama military installations   Following todays action by the Senate  this legislation will now go to a conference committee with the House of Representatives   Close in Active Protection System Integration for the Stryker  CIAPS     12 million   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased our bill includes  12 million in research and development funds for the Close in Active Protection System Integration for use on the Stryker  CIAPS    CIAPS consists of a radar staring in all directions that can detect an incoming threat and launch one of an array of pre positioned interceptors to intercept and destroy the warhead before it hits the protected vehicle  CIAPS is effective against anti tank guided missiles  ATGMs  as well as rocket propelled grenades  RPGs    This research will be performed at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville  AL     Stryker procurement    44 million   Senator Shelby said  Our bill includes  44 million for procurement of the Stryker family of vehicles  Anniston Army Depot plays a significant role in this program  with over 1 000 Strykers already produced at the Depot  and Stryker production in Anniston continues to gain momentum  This program is a critical part of the Army s Transformation effort  and I am pleased that Anniston is helping to lead the Army into the future     Chemical Agents Munitions Destruction   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the bill acknowledges that the chemical demilitarization program requires more funding to comply with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  START      Specifically  the language in the bill reads  The Committee believes the chemical demilitarization  program will require significantly more funding to comply with the Treaty   The Committee does not support the use of appropriated funds for any studies that consider transporting chemical munitions across state lines   Further  the Committee expects that all of the planned sites will be developed and operated to include Blue Grass  KY  and Pueblo  CO  and instructs the Department of Defense to begin obligation of funds at Blue Grass and Pueblo immediately     This is an important step for the Anniston Army Depot   I shared the concerns of many regarding the announcement by the Army Chemicals Material Agency that they were to study the transportation of chemical weapons across State lines  Shelby continued     Death Gratuity Payment   Senator Shelby said  I believe it is critically important that the families of our men and women in the Armed Forces who make the ultimate sacrifice see compensation for their loss   This legislation increases the death gratuity payment to  100 000 in cases when death results from wounds  injuries  or illness that are combat related or occurs in a combat operation or combat zone   Further  the legislation increases the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance  SGLI  to  400 000 from the current  250 000   I was pleased to support this provision  which my fellow Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions introduced in the Senate     Remote Observation Video Encoded Receiver  ROVER  Joint Tactical C4I Transceiver System  JTCITS     19 million   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased this bill will fund additional quantities of the Remote Observation Video Encoded Receiver  ROVER  III and ancillary equipment  and complete the transformation of the ROVER III into Joint Tactical C4I Transceiver System  JTCITS    Much of the work for this programs is completed in Huntsville    The funding will produce operational quantities of components to field the system to a Ranger Battalion or equivalent size Special Operations unit    This system is a robust tactical wireless network that directly links the individual soldier to imagery and sensor information   This device packages these multiple essential combat capabilities  with the ability to down link imagery from an overhead platform  into a single light weight hand held package  This program has been developed to function either as an integral part of a battlefield tactical wireless network  or to operate in a stand alone mode to provide the individual warfighter on the ground with immediate access to information available from all supporting manned and unmanned aircraft and ground sensors        30                                                          April 2005 News
