      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY URGES ACTION ON MILITARY RESERVIST TAX CREDIT BILL     April 20  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL  today urged his colleagues to take action on legislation that he and Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND  introduced to ease the financial burden placed upon military reservists and their families    Senator Shelby  while recognizing that the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill was not the appropriate vehicle for this legislation  used this opportunity to encourage the Senate Armed Services Committee to take action on this legislation this year   The following text is Senator Shelbys floor statement  as prepared     Mr  President  I rise today to speak about this amendment because I believe it is very important to our Reserve and Guard units who have been called upon to serve their country during this time of war   This amendment is based on a bill I introduced last month with Senator Dorgan  and it provides a financial safety net for the families of our servicemembers proudly serving in our Nation s military Reserve and National Guard     Today  our National Guard and Reserve units are being called upon more than ever and are being asked to serve their country in a very different way than in the past  The Global War on Terror and the high operational tempo of our military require that our reserve components play a more active role in the total force     These long tours and frequent activations have a profound and disruptive effect on the lives of these men and women and on the lives of their families and loved ones  Many of our Reservists suffer a significant loss of income when they are mobilized   forcing them to leave often higher paying civilian jobs to serve their country  Such losses can be compounded by additional family expenses associated with military activation  including the cost of long distance phone calls and the need for additional child care  These circumstances create a serious financial burden that is extremely difficult for Reservists  families to manage  We can and should do more to alleviate this financial burden     Therefore  this amendment would provide a completely refundable income tax credit of up to  20 000 annually to a military Reservist called to Active Duty  The amount of the tax credit would be based upon the difference between wages paid by the Reservist s civilian job and the military wages paid upon mobilization  The tax credit would be available to members of the National Guard or Ready Reserve who are serving for more than 90 days and would vary according to their length of service     Now  Mr  President  is the time to recognize the service and sacrifice of the men and women who are in the Guard and Reserves   I believe that Congress must focus on this issue   it is important to thousands of servicemembers who are serving their country and struggling financially     I recognize that the Emergency Supplemental may not be the best place to begin a discussion about this subject so I urge my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee to not only study  but to work with me and Senator Dorgan to act on this issue this year     At a time when the nation is calling our Guardsmen and Reservists to Active Duty to execute the war in Iraq  fight the War on Terrorism  and to defend our homeland  it is imperative that Congress recognize their vital role and acknowledge that the success of our military depends on these troops  It is not too much to ask of our nation and more importantly  Mr  President  it is the right thing to do     Thank you  Mr  President   I want to withdraw my amendment  and I yield the floor        30                                                          April 2005 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                  Current record                                                                                                         Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
