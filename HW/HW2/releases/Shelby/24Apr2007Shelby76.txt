      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     Senator Shelby Speaks at a CJS Hearing on FBI Budget   April 26  2007  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala    Ranking Member of the Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee  CJS   today made the following opening statement at the hearing of the Subcommittee to examine the proposed Federal Bureau of Investigations  FBI  budget for fiscal year 2008   Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  Director Mueller  thank you for joining us today to discuss the Federal Bureau of Investigations 2008 budget request  One week after your arrival as the 6th director of the FBI  our nation suffered the worst terrorist attack ever on U S  soil  The September 11  2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon signified the transformation of a new FBI with greater focus on national security  Congress has tasked the FBI with more responsibility than any other federal law enforcement agency  resulting in more challenges and changes than ever before  The FBI is the Nation s premier law enforcement counter terrorism and counter intelligence agency that investigates criminal activity and includes terrorism  foreign intelligence operations  espionage  cyber crime  public corruption  national criminal organizations  white collar crime and significant violent crime   The FBI request for 2008 is  6 4 billion  This is a  391 million increase over the 2007 Joint Resolution funding level   It has come to my attention that the FBI has a  132 million shortfall in the 2008 budget request  Chairman Mikulski and I want to work with you to ensure that the FBI has sufficient resources to protect our nation   Based on my review of your request  combined with the likely fiscal constraints of this Subcommittee  we will need your assistance as we face tough funding decisions regarding the allocation of resources in your budget  This Subcommittee and the Bureau share the difficult task of targeting these limited resources in a manner that safeguards taxpayer dollars while preserving public safety   The Department of Justices Inspector General recently issued a report critical of the FBIs use of National Security Letters  The IGs review found that more than 60 percent of the files examined included violations of the FBIs own policies and procedures   The report also identified significant abuses in the use of exigent letters  The FBI regularly issued them when no emergency existed  often when there was not even a criminal case open  The lack of controls in the use of National Security Letters and exigent letters is very troubling  but as the former Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  I also know that they are critical in your mission of keeping America safe  Director Mueller  in our meeting last month  you committed to fixing the deficiencies identified in the IG report and implementing its 10 recommendations  The FBI must carefully balance the privacy protections and civil liberties of Americans against the need to provide its agents critical information that is pivotal to mission success  Chairman Mikulski and I have provided the FBI  10 million in the current War Supplemental to carry out the IGs recommendations to fix these problems   We are all extremely saddened by the tragedy that took place on the Virginia Tech campus last week  I understand that the FBI dispatched 20 agents  four victim assistance specialists  and one terrorism victim specialist  I look forward to hearing from the Director about the FBIs role and what these men and women are doing to assist those affected by this horrific event  While I wholeheartedly support bringing the FBI into the 21st century  and realize the importance of information technology  IT  to the FBIs mission  I have a number of unanswered questions about Sentinels phase one implementation  As I stated last year  given your Trilogy failure  I will not support unlimited and unchecked resources and will not tolerate broken promises for results for IT projects that are not fulfilled or delivered   I understand that things are on track and within budget  but I expect the questions of this Committee to be answered in a timely and complete manner  That has not occurred  but I am hopeful that with your commitment here today  we will be able to continue our support for this needed project   The FBIs Hazardous Devices School  HDS  at Redstone Arsenal is the crown jewel of the Federal Governments effort to provide training to Federal  State  and local bomb technicians  In partnership with the Army  this facility has trained over 20 000 bomb technicians in the past 36 years  That is a proven record of success  HDS is the only pre blast explosives training school in the United States  With the continued construction of the National Center for Explosives Research  Redstone Arsenal will become the home of Federal law enforcement explosives training and research   I am working collaboratively to expand the Federal governments explosive infrastructure and expertise in Huntsville  I look forward to working with you  Director Mueller  to ensure that Redstone Arsenal is and will continue to be the law enforcement capital of explosives research and training   There are many other issues Id like to discuss  including the use of resources for the FBIs priority missions  In addition  I would like to talk about the relationship of the FBI Director to the new Director of National Intelligence and the financial and manpower implications for the FBI   I remain concerned that this new arrangement  while important  is placing additional personnel stresses on an over burdened FBI  I fear that some of the FBIs traditional law enforcement responsibilities will not be sufficiently supported by this budget request   Director Mueller  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the FBIs budget request  and I look forward to working with you on these and other important issues facing our Nation  Now  I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at the Federal Bureau of Investigation for all they do to keep this country secure                                                         April
