SHELBY ANNOUNCES HURRICANE RECOVERY FUNDING    December 21  2005   WASHINGTON  DC    U  S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced U S  Senate approval of important funding for hurricane recovery included in the amended version of Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report for fiscal year 2006   The Senate amended the conference report to remove provisions relating to oil exploration in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR    The amended legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 93   0    The legislation must now return to the House of Representatives for a vote   Upon passage  the legislation will be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature          Senator Shelby said  I am pleased that the bill includes important hurricane recovery funding   The 2005 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record   It is critical we aid the people  businesses and communities of Alabama and the Gulf Coast who were affected by these natural disasters   However  I am disappointed the Senate was unable to maintain the provisions relating to oil exploration in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  which would have created the Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Prevention and Assistance Fund       Community Development Block Grant    11 5 billion      Senator Shelby said  This funding will be provided to the Coastal states for relief efforts and mitigation activities  including housing assistance  infrastructure development  and assistance to public services       Department of Justice    229 million      Senator Shelby said  This funding provides  125 million to support state and local law enforcement activities in hurricane damaged areas  including the hiring of additional officers in areas that have experienced a sudden population increase due to hurricane evacuees  as well as replacing equipment that was damaged  lost  or destroyed by the hurricane   In addition  the legislation includes funding to repair  rebuild  and replace facilities  infrastructure  and equipment damaged or destroyed by the hurricanes for the United States Attorneys  United States Marshals Service  Federal Bureau of Investigation  Drug Enforcement Administration  Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Prison System   United States Department of Agriculture    1 1 billion                                                                                             Senator Shelby said  The Emergency Forestry Conservation Reserve Program will receive  404 1 million to help provide assistance for forest landowners in hurricane affected counties   In addition there is  200 million provided for the Emergency Conservation Program  ECP  to rehabilitate farmland damage caused by natural disasters and  300 million is provided through the Emergency Watershed Program  EWP  to remove debris  repair structures  and reshape and protect eroded land   Small Business Administration Disaster Loan Program    466 million      Senator Shelby said  I am pleased this funding was included to provide loans to businesses and homeowners who have sustained physical damage and economic injury as a result of the 2005 hurricane season   This program will also aid in the costs associated with administering these loans       NASA    349 8 million       Senator Shelby said  This funding will provide necessary repairs and hardening for NASA facilities that sustained hurricane damage   These facilities are critical to the mission of NASA and are integral to the Shuttle program and for future manned space activities       National Institute of Standards and Technology    4 5 million      Senator Shelby said  I am pleased that language was included to waive the matching requirements of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program for Centers serving areas affected by the 2005 hurricanes   These funds will cover costs associated with the match waiver for any funds received in fiscal year 2006          30                                                            December 2005 News Releases                      Year            County
