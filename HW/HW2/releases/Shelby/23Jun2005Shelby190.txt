      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY COMMENDS PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL      June 28  2005   WASHINGTON  D  C      U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL  today commended Senate passage of H R  6  the Energy Policy Act of 2005   By a vote of 85   12  the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Energy Bill  which will now head to a conference committee with the House of Representatives for consideration   Senator Shelby made the following statement regarding passage of the bill                  I am pleased that the Senate has been able to come to agreement and pass an Energy Bill   This legislation encourages increased domestic production so that consumers will experience more stable gas prices  and the country will lessen its dependency on foreign oil   The bill also creates incentives for alternative energy production and conservation efforts  including improved fuel efficiency   I am encouraged by the bills strong focus on energy reliability   Without a long term strategy to ensure steady  reliable supplies of energy  we put our economy and the way of life it supports at risk                     I am very encouraged that the bill permanently halts the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions  FERC  Standard Market Design  SMD  proposed rulemaking   SMD calls for a one size fits all electricity template for the entire country  eliminating a states ability to make decisions on electricity issues   In particular  it would allow the relatively inexpensive power Alabamians currently receive to be shipped to other areas of the country  forcing us in the Southeast to pick up the tab   Additionally  the SMD proposal would force rate payers in Alabama to cover the costs of upgrading transmission in Alabama in order for excess power to be shipped out of the region   Therefore  we would pay for power upgrades that serve high cost areas  such as New York City  while providing no benefit to consumers in Alabama   I believe all Alabamians can declare victory with this provision                     I was also pleased that I was able to work with Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman to include report language  which clarifies the involvement that States and localities should have in the siting  construction  and operation of LNG facilities   There is no question that state and local governments have a keen understanding of the needs of their communities  and this language provides clarity as to what their role should be in this process   While this is an important step  I am hopeful that during the conference process we can include even more substantive language as a part of the bill itself  which will establish a clear and direct line of communication between the FERC and States and localities                     For the first time  the Senate Bill includes provisions that will allow Alabama to receive a share of the royalties from oil and gas leases in federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf  This will provide over  16 million a year for conservation  master planning and infrastructure development for Alabamas coastal areas                     Finally  I am hopeful that  during conference with the House  the conferees can come to agreement about exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR    While the Senates bill did not include such a provision  the House bill did   I believe that oil exploration in ANWR  done in an environmentally safe and sound manner  is an important step towards reducing our dependency on foreign sources of oil  Shelby concluded            30                                                          June 2005 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Current record                                                                                                                                                      Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
