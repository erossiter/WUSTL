      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    CONFERENCE COMMITTEE APPROVES FY 2006 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL               June 8  2006   U  S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced Conference Committee approval of important funding for Alabama included in the fiscal year 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill for the Global War on Terror and Hurricane Relief  The bill will soon be voted on in the House  The Senate will consider the bill following House approval  after which it will be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature    GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR  Abrams Tanks    600 million  Senator Shelby said  I am pleased that the supplemental restored funding for the M1A2 Abrams tank fleet  These funds will allow for the continuation of upgrades and maintenance on the Abrams  providing our warfighters with the most advanced equipment available  The Anniston Army Depot plays a major role in the refurbishment of the Abrams and I believe that these funds will allow production in Alabama to continue and ensure our servicemembers have the necessary troop protection and critical survivability capabilities essential to our current military operations    HURRICANE RELIEF  Surveying and Mapping for Marine Debris Removal    20 million  Senator Shelby said  The most important step of marine debris removal is surveying and mapping  To ensure the safety of our fishermen  we must first locate the debris so that it may be removed from the fishing grounds throughout the Gulf  This process will keep boats from colliding with hazardous items that may have been created by last years storms  It will also lower the risk of fisherman snagging debris  instead of catching fish  which could ruin their nets and damage other fishing gear   Oyster Bed and Shrimp Ground Reseeding  Rehabilitation  and Restoration    128 million Senator Shelby said  We must reseed and rehabilitate oyster beds  and clean up and monitor shrimp grounds throughout the Gulf Coast region  The program will attempt to restore productive oyster reefs and shrimp grounds in areas that have experienced a loss due to environmental and harvesting factors  A resurgence of these habitats will also significantly impact the water quality and clarity in the region   Physical Oceanographic Real Time Systems  PORTS      2 million  Senator Shelby said  The PORTS systems monitor the water levels and currents to provide up to date information to commercial ships traveling in and out of ports and harbors for efficient and safe navigation  The data and information gathered by the PORTS systems can be accessed by ship captains and harbor pilots while navigating on approaches to the port and into the dock  The ports of Mobile  Pascagoula  Gulfport  and New Orleans will each receive  500 000 for the installation of a PORTS system  Maritime commerce transports 95  of all good in the United States so it is critical we equip our ports with the necessary tools to operate efficiently and effectively   Repair and Replace Tide Gauge Stations    1 million  Senator Shelby said  This funding will allow for the repair and replacement of tide gauge stations in the Gulf Coast region  Tide gauges measure daily water levels and are critical to measuring and predicting coastal flooding and dangerous storm surges that result from hurricanes  We must repair and replace these stations as tidal readings assist communities with evacuations and help save lives   Procurement  Acquisition and Construction     12 million  Senator Shelby said  This funding will be used to replace the aging emergency response mapping aircraft and sensor package which will allow NOAA to continue its capability to provide information about hurricane damage  This is a Citation aircraft that responds to national emergencies to acquire aerial data  images and elevation readings  of disaster areas to help emergency responders manage relief efforts and locate evacuees in need of assistance  NOAAs current citation was the only plane authorized to acquire data over the World Trade Center and the Pentagon immediately after September 11  2001  NOAA has only one of this type of plane  and these funds are only being used to replace this aging plane  not add to NOAA infrastructure                                                          June 2006 News Releases
