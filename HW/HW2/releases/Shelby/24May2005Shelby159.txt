      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY CHAIRS HEARING ON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUDGET     May 24  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   Chairman of the Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Subcommittee  today heard testimony from U S  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller  The hearing included an overview of the FY 2006 budget for the Department of Justice  Senator Shelby s opening statement  as prepared  is included here    Good Morning   I want to welcome Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation  Robert Mueller   Thank you both for appearing before the Committee this morning   This is your first appearance before the newly created Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies   Previously  in my capacity as the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  we had the opportunity to work together  and I hope to continue that relationship       I want to thank the Full Committee Chairman  Senator Cochran for being here today and express my appreciation for his leadership and guidance moving this Committee forward        I look forward to hearing from each of you about your vision of the Justice Department and the FBI  respectively  and the challenges each of you see in the coming fiscal year    In particular  I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at the Justice Department and all they do to keep America safe         Based on my review of your budget request and the constraints of the subcommittee  I believe it will take your leadership to make the tough choices regarding the allocation of resources given the budget constraints we are facing         The fiscal year 2006 budget request for the Department of Justice is  20 3 billion and represents an increase of one percent over the FY 2005 enacted funding level   While the budget proposes increases for the FBI  the United States Attorneys  the United States Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives  this budget proposes severe cuts to other important programs   In particular  it proposes to cut  1 4 billion to State and local law enforcement programs  it rescinds  314 million in funds for the construction of new prisons  and proposes  123 million in new fees to fund base operations for critical law enforcement activities   This budget also proposes to rescind  1 3 billion held in trust for victims of crime to offset costs elsewhere  With that proposed offset  the Justice Department s request is actually  19 1 billion and represents a five percent decrease from the fiscal year 2005 level   Quite honestly  I find these cuts to be unacceptable and irresponsible   particularly as they relate to the rescission of important funds and the proposal of new fees                                                                       I want to be supportive of this request but these reductions and budget maneuvers concern me   For example  the budget proposes to increase a fee on the explosives industry to generate revenue of  120 million in offsetting collections in FY 2006   I want to point out that even if Congress passed this proposal today  I am told it would take the Department two years to even begin collecting the fee   If that is true  I do not understand how the Department of Justice proposes to use the receipts from this fee to offset fiscal year 2006 law enforcement operations   This  120 million hole is just one example of many contained in this request   These shortfalls will force the Committee to make some extremely difficult choices         Another offset that concerns me is the proposal to rescind funding previously provided by this Committee for new prison construction   This just doesn t add up   Not only are we facing significant overcrowding at federal prison facilities  but you are projecting the addition of approximately 8 000 new prisoners each year to those already crowded facilities   Yet  the budget proposes to rescind  314 million for funding already provided to build two medium security facilities   Without construction and activation of these two facilities  projected medium security crowding  which is already fifty percent over capacity  will be ten percent higher by FY 2009         As for increases  Mr  Attorney General  your budget request proposes that  2 7 billion be spent on information technology  IT    While I am a big proponent of technology  I also expect there to be some direct oversight by you of the disparate systems being developed by the Department and its bureaus   The fact that the Department s CIO has control of less than ten percent of the IT resources and the employees who build  run  and maintain these systems explains why there is no universal plan for systems development in the Department   Given the current budgetary constraints  there are not sufficient resources to continue building these stovepipe systems that fail to deliver the results promised to the taxpayers and the users         I am especially interested in hearing what specific oversight the Department is conducting with respect to the FBI s Virtual Case File  VCF    I was extremely disappointed to learn of VCF s failure  and the significant loss of funds associated with it   While I wholeheartedly support bringing the FBI into the twenty first century and realize the importance of information technology to the FBI s mission  I cannot support unlimited and unchecked resources and will not tolerate broken promises for results that are never realized or delivered   I believe  given one failed attempt  it is imperative that you proceed with caution to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes twice  I expect results  and I will do everything I can to ensure that there is Congressional oversight for this program  however  someone must be accountable for the success or failure of VCF and all of the Department s programs       There are many other issues that I anticipate discussing during this hearing including the FBI s use of resources on priority missions  the relationship of the FBI Director and the new Director of National Intelligence and the funding implications of that relationship  and the critical human resource issues the FBI is now confronting       Mr  Attorney General and Mr  Director  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the Justice Department s budget request  and I look forward to working with you on these and other important issues facing our Nation  Shelby concluded           30                                                         May 2005 News Releases                      Year            County
