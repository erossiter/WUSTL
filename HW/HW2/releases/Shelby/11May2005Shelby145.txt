      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY CHAIRS HEARING ON NASA BUDGET    May 12  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   Chairman of the Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Subcommittee  today heard testimony from National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA  Administrator Michael Griffin   The hearing included an overview of the FY 2006 budget for NASA   Senator Shelbys opening statement  as prepared  is included here     This hearing of the Senate Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Subcommittee will come to order   I want to welcome the new NASA Administrator  Dr  Michael Griffin  who is joining us to discuss the President s fiscal year 2006 budget request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Dr  Griffin  in assuming your new post as the NASA Administrator  I can only imagine how busy the past few weeks have been   Now that you have had some time to reacquaint yourself with NASA s activities  I look forward to discussing your thoughts about how NASA is doing  and hearing your insights as to what they could be doing better   I also anticipate that we will have an ongoing and open dialogue about NASA s progress with return to flight and achieving the President s vision for space exploration   I am very interested in discussing how we can preserve the expertise within the activities and institutions that will be necessary to take this ambitious journey     More than a year ago the President presented a vision for space exploration that calls for a return to the Moon and eventually a manned mission to another planet   I am excited by the opportunities that lay ahead with the exploration vision at NASA     However  there are fiscal realities that  like it or not  may affect the vision   That is what we deal with on our Committee  and I believe it is one of the difficulties you will face as the NASA administrator  having to balance NASA s limited resources with its programs and requirements     I believe that we all appreciate the inherent risks involved with many of the activities NASA undertakes   We also appreciate that with risk comes the potential for failure   Inevitably  failures increase the overall costs of the activity  and one of the problems that I anticipate along the path to the Moon is the potential for failures that could pose a significant challenge to the forward momentum of the program and the vision     We have already experienced such a challenge with NASA s return to flight requirements   Specifically  we have seen a strain on science missions and aeronautics as NASA has redirected funds to pay for return to flight cost overruns     These funding shifts have caused programs and facilities projects to be deferred  created uncertainty regarding the fate of the Hubble telescope  and resulted in aeronautics spending being flat     Dr  Griffin  I believe you have the knowledge  the background and the ability to guide NASA   But I also believe that you must begin your journey on a firm foundation   Getting back to the Moon will take more than just plans for a rocket  it will also take a sound financial structure and capable management in order to balance all of the important activities that NASA undertakes to make this exploration vision a reality     I believe there are several looming issues that must be addressed if NASA is to maintain the forward momentum of its exploration goals   The first  as I alluded to before  is the shuttle fleet and how that impacts any future Crew Exploration Vehicle  CEV    NASA has been working diligently to complete the necessary changes to the shuttle that will provide additional safety for our astronauts and the vehicle itself  however  the shuttle is targeted to be decommissioned by 2010   The next U S  manned space vehicle  the Crew Exploration Vehicle  is not currently scheduled for a manned flight until 2014   I am concerned by such a gap in U S  manned space flight and  more importantly  I am concerned that the time schedule for the current 25 or more shuttle flights prior to the 2010 retirement is too optimistic     Any deviation in these schedules  particularly as they relate to funding  could cause this gap to widen even further than is currently anticipated     Dr  Griffin  I understand that you have your own ideas as to how the gap between the shuttle retirement and the CEV could be closed   I am interested in hearing how you believe this is possible given the tight funding environment     The second challenge  the completion of the International Space Station  is directly linked to the first   The construction of the station is dependent on the shuttle for critical supplies and parts that cannot be delivered by any other vehicle     Our international partners have done an admirable job filling in while the shuttle is undergoing repair  but there is an expectation that the shuttle will return as it is essential to complete the Space Station     The United States has a commitment to our international partners to complete the Station   I believe that we must maintain that commitment  and I am interested in learning of your thoughts  Dr  Griffin  about NASA s plans for completing the International Space Station and further  how that will impact our ability to work cooperatively with other countries in the future on the vision     Finally  Dr  Griffin  I believe NASA faces a significant challenge in building the technical workforce necessary to carry us into the future   NASA is one of the most publicly recognized agencies within the federal government   We all know about something happening at NASA  whether it is stunning pictures of the universe from the Hubble Space Telescope  photos from Mars  or even the Astronauts living on the Space Station   Such high visibility and name recognition can be a powerful tool in inspiring and recruiting future scientists and engineers     The success of NASA programs in science and exploration students see today  is the inspiration necessary to attract the young people of this Nation to these careers     Dr  Griffin  do not forget that the missions of tomorrow will not be possible if there are no scientists and engineers being developed today   This is a serious issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that future exploration in space can occur     In closing  I want to thank you again for being here today   It is my hope that this will be the beginning of a productive relationship between NASA and this newly constituted subcommittee     I believe there are many challenges ahead and I look forward to working with you to meet those head on     I will now turn to my colleague  our Ranking Member Senator Mikulski  for her comments        30
