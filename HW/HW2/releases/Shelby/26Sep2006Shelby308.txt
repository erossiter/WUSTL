      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     CONFERENCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF DEFENSE FUNDING FOR NORTH ALABAMA    September 26  2006  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced conference committee approval of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  The legislation includes a number of projects for North Alabama  The bill will soon be voted on in the House  The Senate will consider the bill following House approval  after which it will be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  The funding approved by the conference committee will support important defense related programs in order to strengthen our national security  said Senator Shelby  These programs are critical to the stability of our nations military infrastructure and readiness  and todays approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens and the strength of our military  In total  this bill provides  436 6 billion for defense related needs  including  70 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror  GWOT   MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY  MDA      9 371 billion  The recent missile tests in North Korea were an all too loud reminder that missile defense is one of the most important operations our military provides  said Senator Shelby  Although North Koreas test was unsuccessful  it underscores the necessity for a robust missile defense program  The following projects are part of the  9 371 billion included for the MDA  GROUND BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE  GMD      3 055 billion  Ground based Midcourse Defense  GMD  is the first line of defense deployed to defend our homeland against ballistic missile attacks by rogue nations or terrorist organizations  said Senator Shelby  There are many other countries out there who wish to do us harm and GMD is an effective way to stop them   The bill provides an additional  200 million for test infrastructure  operations support  and additional interceptors for GMD  KINETIC ENERGY INTERCEPTOR  KEI      357 508 million  The Kinetic Energy Interceptor is a vital component of the Ballistic Missile Defense System  which must be strong during this time of war  said Senator Shelby  While the program was reduced by  48 million  I am confident KEI will continue development on schedule with a boost flight test still planned for 2008  MULTIPLE KILL VEHICLE  MKV      144 975 million  The MKV enhances the Ground based Midcourse Defense system by providing as many opportunities as possible to destroy an incoming missile through the use of several kill vehicles launched from one booster  said Senator Shelby  While we have not needed it yet  our strong missile defense system is one of our militarys most important functions in keeping the homeland secure   JOINT COMMON MISSILE  JCM      30 million Designed as a next generation  multipurpose replacement for the Hellfire  Longbow  and Maverick air to ground missiles currently used by the Army  Navy  and Marine Corps  the Joint Common Missile  JCM  was slated for termination by the Department of Defense in Presidential Budget Decision 753  issued in December 2004  Senator Shelby was a leader in working to restore funding for the JCM in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to ensure that the program remains viable  The Joint Common Missile is a critical program for keeping technological superiority in our missile arsenal  said Senator Shelby  The JCMs termination was ill conceived because it ignored the opinions of our top military leaders and would deprive our servicemembers of a new capability that cannot currently be replicated  Restoring funding for this vital program is essential because it will bolster our warfighting potential and provide our servicemen and women with a new capability to ward off the unconventional threats of the 21st century  There are over 150 jobs associated with the program including manufacturing  government program management  and subcontractors throughout Alabama  and overtime will bring approximately  280 000 000 to the Troy area in the way of salary  wages  and other costs  PATRIOT PAC 3     489 067 million The PAC 3 procurement program was fully funded  allowing the military to procure 108 Patriot Advance Capability  PAC 3  missiles  said Senator Shelby  This system will provide a critical force protection element on the battlefield  EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE  EELV      856 49 million  The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle is built at Boeings facility in Decatur and serves as the Air Forces space lift modernization program  said Senator Shelby  EELV improves our nations access to space by making space launch vehicles more affordable and reliable  and keeps many of Alabamas workers on the job   LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER  LUH      167 177 million The primary mission for the Light Utility Helicopter  LUH  is to provide aerial transport for logistical and administrative support  said Senator Shelby  The LUH is intended to replace Vietnam era UH 1H Huey and OH 58D Kiowa Warrior  Our bill includes  167 177 million for the procurement of LUH  which is managed at Redstone Arsenal   ARMED RECONNAISSANCE HELICOPTER  ARH      101 818 million The Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter  ARH   which is managed at Redstone Arsenal  provides the military with a highly deployable  reconnaissance and security capability to replace the aging OH 58D Kiowa Warrior fleet  said Senator Shelby   The bill includes funding for the procurement of 12 helicopters  FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEM  FCS      3 4 billion Future Combat Systems  FCS   the core building block of the U S  Armys Future Force  is a joint networked combat and combat support system that provides our soldiers with greater situational awareness so they can see first  understand first  and act first  said Senator Shelby  FCS is integral to equipping the warfighter with the most technologically advanced weapons system  In addition  this bill includes  324 23 million for the Non Line of Sight Launch System  NLOS LS  and  112 237 million for the Non Line of Sight Cannon  NLOS C  which are vital components to the Future Combat System  UNMANNED SYSTEMS INITIATIVE     1 65 million  The Unmanned Systems Initiative at the Aviation and Missile Research  Development and Engineering Center  AMRDEC  will conduct research and development of unmanned systems to advance  evaluate  and rapidly mature technologies to meet urgent warfighter needs as well as the optimal tactics  techniques  and procedures to employ unmanned systems capabilities  said Senator Shelby  Unmanned systems have immense potential to reduce engagement timelines while improving survivability in difficult urban terrain  Acceleration of the transition and fielding of these robotic technologies and capabilities is a critical wartime effort  UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES  UAVs  The DoD Appropriations bill included  for a second year  language that prohibits the transfer of research  development  acquisition  or program authority relating to tactical UAVs from the Army  said Senator Shelby  The language ensures that the Army will retain responsibility for and operational control of the Extended Range Multi Purpose  ERMP  UAV  UAVs provide support for tactical ground combat operations for the Army  and it is important that the Army maintain control of tactical UAVs because they are vital for ground combatants   UAV research and development is conducted at Redstone Arsenal  and the Army UAV Center of Excellence is located at Ft  Rucker                                                          September 2006 News Releases                      Year            County
