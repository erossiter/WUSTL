      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     Senator Shelby Comments on the State of the Union    January 24  2007  Washington  D C      U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  made the following comments in response to President Bush s State of the Union address  Tonight President Bush spoke to the American people in his seventh State of the Union address  The President provided an accounting of the nation as well as an outline of his domestic and foreign policy agenda for the coming year  The President s agenda is ambitious  It is greeted by a very different Congress than in past years  While I anticipate an uphill climb for the President s proposals  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the administration to develop and debate the best policies for our nation  Americans across the country continue to express their skepticism about the war in Iraq  Like me  they want to know why we are there  if we re going to win and most importantly  when our troops are coming home  Just over a week ago  the President addressed the nation about the ongoing violence in Iraq  He outlined his proposal to increase the number of troops in Iraq and he touched on that topic again tonight  I continue to believe that we must support our troops regardless of the circumstances  It is essential that they have the best equipment  supplies  and leadership necessary to get the job done  However  I have expressed my reservations about the Presidents plan and will continue to question the President and our military leaders to make certain that we do everything we can to ensure that the Iraqi people take responsibility for their government and their country so that our men and women in uniform can return home  Once again  the President used his State of the Union address to advocate his immigration proposal  However  what the President discussed tonight is no different from what he has proposed in previous Congresses  Yet again  the President s proposal offers amnesty to illegal immigrants and I will not support any legislation that turns a blind eye and rewards illegal immigrants for breaking the law  Amnesty will only serve to embolden those seeking to break our laws and come to the United States illegally in the future  The American people deserve better  The President s touched on many other worthy ideals in his speech tonight and I plan to fully examine the details of his proposals as they are presented to Congress  It is my hope that the Congress can work in a bipartisan fashion to improve the state of this union                                                          January 2007 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                Current record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
