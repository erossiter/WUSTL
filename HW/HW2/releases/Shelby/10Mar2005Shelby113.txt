      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY STATEMENT ON BRAC COMMISSION NOMINEES    March 15  2005   WASHINGTON  DC  President George W  Bush today submitted to the Senate the names of nine nominees who will serve on the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission for 2005   Senator Shelby made the following statement about the BRAC Commission    I strongly believe that Alabamas military installations are well positioned going into the 2005 BRAC process   Each of Alabamas bases provide critical support and military value to our national defense and the mission of our armed forces   I am confident that the BRAC Commission will see the value and purpose of our installations    I am pleased that former Veterans Administration Secretary Anthony Principi has been nominated to head the BRAC Commission   Secretary Principi faces a tremendous challenge  but I am confident that with his depth of knowledge he is up to this task     I am  however  disappointed that General Coburn will not serve as a member of the BRAC Commission   His vast military expertise and knowledge would have contributed greatly to the process   I have been assured that General Kicklighter will serve only as a placeholder until a new nominee can be found   I am hopeful  that as the confirmation process continues  a replacement will be found who will embody General Coburns immense understanding of our military posture and mission readiness needs     Now  more than ever  our Nations military bases play a critical role in our national security  and I am hopeful that the BRAC Commission will measure each installation on their merits        30                                                          March 2005 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Current record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
