COMMERCE SECRETARY RESPONDS TO LETTER FROM SENATORS     September 9  2005   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL  expressed concerns to U S  Department of Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez regarding the effects of Hurricane Katrina on commercial fishermen  shrimpers and oystermen in the Gulf of Mexico   In a letter to Secretary Gutierrez yesterday  Senator Shelby and fifteen other Senators asked the Commerce Department to declare a commercial fisheries failure and begin the process of delivering financial assistance to the impacted Gulf Coast commercial fishing industry       Senator Shelby was pleased that Secretary Gutierrez responded to their letter by announcing today that he has made a determination that a commercial fishery failure and a fishery resource disaster within the meanings of Section 312 a  of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Section 308 b  of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act have begun in the Gulf of Mexicos commercial fisheries   This declaration is for the commercial fisheries off the Florida Keys and the north central Gulf of Mexico  including Florida  Alabama  Mississippi  and Louisiana              Senator Shelby said  I am pleased that Secretary Gutierrez made this declaration that will enable fisheries to have access to timely relief in this difficult and uncertain time   It will take months  if not years  to overcome the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina on our coastal communities and our state  but I am hopeful that todays announcement will help us begin to restore the Gulf States fishing and processing infrastructure            Senator Shelby s letter to Secretary Gutierrez is attached          30      Secretary Carlos M  Gutierrez  U S  Department of Commerce  14th and Constitution Avenue NW  Washington  DC  20230     Dear Mr  Secretary          As our nation struggles to come to grips with the economic and environmental impacts of Hurricane Katrina  we must not overlook the devastating effects that this natural disaster is having on commercial fishermen  shrimpers  and oystermen in the Gulf of Mexico   We ask you to declare a commercial fishery failure for these fisheries  as authorized under Section 312 a  of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Section 308 b  of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act in cases of natural disaster  so that forthcoming federal assistance can be made available to affected states          We understand that the Department of Commerce is still in the early stages of assessing the damage done to fish stocks  coastal and marine ecosystems  fishing vessels  and port infrastructure  therefore  the full range of economic and environmental impacts is unknown at this time   Nevertheless  we have ample evidence that many commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico  which supplies 30 percent of the nations seafood and produced landings worth  686 million in 2003  have been destroyed   Countless fishing vessels and shoreside facilities have been leveled or damaged beyond repair  just as fishermen approach what would have been the height of the season   At the same time  millions of acres of marshes  wetlands  and estuary habitats that are essential for commercially valuable stocks has disappeared  and what remains of these areas is covered by toxic sludge and other devastating pollutants               Clearly  our Gulf of Mexico fisheries face a troubling and highly uncertain future  with some reports indicating that it may take 18 months or more to restore parts of this industry   The commercial fishermen  shrimpers  and oystermen cannot wait this long to begin receiving some form of federal financial assistance   Declaring a commercial fisheries failure will begin the process of delivering financial assistance to the impacted Gulf Coast commercial fishing industry         Thank you for considering our request       Senator Richard Shelby  Senator Jeff Sessions
