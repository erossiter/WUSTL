legislation reflects our commitment to protecting the waterways and energy resources in our state and throughout the country  Tuscaloosa Army Corps of Engineers Office Relocation    5 Million The Corps office in Tuscaloosa is overcrowded and does not meet current safety standards  This funding will allow the Corps to move the maintenance facility to an industrial area of Tuscaloosa where more space is available   The Corps facilities in Tuscaloosa are inadequate  inefficient  out dated and fail to meet environmental and safety standards  said Shelby  This new facility will allow the employees and public to have a facility that meets workplace and environmental standards  while highlighting the value of Alabamas thriving waterways by keeping the Corps presence along the river  Mobile Harbor Turning Basin    2 Million The Alabama Port Authority will make improvements to the navigation system at the Mobile Harbor  including the construction of a turning basin and widening a section of the Mobile Harbor project   The Port of Mobile is vital to the economy of the state of Alabama and the Gulf Coast region  said Shelby  Alabamas waterways are an integral component of our national inland waterway transportation system and an economic necessity for businesses that depend on the waterways infrastructure to transport their goods  Improvements to the Port will spur international trade and economic opportunities in the region  Integrated Distribution Management System  IDMS     2 Million The IDMS is projected to save customers between  12 million to  96 million annually due to power loss reductions   The IDMS will integrate information systems that operate an electric distribution system  providing a significant increase in reliability  said Shelby  In addition  the system will reduce power losses inherent in the system  This funding is important given the ongoing efforts to ensure reliability across the power grid   Auburn University Alternative Fuel Source Study of Cement Kilns    1 5 Million During this phase of research  the Auburn and LaFarge North America team of researchers will consider alternative fuel sources that are regionally available  energy intensive  appropriate for cement kilns and supportive of national energy policy   Auburn Universitys laboratories will continue to work in coordination with LaFarge North America to study the conversion of alternate fuel sources for cement production  said Shelby  It is critical that our scientists work to decrease the nations dependence on foreign fuel sources  This project is a perfect example of the private sector working with a public university to drive innovation in the industry  Delta Regional Authority  DRA     12 Million The Delta Regional Authority is a federal and state partnership that serves 240 counties in eight states  including 20 of Alabamas most impoverished counties   The Delta Regional Authority provides transportation and infrastructure funding  as

funding will allow the DRA to continue its efforts to spur economic development throughout these underserved areas of Alabama  Appalachian Regional Commission  ARC     75 Million Thirty seven Alabama
