   155 Million The Bureau of Prisons is provided with  405 million for prison construction  Aliceville is the next federal installation to be completed on the Federal Bureau of Prisons list of prioritized sites  The  405 million is more than enough to ensure that Aliceville will receive the final  155 million necessary for completion   This prison will be an economic engine for all of West Alabama  bringing numerous jobs and significant economic development to the area  said Shelby  The prison will provide steady and good paying jobs for the surrounding area   Near Space Engineering

science missions  The University of Alabama will continue the N SERT program to ultimately enable the widespread development of near space platforms and technology for NASA  Near space platforms have applications ranging from remote sensing to planetary exploration to homeland security  The infrastructure and expertise developed by the N SERT program will enhance the University of Alabamas ability to support future near space missions at NASA  West Alabama Marine Shrimp and Fish Aquaculture    235 000 This project will help develop methods and find efficiencies in the development of marine shrimp and fish aquaculture using ponds and the salinic water found throughout West Alabama  Auburn University has proven itself time and again as an institution on the forefront of groundbreaking research that leads to economic development in Alabama  said Shelby  Auburn University will use this funding to continue its efforts to develop an inland shrimp and saltwater fish industry in the Black Belt  These funds will be used to assist farmers with the necessary information to grow and market shrimp and other fish by profitably using existing water sources in the Black Belt   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program  JAG  provides funding for law enforcement to implement programs that prevent and control

maps available when developing evacuation plans  traffic patterns or community development  Alabama Drought Research Study    752 000 This study is developing methods for industry  agriculture  municipalities and other users of surface water to store and access Alabamas water resources for the best economic benefit   While Alabama has been blessed with an abundance of water resources  we have all seen during this summers drought that those resources are not unlimited or constant  said Shelby  Many of Alabamas research universities  led by researchers at UAH and Auburn  are studying a variety of methods and plans that will allow government  industry and farmers the ability to capture and retain water resources when they are abundant to insulate the state from the impacts of catastrophic drought  Considering our current severe drought status  I cannot think of a more appropriate project   Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center PREPARE Program    470 000 The Planned Response Emergency Portal and Accessible Response Environment  PREPARE  program will work to establish  develop and operate a center and system for the interstate and intrastate accumulation  storage  retrieval  analysis and dissemination of vital information relating to crimes  criminals and criminal activity for the justice community   The integrated technology the PREPARE program provides will

may be considering joining a gang or participating in drug trafficking   Alabama District Attorneys Association Computer Forensics Laboratory    752 000 The Alabama District Attorneys Association has developed three regional computer forensics laboratories to investigate and prosecute all forms of computer crimes such as child pornography and solicitation  white collar crime and identity theft  The labs are also used to search for evidence in many other cases  to educate officers in the preservation of digital evidence and to educate the public on internet safety  As technology expands  unfortunately  so do opportunities for criminals  said Shelby  Thousands of crimes are committed over the internet each day  As such  our law enforcement community must have the needed technology to track down and prosecute offenders  Alabama Department of Corrections Electronic Training and Security Tools    376 000 The Electronic Training and Security Tools  ETAST  project will continue an effort to develop interactive computer based training for the Alabama Department of Corrections to satisfy requirements for new and recurring training  The project will also convert paper architecture drawings into electronic images for the development of three dimensional situational awareness and training for crisis response teams  ETAST will enable the Department of Corrections to provide training more efficiently and effectively  said Shelby  This project also will help increase the safety of both officers and inmates at Alabamas prisons  Play by the Rules  Laws for Youth    94 000 Play by the Rules has provided students in Alabama with a better understanding of the laws that govern society  Phase II of the program will be an effort to expand the program to other states  Research shows that law related education can have a direct impact on a youths decisions to commit a crime when put in at risk situations  said Shelby  I hope that Play by the Rules can have the same impact across the country as it has had here in Alabama  The following nationwide projects and programs are slated to receive funds in the Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008  Child Sexual Predator Elimination Grant Program    15 608 Million The Child Sexual Predator Elimination Grant Program is a new national initiative that will
