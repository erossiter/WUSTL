   Center for Domestic Preparedness    57 Million  Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the conferees agreed that the Center for Domestic Preparedness  CDP  at Ft  McClellan is the cornerstone of our nation s emergency responder training facilities  The  57 million included in the conference report will allow CDP to increase its training capacity for first responders so that we may respond to terrorist attacks quickly and effectively   These first responders include law enforcement personnel  firefighters  and emergency medical personnel who are trained by CDP to prevent and respond to incidents of domestic terrorism    In fiscal year 2004  CDP trained over 50 000 first responders  and is expected to train 60 000 more by the end of fiscal year 2005   In addition to training our nations local first responders  CDP works closely with a number of federal agencies including the Department of Agriculture  USDA   Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   and others to develop new integrated counter terrorism training programs    Since the September 11  2001 attacks on our country  the importance of first responders has become evident   Ft  McClellan s Center for Domestic Preparedness provides the necessary training for professionals to rapidly respond and react to terrorist attacks  Shelby concluded     14 Mile CSX Railroad Bridge

Replacement of the bridge will ensure safe marine navigation on the Mobile River  which is critical to maintaining the efficiency and reliability of waterways commerce through the Port of Mobile and along the Black Warrior Tombigbee waterway system    The replacement of the bridge will save shippers millions of dollars annually in lost time and accidents  and will greatly assist in the shipment
