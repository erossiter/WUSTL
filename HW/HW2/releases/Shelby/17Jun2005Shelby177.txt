COMMERCE  JUSTICE  SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL CONSIDERED BY SUBCOMMITTEE   Opening Statement of Chairman Richard Shelby                                                                                                                                                                                                                     June 21  2005   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R Ala    Chairman of the Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee  CJS   today held a meeting of the subcommittee to markup the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce  Justice  and Science Appropriations Bill   The following is Chairman Shelbys opening statement  as prepared    The Subcommittee will please come to order   I will begin by outlining the recommendation that is before you   I will then yield to Senator Mikulski for her opening statement and for the usual motion   Then I will yield to the Members for opening statements   When those opening statements are completed  I will recognize Members for the purpose of offering amendments  should they choose to do so       I would like to again thank Members for coming  I would also like to thank Senator Cochran  our full committee Chairman  for his leadership throughout our preparations   I would like to thank Senator Mikulski  our Ranking Member   Senator Mikulski and I have worked together on science and commerce issues for many years   I believe that we have worked together this year to craft a bill that is balanced  responsible  and forward looking  under intense time and budget constraints       This is the first markup of the newly constituted Commerce  Justice  Science and Related Agencies appropriations bill   I believe this bill is one of the more complex of the twelve appropriations bills  and like many of the other bills has many unique challenges   This new subcommittee has jurisdiction over two Cabinet agencies  the Departments of Justice and Commerce  as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  the National Science Foundation  and a number of independent agencies  such as the Securities and Exchange Commission  the Federal Trade Commission  the Federal Communications Commission  and the Small Business Administration   The major areas of jurisdiction are counterterrorism  Federal  State  and local law enforcement  our Nation s economy  scientific research  our nation s space program  and regulation of the banking and telecommunications sectors         This diversity makes the Commerce  Justice  Science bill a challenge to move through the appropriations process   And  in a year when domestic discretionary dollars are scarce  we must    and I believe we have    work together to find ways to ensure that the priorities of our Nation and our States are met while remaining within our allocation   I believe that the bill before you today accomplishes this goal   I want to quickly highlight some important provisions that are included in the bill before you today        The Subcommittee mark is  885 million above the fiscal year 2005 level  which is a two percent increase   In reviewing the Subcommittee mark  the numbers appear to suggest that we are well below the budget request   However  it is important to note that the bill does not include the proposed Strengthening America s Communities Initiative   While the President s budget request for the Department of Commerce included  3 7 billion to implement this initiative  it was not assumed as part of the Subcommittee s 302 b  allocation and therefore not included in the bill       I believe it is also important to note that the Subcommittee has provided funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA   under a separate Science Title  along with the National Science Foundation  NSF  and National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA         Let me provide a short description of the Subcommittee recommendation for each of the major agencies funded under this bill       The Subcommittee recommendation includes an increase of over  1 billion above the budget request for the Department of Justice   The bulk of this increase is due to the restoration of the proposed cuts to State and local law enforcement grant programs such as the Byrne Grants  funded at  177 million  COPS Tech  funded at  137 million  Meth Hot Spots  funded at  60 million  and many others        For other Justice programs  the recommendation includes funding to support current services and provides requested increases for critical counterterrorism and law enforcement programs   For the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   the recommendation includes funding increases to strengthen and leverage the FBI s existing workforce  such as increases for training  secure computer networks  intelligence analysis software  and infrastructure enhancements       We have included nearly  7 2 billion for the Department of Commerce  including NOAA and the National       Institute for Standards and Technology  NIST   which is an 8 percent increase over last year s funding level   I do want to point out that many programs within the Department of Commerce were proposed for termination in the President s fiscal year 2006 budget   Most of these terminations were premised upon the notion that they are no longer needed   I    and many of my colleagues    strongly disagree   To that end  we have restored funding to the Economic Development Administration by including  315 million   We have also restored  22 million in funding to the Public Telecommunications Facilities  Planning and Construction grants and  15 million to restore the Technology Opportunities Program       In the Science Title of the bill  the Subcommittee recommendation restores the eight percent reduction from last year s enacted level that was proposed for NOAA   We are disappointed that NOAA s budget has again been targeted for severe reductions   I strongly believe  as do many of you  that NOAA s budget should move in the opposite direction  and we have done that in this bill   The recent Ocean Commission report concluded  essentially  that we are not doing nearly enough towards the study our Oceans   Implementation of the recommendations of the Ocean Commission Report is among the Subcommittee s top priorities  the recommendation includes  660 million for Ocean Commission initiatives       This bill provides funding for NASA to move forward with the exploration vision  while fully funding the ongoing activities of the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station   In order to accomplish the vision the President has proposed  we must fulfill our commitments to these programs and maintain our investments in research to ensure our journey back to the Moon is successful   This bill fully funds Constellation Systems  which will allow NASA the ability to move forward with the Crew Exploration Vehicle  the Nation s next manned vehicle that will take us to the Moon and beyond   Finally  we have provided NASA with funds to prepare a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope so that it can continue to provide us with valuable knowledge about the universe we live in         The fiscal year 2006 Subcommittee recommendation includes funding for a number of independent agencies that fall within the Subcommittees purview  including full funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC    The SEC is currently in the process of ramping up its enforcement capabilities to address and prevent corporate scandals   Full funding is also provided for the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  which is tasked with overseeing spectrum allocation   a booming business these days   Finally  the recommendation does not accept the proposed elimination of several Small Business Administration programs  including  7 j  technical assistance  Microloan Technical Assistance and Microloan Direct  HUBZones  Native American Outreach  and PRIME        In such an austere budget environment  difficult decisions must be made   I believe we have listened to our colleagues on the Committee and in the wider body to try to address their diverse concerns   And while we were able to accommodate many of our colleagues  requests  we were obviously not able to do everything everyone has requested   In this vein  if any of our colleagues have concerns  Senator Mikulski and I will be glad to work with you as the process moves forward to try to address these concerns   I will ask  however  that you reserve amendments for the floor       Above all  we have endeavored to produce a bill that is bipartisan  reflective of this Committee s priorities as well as those of the entire Senate   We will rely on our colleagues to help us move this bill through full Committee  past the floor  and ultimately through conference   I urge my colleagues to support this bill       I yield to Senator Mikulski  my esteemed Ranking Member  for her statement  Shelby concluded          30                                                          June 2005 News Releases                      Year            County
