   3 1 billion This bill provides  3 1 billion for BRAC  of which  9 4 million will be used for construction of the Recruiting Brigade Operations Building at Redstone Arsenal in FY07  These funds restore the money cut in the FY07 Joint Resolution and will allow the BRAC timeline to remain on schedule  allowing the Department of Defense to rotate forces  train our warfighters  and maintain the overall readiness of our armed forces  Including the  3 1 billion cut in the FY07 Joint Resolution was vital to keeping the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations on schedule  said Senator Shelby  Fully funding the BRAC budget request for 2007 was one of my highest priorities  as it is critical to military readiness and quality of life and to the Department of Defenses transformation efforts   Agriculture Disaster Assistance    4 15 billion  Alabamas agriculture industry has been plighted by severe weather conditions in past years  This funding will allow the Department of Agriculture to address the needs of farmers that were not met through the normal recovery programs   I have always and will continue to work to protect and preserve Alabamas family farms  said Senator Shelby  Farms are the workhorse of Alabamas rural economy and it is important that we help Alabamas farmers recover from devastating droughts and hurricanes from previous crop years   NOAA Direct Assistance to Gulf Coast Fishermen    85 million The Gulf of Mexico is home to a significant share of the U S  fishing industry  accounting for almost 20 percent of all commercial landings  In addition  the recreational fishing industry contributes billions of dollars to the economy of the Gulf Coast each year  Of the  85 million   20 million will be available to assist Alabamas fishermen   Many shore based facilities that support the Gulf fishing industry were damaged or destroyed as a result of the hurricanes  said Senator Shelby  Alabama lost over  138 million in marine dockside revenue as a result of hurricane devastation  This funding will help provide much needed assistance to Alabamas fishermen as they continue to recover   FBI Hazardous Devices School at Redstone Arsenal    8 1 million The FBI proposal totals  348 million  of which  8 1 million is for the Hazardous Devices School  HDS  at Redstone Arsenal   The FBI Hazardous Devices School will be used to train federal  state  and local bomb technicians  to acquire electronic counter measure training skills  and to equip the HDSs new secure training facility  said Senator Shelby  As we continue to fight the Global War on Terror  it is critical that state and local bomb technicians and our FBI agents have the knowledge and training necessary to protect our communities from ever evolving threats   State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance    70 million This bill includes  70 million for the Edward Byrne Grant Program  Of these funds  Alabama will receive  7 5 million to assist state and local law enforcement for the increased costs incurred from hurricanes and tornados that have devastated areas of Alabama   Byrne grants are essential to local law enforcement efforts because they provide funding directly to our crime fighters  said Senator Shelby  I firmly believe that those individuals serving on the front lines of our communities know best what they need to successfully do their jobs  We must do all we can to support local law enforcement as they help keep Alabama safe  NOAA Gulf Coast Disaster Response Center    6 million This funding will allow NOAA to begin developing a center that can effectively respond to weather and marine disasters  It will serve as a focal point for innovative severe storm research  The tornadoes that devastated Coffee and Wilcox counties coupled with the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005  are further proof of the need for a facility like this  The response center will also help to provide a coordinated response when disasters occur   In recent years  NOAA has greatly improved the timeliness of severe weather warnings  but we still must do more to be prepare our citizens for natural disasters  said Senator Shelby  It requires better education  better planning  and better infrastructure  The Gulf Coast Disaster Response Center will give NOAA the capability to mobilize its emergency response after disasters and more effectively help communities in need   Alabama Coosa River System Dredging Project    3 million The Alabama Coosa river system was seriously damaged when Hurricane Dennis wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast  The state of the river system has significantly strained existing industry that relies on the river  As an example  the silting and shoaling as a result of Dennis is increasing the transportation costs of a single industry on the river by  100 000 each month  The Army Corps of Engineers will use this funding to begin dredging the system to alleviate the problems that have plagued barge traffic over the past several years   The Alabama Coosa River runs through an economically depressed area of the state in serious need of industry and good paying jobs  said Senator Shelby  If the Alabama Coosa can achieve full operational status  jobs and industry will follow  We must not forget the damage these counties have endured  The dredging will ensure that this vital waterway is restored to the people of Alabama                                                          March 2007 News Releases                      Year            County
