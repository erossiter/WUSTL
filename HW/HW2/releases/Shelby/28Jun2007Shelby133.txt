      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    Shelby Fights for Safety of Law Enforcement    June 28  2007  Washington  D C     The U S  Senate Appropriations Committee today approved an amendment sponsored by Senator Richard Shelby  R AL   ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science  that would ensure that gun trace data collected by the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco and Firearms is only used for legitimate law enforcement purposes related to a specific case or investigation   The amendment is similar to language that has been included in the CJS bill since 2003  However  it incorporates improvements requested by the President and law enforcement officials  The bill will now go to the Senate floor for consideration   Full text of Senator Shelbys remarks on the amendment as prepared are below   Mr  Chairman  at this time I would like to offer an amendment for consideration by the Full Committee   Chairwoman Mikulski and I have worked closely on this Subcommittee mark  and will continue to do so  However  we disagree on a critical issue  My amendment is about the legitimate use of firearms trace data by law enforcement officers  In the Subcommittee mark before you today  a critical restriction on the use of trace data has been removed and would expand the use of this information beyond the realm of a legitimate investigation   The amendment I am offering would re insert the limitations on the use of gun trace data that has been in this bill since Fiscal Year 2003  known as the Tiahrt amendment   This amendment is not precedent setting and is largely what has been law for the last four years  It does contain important changes  including making this provision permanent  and grandfathering in all previously disclosed trace data information  which I believe was the intent of Congress when this provision was originally adopted   A key component of the ATF s mission is the tracing of firearms on behalf of more than 18 000 Federal  State and local agencies    approximately 270 000 annually  The ATFs long standing policy has been to provide the data to law enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction over the specific case where the trace is relevant    not to politicians  lawyers and overzealous individuals who could misuse the information and put law enforcement officers in harms way   Last year  New York City officials used gun crime trace data to conduct a number of so called sting operations with private detectives in multiple states  unbeknownst to federal  state or local law enforcement agencies  These rogue operations jeopardized ongoing investigations and possibly interfered with other agencies work  The ATF had open investigations on a number of the same targets at the time and as a result  there was a negative impact on the criminal investigations   More investigations have not been jeopardized because this data has not been released  It should never be available to individuals that would endanger the lives of law enforcement officers and compromise on going investigations  Neither this amendment nor the ATF prevents the sharing of trace data with law enforcement officials conducting criminal investigations  There are no restrictions on the sharing of trace data with other jurisdictions once it is in the hands of state or local law enforcement officials  This amendment does protect ongoing police investigations and allows police to share information for any bona fide investigation    nothing more   Mr  Chairman  my amendment allows for information sharing as the language clearly states that it does not prevent the sharing or exchange of  trace  information among and between federal  state  tribal  local or foreign law enforcement agencies or federal  state  or local prosecutors  or national security  intelligence  or counterterrorism officials for use in bona fide criminal investigations or prosecutions   My proposal also deletes provisions previously contained in this bill  that limited disclosure of information that pertains to the geographic jurisdiction of the requesting agency  This step clearly clarifies that there is no intention to prevent interagency cooperation  It also states that the ATF data cannot be used in testimony or as exhibits in third party civil actions  If this is about fighting crime and not about suing the gun industry  then everyone should support this   I must submit to my colleagues that without this amendment  sensitive trace data will become available to criminals and result in Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requests  resulting in civil subpoenas for specific trace information that could require the contemporaneous release of trace data jeopardizing pending investigations and the safety of witnesses  informants and law enforcement personnel   Without this amendment  the names and personal information of thousands of innocent law abiding citizens who have not committed a crime could be publicly released  Politicians  criminals and even terrorists  could eventually have access to sensitive trace data and personal information   Why would we dare risk the safety and privacy of American citizens and the spilling the blood of our law enforcement officers   This amendment has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police  the National Rifle Association  the Southern States Police Benevolent Association  and the National Shooting Sports Foundation  among others   Having served as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee  I have a strong record of being critical of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies for not sharing enough information with state and local law enforcement agencies  There is a difference between the sharing of pertinent information and the reckless sharing of sensitive and personal information  Make no mistake about it  this amendment has nothing to do with catering to the gun industry and everything to do with protecting the safety and privacy of American citizens and law enforcement officers  Thank you Mr  Chairman  At the appropriate time  I will ask for a roll call vote on my amendment                                                          June 2007 News Releases
