SHELBY ANNOUNCES DEFENSE FUNDING FOR NORTH ALABAMA    July 18  2006   U  S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL   a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced subcommittee approval of important funding for North Alabama included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2007  Following todays action by the subcommittee  this bill will now go to full committee for consideration on Thursday   Senator Shelby said  The Senate approved funding for these important defense related programs that will help to strengthen our national security  These programs are critical to the stability of our nation s military infrastructure and readiness  and today s approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens  In total  this bill provides  453 5 billion for defense related needs  including  50 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror   MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY     9 371 billion  The recent missile tests from North Korea were an all too loud reminder that missile defense is one of the most important operations our military provides  said Senator Shelby  Although North Koreas test was unsuccessful  it underscores the necessity for a robust missile defense program   GROUND BASED MID COURSE DEFENSE  GMD      3 103 billion  Ground Based Mid Course Defense  GMD  is the first line of defense deployed to defend our homeland against ballistic missile attacks by rogue nations or terrorist organizations  said Senator Shelby  There are many other countries out there who wish to do us harm and GMD is a good way to stop them  The bill provides an additional  227 million for test infrastructure  operations support  and additional interceptors for GMD   KINETIC ENERGY INTERCEPTOR  KEI      205 508 million  The Kinetic Energy Interceptor is a vital component of the Ballistic Missile Defense System  which must be strong during this time of war  said Senator Shelby  I am disappointed that the committee reduced funding for KEI by  200 million  particularly in light of the missile threats from North Korea and Iran   MULTIPLE KILL VEHICLE  MKV      164 775 million  The MKV enhances the Ground Based Mid Course Defense system by providing as many opportunities as possible to destroy an incoming missile through the use of several kill vehicles launched from one booster  said Senator Shelby  While we have not needed it yet  our strong missile defense system is one of our militarys most important functions in keeping the homeland secure  The bill increased MKV  65 million over the Presidents budget request   PATRIOT PAC 3     489 067 million  The PAC 3 procurement program was fully funded  allowing the military to procure 108 Patriot Advance Capability  PAC 3  missiles  said Senator Shelby  This system will provide a critical force protection element on the battlefield   EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUCH VEHICLE     936 490 million  The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle  known as EELV  is built at Boeings facility in Decatur  and is the Air Force space lift modernization program  said Senator Shelby  EELV improves our nations access to space by making space launch vehicles more affordable and reliable  and keeps many of Alabamas workers on the job  This funding will allow for the procurement of 4 EELVs   LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER     91 117 million  The primary mission for the Light Utility Helicopter  LUH  is to provide aerial transport for logistical and administrative support  said Senator Shelby  The LUH is intended to replace Vietnam era UH 1H Huey and OH 58A C Kiowa Warrior helicopter  Our bill includes  91 117 million for the procurement of 16 LUHs  which is managed at Redstone Arsenal   ARMED RECONNAISSANCE HELICOPTER    101 818 million  The Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter  ARH   which is managed at Redstone Arsenal  provides the military with a highly deployable  reconnaissance and security capability to replace the aging OH 58D Kiowa Warrior fleet  said Senator Shelby  The bill includes funding for the procurement of 12 helicopters   FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEM     3 502 billion  Future Combat Systems  FCS   the core building block of the US Armys Future Force  is a joint networked combat and combat support system that provides our soldiers with greater situational awareness so they can see first  understand first  and act first  said Senator Shelby  FCS is integral to equipping the warfighter with the most technologically advanced weapons system   In addition  this bill includes  325 8 million for the Non Line of Sight   Launch System  NLOS LS  and  12 237 million for the Non Line of Sight Cannon  NLOS C  which are vital components to the Future Combat System   UNMANNED SYSTEMS INITIATIVE     2 5 million  The Unmanned Systems Initiative at the Aviation and Missile Research  Development and Engineering Center  AMRDEC  will conduct research and development of unmanned systems to advance  evaluate  and rapidly mature technologies to meet urgent warfighter needs as well as the optimal tactics  techniques  and procedures to employ unmanned systems capabilities  said Senator Shelby  Unmanned systems have immense potential to reduce engagement timelines while improving survivability in difficult urban terrain  Acceleration of the transition and fielding of these robotic technologies and capabilities is a critical wartime effort   UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES  UAVs   The DoD Appropriations Bill included  for a second year  language that prohibits the transfer of research  development  acquisition  or program authority relating to tactical UAVs from the Army  said Senator Shelby  The language ensures that the Army will retain responsibility for and operational control of the Extended Range Multi Purpose  ERMP  UAV  UAVs provide support for tactical ground combat operations for the Army  and it is important that the Army maintain control of tactical UAVs because they are vital for ground combatants   UAV research and development is conducted at Redstone Arsenal  and the Army UAV Center of Excellence is located at Ft  Rucker
