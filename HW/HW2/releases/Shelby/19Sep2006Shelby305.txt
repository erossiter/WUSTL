CONFERENCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING FOR ALABAMA    September 25  2006  Washington  D C       U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R Ala    a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  announced conference committee approval of funding for several projects included in the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  The bill will soon be voted on in the House  The Senate will consider the bill following House approval  after which it will be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  Maritime Patrol Aircraft    148 116 Million The CN 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft  MPA  provides the patrol and surveillance capability necessary to keep our coastal waters safe  said Senator Shelby  This legislation includes funding for the acquisition of three additional CN 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft  MPA   In addition  funding was provided to allow the Coast Guard to missionize and outfit three previously acquired MPA to full  mission ready  status  These aircraft are integral to the Coast Guard s mission and our national security   In 2004  EADS  European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company  North America announced the expansion of operations to Mobile with a new EADS CASA facility  All training for the CN 235 will take place at the U S  Coast Guard Mobile Air Training Center in Mobile  Center For Domestic Preparedness     57 Million The Center for Domestic Preparedness  CDP  at Ft  McClellan is the cornerstone of our nation s emergency responder training facilities and the  57 million provided in this bill will ensure that our nations first responders can continue to train at the only civilian live agent facility in the country  said Senator Shelby  The funding in this legislation will allow CDP to maintain its training capacity for first responders so that we may respond to terrorist attacks quickly and effectively  These first responders include law enforcement personnel  firefighters  and emergency medical personnel who are trained by CDP to prevent and respond to incidents of terrorism  In addition to training our nation s local first responders  CDP works closely with a number of federal agencies including the Department of Agriculture  USDA   Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI   Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   and others to develop new integrated counter terrorism training programs  Since the September 11  2001 attacks on our country  the importance of first responders has become more evident  Ft  McClellan s Center for Domestic Preparedness provides the necessary training for professionals to rapidly respond and react to terrorist attacks or natural disasters  Senator Shelby concluded   Noble Training Center     5 5 Million It is critical that we learn from our experiences and prepare for emergency events  said Senator Shelby  As we continue to fight the War on Terror and ready the nation for a natural disaster  emergency training is critical for our healthcare professionals  Unfortunately  with emergencies come injuries  and our doctors and nurses must be prepared for any tragic event whether man made or natural disaster  The bill includes a provision to reorganizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency that transfers Noble Training Center to the Center for Domestic Preparedness  The Noble Training Center is the only hospital facility in the United States solely devoted to training healthcare professionals in the areas of disaster preparedness and response  The integration of these two training facilities will allow CDP to deliver a comprehensive medical curriculum to specifically address medical and public health preparedness and response  The transfer of Noble Training Center further cements the Center for Domestic Preparedness as the preeminent all hazards preparedness and response training facility in the country allowing for seamless event response and medical evacuation and response training  Consolidation of Noble Training Hospital with the CDP means first responders will be able to experience a simulated real life scenario during training  Currently  the CDP provides event site  command center and triage training that stops at the hospital doors  With the consolidation  CDP and Noble will be able to provide training for first responders from the site to admission and treatment at the hospital  Senator Shelby concluded  14 Mile CSX Railroad Bridge on the Mobile River     7 Million  Replacement of 14 Mile CSX Railroad Bridge will ensure safe marine navigation on the Mobile River  which is vital to maintaining the efficiency and reliability of waterways commerce through the Port of Mobile and along the Black Warrior Tombigbee waterway system  said Senator Shelby  This legislation includes funding for the Coast Guards ongoing efforts to replace the bridge  The replacement of the bridge will save shippers millions of dollars annually in lost time and accidents  and will greatly assist in the shipment of cargo moving through the Alabama State Docks  added Shelby  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC      6 Million Having the necessary resources  knowledge and technology available to conduct a thorough investigation into child exploitation is essential to protecting our children  said Senator Shelby  This funding will assist NCMEC with their continued efforts to ensure our children s safety   Firefighter Assistance Grants     662 Million This legislation includes  662 million for Firefighter Assistance Grants  said Senator Shelby  These funds will assist local fire departments in their efforts to protect the health and safety of the public and firefighting personnel against fire and fire related hazards  and to provide assistance for fire prevention programs  These funds are administered by the Department of Homeland Security s Office of Domestic Preparedness  Funds can be used for such things as fire operations  firefighter safety programs  emergency medical services  and firefighting vehicles   Transportation Security Grants     409 Million As we continue the War on Terror and the defense of our nation against terrorist attacks  it is imperative that we take nothing for granted and this funding will take significant steps to better secure our transportation infrastructure  said Senator Shelby  This legislation provides funding for rail and transit security grants  port security grants  inter city bus security grants  and trucking industry security grants  I believe these funds are crucial in our efforts to improve homeland security  We have made great strides in improving our nation s aviation security  but Americans deserve to have the government s full attention devoted to the security of every mode of transportation  These funds will be administered by the Office of the State and Local Government Preparedness and Coordination within the Department of Homeland Security   210 million will be used for port security grants   175 million for rail and transit security grants   12 million for inter city bus security grants  and  12 million for trucking industry security grants   Border Security Fencing Infrastructure and Technology     1 188 Billion Our porous borders serve as a welcome sign to illegal immigrants and would be terrorist  said Senator Shelby  We must continue to construct physical barriers and increase our ability to effectively control our border  Failure to do so puts our national security at risk  This legislation is further proof that Congress is committed to securing our borders and adding the necessary funds to properly carry out this goal  This legislation includes funding to further secure our borders with additional fencing and vehicle barriers  This funding will be used for the development of fencing  vehicles barriers  and virtual fencing and monitoring technology along the United States border
