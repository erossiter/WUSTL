      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     SHELBY COMMENDS CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO     January 31  2006   By a vote of 58   42  Judge Samuel Alito was confirmed today by the United States Senate to be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  voted to confirm Judge Alito   I am proud to join so many of my colleagues in support of Justice Samuel Alito  Justice Alitos education  legal training  and judicial experience make him a great choice for the high court  He is a fair and impartial jurist  and I am confident that he will be an excellent addition to the United States Supreme Court  Senator Shelby concluded   Before the vote  Senator Shelby made the following statement  Mr  President  I rise today to support the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court   Judge Alitos education  legal training  and judicial record have positioned him well to serve our nation with honor and dignity on the Supreme Court  A graduate of Princeton and Yale  Judge Alito has more than thirty years of legal experience  Over the years  he has served as a judicial clerk  a prosecutor  an appellate lawyer before both the U S  Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court  He has served as Legal Counsel to the United States Government and most recently as a judge on the U S  Court of Appeals for the Third District  Judge Alito has a full breadth of experience in both criminal and civil cases as well as the trial and appeals phases of the judicial system   I believe Judge Alitos record on the U S  Court of Appeals for the Third District shows that he is a fair and impartial jurist  During his tenure on that court it has been clear that he takes all legal theories and arguments into account when making decisions and issuing rulings  Judge Alito is well respected by his colleagues and has even received their praise for the manner and tone he takes in working through the facts to arrive at a decision  I do not recall anyone questioning his ability to do the job and in fact  he received a unanimous well qualified rating from the American Bar Association  its highest rating   While many have criticized Judge Alitos supposed judicial philosophy  I believe that his written decisions and statements as well as his appearance before the Judiciary Committee confirmed his ability to set personal views and ideology aside so as to not cloud his interpretation of the law  I commend Judge Alito for his poise and composure throughout one of the most arduous hearings in recent memory   The time has come for Congress and the President to serve as a check on the judicial activism that has become so prevalent in the Judiciary today  I believe that we must have judges that interpret the Constitution and the law rather than manipulate it to meet their personal ideologies  Judge Alito fits that mold   Mr  President  I am proud to support Judge Alito and look forward to him becoming the next Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court  Senator Shelby concluded                                                          January 2006 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current record                                                                           Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
