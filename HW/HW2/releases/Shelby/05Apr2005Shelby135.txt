      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY REACTS TO DoD DECISION TO RELEASE FUNDS FOR INCINERATOR CONSTRUCTION IN KY AND CO     April 20  2005   WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senator Richard C  Shelby  R AL  today reacted to a decision by the Department of Defense to release funds for construction of chemical weapons incinerators in Colorado and Kentucky    Specifically  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  Technology and Logistics Michael Wynne issued a memo providing the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternative  ACWA   the agency responsible for oversight of the sites in Kentucky and Colorado  with full access to funding that had been previously withheld in the fiscal year 2005 budget for construction of chemical weapons incinerators   The memo also states that studying the concept of transportation of chemical weapons should cease     Senator Shelby said  This announcement is long overdue   I have been concerned for some time about the Department of Defenses decision to withhold funds for construction of chemical weapons incinerators in Colorado and Kentucky   The construction of these incinerators is critical in order to meet the requirements of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  START  which states that all chemical weapons stockpiles must be destroyed by April 29  2012   I share the concerns of many in my State of Alabama that the Anniston Army Depot could be subjected to more weapons should these other facilities not be built     I was given assurances in the past that the incinerator in Anniston would only be used for the destruction of weapons already in Anniston and once that work was complete  the facility would no longer be used   I am pleased the Department of Defense is keeping its word and moving forward with the construction of these other facilities     I am pleased that officials have ceased the study of the transportation of chemical weapons across State lines  Shelby concluded    Senator Shelby has been concerned about this issue since it was first announced that the Army Chemical Materials Agency was directed by the Department of Defense to study the transportation of chemical weapons  He is an original co sponsor of S 186  which would prohibit the use of Department of Defense funds for any study related to the transportation of chemical munitions across State lines     Senator Shelby was a strong supporter of language in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  which passed out of the Appropriations Committee on April 6  2005  that reads in part  The Committee believes the chemical demilitarization program will require significantly more funding to comply with the Treaty   The Committee does not support the use of appropriated funds for any studies that consider transporting chemical munitions across State lines   Further  the Committee expects that all of the planned sites will be developed and operated to include Blue Grass  KY  and Pueblo  CO  and instructs the Department of Defense to begin obligation of funds at Blue Grass and Pueblo immediately      30                                                          April 2005 News Releases                      Year            County                                                                                                   Current record                                                                                                                        Washington                                                  Email                                                            Email                                                       Email                                                       Email                                                            Email                                                       Email
