      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    Shelby Announces Defense Funding for the Wiregrass   September 12  2007  Washington  D C     U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R Ala    a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  today announced committee approval of important funding for the Wiregrass included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2008  Following todays action by the committee  the legislation will go to the Senate floor for consideration  The funding approved by the Senate will support important defense related programs that strengthen our national security  said Shelby  These programs are critical to the stability of our nations military infrastructure and readiness and the Senates approval demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the safety of our citizens and the strength of our military  Having just returned from Iraq  I know these programs will prove beneficial as we continue the fight against terrorism  In total  this bill provides  459 3 billion for defense related needs  Javelin Missile     168 million The Defense Appropriations bill included  168 million to procure 385 Javelin missiles for the Army  said Shelby  Javelin missiles give our ground forces a critical tactical fire capability  Produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy  these missiles keep our servicemembers safe and keep Alabamas economy strong   Hellfire Missile     46 million Hellfire missiles  produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy  help to ensure that our military aviators are the best equipped warriors in the sky  said Shelby  This bill includes  46 million for 439 hellfire missiles for the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  UAV    Non Line of Sight Launch System  NLOS LS      255 million The Non Line of Sight Launch System is a program focused on beyond line of sight fires for the Army s Future Combat System  FCS   said Shelby  The NLOS LS program is a containerized  platform independent multi mission weapon concept that will serve as an enabling technology element for the FCS  The NLOS LS provides rapid response and lethality in packages requiring significantly fewer personnel  decreased logistical support and lower life cycle costs  while increasing survivability compared to current direct fire gun and missile artillery  Non Line of Sight Cannon  NLOS C      137 8 million The Non Line of Sight Cannon provides networked  extended range targeting and precision attack in support of the warfighter with a suite of munitions that include special purpose capabilities  said Shelby  The NLOS C provides sustained fires for close support and destructive fires for tactical standoff engagement  I believe this project is vital for the warfighter  Army Helicopters The fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill includes funding for a number of helicopter systems vital to the Army  and the mission at Fort Rucker and in the Wiregrass region  said Shelby   The following airframes were included   673 7 million for modifications to the AH 64 Apache Longbow attack helicopter     770 8 million for procurement of 52 UH 60 Blackhawks     230 5 million for procurement of the Light Utility Helicopters  LUH      540 7 million for modifications to the CH 47 Chinook Helicopter     242 3 million for 16 Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters  ARH      Joint Air to Ground  JAGM  Missile     53 5 million  I am pleased that research and development are fully funded for the JAGM  said Shelby  JAGM is essential because it will bolster our warfighting potential and provide our servicemen and women with a new capability to ward off the unconventional threats of the 21st Century   Designed as a next generation  multipurpose replacement for the Hellfire  Longbow  and Maverick air to ground missiles currently used by the Army  Navy  and Marine Corps  JAGM will be a vital asset for our services in years to come  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAVs  The DoD Appropriations bill includes  for a third year  language that prohibits the transfer of research  development  acquisition or program authority relating to tactical UAVs from the Army  said Shelby  The language ensures that the Army will retain responsibility for an operational control of the Extended Range Multi Purpose  ERMP  UAV  With the Army conducting the vast majority of UAV operations in Iraq  it is imperative that control of UAV assets is kept with the battlefield commander to ensure that these assets are readily available to our troops who are deploying them for tactical missions  During my recent visit to Iraq  I discussed the ongoing debate concerning Executive Agency for Unmanned Aerial Systems  UAS  with our battlefield commanders  They agreed that the Army needs to maintain control of their UAS assets because  from a tactical standpoint  our soldiers in the field need a versatile  service specific capability  UAV research and development is conducted at Redstone Arsenal  and the Army UAV Center of Excellence is located at Ft  Rucker
