funding for these important Wiregrass area defense related programs  They are critical to the stability of our nation s military infrastructure and readiness  and today s approval demonstrates our commitment to national security   In total  this bill provides  490 2 billion for new defense related needs  including  50 billion for contingency operations related to the Global War on Terror                     As we continue to look for ways to reduce our nation s spending in light of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  we must also ensure that funding is provided for important priorities  such as our national defense         JAVELIN MISSILES                   Senator Shelby said  I am pleased that the committee approved  57 636 million to procure 300 Javelin missiles in fiscal year 2006   Javelin missiles give our ground forces a critical tactical fire capability and are produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy   In addition  the bill includes  14 007 million for modifications to Javelin missiles         HELLFIRE MISSILE PREDATOR HELLFIRE MISSILE                  Senator Shelby said  I am pleased the committee approved  50 million for the procurement of Hellfire missiles  These missiles help to ensure our Army and Air Force aviators are the best equipped warriors in the sky and are produced at the Lockheed Martin facility in Troy   Additionally  our bill includes  21 135 million for over 200 hellfire missiles for the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  UAV           JOINT COMMON MISSILE                   Senator Shelby said  Our bill includes language requiring the Department of Defense to conduct a study on the impact that cancellation of the Joint Common Missile  JCM  will have on our national defense   Earlier this year  I raised concerns with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers regarding the cancellation of this program   I am hopeful that this study will provide the Congress with answers regarding why this vital program was cancelled and if termination was justified         JOINT AIR TO SURFACE STANDOFF MISSILE                  Senator Shelby said  The committee approved  100 million for the Joint Air to Surface Standoff

independent multi mission weapon concept as an enabling technology element for the FCS  The NLOS LS provides rapid response and lethality in packages requiring significantly fewer personnel  decreased logistical support and lower life cycle costs  while increasing survivability compared to current direct fire gun and missile artillery         NON LINE OF SIGHT CANNON      Senator Shelby said  The Non Line of Sight Cannon  NLOS C  provides networked  extended range targeting and precision attack in support of the warfighter with a suite of munitions that include special purpose capabilities  The NLOS C provides sustained fires for close support and destructive fires for tactical standoff engagement   I believe this project is necessary for the warfighter  and I am pleased our bill

DoD Appropriations Bill   This amendment prohibits the transfer of research  development  acquisition  or program authority relating to tactical UAVs from the Army   The amendment ensures that the Army will retain responsibility for and operational control of the Extended Range Multi Purpose  ERMP  UAV   UAVs provide support for tactical ground combat operations for the Army  and it is important that the Army maintain control of tactical UAVs because they are vital for ground combatants         UAV research and development is done at Redstone Arsenal  and the Army UAV Center of Excellence is located at Ft  Rucker                  30                                                            October 2005 News Releases                      Year            County
