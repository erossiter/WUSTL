      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                    SHELBY  WE MUST PROTECT THE FLAG          June 27  2006   U S  Senator Richard Shelby  R AL  yesterday delivered a speech on the floor of the U S  Senate in favor of the Anti Flag Desecration Resolution  which Senator Shelby co sponsored  The resolution proposes an amendment to the U S  Constitution authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States    Full text of Senator Shelbys remarks as prepared   Mr  President  I rise today to express my strong support for the Anti Flag Desecration Resolution   Two hundred and twenty nine years ago this month the Continental Congress adopted a resolution giving the United States a flag  the Stars and Stripes  the American flag we know today  There is no greater symbol of our freedom and liberty   The Stars and Stripes epitomize the underpinnings of the United States  that which was envisioned and created by the founders of this great nation  solidified by the framers of the Constitution  and represented at that first Continental Congress  Old Glory was raised at Iwo Jima  placed on the moon  and drapes the coffin of every servicemember who has sacrificed their life for our nation  Our flag  Mr  President  is emblematic of liberty and democracy  it honors all those who have defended our nation from enemies at home and abroad  and all those who carried it into battle  and never returned   Yet there are some throughout this country who have chosen to express their views and opinions by defacing and even burning the flag  They believe the flag is simply a piece of fabric upon which stars and stripes have been sewn  They refuse to respect and revere the flag as a true monument to the freedoms and ideals of our great nation  These notions were bolstered by a 1989 Supreme Court decision that protected desecration of the flag   Mr  President  throughout the history of our nation  the flag has been protected by laws  In fact  before the Supreme Courts decision in 1989  48 states and the District of Columbia had laws regulating the physical misuse of the American flag  Even today  a majority of Americans continue to believe that the flag should be protected  that the court was wrong in their decision   It is that strong support and my firm belief that we must protect the flag  that has sent me here today to advocate for this resolution  While some have argued that we should simply accept court interpretations of First Amendment issues as final  irreversible truths  our system of government is based upon checks and balances that allows for legislative reactions to judicial decisions   While rarely invoked  utilizing the procedures set forth to amend the Constitution is a reasonable reaction to a controversial  and clearly wrong headed court decision  The amendment process should not be avoided simply because it is arduous or because the courts are thought to have the final word  The American system provided for amendments and there are some issues that deserve that attention   In debating this issue we must we must look beyond burning the flag and protecting ones freedom of expression  This issue must be considered in a broader context  We must remember that this issue is about respecting the single  unifying symbol of this great democracy  the American flag   Defacing the United States Capitol or the Washington Monument would never be considered legitimate acts of free speech  The flag should be entitled to the same considerations  The flag  Mr  President  is a national treasure  a monument even  and like other national assets  it deserves to be protected and respected   Our flag is a unique national symbol  that represents common values  shared aspirations  and the sacrifices of millions of Americans  The argument is not about legitimate free speech  but rather the extent to which free people must tolerate offensive acts   While some will say that a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning unduly inhibits free expression  Mr  President  I disagree   Let me be clear  It will not diminish the Bill of Rights to allow Congress to define and enforce a law which protects the American flag much like other monuments are protected  To desecrate the American flag is to desecrate the memory of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their lives to keep our flag flying  It is to destroy everything this country represents   There are some things that just need to be treated with respect and reverence for no other reason then to honor all those who have served and died for this country   When we look at our flag we should see more than a piece of fabric  colored red  white  and blue  We should see our nation and all that it symbolizes  Our armed forces put their lives on the line daily to defend what Old Glory represents  We have a duty and responsibility to honor their sacrifices by giving the flag the Constitutional protection it deserves   Thank you  Mr  President  I yield
