      United States Senator Richard Shelby   Press Room                                                                                                    Press Room News Releases                     GULF COAST SENATORS INTRODUCE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS REVENUE SHARING BILL    Bill provides coastal impact assistance to energy producing states  March 8  2006   Six Gulf Coast senators joined together today to introduce bipartisan legislation that will direct a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of Mexico to the states of Mississippi  Louisiana  Alabama and Texas  The bill  authored by U S  Senators Trent Lott  R Miss   Mary Landrieu  D La   Thad Cochran  R Miss   David Vitter  R La   Richard Shelby  R Ala   and Jeff Sessions  R Ala   responds to legislation reported out by the Senate Energy Committee today to open as much as 3 6 million acres of the Gulf to oil and gas production   The Gulf Coast senators bill would share with the coastal producing states 50 percent of the federal revenue generated by production in an area known as Area 181  This coastal impact assistance had not been included in S  2253  the legislation passed by the committee this morning despite a letter from Senators Lott and Landrieu last month stating that they could not support such a bill unless coastal impact assistance was included   The Gulf Coast states have provided the ports  pipeline facilities  fabrication facilities  and other support functions to maintain oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico  Sen  Lott said today  As we saw from the devastation caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the damage to this supporting infrastructure causes its own damage to our coastal communities  The increase in Gulf oil and gas exploration that will occur as a result of leasing Area 181 will increase the impact on the Gulf Coast communities  The provision of coastal impact assistance using a portion of the federal revenues from these leases is appropriate and greatly needed by those communities   The nation has a need for more oil and gas  and we are the nations only Energy Coast  Sen  Landrieu said  Weve got to increase our supply  not decrease it  and we also have to conserve more  But the host states along the Gulf Coast are the ones who make offshore energy possible  Without them  none of those minerals would be accessible  So particularly after hurricanes Katrina and Rita  we need to use our fair share of these royalties to build better  stronger levees and to restore our eroding wetlands  the first line of defense against oncoming storms  It is imperative that this new source of revenue come to help us in the long term rebuilding efforts of the Gulf Coast   This legislation will allow Mississippi to get a fair share of the profits from the oil and gas produced in the 181 Area of the Gulf of Mexico  Sen  Cochran said  This is especially important for our state in light of the loss of tax revenue we have faced because of the damage of Hurricane Katrina  The income Mississippi will gain from this revenue sharing agreement will provide funds for infrastructure improvements  conservation programs  and restoration of coastal areas   Louisiana and the other Gulf States have provided the infrastructure for oil and gas production  which supports the energy needs for the vast majority of the nation  said Sen  Vitter  This bipartisan legislation is one of several avenues that we will pursue to ensure that Gulf States are getting their fare share of the royalty revenues  which are critical for Louisiana to use for hurricane protection and coastal restoration   This legislation is an important step towards leveling the playing field for the Gulf States  Sen  Shelby said  It is time that Gulf States receive a return on their investment in our nations oil and gas production  Time and again we have experienced the direct impact the supply of oil and gas from the Gulf has on our economy  I believe it is imperative that the Gulf States benefit from their willingness to participate in exploration activities that are essential to our nations energy supply   Increasing domestic production is a matter of national security  and Congress should act now to allow more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico  Alabama and three other Gulf states produce oil and gas that benefit the rest of the country  and it is only fair that these states are rewarded for their willingness to produce a disproportionate share of our nations energy needs  said Sen  Sessions   The bi partisan legislation introduced today allows for the funding to be used by states and parishes or counties for the restoration of coastal wetlands  mitigation of damage to wildlife and natural resources  implementation of federally approved conservation management plans  projects pertaining to onshore infrastructure  and activities related to energy production or administrative costs necessary to comply with the legislation  While the exact amount of funding created by the legislation remains unknown  Area 181s total lifetime royalties are estimated to be as high as  11 billion   The Gulf Coast senators bill is expected be re offered as an amendment to or as a substitute for the underlying legislation  S  2253  when it reaches the Senate floor       30                                                          March 2006 News Releases
