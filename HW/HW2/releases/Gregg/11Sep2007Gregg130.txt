to Congress Unofficial Transcript  Mr  Gregg  I want to continue the discussion which has been going forward today on the treatment of General Petraeus by the group Moveon org relative to the advertisement which was run and has been shown on the floor a number of times referring to General Petraeus as General Betray Us  I think it was a despicable act  It really crosses the line when someone who has dedicated his life to defending this nation would be subjected to this type of personal assassination and character assassination and it is totally inappropriate   The troops who are serving us in Iraq are doing so because they believe unalterably in the cause of America  They believe what this nation stands for is good and right  And they are putting their lives on the line to make sure that we can maintain the freedoms which are so critical to us  Now  you can disagree with the policies on Iraq  and I have a lot of reservations about them  I especially have very severe concerns about what s happening with the government of Iraq  both in the area of creating coalition government stability and specifically in the area of corruption  But what you cannot argue with and what should not occur is that we say to our troops who are out there every day facing danger and lethal threat that we do not support them  And yet  when you impugn in such a gratuitous and vicious way the integrity of their commander in the field  you clearly impugn the troops who are in the field  It is wrong and shouldn t be tolerated   General Petraeus has a record which is extraordinary  He has dedicated almost four decades  I believe  to the military service of this country  He has received a bronze star along with innumerable other decorations in the 101st Airborne  He has been to Iraq on three tours  spent the last four years overseas away from his family  and has put in place an initiative in Iraq which he generally believes  as his testimony has shown both yesterday and today before the House and the Senate  is making progress in a number of critical areas relative to the war on the ground and relative to fighting the Islamic terrorists who wish to do us harm   And yet  before he even got to the Senate or to the House to testify and make his case as to why he felt the policy that he s pursuing there as the General in command was the correct policy and should be sustained  before that could even occur  his character was attacked in the most vicious way by people who oppose the war   Opposing the war is a legitimate position  There are very strong arguments in that area  I don t happen to agree with many of them  but I respect those arguments when they re made substantively and appropriately  But when an organization like Moveon org  which is a national organization of dramatic influence  steps out and runs a full page ad at the cost of  160 000 in The New York Times which has as its title  Is he General Petraeus or General Betray Us  that is an inexcusable  vicious and petty act  and not becoming of our society nor a democracy in general   Now the other side of the aisle    and I have the greatest respect for members on the other side of the aisle relative to their commitment on this issue    the other side of the aisle has said  Well  it s not us doing this  Well  let s remember that Moveon org identifies with and openly claims to be a major player in the caucus of the Democratic Party  In fact  just this weekend in The New York Times  the lead spokesman for Moveon org said    and I paraphrase here    but he said  I meet regularly with the Democratic leaders of the Senate  and I talk almost daily to the Democratic staff of the Democratic leaders of the Senate  Earlier in the year  Moveon org  and I believe it was the same individual  and again I am paraphrasing  said of the Democratic Party  We bought it  it s ours  we re going to dominate it  And I see in New Hampshire Moveon org is one of the most aggressive arms of the Democratic Party in our state  They are the ones carrying the message relative to the war and relative to the Democratic leadership in our state  that s for sure   This statement by Moveon org which is so over the top and so outrageous and so inexcusable in its treatment of an American soldier and the troops he commands should be repudiated openly  It should be repudiated by this Senate because it s wrong  It s just common decency that we should repudiate it  And yet  we see on this floor that procedural mechanisms are being used to protect Moveon org  That s what s happening here  Rule 16  a procedural mechanism in this Senate  has been used to keep a very reasonably innocuous Sense of the Senate from being brought forward to a vote  It doesn t take very long to vote on something like this  We could set up a vote in ten minutes on this   And what does this Sense of the Senate  which is so inappropriate that it has to be knocked down by a procedural action  say  It says    I need to get my glasses here because my wife always says I squint if I don t use my glasses  bad image  she says  so let me get my glasses  This is the resolution clause  It is the Sense of the Senate  one  to reaffirm its support for all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces including General David H  Petraeus  Commanding General of the Multinational Forces in Iraq  Two  to strongly condemn any effort to attack the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all the members of the United States Armed Forces  And  three  to specifically repudiate the unwarranted personal attacks of General Petraeus by the liberal activist group Moveon org  I think it s number three that must bother my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and which is causing us to not be able to go to a vote on this amendment   That we would repudiate  probably from a financial standpoint one of the biggest contributors to the efforts to fight against the war and that organization which openly claims it would essentially be an arm of the Democratic Party  would be repudiated here on the Senate floor  They deserve to be repudiated  Honestly  if an organization which identified itself as the Republican Party    I can t think of any that we have that has the type of money that Moveon org has  because we don t have any George Soras  funding us or any organization like that   but if we had such an organization and they did something like this  I would immediately want to repudiate it   Because somebody of the character and commitment of General Petraeus doesn t deserve this  You know  he came back here to testify because he was asked to come back to testify by committees  which are committees where the majority is controlled by the Democratic leadership of the Congress  And yet  before he gets here to testify before those Committees  there is a clear attempt to discredit him personally because they didn t like the message  So instead of attacking the message  they decided to kill the messenger or attempt to at least undermine the messenger  That s the goal of this ad  Nothing more than a petty attempt to basically undermine the message of what General Petraeus has to deliver  we re going to attack him as the messenger  which is gratuitous  inappropriate  inaccurate  unfair and vicious   quite simply  vicious  calling him General Betray Us  And so if the majority party doesn t subscribe to this message  then they should allow us to offer this resolution right now while he s here in town  while he s testifying before the Senate today and before the House yesterday  They shouldn t ask us to wait until next week to correct this egregious act and to go on record repudiating this egregious act  They shouldn t use a parliamentary procedure to defend Moveon org  No  they should have a vote right now on this resolution  this Sense of the Senate   So at this point I ask unanimous consent  Mr  President  that Rule 16 not apply to this Sense of the Senate and that the procedural attack on this Sense of the Senate not be in order   The Presiding Officer  Is there objection   Mrs  Murray  Mr  President  I object   Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  I ask further unanimous consent that we immediately move to a vote on this resolution stating that we support General Petraeus  general in the field  we support his men and women who are fighting for us  and that we reject the despicable ad of Moveon org   The Presiding Officer  Is there objection   Mrs  Murray  Mr  President  I object   The Presiding Officer  The objection is heard   Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  I regret the decision by the majority party to not allow to us to proceed in this manner to help us give this good man his fair hearing  I yield the floor and a make a point of order that a quorum is not present
