Senator Gregg Calls on GAO to Evaluate Government and Private Sector Response Capabilities to Outbreak of Pandemic Flu Contact  Erin Rath  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today requested that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  evaluate government and private sector response capabilities in the case of an outbreak of pandemic flu   The possibility of a pandemic flu outbreak is real  and we must be prepared at all levels of government  as well as in the health care industry and business  said Senator Gregg  the former Chairman and current member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  In order to be properly prepared  we need to measure our current capabilities and make improvements and changes where needed  An assessment by GAO of our current capabilities will help us do that and I look forward to their answers   In a September 20th letter to GAO  Senator Gregg commended the agency on its investigative work into the preparedness of all levels of government  and requested that it assess the preparedness of hospitals and other private sector entities to respond to an outbreak of pandemic flu  He requested that GAO evaluate the preparedness of the nations critical infrastructure  including food and water supplies  Senator Gregg also asked GAO to continue to measure and assess the readiness of first responders to have the proper personnel  vaccines  and medical equipment available to treat a significant rise in patients and keep those supplies both safe and available   During the 109th Congress  Senator Gregg introduced the SAFE Act  S  2792  to enhance our nations level of emergency preparedness  including better coordination and planning at all levels of government for public health and medical response  During the 108th Congress  Senator Gregg authored the Project BioShield Act  which provided  5 6 billion for the development of critical vaccines  devices and drugs that can be used against bio terror threats like anthrax  small pox  and botulinum toxin  The legislation also ensures prompt access to life saving therapies under development when an attack occurs and improves NIH research authorities to speed up bioterrorism research  As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Senator Gregg held a hearing on May 23  2006 titled  Bio Defense and Pandemic Influenza  Is America Prepared  Under Senator Greggs leadership  the HELP Committee held four hearings regarding bioterrorism  The Smallpox Vaccination Plan  Challenges and Next Steps January 2003  Federal Bio Defense Readiness July 2003  Terror Attacks  Are We Prepared  July 2004  and BioShield II  Responding to an Ever Changing Threat a joint hearing with the Judiciary Committee in October 2004 In addition  Senator Gregg held a joint Budget Appropriations Committee hearing on bioterrorism preparedness in April 2005    A copy of Senator Greggs letter to GAO is attached      September 20  2006  Dear Mr  Walker   I commend GAO for conducting a comprehensive study on federal and private sector efforts to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic  A pandemic could have severe consequences  affecting all sectors of the economy and raising important health care and other challenging policy issues  GAO has begun to identify some key issues central to planning for and responding to a pandemic  leadership  authority  and coordination  detecting threats and managing risks  planning  training and exercising  capacity to respond and recover  information sharing and communication  and performance and accountability    An outbreak of pandemic flu will require a comprehensive national network to ensure the protection of our nations critical infrastructure  As such  I request that GAO undertake a review of the private sectors efforts to coordinate critical infrastructure protection networks  There are a number of areas that should be reviewed  including distributing food  water and other critical supplies    I am also interested in preparedness at the state and local levels of government  which would also be called upon to address pandemic threats  Therefore  I request that GAO examine states  planning efforts  including disease surveillance capabilities  evaluation of state pandemic preparedness planning  and medical surge capacity  I would also request that GAO examine whether states are meeting preparedness goals established through the guidance establish in the CDC and HRSA public health and hospital preparedness grants  Finally  I am interested in understanding how well our nations private sector is prepared to handle an outbreak of pandemic influenza  With a significant number of employees out sick or taking care of loved ones  it is expected that the workforce will be significantly impacted  As such  I am requesting that GAO examine how well prepared hospitals and businesses are to maintain adequate levels of operation during a pandemic    As described in at the outset  my interests in preparing for pandemic influenza are wide ranging  and not limited solely to these issues  I would request that your staff keep in touch on a regular basis with Richie Weiblinger of my staff at  202  224 0642   Sincerely    Judd Gregg U S  Senator
