Senator Gregg Calls on HHS Secretary Leavitt to Provide Update on Management of Project BioShield Provision to Stockpile Bioterror Vaccines Contact  Erin Rath  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  today called on Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to provide a comprehensive update on the current status of the BioShield program  The Project BioShield law  passed in 2004 and sponsored by Senator Gregg  directs HHS to prepare for such an event by encouraging the creation and procurement of vaccines and other countermeasures to effectively respond to a biological event   The potential for a biological or bioterror event in the United States is real and must be addressed  stated Senator Gregg  Project BioShield was passed to speed the development and acquisition of vaccines and countermeasures to combat a bioterror attack  and HHS needs to show progress in this effort   However  the news that the initial BioShield contract has been terminated is not a reassuring sign  BioShield is a crucial program that addresses a serious threat to our nation  and HHS needs to deliver results  I want to make sure BioShield is on track  and if not  what needs to be done to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines and countermeasures  In the 109th Congress  Senator Gregg co sponsored the Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act which was signed into law by President Bush on December 20  2006  The measure would establish the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  BARDA   within the Office of Emergency Preparedness  to fund cutting edge research and development of medical countermeasures  including drugs and vaccines  to fight bioterrorism and natural disease outbreaks   The full letter to Secretary Leavitt follows    Dear Secretary Leavitt  I am requesting additional information from the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  about the management of Project BioShield and its future viability  specifically regarding the development and supply of vaccines and countermeasures necessary to protect the health of Americans from potential bioterrorism attacks   The Project BioShield Act of 2004  which I sponsored  provides expedited procedures for bioterrorism related procurement  hiring  and awarding of research grants  making it easier for HHS to commit substantial funds to countermeasure research and development  As you know  this legislation gives the HHS Secretary the authority to contract to purchase countermeasures while they still have several more years of product development   In continuation of this effort  I co sponsored the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006  which President Bush signed into law on December 20  2006  This legislation creates the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority  BARDA  under the direction of HHS  which will focus on directing advanced research and development of vaccines and therapeutics for use against biological attacks   In 2004  HHS awarded the first Project BioShield contract to VaxGen  Inc  to provide 75 million doses of their recombinant anthrax vaccine within 3 years  In November 2006  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  placed a clinical hold on VaxGens Phase II clinical trial for failure to demonstrate sufficient vaccine stability  On December 19  2006  the FDA declined to lift the clinical hold and as a result VaxGen was unable to meet their contractual performance milestones and HHS therefore terminated the procurement contract for breach     I am concerned about the management and future success of this crucial program  By continuing to place such a large concentration of resources into the development of one experimental product  HHS assumes a high level of risk of future vaccine shortages   Toward this end  does HHS still believe that 75 million doses of anthrax vaccines are needed to protect the U S  population  If so  I request that HHS detail how it plans to make up for the anticipated shortfall in anthrax vaccines due to the termination of the VaxGen contract  including whether or not the federal government has further plans to purchase larger supplies of traditional anthrax vaccines that are currently on the market  If not  what has created this reduced need for anthrax vaccines  In addition  please describe why HHS put such a large percentage of its resources into one type of vaccine from one source  rather than simultaneously seeking other potential sources for anthrax vaccines  What steps is HHS taking to ensure that future contracts will not be managed in this fashion  Thank you for your dedication and continued efforts to prepare and respond to a bioterror incident  I look forward to a response so that action can be taken immediately to develop and supply the U S  population with much needed countermeasures  If your staff has any questions about this request or requires additional information  please have them contact Elizabeth Wroe in my office at  202  224 0642     Sincerely   Judd Gregg
