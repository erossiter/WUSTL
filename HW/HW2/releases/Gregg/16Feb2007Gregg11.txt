Senator Gregg Calls On GAO To Review National Strategy To Combat Possible Outbreak Of Pandemic Flu Contact  Erin Rath  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  former Chairman and current member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  recently called on the head of the Government Accountability Office  Comptroller General David Walker  to ensure the quality of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza  developed by the Presidents Homeland Security Council in November 2005   An outbreak of pandemic flu in the United States would wreak havoc on numerous communities and our national economy  stated Senator Gregg  It is a serious threat and it is critical that all levels of government  in all corners of our nation  are prepared to respond efficiently and effectively  I am asking the Government Accountability Office to review both the National Strategy  as well as the implementation plan for the strategy released last spring  I am hopeful the GAO will assess whether we are properly preparing to respond to a pandemic flu outbreak  The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act  S  3678   passed during the 109th Congress and signed into law by President Bush in December 2006  contained initiatives introduced earlier by Senator Gregg  including the Republican Leadership biodefense preparedness bill  S 3  and the SAFE Act  S  2792   Both bills were designed to improve the public health and medical response to biological outbreaks  including the establishment of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the Office of Emergency Preparedness  to fund cutting edge research and development of medical countermeasures  including drugs and vaccines  to fight bioterrorism and natural disease outbreaks   During his tenure as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Senator Gregg presided over a Subcommittee hearing on May 23  2006 titled  Biodefense and Pandemic Influenza  Is America Prepared  Under Senator Greggs leadership  the HELP Committee held four hearings regarding bioterrorism  The Smallpox Vaccination Plan  Challenges and Next Steps January 2003  Federal Biodefense Readiness July 2003  Terror Attacks  Are We Prepared  July 2004  and BioShield II  Responding to an Ever Changing Threat a joint Hearing with the Judiciary Committee in October 2004  In addition  Senator Gregg held a joint Budget Appropriations Committee hearing on Bioterrorism preparedness in April 2005   The full letter to Comptroller General Walker follows    Dear Mr  Walker  I commend your work evaluating our nations ongoing efforts to prepare for and respond to an outbreak of pandemic influenza  As you know  an outbreak of pandemic influenza could have severe and long lasting consequences on our nations economy  security  healthcare  and many other critical elements  Many leaders in public health are confident that an outbreak of pandemic influenza will occur in the future  its not a matter of if  but when and how severe   In November 2005 the Presidents Homeland Security Council issued the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza to provide a framework for the roles and responsibilities of federal  state and local governments  the private sector and local communities to prepare for and respond to a pandemic influenza   The National Strategy was followed by the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza issued in May 2006  The Implementation Plan establishes a direction for preparedness and key planning considerations for federal departments and agencies  state and local governments  and communities in the U S  and abroad  It includes more than 300 specific preparedness actions for federal departments and agencies   I request that GAO review the National Strategy and Implementation Plan to ensure its effectiveness in preparing for and responding to a pandemic influenza  I believe this review should focus on the following key issues       1  To what extent does the National Strategy and the Implementation Plan provide adequate and well defined preparedness recommendations and criteria for all levels of government  the private sector and local communities    2  To what extent do the National Strategy and Implementation Plan include adequate incentives for private sector and local community preparedness planning   3  How well defined are federal department and agency leadership roles and responsibilities through the National Strategy and Implementation Plan   4  Do the National Strategy and Implementation Plan provide adequate planning and criteria for the distribution of vaccines  antivirals and other medical supplies during a pandemic  As described above  my interests in our nations capacity to effectively prepare for and respond to an outbreak of pandemic influenza is wide ranging and not solely limited to the issues mentioned above  I would also request that you continue to regularly update Richie Weiblinger of my staff at  202  224 1107 on your findings   Sincerely   Judd Gregg   U S  Senator
