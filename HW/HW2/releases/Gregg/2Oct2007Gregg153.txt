Senator Gregg Co Sponsors Amendment To Increase Border Security Commitment Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today was the lead cosponsor of a border security funding amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill currently being debated in the Senate  The amendment  entitled the Border Security First Act of 2007  provides  3 billion in emergency funding to help achieve and maintain operational control over the entire U S  Mexico border  The funding would be used for the hiring and training of additional border agents  deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  installation of additional ground based sensors  cameras  and vehicle barriers  and building the 700 miles of border fencing required under the Secure Fence Act of 2006  The amendment also would boost enforcement of our immigration laws at the worksite by providing substantial funds for improved employment eligibility verification  as well as increased detention and removal of those who are here illegally  Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security and author of a similar amendment which was accepted by the Senate during recent debate on the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  stated  Border security is absolutely critical for protecting our nation  and it is a first step toward fixing our broken immigration system  Gaining control over our borders  especially our border with Mexico  also will restore the confidence of the American people and assure them that their government is truly serious about stopping the influx of illegal immigrants  We cannot truly reform our immigration system until this is done  and we can finally account for those who are entering our country and stop those who are trying to come here unlawfully   This amendment provides the necessary funding for additional border agents  fencing  detention beds  and technological resources that are required to achieve operational control over the Southern border  I believe that border control funding is as much a part of national security as funding for the war on terrorism  and this amendment will put the funds in the pipeline to help ensure the safety and confidence of the American people    A transcript of Senator Greggs floor speech follows   Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Floor Statement on Graham Border Security Amendment  Tuesday  October 2  2007 Unofficial Transcript Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  I rise to support the Graham amendment  It s an amendment I ve been helping to develop  It was an amendment that was offered on the Homeland Security bill  essentially  It s the same concept  And the purpose of this amendment is something on which I think there s general agreement here in the Senate for  which is that we supply adequate resources to make sure that our border is secure   This is an effort that we ve been pursuing for quite a while  I had the good fortune to be Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  And during that time  we dramatically increased our commitment to border security  especially in the area of the number of agents  in the area of the number of detention beds  in the area of fencing  electronic and virtual fencing  and in the area of making technology available and support facilities available to Border Security agents and the I C E  agents  It is a ramping up process  however  and there s still a ways to go  although we have made very significant strides  But unfortunately  in our opinion  on this side of the aisle  and this amendment was agreed to by the other side of the aisle for all intents and purposes when it was offered on Homeland Security  there is a need for additional funding to make sure that we put in place the resources which will basically assure the American people that the border can and will be secured along the Southern Border  Now  what does that require  Well  this amendment doesn t put specific numbers relative to the number of agents or detention beds or fencing  but what it does put in place is an additional  3 billion of emergency funding  which will essentially go towards three major areas  The first will be agents  We know that we need about 23 000 agents on the border  We know we re headed towards that number  but we know it s going to take a significant increase in funding for us to get to that number  Now  we wish we could wave a magic wand of dollars and produce these agents overnight  but you can t  These people are highly skilled  They require special qualities as individuals  They have to be law enforcement individuals  but they also have to speak Spanish  They have to have the character and the personality to be able to work in a very intense environment and deal with very threatening situations  while at the same time dealing with people who are coming across the border to make a better way of life for themselves and really shouldn t be treated in the criminal way  but should be treated as decent human beings trying to seek a better way of life here in the United States  but who come into the United States inappropriately and have to go back  Handling that type of situation requires a little more care and sensitivity than dealing with somebody coming across selling drugs  So these are the individuals that we need to attract into the Border Security effort  They re quality  high caliber individuals  You can t just gather them up overnight  It takes a while to get the applicants and then put them through the schooling process  it does take money to do that  And this amendment will allow us  to the extent that we can find these types of individuals and populate this work force  to do exactly that  So we will have a full complement of agents on the Southern Border  In addition  it will add additional detention beds which are critical  There is a belief that we need around 33 000 detention beds  I think is the number  We re headed towards building out a significant number of detention beds  but the dollars in this amendment will give the Department the resources it needs to accomplish the additional detention beds  Why are detention beds important  Because we ve gone from a policy which was essentially catch and release of two or three years ago  to a policy where we actually catch and hold people  We no longer say come back in a few months after we catch you from crossing the border illegally and appear before the court  What happened was people never came back  We d send them off and they d never return  not surprisingly  Now  we hold these folks and we make sure that they have their day in court and that they receive the proper protections of our law enforcement system  but if they re found to have entered this country illegally  they get sent back  but it takes money  And that s why this amendment is important to accomplish that  Third  we are building a fence in those areas  a physical fence in those areas where we need fencing  Fencing isn t appropriate for the entire border  but in our more urban areas along the border  it is appropriate and it is expensive  And so the money in this amendment will allow us to complete the fencing commitments which we think are necessary  And equally important  it will put in place the operation of what we call a virtual fence  but it is a real fence  We have a tremendous electronic surveillance capability  oversight capability through unmanned aerial vehicles  All of this has been put into the works and we are in the process of building out this system of surveillance in nonphysical fenced areas  areas which will have an electronic fence and a visual capability  But that again costs a lot of money  And so this amendment fully funds the movement in that direction  And that s what we need to do  We need to spend this money  Now  it is a lot of money   3 billion  There s no question about it  But I see it very much as part of the war on terror  as a necessary element to protecting our culture and our society  A country which can t control its borders  which doesn t know who s coming across its borders is a country which is at considerable risk  It s at considerable risk for a lot of reasons  but the primary reason is the threat of terrorism  And we have an obligation to our citizenry to make sure the people coming across our Southern Border  that we know who they are and we know they re coming across legally  I think the American people have grown  and rightly so I m afraid  a little cynical of our efforts along the Southern Border  They see us saying we re going to secure the Southern Border  but they don t see us putting the resources towards accomplishing that  These dollars will complete the debate on the issue of resources  The dollars will be there  Whether the management capability is there  whether the build out capability is there  that s still at issue  I admit that  But at least the dollars will be in the pipeline to accomplish this  So as a practical matter  I think this is a very important step forward  I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina  who has been a leader on this effort for a while  who is obviously a leader on immigration reform and hes backed up his words on immigration reform  which is that the first step to immigration reform is effective border security  And that is true  And that is essential  And he s backed that up with this amendment which puts the dollars in place to accomplish effective border security  And that is a corollary to this whole debate  which is that we do need to significantly overhaul our immigration laws  make them more appropriate to the times and to the situations  but you can t get the public confidence to do immigration reform unless the American people believe at the outset that our border  especially our Southern Border  is secure from people being able to cross willy nilly into this country illegally  These dollars will put in place the resources necessary to accomplish that  to make sure that our Southern Border is essentially secure on the issue of crossings  It may take a couple of years for them to bear fruit because there is not an instant response for the even hiring of agents but the resources will be in the pipeline to accomplish that and the American people can have confidence that will occur  I again congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for his amendment and I m happy to join him as a cosponsor on this amendment and I hope it will be adopted unanimously  or with a large majority  At this point  I yield the floor
