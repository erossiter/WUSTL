 Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg                  Comments on                 Presidential Approval of Deficit Reduction Act                                             WASHINGTON  Senate              Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg  R NH  commented following              his attendance at the White House ceremony at which President Bush            signed the Deficit Reduction Act    Senator Gregg              stated  For the first time in eight years  Congress              has addressed the unsustainable growth of mandatory spending programs               and the impact it will have on future generations  This bill is              a good first step  but we must continue this momentum into this              years budget cycle  I applaud the President              for his leadership on the Deficit Reduction Act  and for submitting a budget              proposal to Congress this year that continues this progress  If we fail to address              the skyrocketing growth of mandatory programs  the retirement of the Baby Boomers              will overwhelm the current system and place an unsustainable financial burden              on future generations  I am hopeful that Congress will continue to address the              growth of entitlements so that we do not pass a tax burden to our children that              robs them of the promise of economic security
