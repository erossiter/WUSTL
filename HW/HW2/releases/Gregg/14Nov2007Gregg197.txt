Senator Gregg Urges Department Of Labor To Expedite Emergency Grant For Worker Asistance Center At Wassau Paper Mill Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  tonight sent a letter to United States Secretary of Labor  Elaine Chao  urging her to expedite the State of New Hampshires application for a Department of Labor National Emergency Grant to provide assistance for displaced workers at the Wassau Paper mill  These funds will be used to help set up a Worker Assistance Center  WAC   which will remain operational beyond the December 31  2007 closure date  The Center will provide career and peer counselors  training courses  workshops  seminars  and job retraining  Additionally  these funds will allow the State to assist all of the workers in Groveton who will be dislocated after December 31  2007  without depleting the States ability to effectively handle other dislocated workers  Full text of the letter is included below  Senator Gregg stated  The announcement that the Wausau Paper mill will close its doors after 114 years is a huge blow to the North Country  The mill is the largest employer for Groveton and the surrounding communities  and its closure will impact over 300 workers and their families  Upon hearing of the States application for this emergency grant  I sent a letter to the Secretary of Labor  urging her to expedite the request for federal aid  This grant will provide critical job training and counseling  and will help workers and their families get back on their feet as soon as possible  My office will to continue to work with state and federal officials to ensure that workers receive the assistance they need during this tough time     The text of the letter follows  Dear Secretary Chao  The State of New Hampshire is applying to the Department of Labor for National Emergency Grant assistance to address the needs of workers facing job dislocation as a result of the Wassau Paper Corporation decision to close its mill in Groveton  New Hampshire  on December 31  2007  I write to ask your immediate attention to the states application and your every consideration for its approval in a timely manner  One of the last mills still producing paper in New Hampshires North Country  the impact of its closure is reverberating beyond the individuals and families directly affected to encompass a region and a workforce whose heritage  skills and dedication have long been tied to the wood and paper industries  In order to be responsive to this widespread impact  it is necessary to establish an on site Worker Assistance Center with the infrastructure and personnel in place to reach and assist over 300 dislocated men and women  their families  and the community as a whole  Funds from a National Emergency Grant will ensure there will be enough counselors  including both career and peer counselors  to provide individual attention through the difficult and stressful days and months ahead and to assist in sorting through the often confusing paperwork  information and decisions workers and families will face  Informational classes  workshops  seminars and job training assistance are all important components of the Department of Labor funding and will provide for effective assistance to workers and for the community to successfully respond to the closure  Due to recent closures of nearby mills  loss of comparable employment opportunities  and scarce employment opportunities in the area which can absorb this number of workers  it will likely be a difficult and lengthy transition before the impacts of the Groveton mill closure are fully addressed  In order that necessary resources are quickly made available to ensure a successful transition in as short of a time as possible  I urge your expedited review and favorable action on the states application
