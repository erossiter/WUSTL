Senator Gregg  Social Security and Medicare Reform Must be Addressed  Contact Betsy holahan 202 224 6011   Jeff Turcotte 202 224 2574   Senator Judd Gregg  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  today commented on the 2007 Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports  both of which show that unfunded government promises are rapidly snowballing  The Medicare Trustees  for the second year in a row  make an excess general revenue funding warning  meaning that Medicare will draw more than 45 percent of its total funding from general revenues within the next six years      Todays reports from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees are yet another red flag that current entitlement spending is not sustainable  said Senator Gregg     The 2007 Medicare Trustees report indicates that long term Medicare unfunded liability for Parts A and B now stand at a combined  24 8 trillion over 75 years  with the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund assets being depleted by 2019  The Social Security Trustees report shows that the Social Security Trust Funds assets are due to be exhausted by 2041  with an unfunded liability of  4 8 trillion over 75 years     The Medicare Trustees second warning will  by law  trigger Congressional action that is already long overdue  said Senator Gregg  Congressional Democratic leadership recently discarded the Presidents recommendation to slow Medicare growth by 1 5 percent in the FY2008 2012 budget resolution  a plan that would not have impacted the vast majority of beneficiaries but would have reduced Medicares long term unfunded obligation by  8 trillion      Under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003  a warning issued for two consecutive years requires that the President propose legislation within 15 days of his next budget to bring Medicare spending under the 45 percent threshold  That legislation is required to receive expedited consideration by Congress     Its time for Congress to stop playing politics with these issues and acting as if they will go away  said Senator Gregg  Todays news is a stark reminder of how serious these problems are  and on behalf of our children and grandchildren  I hope that Congress begins to take action so that we can pass on a government they can afford        Medicare Report   http   www treas gov offices economic policy reports medicare report 2007 pdf    Social Security Report   http   www treas gov offices economic policy reports social security report 2007 pdf   Summary of Reports   http   www treas gov offices economic policy reports summary of reports 2007 pdf
