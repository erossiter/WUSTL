Senator Gregg Supports Stem Cell Legislation Contact Erin Rath   WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement regarding stem cell legislation  He voted in support of S  5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007  and S  30  the Hope Offered Through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act of 2007  tonight     U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  stated  Embryonic stem cell research is an exciting field of biomedical research and offers hope to millions of Americans suffering from a variety of diseases and illnesses  Scientists around the country and throughout the world are moving ahead to uncover the potential of these stem cells  which could reveal the most fundamental biological mechanisms necessary to treat and possibly cure many debilitating conditions  such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease  heart disease  diabetes  paralysis  and stroke     Currently the National Institutes of Health  NIH   the worlds premier biomedical research institution  is funding some of our nations brightest scientific investigators embarking on this innovative field of medical research  The Director of NIH  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  is encouraged by the research that has taken place to date using the federally funded stem cell lines available to scientists under the Presidents policy  and believes that much more can be done with greater access to newly derived and genetically diverse embryonic stem cell lines    At a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing this past March Dr  Zerhouni stated that  Since 2004  I think its very clear from the point of view of science and what I have overseen that these cell lines will not be sufficient to do all the research we need to doSo  from my standpoint  it is clear today that American science would be better served and the nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines   In addition  Dr  Story Landis  Chair of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force and Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke testified before the Senate HELP and Appropriations Subcommittee in January and said  Yes  we are missing out on possible breakthroughsthe cell lines that are eligible for NIH funding now have been shown to have genetic instabilityScientists who are funded by NIH would also like to have access to cell lines that have been derived without the use of feeder cell lines or animal products and  finally  there are a number of cell lines  many cell lines that have been generated since the Presidents policy was put in place that have in them mutations specific to human disease  like Huntingtons and ALS and Parkinsons So  yes  more cell lines would be incredibly important     We should expand this promising area of research  while continuing to closely monitor the taxpayer funded research to ensure that it meets strict ethical standards  At the same time  we should continue to pursue research using adult stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells  which are being used in human treatments today
