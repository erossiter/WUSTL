Senator Gregg Announces Senate Support For New Hampshire Law Enforcement Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that the Senate has approved significant federal funding for two New Hampshire law enforcement initiatives that work to fight illegal drug distribution and violent crime  The measure includes  1 million for the New Hampshire Drug Task Force and  1 million for the Operation Streetsweeper Task Force  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science  Senator Gregg was able to include these funds in the Fiscal Year 2008 Appropriations bill  which now heads to a joint House Senate conference committee before returning to each chamber for final passage  Funding for these projects is included within the Committee allocation set out for Fiscal Year 2008 funding measures  A detailed description of each project is included below  Senator Gregg stated  New Hampshire communities have long been some of the best places to live and raise families  and that is due in large part to the outstanding work of our law enforcement officials  But New Hampshire is not immune to some of the most dangerous and widespread crime trends throughout the country  namely the spread of criminal drug activity and gang violence  We need to make sure that the men and women of New Hampshires law enforcement community  who put their lives on the line every day to protect us  have the tools and resources they need to carry out their duties  These two projects in New Hampshire are exemplary demonstrations of collaborative efforts in law enforcement that are working and truly making a difference  Kelly Ayotte  New Hampshire Attorney General  stated  Senator Gregg has been tireless in his efforts to support law enforcement in New Hampshire and enhance public safety  I want to commend Senator Gregg for his efforts in securing funding to provide additional resources enabling local law enforcement to take drug dealers off the streets and keep the public safe  Senator Gregg has continued to be a staunch supporter of worthwhile and needed programs such as Operation Street Sweeper  Manchester Mayor Frank Guinta said  The safety of our residents is my top priority and it is clear that is also important to Senator Gregg  I will continue to track this important piece of legislation and look forward to working with Senator Gregg on this and other important issues in the future  Colonel Frederick H  Booth  Director of the New Hampshire State Police  stated  The New Hampshire State Police is pleased with the announcement that through the efforts of Senator Judd Gregg  we will receive a  1 million Streetsweeper Grant in the 2008 federal budget  The grant will assist State and local police in further enforcement of drug interdiction  gang activity and other related crimes  Some of these funds will be directed towards the partnership program that was initiated last fall after the killing of Officer Michael Briggs of the Manchester Police Department  The partnership program teamed Troopers from the State Police with Manchester Police Officers in an effort to curb violence in the City by targeting drug dealers and gang activity in the City  The program continues to be very successful in reducing drug activity  gang violence  apprehending wanted felons and removing guns from the street  Without the continued support and commitment of Senator Gregg to law enforcement and the Streetsweeper program  it would be challenging to find the additional funding needed to support these vital programs  Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Bill  New Hampshire Projects Securing Senate Approval New Hampshire Drug Task Force    1 million
