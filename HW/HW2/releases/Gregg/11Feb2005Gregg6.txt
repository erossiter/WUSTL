                               GREGG MIKULSKI INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE                  SOLUTION                 TO H2B                VISA SHORTAGE                                Washington  D C    U S  Senators Judd Gregg  R NH  and Barbara              A  Mikulski  D MD  are working to help businesses who count on              seasonal workers stay afloat by introducing legislation in the              Senate that would address the H2B visa shortage  The  Save Our              Small and Seasonal Businesses Act  would exempt returning seasonal              workers from the national cap of 66 000 people  create new anti fraud              provisions in the visa program  create fair allocation of visas               and create new reporting requirements so Congress can track how            many people return each year through the H2B visa program    For the second year in a row  the H2B visa cap of 66 000 workers              was reached  This year  the cap was reached just a few months into              the fiscal year  beginning October 1   Because companies are not              allowed to apply for workers more than 120 days before they are              needed  many businesses weren t even able to apply for visas this              year because the cap was already reached    These temporary  documented workers are vital for many companies                including seafood processing  landscaping and hospitality companies                to stay in business  In fact  many companies use the H2B visa              program year after year to legally hire temporary and seasonal              workers when American workers are not available    Senator Gregg stated    New Hampshire s economy relies to a great              extent on an influx of seasonal workers in some of our high tourism              areas  as well as our logging community up north  It is important              that these New Hampshire businesses have the manpower they need              to continue to provide outstanding service and products for residents              and visitors alike  Now that many seasonal businesses have been              shut out of the H 2B visa program  Congress must act now so that              they can continue to operate and provide their services and goods               This legislation is targeted at alleviating current shortages and              constraints felt by these New Hampshire businesses  and allowing              them to continue operating throughout the year  Moreover  this              legislation would reward companies and foreign workers that play              by the rules and strengthen our guest worker programs so that they              are more fair to all seasonal employers     Businesses all over the country are facing a crisis   said Senator              Mikulski   American companies desperately need seasonal workers              so their businesses can survive the summer  But the national cap              of H2B visas was reached so early this year that many businesses              were not even allowed to apply  Without these temporary workers               many businesses could be forced to limit services  lay off permanent              U S  workers or  worse yet  close their doors  We can t let this              happen  That s why I m introducing legislation that would provide              a quick fix to the H2B problem and help ensure that our companies              get the workers they need to stay in business   This legislation is a two year temporary fix to solve the immediate              H2B visa shortage  The bill does four things  1 Exempts returning seasonal workers from the cap The bill exempts workers from the 66 000 H2B cap who have already              successfully participated in the H2B Visa Program  These are workers              who have used the H2B program in one of the past three years and              have returned home following their employment with a U S  company               Employers must still go through the H2B process and must still              demonstrate that U S  workers are not available to fill the open              positions   This new system would reward those companies and workers who have              followed the rules and worked hard and successfully participate              in the program  This provides an added advantage to employers who              are able to retain workers who are already trained to do their              seasonal jobs  2 Creates new anti fraud provisions This bill makes sure that the government agencies processing the              H2B visas have the resources they need to detect and prevent fraud               Employers would be required to pay an anti fraud fee of  150 on              each H2B petition  Those fees would be used by the Departments              of State  Homeland Security and Labor to train their employees              to prevent fraud  The bill also creates new sanctions for misrepresenting              facts on a petition for an H2B visa  3 Creates Fair Allocation of Visas This bill creates a visa allocation system that is fair to all              employers  It reserves half of the 66 000 visas for employers needing              workers in the winter and half for those needing workers in the              summer  Dividing when the visas are allocated ensures that   until              a long term solution is reached   employers who use winter labor              and those who use summer labor will have an equal chance of getting              the workers that they need  4 Creates New Reporting Requirements This legislation creates new reporting requirements for the Department              of Homeland Security to ensure that Congress knows how many people              are using the program  how many are returning each year and or              had their visa status revoked or otherwise terminated  This will              help Congress make informed decisions about reforms that need to              be made to the H2B visa program  Sponsors of this legislation include Senators George Allen  R VA                Lincoln Chafee  R RI   Susan Collins  R ME   Mark Dayton  D MN
