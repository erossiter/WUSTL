Senate Approves Border Security Amendment Co Authored By Senator Gregg Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON Today  the Senate overwhelming passed an amendment to increase border security originally authored by U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   This amendment  approved by a 95 to 1 vote  provides  3 billion in emergency funding to help achieve and maintain operational control over the U S  Mexico border  The funding will be used for the hiring and training of additional border agents  deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  installation of additional ground based sensors  cameras  and vehicle barriers  and building the 700 miles of border fencing required under the Secure Fence Act of 2006  The amendment boosts enforcement of our immigration laws at the worksite by providing substantial funds for improved employment eligibility verification  as well as increased detention and removal of those who are here illegally  The amendment has been accepted to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill currently being debated by the full Senate  Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  stated  I am pleased the Senate has approved an amendment coauthored by myself and Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina to increase funding for border security by  3 billion dollars under an emergency designation  I believe strongly that you have to have a border that is secure  where people cannot illegally cross the border in droves  In order to accomplish that  you have to have the sufficient resources on the border  enough border agents  enough detention beds  and the money to build a fence  both real and virtual using electronics  In order to accomplish this  it takes resources  and this  3 billion will accomplish that and will help fully fund an operationally secure border  That is the first step to effective immigration reform  having a border that we know is secure  where we know that the people coming into the country are coming in legally and not illegally  especially along the Southern Border  I was happy to support this amendment  It is a step forward in the right direction and ensures that we have the resources to accomplish this  Now we have to execute and put those resources in place effectively to make sure that we do get a secure border
