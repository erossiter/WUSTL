                               GREGG HOLDS HEARING TO EXAMINE FBI INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM            PROGRESS                Senator              Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee              on Commerce  Justice  and State  the Judiciary and Related Agencies          Opening Statement  Director Mueller  we very much appreciate you coming            here today  and we congratulate you for the successes you have had             Last March  I congratulated you because America had not been attacked            in the 2  years following 9 11  Now  I can offer those same            congratulations  but increase the number of years that America has            not been attacked to three plus years  That is an impressive record            and a lot of it is due to the efforts of the FBI  the Bureau s counterterrorism            capabilities and your focus on this issue   We also appreciate your successes with Trilogy  the FBI s technology            modernization program  So far  Trilogy has brought to the FBI  22 000            work stations  3 400 printers  1 400 scanners  475 servers and 2 6000            fast Ethernet local area network ports to all FBI locations  But            we do have concerns with Trilogy  which I know that you are familiar            with and which will be the focus of this hearing    Trilogy is already  200 million over budget  and while we have the hardware  and the networks in place  we still do not have a modernized case management  system  six months after the original delivery date for that system of June  2004    Based on the Inspector General s audit of Trilogy and the Aerospace            Corporation s more specific review of the Virtual Case File software             it seems like we aren t close to getting one    My disappointment with the extreme waste of taxpayer dollars  over             100 million  is surpassed only by my frustration over the fact that            we now do not know when the FBI will have this critical case management            system in place   We are concerned about the delay and the impact it will have on            the FBI s personnel and the FBI s mission  No doubt  there is plenty            of blame to go around and hopefully many lessons learned  some of            which I plan to discuss today  However  the underlying problem remains             the FBI does not have a modernized case management system  What matters            now  though  is where we go from here  how we get there and whether          there is a plan for the future
