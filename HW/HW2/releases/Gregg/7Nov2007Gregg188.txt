Senator Gregg Comments On Need To Ensure Safety Of Drug Imports Contact Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon   WASHINGTON   A member of the Senate  Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today called for renewed attention to securing the nations drug supply in the wake of an Import Safety Action Plan presented to President Bush this week by the Interagency Working Group on Import Safety  Noting that the working groups 50 step action plan contained broad recommendations for better protecting American consumers by improving the safety of imports entering the United States  Gregg drew attention to the need for a comprehensive approach regarding drug imports  including increased regulation for the sale of prescription drugs over the Internet  The working group recommendations released by the President this week reminds us of the challenges we face in securing the U S  food and drug supply  said Gregg  As Congress reviews the Import Working Groups recommendations  we should not miss the opportunity to examine all aspects of our nations drug supply in a comprehensive manner  Chief among these is the unregulated world of Internet pharmacies that  without reform of current practices and procedures  could potentially pose great health risks to consumers who may unknowingly buy prescription medicines from an unlawful and unregulated source  Earlier this year  I introduced the Safe Internet Pharmacy Act of 2007 to address these problems in order to protect American consumers from rogue pharmacies and to ensure that products offered online were in accordance with state and federal laws  Gregg also expressed concerns over a recent U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  investigation into drugs mailed to the United States from foreign countries that suggests consumers may be by passing their physicians and buying drugs online without a valid prescription   The investigation found that consumers may needlessly be putting themselves at risk in pursuit of less expensive medicines by purchasing prescription drugs from unregulated internet pharmacies without the expertise and care of their physician  More than half  or 53 percent  of the products sampled by FDA have FDA approved generic versions available in the U S   and 47 percent were available at national chain pharmacies for  4  Im concerned by the findings of the FDA investigation that shows American consumers are needlessly risking their safety and health by buying unregulated medicines from Internet companies that may  or may not be  legitimate  stated Sen  Gregg  My legislation on Internet pharmacies will help restore confidence and increase the safety in the purchasing process by requiring online pharmacies to register with the FDA and have these legitimate sites be designated by the FDA seal of approval so consumers know they can trust the products they receive  As importantly  this report further underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to regulating internet pharmacies  Patients do not need to accept lower safety standards for lower costs  Background  The Safe Internet Pharmacy Act of 2007 Problem  Unsafe Internet pharmacies   Most Internet pharmacies are legitimate businesses that offer convenient services in accordance with state and federal law  however an increasing number of Internet pharmacies operate unlawfully and at serious risk to consumers  Estimates of the number of Internet pharmacies operating in the U S  have reached as high as 1 400  but under current law it is virtually impossible to identify and prosecute those that violate the law    Many dispense unapproved or counterfeit versions of FDA approved drugs in violation on the FDCA    Many dispense prescription drugs and controlled substances without a valid prescription     Many do not protect consumers private medical information as required by HIPAA regulations    Many do not provide adequate identification information on their websites and appear online one day and disappear the next  Consumers have no way of determining whether or not the Internet pharmacy is in compliance with state and federal law    Solution  The Safe Internet Pharmacy Act of 2007    Requires all internet pharmacies that dispense a prescription drug in the U S  be licensed by the FDA    Requires Internet pharmacies located outside the U S  to maintain an agent in the U S  for service of process and be subject to the jurisdiction of the U S  and every state in which it does business    Requires contact information to be listed for each place of business  pharmacist  or health care practitioner in all states or countries where they are authorized to dispense prescription drugs    Requires a visible and distinctive tamper resistance seal on the website to confirm that the Internet pharmacy is licensed by the FDA     Ensures confidentiality of patient information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996    Requires that the Secretary keep an up to date searchable database of licensees available to the public by an Internet website    Requires the establishment of policies and procedures designed to prevent or block payment for restricted transactions  U S  district courts shall have jurisdiction to order an interactive computer service to remove or disable links to an unlawful Internet pharmacy
