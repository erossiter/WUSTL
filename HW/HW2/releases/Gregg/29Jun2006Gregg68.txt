 Senate Committee Seeks to Close Oil Lease Loophole               and Recoup Billions of Dollars                Washington               DC  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved an              amendment by U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Judd              Gregg  R N H   to help the federal government recoup billions of              dollars in lost oil lease royalties   The proposal was approved as an amendment to the FY 2007 Interior              Appropriations Bill by a 15 13 vote  It would require that companies              interested in bidding on new oil or natural gas drilling leases              on the Outer Continental Shelf must agree to renegotiate their              existing contracts on which they are paying no royalty payments              as a result of a government error in 1998 99   An administrative error that has allowed oil and gas companies              to drill in federal waters for free despite record profits has              cost the national treasury billions of dollars  Senator              Feinstein said  President Bush and energy executives agreeat              current high prices  companies dont actually need these              additional incentives to drill  The amendment approved today in              Committee incentivizes oil and gas companies to renegotiate their              leases and end these unnecessary federal handouts  Taxpayers              should no longer be forced to bear the burden of  10 billion in lost revenue              because of this clerical omission   Senator Gregg said  With the price of oil at over  70              per barrel and with oil companies making such massive profits               it is inappropriate for them to drill in federal waters under certain              leases without paying royalties like everyone else  While this              is due to an administrative error that occurred almost a decade              ago  it is now costing the federal government billions of dollars               Some oil and gas companies are now in court trying to challenge              contracts and stop paying royalties on even more leases  This is              outrageous  and Congress must stop this massive fleecing of the              American taxpayer  This bipartisan amendment is an appropriate              way to encourage oil and gas companies to renegotiate their leases              and pay the royalties that many of my Senate colleagues agree should              be paid  I hope that todays successful vote on our amendment              shows that Congress is dead serious on making sure that this happens   Specifically  the amendment would bar the Secretary of the Interior              from using any funds to issue new oil or natural gas production              leases for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf to any person              who holds an OCS oil and gas production lease but does not pay              royalties on oil produced from the lease  based on price thresholds              as determined by the Secretary of Interior                Essentially  the amendment provides energy companies with a choice                 They can keep their existing leases royalty free if they so choose               but be barred from bidding on new contracts  or                They can agree to renegotiate these leases in good faith and be              able to participate in the bidding for new leases   The amendment is similar to one that widely passed the House              of Representatives by a vote of 252 165  The House measure was              introduced by Representative Maurice Hinchey  D N Y   and amended              by Jack Kingston  R Ga     Background               In 1995  Congress passed the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act  which              granted a royalty holiday to oil and gas companies              drilling in deep waters for leases sold between 1996 and 2000               The measure reduced the amount of royalties that companies had              to pay for drilling in American waters in the Gulf of Mexico  At              the time  gas prices were fairly low  and the move was seen by              many as an incentive to get petroleum companies to drill for oil              and natural gas and keep energy production inside the United States   In 1998 and 1999  the federal government issued              a series of leases to oil and gas companies that did not include              price thresholds  According to the Interior Department  there are              576 active oil and natural gas leases that the Department of Interior              signed during this period  It is estimated that this omission will              cost taxpayers as much as  10 billion over the next 25 years    On November 9  2005  the CEOs of the five largest              energy companies testified before a joint Senate Committee hearing               In response to the question posed by Senator Wyden  Is the President wrong              when he says we dont need incentives for oil and gas exploration  every              single one of the CEOs said No
