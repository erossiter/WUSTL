Senator Gregg Lauds Passage Of Energy Bill Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today lauded passage of HR 6  the Renewable Fuels  Consumer Protection  and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007  Senator Gregg joined 85 of his colleagues in approving this measure  which passed the Senate by a vote of 86 8 and now heads back to the House of Representatives  Senator Gregg stated  Our nation faces a severe energy crisis forcing families to trim their budgets in order to pay for skyrocketing energy bills and rising prices at the gas pump  Our dependence on foreign sources of oil also poses a serious risk to our national security  It was critical that we work together in a bipartisan manner to finalize an energy bill that addresses the growing energy crisis and develops responsible policies that place a greater emphasis on energy conservation  develops environmentally friendly renewable energy sources  and reduces our dependence on foreign oil  The energy bill brought before the Senate today contains a number of initiatives which will improve our nations energy policy  Although I would have preferred higher fuel economy standards  I support the bills increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards for motor vehicles  This is the first increase in CAFE standards in three decades  I also support the legislations efforts to encourage conservation by requiring the use of more efficient technologies in everything from buildings and lighting to home appliances   I applaud my colleagues in the House and Senate for working together in a bipartisan manner to pass a comprehensive bill that will significantly improve our nations energy policy  Like others  I believe this bill could have been stronger  By working across the aisle  however  we now have a bill that can be signed into law  will reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil  and can help reduce energy prices by lowering demand
