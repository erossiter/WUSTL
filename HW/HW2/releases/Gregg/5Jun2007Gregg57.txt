Senators Gregg and Clinton Introduce Bill to Harness Medicare Data to Reduce Health Care Costs and Improve Quality Contact Erin Rath  WASHINGTON  U S  Senators Judd Gregg  R NH  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  today introduced the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act to improve health care quality and reduce costs  The bill allows highly qualified experts and organizations to access and analyze Medicare data to determine ways to lower overall health care costs while improving quality of care  The federal government is sitting on a treasure trove of information that can be used to dramatically improve health care quality while making it more affordable for all Americans  said Senator Gregg  Businesses and health insurance plans in the private sector already utilize their own data to compare and examine the cost and effectiveness of the care their workers and beneficiaries are receiving  This bill expands that research effort by allowing highly qualified organizations to access Medicare data to determine more effective health care solutions while making it more affordable while placing a premium on the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries  The bill authorizes the release of Medicare data to highly qualified organizations  known as Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations  MQRO   to analyze and develop reports on the cost and quality of health care while including necessary safeguards to protect patient privacy  These reports can be requested by private sector organizations to measure health care quality and costs in a community  which will be released to the public   In every instance Medicare beneficiary privacy is ensured by requiring MQROs to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Privacy Act  To further ensure beneficiary protection  the bill also requires a privacy review by the Department of Health and Human Services of any analytical report prepared by an MQRO prior to its release  Any reports or results derived from this data must be released to the public within one year        Medicare Quality Enhancement Act of 2007 Short Summary  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act  MQEA  seeks to improve U S  health care by providing qualified private sector organizations access to Medicare data for the development and release of reports on the quality  cost  efficiency and effectiveness of our health care

On behalf of AARPs more than 38 million members  we would like to offer our support for MQEA  Importantly  your bill would create unprecedented access to physician specific data that is essential for identifying low quality and inefficient practice patterns  Greater transparency of provider quality is a critical building block in efforts to reform our highly inefficient and increasingly unaffordable health care system  American Association of Retired People  AARP   June 5  2007   etna strongly supports the MQEA  We believe that quality care  efficiency  and cost savings will result from this legislation  and Aetna urges the prompt consideration and passage of this bill  Aetna  June 5  2007    The American Nurses Association applauds your efforts to provide enhanced access data to Medicare data in order to improve the quality and efficiency of health care services  Americas nurses have long supported evidence based efforts to improve patient care  The collection and dissemination of health care data is essential to those efforts  American Nurses Association  June 5  2007    This bill marks an important step forward to provide consumers  providers  plans and purchasers with actionable information on the cost and quality of health care service in their communities  Health care is the leading cost pressure for Business Roundtable companies  In order to lower costs and improve quality  we need greater and more accurate information  Business Roundtable  June 5  2007     We  applaud the bipartisan leadership of Senators Clinton and Gregg in introducing the MQEA  The legislation would give consumers badly needed information about the cost and quality of care delivered  It is critical that Medicares abundance of data be made available to aid private efforts that are underway to improve quality and lower costs  Corporate Health Care Coalition  June 5  2007    Using the data of one of the largest government payers of health care is a common sense way to help improve health care outcomes and lower costs  This information will greatly help employers and consumers to identify providers that deliver the highest quality care  HR Policy Association  June 5  2007    Women need good  reliable information about the quality of their health care providers in order to make informed decisions about care for themselves and their families  But today there is little data available for consumers to use to assess health care quality   This bill  is an important step forward in the effort to gain greater access to reliable data on provider performance  National Partnership for Women and Families  June 5  2007   We need every possible tool to help drive development of a value based health care system  The Gregg Clinton bill will help harness Medicare data to help consumers of all ages find the best quality and most affordable health care  We strongly support this bipartisan effort  National Retail Federation  June 5  2007   This thoughtfully crafted bipartisan bill would enable American workers  retirees  purchasers and their health plans to reduce near term health care spending by up to ten percent and to much better recognize and reward physician excellence in quality of care  Mercer Human Resource Consulting  June 5  2007   Despite all of our knowledge and technology  studies suggest that Medicare beneficiaries dont always receive treatments that have been proven effective  and they often get care that is inappropriate or of unproven value  As the largest purchaser of health care  Medicare should use the enormous amount of data it collects to drive quality improvements and better performance from our entire health care system  In short  we need to use this data to create a health care system that is continuously learning and improving  Service Employees International Union  SEIU   June 5  2007
