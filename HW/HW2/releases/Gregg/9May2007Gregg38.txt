Senator Gregg  s Drug Safety Surveillance Provision Included in FDA Reform Bill   Contact Erin Rath Jeff Turcotte  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   a member of the Senate Health  Labor  Education  and Pensions Committee  today applauded passage of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act approved by the Senate  with Senator Greggs support  earlier today  Senator Greggs language  based on S  1024  the Safer DATA Act he introduced earlier this year  was included in the final bill  It puts drug safety data surveillance at the center of the FDAs efforts to monitor and improve the safety of our nations drug supply  The language pools existing data and technology to establish an active post market surveillance system to identify risks that may need further action or study  The HELP Committee passed the FDA reform bill on April 18  This bill puts science at the center of drug safety  stated Senator Gregg  It is critical that the FDA have a tool that allows them to collect and analyze the safety of prescription drugs after they are brought to market   In addition to the Safer DATA language  the measure includes language Senator Gregg offered during the HELP Committee mark up to clarify that the FDA may only require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS  when informed by scientific information  such as the data collected and analyzed by the surveillance system  The final bill also includes language Senator Gregg authored to provide an emergency exemption for bioterror countermeasures from the provisions in the bill that limit a physicians ability to prescribe medicine to their patients in the event of a public health emergency  In a time of a bioterrorism crisis  medical professionals and first responders must have the resources they need to treat patients effectively and to prevent the spread of any bioterror agent  Previous versions of this bill included language that prevented physicians from exercising their training and discretion in treating their patients during a bioterror event  I am pleased my language has been included which removes these roadblocks and allows medical professionals to do what they do best  treat their patients  Significant improvements have been made to this measure since it was passed by the HELP Committee last month  This bill makes already effective programs stronger and will ultimately benefit the thousands of Americans who rely on these programs to make their lives better  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to make further improvements as this bill progresses
