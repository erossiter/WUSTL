                               GREGG CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO                  POTENTIAL GAS PRICE GOUGING                                  WASHINGTON                 U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations              Subcommittee on Homeland Security  today sent a request to the              head of the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation              into whether gasoline producers  wholesalers  or retailers have              engaged in price gouging or other market manipulation in the wake              of Hurricane Katrina s devastation in the Gulf Coast region    In a letter to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission               Senator Gregg stated   As you know  Hurricane Katrina has had a              major impact on our nation s gasoline markets  disrupting oil production               gasoline pipelines  and refineries in the Gulf Coast region  I              recognize that this unprecedented natural disaster came on the              heels of an already steady climb in gasoline prices due to increasing              global demand  restricted refinery capacity  and other factors               However  reports of nearly immediate  massive increases in gasoline              retail prices in the days following Katrina  including in markets              that are less reliant on the Gulf Coast region for gasoline supplies               are troubling  As many oil companies have reported record profits               as consumers have seen their gas prices nearly double  there is              growing concern inflated prices are translating to inflated profits               These price increases not only have hurt constituents in my state              who need their motor vehicles to go to work and carry out daily              activities  but they also have caused increased hardship for gasoline              consumers in other parts of the country  especially those in the              Gulf Coast region who already are struggling to recover from Katrina s            devastation                 I realize that the prosecution of price gouging is generally                  left to the States unless it involves some form of collusion                  or other acts prohibited by federal    antitrust laws  Nevertheless  under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Congress    already has given the FTC the responsibility to review pricing practices                  in the gasoline market  Moreover  the FTC has both the expertise                  and the resources    to carry out such an investigation and provide a comprehensive nationwide                  review for Congress  As such  I request that the FTC examine                  whether gasoline producers     wholesalers  or retailers are engaged in any price gouging or other market    manipulation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina s landfall  I also would urge    that this investigation be carried out in a timely manner so that Congress    can have the information needed in an expeditious manner
