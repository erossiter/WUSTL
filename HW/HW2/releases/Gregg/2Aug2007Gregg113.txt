Senator Gregg Comments On Passage Of SCHIP Reauthorization Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement upon Senate passage of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program reauthorization     Senator Gregg stated  It is essential that the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  be reauthorized to ensure that more low income children get health insurance  Unfortunately  the legislation as prepared by my Democratic colleagues in the Senate sets a dangerous precedent for the direction of our nations healthcare and the reauthorization of this important program  I do not support a plan which radically expands the SCHIP program into a new  larger entitlement for adults and higher income people  which takes people who already have health insurance and puts them on a public program  which moves us in the direction towards single payer  nationalized healthcare  and which includes budgetary gimmicks that hide the true cost of the program and further burdens our childrens future   SCHIP should be focused on providing children of low economic means with the assistance they need to get health insurance  and on those children who do not have insurance already  There is no reason to take people off of private insurance and put them on publicly funded insurance  However  under the Senate bill  2 3 million of the 4 5 million children who join SCHIP already have health coverage  Under the Senate bill  the cost to the taxpayer per child of providing health care will be an astounding  3 950  In comparison  the average cost of insuring a child for one year is  1 130 in the private sector  Why the taxpayers should have to pick up the higher cost of insurance is not clear  Likewise  the House proposal is a massive spending increase in entitlement spending that more than doubles the Senate bill with  81 billion in new spending over five years in SCHIP  Medicare and Medicaid programs  More importantly  it pits seniors against children by slashing nearly  200 billion from Medicare to pay for this expansion by cutting reimbursements to everything from hospitals and nursing homes to Medicare Advantage plans  impacting the neediest seniors to expand SCHIP into the middle class and to non citizens  The true purpose of this expensive expansion of the SCHIP program was stated by Senator Max Baucus  D MT   the Democratic Chairman of the Finance Committee  when he said Were the only country in the industrialized world that does not have universal coverage  I think the Childrens Health Insurance Program is another step to move toward universal coverage   Everyone realizes that the goal of this legislation moves us a giant step further down the road to nationalizing healthcare  which would result in a drop in quality and in rationing     Not only does the Senate bill take a giant leap towards nationalizing the health care system  crowding out the private market and raising costs due to a lack of competition  but it promotes the misuse of this federal program to cover adults  The bill hides the true  110 billion price tag with a budgetary gimmick  There is  40 billion in spending that is not paid for  This will have an enormous impact on those who will have to pay for it  our children  The alternative proposal  which I supported  would have aided 1 3 million kids and was completely paid for without budgetary gimmicks  Our proposal did not move kids with existing private insurance onto the federal programs  We should not be saddling future generations  the very children this program purports to care for  with the type of unfunded mandate created by this liberal proposal
