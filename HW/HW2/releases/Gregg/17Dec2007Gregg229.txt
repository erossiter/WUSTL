Appropriations Committee allocations for FY08 spending measures  A detailed description of each project is included below     The House is expected to vote as early as tonight on the omnibus package that contains 11 out of the 12 annual spending measures  the Senate will likely debate the measure later this week  If passed by both chambers  the legislation will then be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  Senator Gregg stated  More than 1 500 New Hampshire National Guard members have served in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom  These Granite State mothers  fathers  sons  and daughters are among our nations finest patriots and deserve our full support  The new facility at Pease will assist them in performing their vital missions safely and effectively  Gregg added  The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is not in the news as much these days as it was during the tough BRAC year of 2005  but  nevertheless  Senator Sununu and I continue to work very hard to ensure that Portsmouth  the best public shipyard of all  receives the appropriate workload and infrastructure improvements needed to help maintain its well deserved reputation  Gregg continued  Though the Democratic Leadership has pushed this years appropriations process into the 11th hour  it is important to note that Republicans efforts to control spending were successful and forced the elimination of  18 billion in new spending  I am pleased my colleagues were able to reach across the aisle and come up with an omnibus package which is more in line with the budget request and still includes funding for important New Hampshire initiatives  Senator Sununu stated  In New Hampshire  New England  and across the country  military facility personnel are hard at work helping to keep our armed forces strong  That is why the men and women at Pease Air National Guard base and military and civilian personnel at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard deserve resources to help them continue their vital support missions  At Pease  the Wings leaders have identified a new Operations and Training Facility as mission critical and the states top military construction project  while at the Shipyard  a state of the art dry dock facility will further increase efficiency at the Navys most efficient yard  These initiatives  in addition to constructing a new consolidated Emergency Control Center at the Shipyard  represent a sound investment in support of our military  MG Ken Clark  New Hampshire National Guard Adjutant General  stated  Since the closure of Pease in 1991  the NH Air National Guard has been seeking to complete the consolidation of facilities at Pease to a single piece of land that can be properly secured  With the nation s increased emphasis on security and the recent uncovering of terrorist plans to attack US bases  this is indeed good news for the 157th Air Refueling Wing    8 9 million for NH Air National Guard   These funds will allow for construction of a new Wing Headquarters Operations and Training Facility at Pease Air National Guard Base  The building will be used to accommodate the functions of command  financial management  personnel support  recruiting  education  training  family support  chaplains  legal staff  public affairs  safety and environmental management  The site will include a 250 person auditorium and Base Exchange  The present Wing Headquarters building  which is 1954 construction  has exceeded its useful life  has inadequate mechanical and electrical systems  and fails to meet minimum Anti Terrorism Force Protection requirements  Americans with Disabilities Act requirements  and other facilities requirements   9 7 million for Consolidated Emergency Control Center at PNSY   These funds will allow construction of a new Consolidated Emergency Control Center at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  This facility will allow for the consolidation of all shipyard emergency response organizations to one centralized location  It will provide the emergency response team with the ability to communicate with a large network of local  state  and federal organizations to effectively respond to emergencies   1 2 million for Waterfront Support Facility at PNSY   These funds will allow for the planning and design of a Waterfront Support Facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  The funds will be used for design and planning studies of a modern  state of the art production facility to be utilized in support of upcoming Virginia class submarine depot availabilities
