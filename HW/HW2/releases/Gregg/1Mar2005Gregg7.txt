                          SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE REVIEWS DEFENSE BUDGET    WASHINGTON Members of the Senate Budget Committee today heard              testimony from the Department of Defense regarding their FY06 budget            request   The President s FY06 budget includes  419 3 billion in defense            discretionary spending  a 4 8 percent increase over FY05    Paul Wolfowitz  Deputy Secretary of Defense said   This budget              addresses our country s need to fight the war on terror  to support              our men and women in uniform  and to meet the threats of the 21st              Century  It reflects difficult choices to ensure sufficient funding              for our most pressing requirements  Those difficult choices and              our proposed transformation of the business of defense underscore              our resolve to be wise in the spending of taxpayer dollars    Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg today said he intends to include              a reserve fund for the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in              the budget resolution    Gregg said   These are not expenditures that will go on forever               in fact  we hope these expenditures will be shortened in their              time horizon  and hopefully no more than two or three more years               Therefore I do not believe these dollars we are spending in Iraq              or Afghanistan should be built into the defense base  and it would              be a major budget error if we were to do that    Wolfowitz said   When you have unpredictable emergency expenditures               it is wise to do it through a supplemental  Making some kind of              provision in overall budgeting for the fact that there is going              to be a requirement for U S  fiscal resources over and above what              we requested for this year makes sense     Last year  the Senate passed a budget that included a  30 billion war reserve  fund  That amount was raised to  50 billion during conference negotiations  with the House     Defense accounts represent the most significant item in discretionary              spending within the budget   one that it is clearly critical with              respect to where we are going as a nation and how we maintain our              strength as a nation   Chairman Gregg said    Recent action in Syria and Palestine also tell us that the awakening              voices of democracy in those regions are occurring  and that those              in that region are able to pursue it without being stifled by terrorists              that are despotic  How we are going to sustain our commitment to              the defense initiative as we restructure the core structure of              how we meet the threat of terrorism and the long term costs of              this reallocation of resources as we move forward are all critical              funding issues and ones that must be addressed   Gregg said
