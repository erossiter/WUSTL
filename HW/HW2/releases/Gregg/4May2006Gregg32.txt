                               GREGG APPLAUDS INTRODUCTION OF                  COMPREHENSIVE                  MEDICAL LIABILITY BILLS                WASHINGTONU S               Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   former Chairman and current member of              the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  today              applauded the introduction of two medical liability reform measures              that will increase access to health care by halting the trend of              doctors leaving their practices due to the high cost of medical              liability insurance  causing patients to travel great distances              to see doctors  or go without care   Senator Gregg is an              original cosponsor of both measures  S 22  the Medical Access Protection              Act introduced by Senator John Ensign  R NV   and S  23  the Healthy              Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act introduced by Senator              Rick Santorum  R PA   Next              week the Senate is going to take up my bill to give women  especially              women who are having children  better access to doctors  stated              Senator Gregg  In New Hampshire  we have a serious problem                 there simply arent enough OB GYNs  and in fact in parts              of the state they are no people who are practicing baby doctors               We are finding that women who need to see doctors cannot see them              or have very little choice in the doctors they can see because              of the limited amount of people who are practicing the specialty  The              reason that is happening is because doctors cant afford              to practice as OB GYNs because of the high cost of malpractice              insurance  driven by the excessive cost of lawsuits  This              bill will limit  to some degree  the amount of recovery that can              occur under a lawsuit  It doesnt limit recovery for              cost or for medical cost and for compensation or for lost wages               But it does limit the excessiveness non compensation type of damages               As a result  it will allow more doctors to get in the business              of caring for women who want to have children especially  This              type of law has worked in places like Texas and I am hopeful the              Senate will pass this type of law next week  although it is an              uphill fight as the influence of the trial lawyers is so extreme               especially on the Democratic side of the aisle   New              Hampshire doctors have felt the full effect of this harsh trend               From 2003 to 2004  physicians in our state have faced double digit              premium increases  The current annual premium for some physicians              in New Hampshire is  84 000  and these types of premiums have left              residents with only two neurosurgeons in the Concord Manchester              area and one OB GYN in all of Coos County  A lack of OB GYNs in              the North Country is a serious health concern for mothers who may              have to drive across Coos County to receive care  Two              years ago  I met with several obstetricians and gynecologists from              across New Hampshire at Concord Hospital to hear their stories               and things have only gotten worse for patients in our state since              that time  Dr  Patricia Miller of Derry was a solo practitioner              for 15 years  delivering 8 10 babies a month  about 100 per year              for mothers in southern New Hampshire who stopped delivering babies              in December 2003 because of increased medical liability insurance              premiums  Dr  Krishna Das closed her northern New Hampshire              OB practice because of skyrocketing medical liability costs and              moved out of state   This              trend of doctors leaving entire regions of our nation uncovered               or leaving their practice or the practice of medicine altogether               has reached a crisis stage  American scientists and physicians              have made great medical breakthroughs and provide the best medical              care in the world  Congress needs to act now to be sure that              care is available to patients in all parts of our nation  I am              hopeful these two bills will allow proper and fair justice to be              served while stopping trial lawyers from using doctors as their              personal ATM machines  allowing critical health care providers              back into regions they current cannot afford  Palmer              Jones  Executive Vice President of the New Hampshire Medical Society               stated  Passing this legislation would significantly improve              access to care in New Hampshire  especially for women seeking care              from OB GYNs and other professionals   In              2005  Senator Gregg joined U S  Senator John Ensign  R NV  in introducing              S  354  the Help Efficient  Accessible  Low Cost  Timely Health              Care  HEALTH  Act of 2005  a comprehensive medical liability reform              bill  as well as S  366 and S  367  two bills targeting medical              liability reform bill targeted at obstetrics gynecology and trauma              care  All three bills would improve access to care by addressing              the soaring costs of medical liability insurance   Last              week  Senator Gregg joined hundreds of osteopathic physicians               residents and students  as well as Senate Majority Leader Bill              Frist  R TN  and several other Senate colleagues at a Capitol Hill              press conference to urge Congress to pass comprehensive medical              liability reform      AUDIO AVAILABLE  1 800 545 1267  mailbox                332
