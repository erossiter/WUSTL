most spectacular environmental areas in this country and              it is our responsibility to protect these natural resources so              that our children and grandchildren are able to appreciate them              just as we have  The efforts underway do not just protect sensitive              lands and waterways here in the Granite State  These awards are              a testament to the hard work of dedicated groups and individuals              at the local level whose efforts will ensure that these areas are              protected for generations of New Hampshire residents and visitors              to enjoy   Senator Sununu stated  This funding will help ensure that              critical environmental conservation initiatives in the North Country              are able to move forward  Protecting the diverse habitats  forestlands               and natural resources within the Lake Umbagog National Wildlife              Refuge and the Silvio Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge is              both an economic and recreational priority  Moreover  resources              for the Northern Forest Partnership and the Northern States Research              Cooperative will provide valuable knowledge to protect forests              and lands for current and future generations  Local  state  and              federal officials  working alongside conservationists  are              to be commended for their cooperative effort to preserve this special              part of our state   David Sleeper  Executive Director  Hubbard Brook Research Foundation               stated  We are thrilled to hear that Senators Gregg and              Sununu have worked to secure funds in next years EPA appropriations              bill for the New Hampshire Mercury Monitoring Project  The project              will analyze mercury levels in stream and lake water  in lake sediments               and in songbirds  salamanders  and other organisms  drawing heavily              on the world famous Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study  Measurements              at Hubbard Brook will be used as a base line for samples taken              in two mercury hot spots in New Hampshire and in              other key areas throughout the state  A team of scientists will              share the results of their mercury studies with policymakers  land              managers  business leaders  and other members of the public  In              this way sound ecosystem science can be brought to bear on a vexing              environmental problem   Dr  Charles T  Driscoll  University Professor of Environmental              Systems Engineering at Syracuse University  Team Leader  Hubbard              Brook Research Foundations Mercury Science Links Project              stated  I am delighted that Senators Gregg and Sununu are              including funding for the Hubbard Brook Research Foundations              New Hampshire Mercury Monitoring Project in the Environmental Protection              Agencys 2007 appropriations bill  Elevated inputs of mercury              from atmospheric deposition have contributed to the widespread              contamination of mercury in fish tissue  a critical water quality              problem in New Hampshire and throughout the United States  Recent              research shows that two of five biological mercury hot spots in              eastern North America are located in the state  The new mercury              monitoring program in New Hampshire will create vital new sources              of information about mercury that will be shared widely with the              scientific and policymaking communities  We hope that New Hampshire              will help lead the way to national mercury legislation to monitor              this dangerous pollutant   Senators Gregg and Sununu have once again demonstrated              their leadership and commitment to protecting critical habitat              resources in New Hampshire by including federal funding for the              Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge  said Dennis Shaffer               Northern New England Field Office Director  This is an important              step for the refuge to conserve important wetland  riparian  and              boreal forest resources for the native and migratory wildlife that              depend on these critical habitats   Conservation of the Connecticut River watershed is one              of our highest priorities in New England  said Daryl Burtnett               state director of The Nature Conservancy in New Hampshire  Senators              Gregg and Sununu understand the urgency and challenges of this              work  They know that land protection  guided by science and supported              by local communities  can make a real  lasting impact on conservation              for many generations to come  We applaud our Senators efforts   New Hampshire Audubon Interim President Bruce Schwaegler is delighted              with the appropriations  New Hampshire Audubon has strong              ties to many of the tracts that make up the Silvio O  Conte National              Wildlife Refuge and supports strongly the watershed approach towards              conserving the Connecticut River  We also applaud the funding of              the Lake Umbagog land protection initiatives which will ensure              continued resource protection for this jewel in northern New England              and build on a series of significant federal investments in the              refuge in recent years  added Schwaegler    Steve Blackmer  President of the Northern Forest Center  stated  The              Northern Forest region of Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont and New              York faces significant challenges due to major changes in the regions              economy  Many communities are struggling with decline  and yet              people in all four states have ideas for how to build their forest based              communities and economy               Funding from the Northern Forest Partnership Program has enabled              public agencies  educators  non profit organizations and businesses              to invest in their communities and their future  A  400 000 appropriation              results in an enormous investment in the rural communities of the              Northern Forest  Every grant is matched dollar for dollar  or better               from non federal sources               The Northern Forest Center is grateful to Senators Gregg and Sununu              and the Senate Appropriations Committee for their continued support              of the Northern Forest region through the Northern Forest Partnership              Program  Fiscal

Columbia Colebrook               The Pondicherry division was recently designated as the first Important              Bird Area in NH  It supports 230 species of birds and harbors a              greater diversity of birds than any other similarly sized areas              in NH  Species include the loon and  American black duck  The Nature              Conservancy and NH Audubon have partnered with the US Fish and              Wildlife Service to complete 5 land protection projects that have              added more than 1 400 acres of critical habitat to Pondicherry               The appropriated funds will be used to continue these land acquisition              efforts in the refuge  Last year  1 million in federal funds was              secured through the Interior Appropriations bill for the Conte              Refuge for a total of more than  10 4 million since Fiscal Year              1998  Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge   1 million  In              partnership with the State of New Hampshire  Trust for Public Land              and NH Audubon  the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service has established              a land acquisition program at Lake Umbagog  The Refuge contains              Lake Umbagog  with 8 700 acres of open water  miles of shoreline               protected coves and backwaters  It contains unique habitats for              the bald eagle and peregrine falcon  It is also considered the              best breeding habitat for the loon and osprey and has been designated              as a National Natural Landmark  Lake Umbagog also offers scenic              wilderness recreational opportunities for kayakers  canoeists               and hikers  The appropriated funds will assist in protecting it              from rapid shoreline development which could compromise the scenic              and natural integrity here   3 75 million in federal funding has              previously been secured for the Refuge  Northeastern States Research Cooperative   1                  million  The              Cooperative promotes collaboration among ecosystem research scientists              in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada  and works              to facilitate regional research and monitoring assessment activities               The overall funding of  4 million is provided to NH  VT  ME and
