Senator Gregg Co Sponsors Good Government Amendment To Institute Prioritization System For Water Projects  Contact Erin Rath  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee  today co sponsored an amendment to the Water Resources Development Act which would establish a system to prioritize Army Corps of Engineers water projects   Senator Gregg stated  This amendment is just common sense  Currently  we are spending at a rate that the federal government  and federal taxpayers  simply cannot afford  By setting up this commission  we would be bringing a modicum of responsibility to how federal dollars are spent  I am disappointed that this amendment was not approved  and I hope that as this and other spending measures move through Congress  that we can garner more support for ways to use taxpayer funds more efficiently and reduce federal spending on unnecessary pork projects   There is currently a backlog of  58 billion in authorized but not yet constructed water projects by the Army Corps of Engineers  Without this amendment  the WRDA bill currently under consideration in the Senate adds another  15 billion to the backlog  The amendment would have set up a temporary  bipartisan Water Resources Commission to make non binding recommendations on a process for prioritizing Corps projects  provided non binding recommendations for prioritizing projects currently under construction or authorized in the last ten years  and analyzed projects by type and put them into tiers reflecting their immediate importance  while seeking a balance between the water resource needs of all states   The amendment  authored by Senators Russell Feingold  D WI  and John McCain  R AZ  was not approved by a vote of 22 69  The amendment has the support of  Taxpayers for Common Sense Action  National Taxpayers Union  Citizens Against Government Waste  American Rivers  Clean Water Action  Defenders of Wildlife  Earthjustice  Environmental Defense  Friends of the Earth  League of Conservation Voters  National Wildlife Federation  Republicans for Environmental Protection  Sierra Club  and Union of Concerned Scientists
