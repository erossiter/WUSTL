Senator Gregg CoSponsors Bill To Increase Border Security Commitment Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today cosponsored the Emergency Border Security Funding Act of 2007  This bill  sponsored by Senator John Cornyn  R TX   provides  3 billion in emergency funding to help achieve and maintain operational control over the entire U S  Mexico border  The language in this bill  originally authored by Senator Gregg  was approved in July as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  Additionally  it was approved as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense conference report  but the Democratic Leadership in Congress decided to not include the measure in the final bill sent to the President  Senator Gregg stated  It is clear that the American people want swift action to gain control of our borders  This stand alone bill will give us yet another chance to and put the funds in place to help ensure this happens  Such legislation would be a significant step forward for fixing our broken immigration system and assuring the American people that its government takes border security seriously  It is clear that the support for this funding exists since it has been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate twice this year  To date  however  those making the decisions in the Democratic led Congress have unfortunately decided to not get these funds to the President  Securing our borders is critical to ensuring the safety of our nation and our citizens  and I implore the Democratic Leadership to stop playing partisan games and act swiftly to approve these important funds  The Emergency Border Security Funding Act of 2007 would mandate operational control over the entire Southern border and require specific levels of border security assets  namely  the hiring and training of 23 000 full time border agents  deployment of 4 new Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  installation of additional 105 ground based sensors and cameras  45 000 detention beds  300 miles of vehicle barriers  and 700 miles of border fencing  which were required under the Secure Fence Act of 2006   The Act would provide  3 billion in emergency funds to help fulfill these mandates  and it also would require the Administration to provide periodic progress reports to Congress on its implementation efforts
