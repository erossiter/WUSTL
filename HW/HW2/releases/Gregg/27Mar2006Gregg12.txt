 Floor Statement on Border Security and                  Immigration                 by U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman  Senate Appropriations                  Subcommittee on Homeland Security                                    Monday  March 27  Mr                 Gregg               Mr  President  we re about to begin this week a very significant              discussion  debate and hopefully passage of legislation to address              what is one of the crucial public policy issues we have here as              a country  which is the question of how we handle immigration    We re a nationwhich has been built on immigrants  Every one of us in this country  except forNative Americans  comes from a family that came from somewhere else and immigratedto this country  Part of our heritage which we re most proud of is the fact thatwe ve been able to assimilate cultures from around the world and bring them tothe United States and create America  It s something we should take pride in something which sets an example for the rest of the world to show that peoplecan gather and can live together and can be productive and can produce a nationfounded on democracy  freedom  and liberty  individual rights  and heritage heritage which has built a matrix of strength for us  As a nation as we bring together people from different cultures and we form an America  EPluribus Unum  the language above the President of the Senate  says it so well From many one  We are  therefore  a nation which needs to have an immigrationpolicy which understands that  which first and foremost appreciates and continuesto reward the idea that there are peoples from around this world who wish tocome to America to participate in this country and to make us a more productiveplace in which to raise their children and to assist us as a nation in beingstronger economically  socially  From a standpoint of just inner strength we attain so much from having different people participate in our country  Wealways want to be that beacon  that light up on the hill that draws the worldto us because as long as people want to come to America  we know we re doingsomething right  We should take great pride in that   And we continueto be a place where people want to come  As a result  we do have the issue ofhow we deal with immigration  But most importantly  as we move down this road we have to recognize that it is critical that we not do anything which tarnishesor chills or in any way undermines that great tradition of America  which isthat we reach out our arms to people who wish to come here and be productiveand participate in our way of life   However  unfortunatelyover the last few decades  and especially in an accelerated way as we moved throughthe 1990 s and into this decade of the first part of the 2010 period  as we moveinto this first decade of 2000  we ve seen that a large number of people arecoming into our nation illegally  They re not following the course which is availableto become an American citizen legally  to emigrate here  to take advantage ofour system and to build on the opportunities that are here and do it legally That has become a problem for us  It is a problem from the standpoint that itviolates our laws  It is also a problem for us in the post 9 11 world where wereally need to know who is coming into this nation because of the threat of terroristacts against us   For the mostpart  these people who come to our country have come here for purposes whichare good and decent  They want to have a better life  They want to be able toearn a better living  They want to be able to give their families more than whatthey had in the nation that they left  And that is a well intentioned purpose But they still come here illegally  and we need to address the issue of how wedeal with that   Now this questionhas been divided into basically two functions  First is how you physically controlthe borders of our nation and make sure that those borders are reasonably secureso that we have a decent idea of who is coming across those borders and why they recoming into our nation  And the second is the question of how you deal with peoplewho have come here to work  to perform tasks which are available to them  peoplewho may already be here illegally but people who still want to come here anddo it in a way that is within the law  And that  of course  involves the debateover our guest worker program   On the firstissue  I ve had a fair amount of interest and involvement because I chair thecommittee that has jurisdiction over this question  the Appropriations Subcommitteeon Homeland Security  And the question of whether or not our borders are secureis something which  since I have taken over as Chairman of this Subcommittee has been all consuming over the last two years that I ve had the good fortuneto chair this subcommittee of the appropriations committee   It s prettyobvious to any American that our borders are not secure  that we do not knowwho s coming in  We certainly don t know who s leaving  We don t know what scoming in  and we don t know  to a large degree  what s going out  On theissue of movement of people  we are attempting to address that question  We haveover the last two years significantly increased the resources going into bordersecurity  We ve increased the number of border patrol agents by almost 2 000 We ve increased the number of beds which are available  what are known as detentionbeds  also by a significant number  We have increased resources flowing intothe border security area  especially in the area of technology capability  tryingto set up a system called U S  VISIT  which will allow us to effectively trackwho s coming into our country on a realtime basis through using fingerprintsand our databases on fingerprints   We have madeprogress  But we are nowhere near solving the problem  And I want to talk brieflyabout that specific issue and then a little bit about the bigger issue of guestworker and how you become an American citizen  Because as the Judiciary Committeewrestles with this problem of border security  I think it s important that wedo it the right way  that we think about it in what s going to get the best resultsversus what s going to get the best press release   To begin with we do not need a wall across our southern border  We don t need it from a standpointof being able to know who s coming across the border  We don t need it from thestandpoint of being good neighbors  We do not need it from a standpoint of presentingthe national culture  It would be the exact opposite thing that we should doas a nation  There may be sections  clearly  where some sort of fencing or wallwill be necessary  sections where the commingling of the border is so close it is very difficult to control that section without some sort of a definableevent which forces people who wish to come across the border through a controlledpoint  But to run up a wall the length of the border  as has been suggested bysome of our colleagues  especially in the other body  is just an anathema tothe concept of what America stands for   We want tocontinue to a society which says we are open  that we are a place where peopleare encouraged to come to and that we are a place that will reach out to peoplewho wish to be productive and come here to be productive citizens  And futhermore it would cost a huge amount of money and would accomplish very little   So much morecould be accomplished through other means  With the addition of a fairly significantbut not dramatic increase in the number of border agents  if we went up to say20 000    we re now about 13 000  And with the addition of fairly significantbut not a dramatic amount of new detention beds and some creative approachesto detection capability such as using former military bases and the facilitiesthat might be available through transient housing  Maybe we could use some ofthose trailers that we ve got sitting down there in Arkansas that aren t beingused  But through creative detention capability we could add the additional beds   and there are not that many needed compared to the overall numbers   With creativeapproaches using technology  of which we have an unlimited source of ingenuityin this nation  It seems like every day somebody comes to my office every daywith some idea of how to create a monitoring system or some use of a monitoringsystem  Through the use of unmanned vehicles  satellite technology  through theuse of sensors  which would not cost that much  With the creative use of justadding physical capital assistance  such as new cars  new helicopters  new planesfor Customs  such as new capacity for the Coast Guard  we could  without a greatdeal of incremental increase compared to the spending which we do in other partsof this government  effectively monitor and manage certainly the southern border And as a result  we would know who was coming into this country across that southernborder which is where most of issue of illegal immigration occurs   Would we solvethe northern border issues  probably not  That s a little different puzzle  Thenorthern border doesn t have the huge illegal immigration issue but it does havean equally severe  maybe even more severe opportunity for terrorists  peoplewho wish to do us harm  to cross  And there are other approaches which need tobe taken there   But as tothe southern border  it is totally possible  reasonable and should be done  tomanage that border effectively with the addition of some significant resourcesbut not dramatic increases   I suggesteda year and a half ago that if we increased the capital resources available tothe Border Patrol and the Customs agencies by about  1 2 billion we could essentiallybuy out almost all the major capital needs they need in order to manage the border all the housing  all the airplanes  all the cars  all the unmanned vehicle monitors all the technology for detection capability that we would need  That s a lotof money by New Hampshire standards  but in the context of a  1 8 trillion budget it s certainly a manageable sum   So far thatsuggestion has been stiff armed by the Administration and basically limited asa result of politics here on the floor of the Senate  In addition to that capitalneed  which as I mentioned is about  1 2 billion  there is the need to add newagents and there is the need to increase our capability on the operationalside  But  again  the dollars necessary to do that are not dramatic  not dramaticat all  probably in the range of  2 billion of additional funding per year  Alot of money  again  by New Hampshire standards but in the context of overallnational defense where we re spending  440 billion plus the money for the waron terrorism  an additional  2 billion to secure our southern borders in thecontext of personnel increases is not dramatic  It s doable  The point is itwould accomplish our goal which is to secure the southern borders  And I ve askedfor that to be done  Unfortunately that has not been proposed  Well  that isincorrect  It was proposed to increase the commitment of number of border patrolby the Administration  They gave that commitment in their budget submission but they took it away because they tied it to creating a fee which would increasethe airline user fee and the practical result of that would be that the moneywhich was supposed to be used to add these additional agents would never be realized But it should be done  And it can be done   If a fee isnecessary to do it  it should be done on a fee basis but not on a fee that hasno relationship to the actual usage  An airline fee does not impact southernborder protection  The airline fee impacts the TSA  and it needs support  Andit has gone through two years of freeze and should be increased in our commitmentthere  and this fee maybe should be used to do that  But if we re going to havea fee  it should be border related if that s the way it s going to be done  Butin any event  it should be done  We should spend these dollars to accomplishthis   The bill thatis working its way through the Judiciary Committee has a commitment to thesetypes of efforts  It s an authorizing bill  I have to find the money as an appropriatorand right now the money to accomplish those good intentions isn t there   Also  thebill coming through the authorizing committee creates a number of mandates  Itsays  this shall be done by Border Patrol  this shall be done by Customs  thisshall be done by Coast Guard    I m not sure it addresses Coast Guard  but ithas a number of mandates for border control and immigration  The practical effectof that is artificially directing and redirecting flows of revenues and resources and it may actually as a result of those mandates end up undermining our abilityto address the border  If the bill comes to the floor  which I hope it will I hope we can straighten those issues out   The bottomline is simply this  we can accomplish security on the southern border  We canknow to a large extent who is coming in and out of this country  We can limitdramatically    I mean dramatically    down to a trickle for all intents andpurposes  the number of people who get into this country illegally cross thesouthern border by giving resources that in the relative context of the nationalbudget are extraordinarily small  And if we have to pay for them  we should payfor them through some sort of a border security fee  It can be done   Why hasn tit been done  Well  because border security has been a stepchild around hereto national defense for a long time  I find that unacceptable  If we re goingto have a core defense budget which spends  440 billion up from  289 billionjust five years ago  on top of which we re spending billions to fight a war one has to ask what is the core defense budget for  It s not to fight the warbecause we re spending on top of it to fight the war  So it s obviously for strategicdefense and it s needed  I guess  for the most part  But if that is a need ofcritical priority  clearly protecting our southern border is an equal need ofnational defense  Maybe we should roll the border security effort into the defensedepartment and then we would get the resources for it  Although I think it wouldbe a bad policy decision  at least we would get resources   But in anyevent  in the context of what is important from the standpoint of national security I can t think of anything   there are a lot of things  I think it has to rankright up there at the top  knowing who is coming in and out of this country whileour country at risk  We know that these people want to attack us on our soil it is absolutely critical that we have the necessary resources to protect whois coming in and out of our country so that we can protect ourselves from peoplewho might cause us harm   It is criticalthat as a culture we control this  We cannot survive as a culture if we havea massive amount of people coming into this country illegally  It doesn t work People who want to come to this country  and we want to maintain an open approachto people coming into this country  have to know if they follow the rules andcome here legally they are able to get in line under the rules and have a shotat American citizenship and participating in the American dream So it is criticalwe get our borders under control  And we should do it  We should have done itlong ago  and we can do it now  We should make that commitment to those typesof resources   As this billmoves forward  I intend to make those points and try to get people to look atthis in the context of a doable event rather than in the context of simply apress release event   Secondly on the issue of immigration itself  it is also obvious that we have to have aworkable guest worker program  We have to have something that says to people if you want to come here and work and better your family  there s a way we canwork that out  We can make that happen  That takes the pressure off illegal immigration After we secure the border  it is clear that some sort of effective guest workingprogram is necessary to be in place   As part ofthat overall immigration effort  there s one little slice I think we need toaddress  It s a small slice  There is today a lottery program where you can essentiallysend in your name and you put it into a lottery  And you have to be from a countrywhich is deemed underprivileged  I believe  There s some sort of categorization But if your name is pulled out of a hat you get on the path to American citizenship 50 000 names are pulled out of the hat every year just as a lottery  Well at one time this may have made sense  but it doesn t make sense today  It s obvioustoday that pulling people s names out of a hat to put them on path to citizenshipin America is not fair to those people who are waiting in line and who have areason and who follow the process and have a purpose  And it s not fair to ournation  I mean  how do we know that we want somebody whose name is drawn outof a hat to be an American citizen  What benefit is that to us other than thatthe person happened to be lucky  Thus  if we re going to keep this lottery program I believe we need to change it to a lottery program which essentially says  ifyou want to participate in this lottery  you have to have some unique talentsor skills which America needs  You have a masters degree or doctorate in somescience or math capability  or a foreign language capability  something Americahas a use for  So I think we should convert this lottery to that approach   I note thatmy time is about to expire here and that we have both assistant leaders on thefloor so something big must be happening  Therefore  I will continue this discussas we move forward on the debate of immigration   But I do thinkit is critical to understand that resolving the border issue is a doable event And we can accomplish it with the right amount of resources placed in the rightplace  We don t need new laws to do it  I yield the floor
