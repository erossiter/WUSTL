        FUNDS FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE                        WASHINGTON               DC  United States Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH               today  7 14  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee              has approved  3 65 million in Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation              Protection  CELCP  funds to protect more than 700 acres of New              Hampshire land  The funds  which fall under the National Oceanic              and Atmospheric Administration  are contained in the Fiscal Year              2007 Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations              Bill    The              resources are targeted for the Coastal Headwaters Project in Greenland                2 7 million  and the Salmon Falls Headlands Project in Middleton              and Milton   950 000   CELCP program resources leverage state               local  and private funding to protect coastal and estuarine areas              that are environmentally significant and are being threatened by              development  With Appropriations Committee approval on Thursday               the legislation now moves to the full Senate for consideration              in the weeks ahead   Senator              Gregg  former Chairman  and still a member  of the CJS Subcommittee               stated    New Hampshire is home to valuable sensitive environmental              ecosystems across the state  It is our responsibility to              work to ensure that these areas are protected for future generations              of Granite Staters and visitors to enjoy  In the past the              funds provided through the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation              Protection program have assisted local and state leaders in their              efforts to protect these ecologically sensitive areas  I              am pleased that the funds this year will go toward the Salmon Falls              Headlands in Milton and Middleton and the Coastal Headwaters Project              in Greenland  as they are experiencing growing populations and              increased development  heightening the need for protection of these              important environmental areas  Senator Sununu stated  Unwavering              dedication to conservation at the local and state level together              with the availability of federal Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation              Protection funds have protected several sensitive ecological regions              of our state from the pressures of commercial and residential development               The protection of more than 700 acres in the Coastal Headwaters              and the Salmon Falls Headlands through this funding continues this              strong tradition of environmental stewardship and will allow diverse              ecosystems of fish  wildlife  and plants to thrive even further   Ted Diers  Program Manager  NH Coastal Program  stated  We              are extremely pleased with the Senates action  These two              projects are a top priority for their water quality protection               habitat and open space values and represent land protection in              rapidly developing areas of our coast  CELCP is an incredibly important              program to New Hampshire  There are few other funding opportunities              to address the rapid loss of open space in our coastal zone and              watershed  Daniel Kern  Chair  Greenland Select Board  stated  Federal              funding through the CELCP program is critical to the Town of Greenlands              interest in conserving the Coastal Headwaters area  While the Town              does have some funding available for land protection  it does not              have enough to complete this project on its own  especially when              considering competing priorities  We hope that the Trust for Public              Land and the Seacoast Land Trust are able to reach an agreement              with the landowners in the area so that we now can complete this              project  Jane Difley  President Forester  Society for the              Protection of New Hampshire Forests  Forest Society  stated  We              deeply appreciate the strong and effective support of Senator Gregg              and Senator Sununu for watershed conservation funding through NOAA               Federal funding through the Great Bay Partnership and CELCP is              helping protect some of the last best undeveloped land in coastal              New Hampshire  Now  thanks to Senator Greggs and Senator              Sununus belief in supporting innovative new efforts  federal              funding is playing an important new role in protecting aquatic              habitat in one of our states great inland watersheds                 the Merrimack River basin  Lee E  Perry  Executive Director               NH Fish and Game Department  stated  This project is another              great example of land conservation that can be achieved through              public private partnerships  As a result of this collaborative              effort  extensive wetland  shoreline and associated upland habitats              in the upper reaches of the Great Bay watershed will remain in              their natural condition both now and into the future  It              complements the Departments land              conservation efforts and is a significant addition to the network              of existing protected lands in the area  We thank Senator              Gregg  Senator Sununu and the CELCP program for their support of              this important conservation project    Kristen C  Grubb               Executive Director of the Seacoast Land Trust  stated  The              Coastal Headwaters Area is the source of three major Seacoast streams              and one of the most important large unfragmented areas left in              the region  Protecting its wildlife habitat  water resources  and              special natural areas is critical to maintaining the integrity              of unique Seacoast natural resources  This project is one of the              Seacoast Land Trusts highest priorities for              land protection in the next few years      Coastal Headwaters Project  Greenland   The              funding aims to protect 238 acres at the top of the Winicut River              watershed including an 85 acre property located between the headwaters              of the Winicut and Little Rivers  as well as Berrys Brook   Salmon Falls Headlands                  Project  Middleton Milton   The funding aims to                  protect two tracts of land totaling 491 acres of conservation                  easements  The Salmon Falls tract is 345 acres and consists                  of 8 400 feet of frontage on Salmon Falls  The other tract                  is a 146 acre parcel on Horn Brook
