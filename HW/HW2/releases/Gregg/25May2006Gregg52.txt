                                GREGG COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF IMMIGRATION BILL                     NEW AUDIO AVAILABLE                                                  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  today applauded Senate passage of S 2611  the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006  The bill passed by a vote of 62 36    The approved measure includes two amendments sponsored by Senator Gregg  The first amendment  sponsored by U S  Senators Judd Gregg  R NH  and Maria Cantwell  D WA   is to reform the current green card lottery program by reallocating two thirds of the 50 000 visas currently issued to a new advanced degree lottery system  The visas issued under the proposed advanced degree visa lottery would only be available to applicants who have a masters or doctorate degree in science  technology  engineering  or mathematics  The Gregg Cantwell amendment  approved by a vote of 56 42  represents a bipartisan response to address shortages in these areas  The second amendment by Senator Gregg and Senator Robert C  Byrd  D WV  would provide funding for border security through a  500 supplemental fee on individuals wishing to change their status from illegal aliens to legal  This amendment was approved by a vote of 73 25    Senator Gregg stated  Managing Americas borders and dealing with immigration are two of the most significant issues we face today as a nation  This is because a porous border poses a tremendous threat to our national security  At the same time  the culture and strength of America is defined and energized by immigration but it must occur in an orderly and legal manner    I have made restoring order and security to our border one of my top priorities and we have seen some moderate success  Since I took over Chairmanship of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  we have made significant strides in improving border security  Last years appropriations bill included  5 9 billion for Customs and Border Protection and  3 1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement  These funds will provide  among other things  1 000 new border control agents  funding for over 40 700 positions dedicated to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws  over  10 6 million to train new border and immigration enforcement personnel  and  1 3 billion for the detention of illegal aliens  In addition  in the Fiscal Year 2005 supplemental funding bill  we included over  635 million for DHS  including an emergency infusion of personnel for increasing border security  This legislation also gave DHS greater authority to construct border security fences and toughened immigration laws to make it easier to deport aliens for terrorist activities  I have also proposed  and the Senate has supported  an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 supplemental bill which would provide  1 9 billion for border capital infrastructure costs  including new planes  border security vehicles and maritime security boats    But border security alone cannot effectively address the issues raised by illegal immigration  Human nature says that as long as a person trying to feed and care for his or her family can only make five dollars a day in Mexico while they would be able to make fifty dollars a day in the U S   there will be huge pressure for that person to come here  We need a system  specifically a guest worker system  which allows these people to come to America and work legally in jobs that go unfilled by Americans  As part of this system  we need strong enforcement of the rules regarding hiring legal workers at the workplace    The bill passed by the Senate this evening does not accomplish all that I would like  but it is a strong step in the right direction  I expect this bill to be further improved in a joint House Senate conference committee  I will continue to work towards the goal of comprehensive and thoughtful immigration policy that continues the American dream which is built by the labor and lives of immigrants
