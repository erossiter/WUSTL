Senator Gregg Introduces Bill to Give Women Increased Access to OB GYNs   Contact  Erin Rath WASHINGTONU S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  yesterday introduced a medical liability reform measure to ensure women have access to physicians who provide obstetric and gynecological services  many of whom are leaving their practices or are moving out of certain regions due to the high cost of medical liability insurance  The Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act is similar to a measure Senator Gregg introduced in the 109th Congress  S 366   and incorporates successful models used on a state level  The trend in the area of OB GYN coverage for expectant mothers is clear    frivolous lawsuits have ballooned the cost of liability insurance for doctors  and in response  OB GYNs are fleeing to areas with low insurance rates or leaving their practice altogether  stated Senator Gregg  In my home state of New Hampshire  physicians have faced double digit premium increases  and in parts of New Hampshire there simply arent enough OB GYNs  My bill guarantees full compensation for medical costs  lost wages  and other tangible costs  stated Senator Gregg  It uses a model adopted by the State of Texas  the results of which show that there is a balance that allows OB GYNs to continue to care for women while allowing those that believe they have been harmed the opportunity to seek redress   Several states have adopted similar laws  and have seen positive results  stated Senator Gregg  However  insurance premiums are still an unsustainable burden on many doctors  and doctors will continue to leave their practices and patients will be the ones who suffer unless action is taken  My bill entitles patients to a fair recovery process while ensuring that doctors can still do what they do best  treat patients  Senator Gregg also is an original cosponsor on the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2007  introduced today by Senator John Ensign  R NV   MCAP is a broad medical liability bill that seeks to improve patient access to health care services by reducing the excessive burden the liability system places on the entire health care delivery system   Palmer Jones  Executive Vice President of the New Hampshire Medical Society  stated  New Hampshire  like many rural states  is struggling to attract  recruit and retain physicians throughout the state  OB GYNs in particular are affected because of the high medical liability premiums they must pay just for the right to deliver babies in New Hampshire  This proposed legislation will encourage obstetricians to continue to stay in rural areas of New Hampshire  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  ACOG   representing 51 000 physicians and partners in womens health care  strongly endorses the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act  stated Douglas W  Laube  MD  MEd  President of ACOG  We commend your continued leadership and efforts to resolve the medical liability crisis facing this nation and to protect access to health care for our nations women and children  said Dr  Laube  As you well know  the medical liability environment is driving good doctors out of practice or out of their home state  And when OB GYNs discontinue the practice of obstetrics  refuse high risk patients  or reduce their surgical practice  womens health care suffers   Perhaps most troubling is the effect of the crisis on young physicians  said Dr  Laube  A 2006 survey of doctors in their fourth year of ob gyn residency  the last year before they enter patient care  confirmed that a states liability climate has a powerful impact on where and how they will practice  A third of residents indicated they had been warned or advised to leave their current location because of liability concerns and nearly half are already considering limiting the type and scope of their practice   Your legislation is critically important to help solve the medical liability crisis  We urge the Senate to move quickly to enact a bill that will provide relief to physicians and ensure continued availability of quality health care for our patients    John A  Strosnider  DO  President of the American Osteopathic Association  stated  I am pleased to inform you of our strong support for the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act of 2007  Your legislation aims to reduce the medical liability burden facing those physicians providing obstetrical care  We believe that the bill includes the appropriate combination of provisions that have been proven effective in stabilizing the medical liability system and increasing patient access to quality and timely health care  On behalf of the AOA and the 59 000 osteopathic physicians it represents  thank you for your continued leadership on this important issue
