                               SENATORS GREGG  SUNUNU  INTRODUCE                                   NEW HAMPSHIRE WILDERNESS BILL                                         WASHINGTON               DC  United States Senators John Sununu and Judd Gregg  R NH               today  3 28  introduced the New Hampshire Wilderness Act              of 2006  legislation to designate approximately 34 500 acres              of White Mountain National Forest land in the Sandwich Range and              Wild River areas as  wilderness  Sununu authored              the Senate legislation and Gregg is the lead co sponsor of the              bill  In November of 2005  the Forest Service recommended the designation              of additional acreage as wilderness in its Management              Plan for the White Mountain National Forest  The  New              Hampshire Wilderness Act of 2006 incorporates the recommendations              of this Management Plan by designating approximately 23 700 acres              in the area of the Wild River as wilderness and adding              approximately 10 800 acres to the existing Sandwich Range Wilderness  The              land would remain as White Mountain National Forest land under              the protection of the National Wilderness Preservation System               Wilderness areas consist of federal lands that are permanently              closed to such activities as mining  logging  road construction               vehicular traffic  and building construction   By law  the              establishment of new wilderness must be approved by Congress  Senator Sununu stated  The Forest Service plan represents              a consensus view of how best to protect lands in the White Mountain              National Forest while ensuring the Forests traditional mixed use              role  The introduction of this legislation is the next step              toward solidifying this agreement   I look forward to working              with all interested parties in support of this bill to ensure that              Granite State residents and visitors alike are able to enjoy these              wilderness regions for generations to come   For              a number of years  local and state officials  citizen groups and              other concerned individuals have been working toward the goal of              designating more wilderness in the White Mountain National Forest  Their              dedication toward permanently protecting land in the Sandwich Range              and the Wild River area is to be commended  and will come to fruition              with the passage of this bill  Sununu said  Senator              Gregg and I will continue to work with Congressmen Bass and Bradley              and all parties concerned to make this legislation a reality   Senator Gregg stated  The White Mountain National Forest              is one of the most spectacular and treasured areas of forest in              our nation  Its beauty has been enjoyed by generations of              New Hampshire residents and visitors alike  who enjoy the natural              wonder of the snow capped mountain peaks  lush green forests  and              crystal clear waterways  Now that the Forest Service has              issued its management plan  Congress must take action to further              protect the uniquely undisturbed and pristine areas in the White              Mountain National Forest for generations to come   Consistent with the Forest Services recommendations               the New Hampshire Wilderness Act of 2006 represents a balanced               consensus based approach for designating additional lands as wilderness  The              establishment of more than 34 000 acres of wilderness in the Sandwich              Range and the Wild River area will be a great accomplishment for              the White Mountain National Forest  both now  and in the years              to come   The New Hampshire Wilderness Act of 2006 recognizes              that some areas of the White Mountain National Forest should remain              open to a variety of uses  I look forward to working on this              legislation and applaud all of the work that already has gone into              this effort  Jane Difley  President Forester for the Society for the Protection              of New Hampshire Forests stated  The Society for the Protection              of New Hampshire Forests is proud to strongly support the White              Mountain National Forest Wilderness designation legislation being              introduced by Senators Sununu and Gregg  We support multiple use              on the National Forests  and we practice multiple use on the 42 000              acres of forest reservations we own and manage in 90 communities              in New Hampshire  The White Mountain National Forest can and should              support Wilderness as well as timber harvesting  and a wide coalition              of forest users join us in supporting these two new Wilderness              designations  Bruce M  Schwaegler  Interim President  New Hampshire Audubon              stated  New Hampshire Audubon thanks Senators Judd Gregg              and John Sununu for their leadership in advancing this win win              wilderness proposal that protects both the public and our public              lands  Both Sununu and Gregg praised Regional Forester Randy Moore  Forest              Supervisor Thomas Wagner and the staff of the White Mountain National              Forest  saying  Randy Moore  Tom Wagner and their entire              team were able to bring together the concerns and opinions of countless              individuals and groups and present a plan that works   Because              of their diligence  this bill should enjoy quick consideration              by our colleagues in Congress  We appreciate their efforts  Wagner commented  I have personally appreciated Senator              Sununu s and Senator Gregg s support to the Forest Planning process              and the professional efforts of Forest Service employees to listen              to many different viewpoints on the management of the White Mountain              National Forest  The ongoing support of the Congressional              delegation helped set the stage for concerned citizens to engage              in a truly respective discourse that provides a balanced and sustainable              approach for management of these important public lands  There are currently              five wilderness areas in the              White Mountain National Forest  Of these  four are in New              Hampshire  the Presidential Range Dry River Wilderness  the Great              Gulf Wilderness  the Sandwich Range Wilderness  and the Pemigewasset              Wilderness  The Caribou Speckled Mountain Wilderness is in              the State of Maine  Congressmen Charles Bass and Jeb Bradley  R NH  will introduce              similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives              this week
