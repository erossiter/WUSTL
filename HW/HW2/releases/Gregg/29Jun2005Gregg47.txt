              SENATOR                GREGG ANNOUNCES  11 5 MILLION                MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE                 REGIONAL AIR QUALITY RESEARCH AND FORECASTING EFFORTS                               WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today              announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved              a measure that contains  11 5 million in federal funding to continue              projects that measure and forecast air quality throughout New Hampshire              and the Northeast Region  The Fiscal Year 2006 budget for the National              Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  approved by the Committee              on Thursday  includes  5 million for the AIRMAP project   3 million              for the New England Air Quality study  2 million for the Targeted              Wind Sensing initiative  and  1 5 million for the Northeast Center              for Atmospheric Science  Policy  All four projects are based              out of the University of New Hampshire  As a member of the Senate              Appropriations Committee  and a former Chairman of the Subcommittee              that oversees funding for NOAA  Senator Gregg was able to include              the funding in the bill  which now awaits action before the full            Senate    Senator Gregg stated   Despite New Hampshire s picturesque mountains               lakes  rivers and beaches  we still suffer from poor air quality               Pollution from Asia  the West Coast  power plants in the Midwest               and cities along the Eastern Seaboard floats up the Atlantic coast              to our doorstep  The environmental and economic consequences of              failing to act on the presence of this polluted and toxic air would              be dire for our region and our state  Since the late 1990 s  UNH              has established itself as a global leader in many aspects of the              study and forecasting of polluted air  and will host two global              conferences in the next five years on the presence and behavior              of mercury and other airborne toxins  UNH s leadership has yielded              tremendous benefits to New Hampshire and the Northeast so we do              not leave our children and their children with the responsibility              to clean up the air they breathe    Dr  Robert Talbot  Director of the UNH AIRMAP program  said these new initiatives  build on the massive 2004 regional air quality study that brought scientists  from around the world to the New Hampshire Seacoast  Dr  Talbot stated   Last  year s efforts produced major discoveries in how pollutants move from region  to region  These new initiatives will enable us to aggressively pursue very  complex questions about the movement and interaction of aerosols  toxins  and  other pollutants  Senator Gregg s willingness to fight for funding is making  UNH the national center for air quality research that is essential to the Nation s  health  Not only do we breathe this air  but we need to prevent pollution of  our land and water  This is science that directly helps people     The UNH Network has gained national recognition for continuously              measuring some 180 chemical compounds  In the past year it has              established two sites that are among the first in the world to              continuously measure airborne mercury  Existing data have been              largely limited to estimates of mercury emissions  and then measurement              of total amounts of mercury carried to the ground with rain   UNH Air Quality and Air Forecasting Programs U S  Senator Judd Gregg  Member               Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science    5 million   AIRMAP   AIRMAP is a cooperative              program between the UNH and NOAA  created in 1999  designed to              provide a detailed                understanding of various sources of pollution by studying the                dynamics of New England s atmosphere  air quality and weather                 The program combines NOAA s atmospheric research with UNH led                systematic monitoring of the region s atmospheric chemistry in                order to develop the ability to predict air quality changes as                an addition to daily weather forecasts  Continued funding for                the AIRMAP project will allow researchers to expand and improve                the project by initiating climate air quality assessment for                the northeast  including detailed measurements of mercury and                other trace metals  Researchers will also continue to validate                their forecasts and models using the project s detailed research    3 million   New England Air Quality Study   Entering its fifth              year of development  the Study continues to discover breakthroughs              in the monitoring and prediction of airborne toxins  The program              includes three comprehensive monitoring stations operating year              round in Durham  Castle in the Clouds and on the Summit of Mount              Washington  allowing researchers to separate out pollutants from              background levels of atmospheric components occurring naturally              in the environment  In the summers of 2002 and 2004  the joint              UNH NOAA project included the use of the NOAA vessel R V Ronald              H  Brown in the Gulf of Maine  which was able to demonstrate conclusively              that air pollutants from the east coast of the U S  return to the              northeast after being transported out to the ocean  The Study has              already benefitted from  7 75 million in federal funding for its              efforts    2 million   Targeted Wind Sensing Project   This award will allow              the program to participate in two innovative initiatives this year                a study in the Eastern Pacific to identify how Asian emissions              are transported to the United States  and in the Atlantic  the              project will track how waves off Africa become the source of hurricanes              in the later stages of summer and into fall  The project s overall              focus  which includes the continuous measurement of levels of ozone              in the northeast  is to reach a better understanding of the components              of our air to improve the quality of overall weather and air forecasts               Through his position as the former Chairman of the CJS Subcommittee               Senator Gregg has previously secured  6 million for the UNH based              program    1 5 million   Northeast Center for Atmospheric Science and                Policy   The Center was created last year as a joint partnership between              UNH and the Northeast Center for Atmospheric Sciences and Policy              to take a regional view of air quality and discover the environmental              and ecological ramifications of air pollution  Researchers are              creating a regional system of observation that is focused on the              presence of mercury  carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide  The Center              will then establish detailed socio economic pictures based on their              findings  Senator Gregg was able to secure a similar  1 5 million              award for the Center last year
