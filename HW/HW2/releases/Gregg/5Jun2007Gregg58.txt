Senator Gregg s Response To Tancredo Press Conference Outside Gregg s Manchester  NH Office  Contact Erin Rath  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   today made the following statement in response to Congressman Tom Tancredos press conference on immigration outside Senator Greggs Manchester  New Hampshire  office  U S  Senator Judd Gregg stated  The need to address our out of control immigration situation is critical to maintaining our nations security  rule of law and culture  The bill before the Senate is a sincere attempt to do this  and hopefully will be amended and improved in a manner that will give us full control of the borders and a logical approach to a guest worker and immigration program   There are  unfortunately  people who wish to bury their heads in the sand by ignoring the threat our present dysfunctional system represents to our country  and who are using a jingoistic and demagogic approach of opposition to immigrants as a way to raise their own political visibility  These politicians are not constructive players to the process of working towards solving one of Americas most pressing and critical problems  Congressman Tancredo has chosen to align himself with this approach  I strongly reject this new know nothing wing of the political spectrum and hope the people of New Hampshire will as well
