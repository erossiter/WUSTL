              GREGG                MAKES OPENING STATEMENT ON SENATE DEBATE OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS                BILL                              WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH                Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland              Security  today made the following opening statement at the start              of debate of the Fiscal Year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations            Bill by the full Senate     THANK YOU  MR  PRESIDENT  WE TURN NOW TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY              BILL  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A TIMELY PERIOD TO BE TAKING UP THIS PIECE              OF LEGISLATION IN LIGHT OF WHAT S HAPPENED IN LONDON  WE RECOGNIZE              ONCE AGAIN AS A RESULT OF THE HEINOUS CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED              IN LONDON  THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO TOTALLY DISREGARD              INNOCENT LIFE AND WHO ARE WILLING TO KILL INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS              SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT AS TO WHAT              THEIR CAUSE IS OR WHAT THEIR PRESUMED CAUSE MAY BE  OF COURSE               WE WERE UNFORTUNATELY  FOCUSED ON THIS FACT BY 9 11  BUT MAYBE              OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS THE SUCCESS OF OUR NATION IN RESISTING              ATTACKS HAS CAUSED US A TOUCH OF COMPLACENCY IN THIS AREA  HOWEVER               LONDON HAS TO CLEARLY REMIND US THAT COMPLACENCY CANNOT BE TOLERATED              WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THESE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES ISLAMIC              FUNDAMENTALISTS AND WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY KILLERS AND TERRORISTS               MURDERERS WITHOUT ANY MORAL CREED OR CAUSE  AND WHOSE ACTIONS ARE            TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED IN ANY FORM OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY               THE HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY WAS SET UP IN              THE POST 9 11 WORLD IN ORDER TO TRY AS A NATION TO GET OUR ARMS              AROUND THE ISSUE                OF HOW WE CAN BEST PROTECT OURSELVESHERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  IT WAS SET UP IN THE CONTEXT OF AGENCIESWHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHER AREAS OF PROTECTING US RELATIVE TO THIS WARON TERRORISM  OF COURSE  WE HAVE OUR DEFENSE DEPARTMENT  WHICH IS THROUGH ITSEXTRAORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN  PURSUING THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTANAND IN IRAQ  AND WE ALSO HAVE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY THE F B I   AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  WHO ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE WE OBTAINTHE INTELLIGENCE NECESSARY TO PROTECT US  BUT WITHIN THIS UMBRELLA OF AGENCIESWHICH ARE TRYING TO PURSUE THIS WAR ON TERRORISM  THERE IS INCLUDED  OF COURSE THE HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY  THE HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY WAS PUT TOGETHER AS AN AMALGAMATION OF A VARIETYOF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS  I THINK THERE WERE 22 OR SOMETHING INITIALLY THAT WERETHROWN TOGETHER  SOME OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS  WHEN THEY WERE PUT INTO THE HOMELANDSECURITY AGENCY WERE ALREADY FUNCTIONING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL AND HAD A TRACKRECORD OF SUCCESS  SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAD A SPOTTY TRACK RECORD  REGRETTABLY SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS DIDN T HAVE A VERY GOOD TRACK RECORD AT ALL  BUT THEYWERE BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRYING TO INVOLVE A COORDINATED EFFORTIN THE AREA OF FIGHTING TERRORISM                NOW WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE  I BELIEVE  AS WE PURSUE THIS FIGHT ON                TERRORISM THAT THE PEOPLE WE ARE FIGHTING ARE DRIVEN WITH A PHILOSOPHY                WHICH WE AS A RATIONALSOCIETY  AS A WESTERN SOCIETY  FIND HARD TO FATHOM  THE CONCEPT THAT YOU WOULDKILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A POINT IS SOMETHINGWHICH WE FIND REPUGNANT AND FIND ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE  BUT THAT IS THE NATUREOF THE PEOPLE WE FIGHT  WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PURPOSE ISN T NECESSARILYTO WIN A GLOBAL WAR IN THE SENSE THAT HAS BEEN  SUCH AS WORLD WAR I OR WORLDWAR II OR EVEN THE KOREAN WAR                THEIR PURPOSE IS ESSENTIALLY TO ASSERT THEIR CULTURE    TO ASSERT                THEIR RELIGION IN A WAY WHICH THEY PERCEIVE ANY RELIGION THEY                SEE AS ALIEN TO IT  AND THEY WANTTO PURSUE THIS WITH A FANATICISM WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO DEVELOP INDIVIDUALS ANDATTITUDES WHERE PEOPLE WILL STRAP BOMBS TO THEMSELVES AND ATTACK US  OR WHERETHEY ATTACK INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS AS THEY DID IN LONDON               THUS  THE THREAT IS A THREAT OF IMMENSE PROPORTIONS  AND IT IS                A THREAT WHICH WE HAVE TO PURSUE IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM WHICH                WE HAVE PURSUED ALL THREATS INOUR NATION  WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS  BUT EXECUTING THIS HAS BECOME A PROBLEM WE HAVE NOT GRASPED  I BELIEVE  AS A NATION HOW WE EXECUTE DEFENDING OURSELVESAGAINST THIS TYPE OF A THREAT                BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS  AND OUR APPROACH MUST BE TEMPERED BY                IT  WE KNOW WE CAN ORDER THE PRIORITY OF THE THREATS AS THEY                REFLECT RELATIVE TO US  WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE  THAT IF THESE INDIVIDUALS GET THEIR HANDS ON A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION CHEMICAL  BIOLOGICAL WEAPON OR  GOD FORBID  A NUCLEAR CAPABLE WEAPON  THAT THEYWILL USE THAT WEAPON  THEY WILL USE IT IN A WAY WHICH KILLS TENS OF THOUSANDS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS  SO WE KNOW THAT THATIS THE NUMBER ONE THREAT WHICH WE MUST CONFRONT  AND WE KNOW ALSO THAT AS A NATION  BECAUSE WE ARE A DEMOCRACY AND BECAUSE WEARE AN OPEN NATION AND BECAUSE WE SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN AN OPEN AND VIBRANTWORLD  THAT OUR BORDERS ARE POROUS AND THAT ACCESS INTO THIS COUNTRY IS EASY AND THAT THAT REPRESENTS  REGRETTABLY  NOW A THREAT TO US                AND WE KNOW ALSO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SUCH AN OPEN SOCIETY  AND                BECAUSE WE ARE A SOCIETY WHICH IS BUILT AROUND THE CONCEPT OF                INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY ANDPEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD AND PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES  THATWE HAVE INNUMERABLE AREAS OF INFRASTRUCTURE  AREAS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATIONAND ACTIVITY WHICH ARE OPEN TO ATTACK  SUCH AS OCCURRED IN LONDON  AND THAT ISAN ISSUE OF THREAT                AND SO WHAT WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO IN THIS BILL IS TAKE THE RESOURCES                WE HAVE AND FOCUS THEM ON A THREAT BASED APPROACH  SO THAT WE                BASICALLY FOCUS THE MOSTRESOURCES ON THE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THE GREATEST THREAT  AND THE WAY WE STRUCTUREDTHIS BILL WAS THAT WE FOCUSED MOST OF THE ENERGY OF THIS BILL  MOST OF THE DOLLARSIN THIS BILL IN TWO PRIMARY AREAS AS FAR AS NEW DOLLARS ARE CONCERNED  WE RESTILL SPENDING A LOT OF DOLLARS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES  BUT THE NEW INITIATIVESIN THIS BILL ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BETTER GET A HANDLE ON DEFENDING OURSELVESFROM AN ATTACK BY A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION  AND SECONDLY  MAKING OUR BORDERS WHICH ARE INORDINATELY POROUS LESS POROUS AND HAVING BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY ASTO WHO IS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT THEIR PURPOSES ARE               AND SO WE MOVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY AROUND IN THIS BILL TO TRY                TO ACCOMPLISH THAT  THOSE TWO BASIC PHILOSOPHICAL GOALS OF ADDRESSING                THOSE TWO ITEMS OF THREAT THAT DOESN T MEAN THAT WE UNDERFUNDED ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WAS ALREADYON THE BOARD  BUT IT DOES MEAN WE TRIED TO FOCUS THIS BILL A LITTLE BIT BETTER              NOW WITHIN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION  THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT                AGENCIES  AS I MENTIONED EARLIER  SOME OF THEM ARE FUNCTIONING                EXTRAORDINARILY WELL  SOMEARE FUNCTIONING IN BETWEEN  AND SOME SIMPLY ARE NOT DOING AS GOOD A JOB AS WEHOPED THEY COULD DO   REGRETTABLY  THIS AGENCY  EVEN THOUGH IT S ONLY BEEN AROUND              FOR TWO YEARS  HAS HAD OVER 486 REPORTS WRITTEN ABOUT IT BY EITHER                THE INSPECTOR GENERAL  THE CRS OR THE GAO AND I BROUGHT THEM WITH ME BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE SO STAGGERINGIN THEIR PROPORTIONS THAT IT S REALLY WORTH LOOKING AT JUST THE PHYSICAL PROPORTIONSTHE NUMBER OF THESE REPORTS  IT S THIS PILE HERE  AND IF YOU TAKE THIS PILE HEREWHICH I PROBABLY CAN T EVEN PICK UP  AND THIS PILE HERE AND PUT IT ON TOP HERE YOU END UP WITH    THEY LL ALL FALL OVER  UNFORTUNATELY  YOU END UP WITH ALMOST3  9 OF REPORTS ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN T GOING THAT WELL AT THE HOMELANDSECURITY DEPARTMENT                           EACH ONE OF THESE REPORTS IS SUBSTANTIVE               EACH ONE OF THESE REPORTS IS WORTH REVIEW AND REQUIRES ACTION               THEY              REFLECT THE FACT                  THAT TWO YEARS  ALMOST THREE  YEARS AFTER THIS AGENCY WAS PUT TOGETHER  THE AGENCY HAS SOME VERY SERIOUS            PROBLEMS  AND THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED              NOW I CONGRATULATE THE NEW SECRETARY  MR  CHERTOFF               FOR HIS APPROACH TO TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS               HE IS                  GOING TO REPORT TO US WEDNESDAY    OR THURSDAY WHAT HIS SECOND STAGE REVIEW IS  HE S PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO                  THIS  BUT I THINK HIS APPROACH WILL PROBABLY BE BASED ON THE                  CONCEPT THAT YOU HAVE    TO HAVE  FIRST  A POLICY DRIVEN APPROACH  AND SECONDLY  IT HAS TO BE SYSTEM WIDE              THERE IS TOO MUCH ANECDOTAL REACTION WITHIN THE AGENCY               THERE IS TOO MUCH HAPHAZARD REACTION  THERE IS TOO MUCH REACTION                  TO THE CRISIS OF THE DAY  HIS APPROACH     I THINK  IS GOING TO BE A MUCH MORE SYSTEMIZED APPROACH  BUT THAT ISN T GOING    TO IMMEDIATELY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM  HOPEFULLY IT WILL BEGIN TO RESOLVE THE    PROBLEMS OF THIS AGENCY  WHICH ARE MANY AND ACUTE               BUT THIS BILL DOES PUT IN PLACE A LARGE NUMBER OF              WHAT  FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD WE IN THE CONGRESS CALL FENCES               WHERE WE ESSENTIALLY                  SAY TO THE AGENCY      BEFORE YOU GET THIS MONEY  YOU VE GOT TO SHOW US THAT YOU RE GOING TO DO      THIS EFFECTIVELY       IT REALLY ISN T SOMETHING I LIKE TO DO  I M A LEGISLATIVE HERE  I M NOT                  A MANAGER  I USED TO BE A GOVERNOR OF A STATE  THAT S A MANAGEMENT                  POSITION       BUT WHEN      YOU SEE AN AGENCY THAT HAS AS MANY FUNCTIONS THAT AREN T FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY      AS      THIS AGENCY HAS  REGRETTABLY  I DO THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE      CONGRESS  ESPECIALLY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE  WHICH HAS A UNIQUE OVERSIGHT      ROLE       TO STEP IN AND SAY BEFORE WE GIVE YOU MORE MONEY TO DO THIS  WE WANT TO                  MAKE SURE      THAT MONEY ISN T GOING TO BE WASTED  MISMANAGED  MISPLACED  MISAPPROPRIATED       AND SO WE RE GOING TO REQUIRE YOU TO DO SOMETHING ELSE  SO THIS BILL HAS      IN IT A LOT OF WHAT I WOULD CALL FENCES  THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL  AS I                  MENTIONED  IS      TO FUND MORE AGGRESSIVELY THOSE AREAS WHICH WE SEE AS THREATS              NOW OBVIOUSLY TODAY  AFTER LONDON  MANY PEOPLE ARE              GOING TO FEEL THAT A THREAT WHICH NEEDS TO RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION              IS THE                  QUESTION OF HOW WE        HANDLE MASS        TRANSIT  AND I COULDN T AGREE MORE  THERE IS NO QUESTION  BUT IN LIGHT        OF THE LONDON ATTACK           AND WE KNEW THIS LONG BEFORE THIS  THE MADRID ATTACK  AND BEFORE THAT        WE VE SEEN THIS AS CERTAINLY AS BEING  CERTAINLY WITH THE ISRAELI SITUATION         A CLEAR        AREA WHERE TERRORISTS WHO HAVE NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE TEND TO FOCUS                  THEIR HEINOUS ACTIVITY  WE KNOW MASS TRANSIT IS AN ISSUE  BUT                  THE QUESTION BECOMES        HOW DO YOU        BEST PROTECT MASS TRANSIT              WELL  WE HAVE PUT IN THIS BILL OVER THE LAST FEW              YEARS LITERALLY TENS OF MILLIONS  NOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS               WHICH                  IS AVAILABLE          FOR UPGRADING          SECURITY           FOR UPGRADING ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE  FOR UPGRADING BOMB DOG ACTIVITY           FOR UPGRADING THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS ON MASS TRANSPORTATION                   AND THERE          IS PRESENTLY          PENDING IN FACT  WITHIN THE FEDERAL TREASURY  ABOUT  115 MILLION TO                   150 MILLION THAT JUST SIMPLY HAS NOT BEEN SPENT  THERE S BEEN                  SO MUCH MONEY          PUT INTO THIS          SO QUICKLY IT HASN T BEEN SPENT  AND IT S STILL AVAILABLE  ON TOP OF          THAT  THERE IS THE  7 BILLION WHICH WE HAVE PUT INTO RESPONDER MONEY          WHICH  IF          STATES WANTED          TO REALLOCATE SOME OF THAT TOWARDS MASS TRANSIT PROTECTION  THEY COULD           AND THAT HASN T BEEN SPENT                SO THERE S REALLY A LOT OF MONEY SITTING THERE              FOR THE PURPOSES OF HELPING MASS TRANSIT OUT  IF YOU TALK TO THE              PEOPLE WHO                  RUN THE MASS            TRANSIT             THEY LL SAY            IT S NOT ENOUGH  BUT AS A PRACTICAL MATTER  IT HASN T BEEN SPENT                  YET  SO WHETHER IT S ENOUGH OR NOT  IT S ALMOST IRRELEVANT                   BECAUSE UNTIL            IT GETS            SPENT  IT S            CLEARLY ENOUGH  INDEPENDENT OF THAT  HOWEVER  ALONG WITH THE FACT                  THAT THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS IN THE STREAM OF THINGS                   WE HAVE            THE ISSUE OF            HOW DO YOU EFFECTIVELY DEFEND MASS TRANSIT               WE ALL KNOW THAT MASS TRANSIT IS SUCH A HUGE ENTERPRISE              WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS  TENS OF MILLIONS IF              YOU                  TAKE ALL THE              TRANSIT SYSTEMS              IN THIS              COUNTRY  ARE MOVING IN AND OUT OF DIFFERENT TRANSIT MODEM  WHETHER              IT S TRAIN  BUSES  FERRIES  ARE MOVING IN AND OUT OF THESE ON A                  CONSTANTLY CHURNING BASIS               AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK THIS TYPE OF A SYSTEM ARE ALMOST              ENDLESS  A PROFESSIONAL TERRORIST    AND CLEARLY THESE PEOPLE ARE              PROFESSIONAL               THEY TRAIN              FOR THE PURPOSES              OF KILLING PEOPLE  USING TERRORIST WEAPONS  PROFESSIONAL TERRORISTS              ARE              ALWAYS  ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND IN A NATION OUR                  SIZE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE IN THE AIR AREA OF                  MASS TRANSITS               THEY RE              GOING TO BE              ABLE TO FIND A POINT OF ATTACK THAT IS NOT SECURE  UNLESS    I                  DOUBT CLEARLY THAT              WE COULD SPEND ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH MONEY  WE D HAVE ENOUGH MONEY              TO SPEND TO MAKE MASS TRANSIT SAFE  AND WE D PROBABLY MAKE MASS            TRANSIT NONFUNCTIONAL              WE CAN RAISE VISIBILITY BY PUTTING MORE OFFICERS              ON TRAINS AND WE CAN HAVE MORE BOMB DOGS AND MORE SURVEILLANCE              SYSTEMS  AND                  WE SHOULD                DO                THAT  BUT                AS A PRACTICAL                MATTER  THE WAY YOU PROTECT YOUR MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM IS THE SAME                WAY YOU PROTECT YOUR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS  IT S THROUGH                AGGRESSIVE AND                ROW ROBUST INTELLIGENCE                 YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE BEFORE THEY ATTACK YOU             THAT S THE KEY TO THIS EXERCISE    ROBUST INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY                  AND THERE IS SOME IRONY HERE BECAUSE TO ACCOMPLISH                ROBUST INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY YOU VE GOT TO GO WHERE THE PEOPLE                COME FROM  WHERE                  DO THEY COME FROM  THEY                  COME FROM THE MIDDLE EAST  WE ARE FIGHTING THEM IN THE MIDDLE                  EAST  AND YET PEOPLE                  WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WANT TO PUT DRAMATICALLY NEW DOLLARS                  INTO THE MASS TRANSIT SYSTEMS  WELL  THE BEST PLACE TO GET                  INTELLIGENCE  QUITE HONESTLY                   IS                  THE PLACE WHERE THESE BREEDING GROUNDS OCCUR OF THESE TERRORISTS                                IRAQ  AFGHANISTAN              AND SO THE WAR IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN IS  AS THE              PRESIDENT HAS POINTED OUT A NUMBER OF TIMES  TAKING THE WAR TO              THEM                  TO FIND                    THEM BEFORE                    THEY CAN FIND                    US                     AND THEN ONCE YOU CAPTURE THESE PEOPLE  YOU GET THE INTELLIGENCE                    FROM THEM  WHICH IS WHY GUANTANAMO BAY IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT                    PART OF OUR                    INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY  AND WHY WHEN PEOPLE COME DOWN TO                  THE FLOOR AND COMPARE IT                    TO                    A NAZI CONCENTRATION                    CAMP IT IS SUCH A GROSS MISSTATEMENT OF WHAT OUR PURPOSE                  IS THERE AND WHAT THE                    ACTUAL ACTION IS THERE THAT IT IS TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO                    MAKE STATEMENTS SUCH AS THAT  NO ONE HAS EVER LOST THEIR                  LIVES AT                    GUANTANAMO BAY                     AND THE INTERROGATIONS WHICH OCCUR THERE OCCUR UNDER STRICT                    REGIMES WHICH                    ARE CONSTANTLY                    MONITORED                    AND                    WHICH MEET ALL THE NECESSARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF LEGAL AND            HUMAN RIGHTS              BUT WE GET VAST AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AS A RESULT              OF MOVING VERY BAD PEOPLE FROM THE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ARENA OVER                      TO GUANTANAMO BAY                       WE GET VAST                      AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHICH GIVES                      US THE                      INTELLIGENCE WE            NEED               AND THEN  OF COURSE  YOU HAVE THE ISSUE OF PROFILING  CLEARLY                        IF YOU RE GOING TO STOP THESE PEOPLE  YOU RE GOING TO                  HAVE TO PROFILE                         BUT THAT S                        BEING RESISTED                AND THEN  OF COURSE THERE IS THE ISSUE OF THE PATRIOT                        ACT  CLEARLY IF YOU RE GOING TO STOP THESE PEOPLE  YOU                        HAVE                        TO KNOW WHAT THEY RE                        DOING                         THE WAY                        YOU DO THROUGH THAT IS THROUGH ELECTRONIC INTERDICTION                        OF THEIR ACTIVITIES TO LARGE                        DEGREE  AND YET YOU HAVE PEOPLE RESISTING THE PATRIOT            ACT               INTELLIGENCE IS THE KEY TO DEFENDING OUR MASS TRANSIT                          SYSTEMS  AND YET WITHIN THIS BODY  REGRETTABLY  THERE                          IS A LOT OF                          RESISTANCE TO                          THOSE                          ELEMENTS OF                          OUR EFFORTS WHICH ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY                          PURSUE STRONG INTELLIGENCE  BUT THAT S REALLY NOT AN                          ISSUE FOR THIS            BILL              THE HOMELAND SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ROLE IS NOT AT              THE MARGIN  BUT IT S CERTAINLY NOT AT THE CENTER  TO                  GATHER INTELLIGENCE                             THAT S                            DONE BY                            OTHER AGENCIES               THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT  C I A  AND F B I               HOWEVER  I CERTAINLY AM WILLING TO ENTERTAINING              MOVING MORE MONEY INTO MASS TRANSIT  WE COULD PROBABLY                  DO ANOTHER  100                              MILLION                              INTO MASS TRANSIT                              AND                              NOT AFFECT THIS                              BILL
