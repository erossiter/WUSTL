Senator Gregg Champions Needed Funds For White Mountain National Forest At Senate Hearing  Contact Erin Rath  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today questioned officials from the U S  Department of Agriculture about proposed cuts to the White Mountain National Forest budget at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Environment  of which Senator Gregg is a member   Questioning Mark Rey  Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment  U S  Department of Agriculture  Senator Gregg asked why funding has been cut for the White Mountain National Forest  which is one of the most visited national forests in the country  Senator Gregg received assurances from Mr  Rey that he would look into this matter closely   Senator Gregg stated  The White Mountain National Forest is one of the most visited forests in the country  and certainly THE most visited east of the Mississippi  Millions of people use the forest because its right there  Its 4 hours from New York  an hour and a half from Boston  and its a great and beautiful spot  Yet  I notice that the budget for the forest is being reduced by 10   which will reduce the forestry programs there by 25   reduce the recreational proposals by 15   reduce the seasonal employees by 75   it will eliminate the leverage programs we have relative to trail protection  and the permanent timber personal are being reassigned to other resource areas  That I presume is a function of the need to spend money somewhere else  I recognize theres tremendous pressure out West to fight fires and that is absorbing huge amounts of money  and that reduced timber harvesting has reduced revenues for forest management  In the context of those resource pressures  it seems to me that we should not be putting a place like the White Mountains  which has a unique role in the Forest system with millions of visitors and a multi use forest  on a path to failure  The White Mountain National Forest recently received notice from the U S  Forest Service that the forest will have to reduce its operations to address a  900 000 shortfall in fiscal year 2007  Approximately 6 7 million visitors come to the Whites every year  compared to 4 million annual visitors to the Grand Canyon    The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests is deeply concerned by the U S  Forest Services proposed mid year budget cut for the White Mountain National Forest  said Jane Difley  president forester of the Forest Society  Cutting 10 percent  or almost a million dollars  will not only affect the quality of the experience for the millions of recreational visitors to the White Mountains  but also impact long term management of the Forests water and timber resources  Given that the WMNF management plan was recently completed following more than a decade of grassroots consensus building  the timing of the proposed budget cuts could not be worse  Our organization was founded over a century ago to protect the White Hills of New Hampshire  Difley continued  The Forest Society greatly appreciates that Senator Gregg has brought the Forest Services proposed cuts to the attention of Senate Appropriations Committee  and looks forward to working with the Senator and the rest of the New Hampshire delegation to maintain funding for White Mountain National Forest  Senator Gregg also took the opportunity to voice his continued support for the Forest Legacy program  a land conservation program which New Hampshire has used to conserve over 230 000 acres  including the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters   Gregg stated  Forest Legacy has been a tremendous program  especially in the East where we are still interested in protecting significant tracts of land  and particularly in a place like New Hampshire which is in the path of the megalopolis  In the West  I can understand how some of the states are overwhelmed with federal ownership  they feel like they have enough and would probably like to sell some  Unfortunately  the Forest Legacy funds have dropped by 71  in the budget request from three years ago  even though the Administration initially supported Forest Legacy with some robustness and so I regret that this years request is rather piddling  The fiscal year 2008 budget requests only  29 million for the program  compared to  100 million in the 2005 request
