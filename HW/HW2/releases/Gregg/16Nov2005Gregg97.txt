New Hampshire has a national reputation              for the high quality of life its citizens enjoy  and this is due              in no small part to the many men and women who watch over our neighborhoods               These federal funds will help ensure that they have the necessary              and up to date tools and resources they need to carry out their              responsibilities  and to protect our greatest asset  our children    New Hampshire Department of Safety Commissioner                Richard Flynn              stated  Senator Greggs continued support of New Hampshire              law enforcement benefits all citizens of New Hampshire by providing              building blocks for collaboration and innovation in an effort to              keep the citizens of New Hampshire and our visitors safe    Swanzey Police Chief Richard V  C  Busick stated  The              news that our Regional Prosecutor Program was receiving a federal              grant could not have come at a better time  As we completed the              third quarter of 2005 the program had reached maximum capacity              and capability  To continue providing this service to the eight              partner towns we needed to address the escalating case loads and              our ability to provide the quality prosecutions for those communities               We have staffing and space needs  This grant is a shot in the arm              and will greatly assist in our forging ahead and will help sustain              the program for several years  As we look ahead the grant may also              allow for additional smaller towns in Cheshire County to benefit              from our professional prosecution program  The victims and citizens              of Cheshire County will be greatly served by this grant  On behalf              of all the partner towns I thank Senator Gregg for his hard work              in making this grant a reality   State Police Colonel Fred Booth stated  With Senator Greggs              support  technology innovations such as J ONE resources network              development and more crime fighting on our streets via state and              local collaboration under Streetsweeper can be dispersed statewide               enhancing safety for officers and the public  Thanks to Operation              Streetsweeper  the State Police has pooled its resources and teamed              up with local and county law enforcement agencies  as well as federal              agencies  in an effort to address the gang and drug related problems              that were flourishing in certain areas of the state   UNH Professor Thomas Miller commented that as a direct              result of the continued support of Senator Gregg  the Universitys              partnership with the New Hampshire Department of Safety has evolved              from local effort into a nationally recognized program  The Project54              system has already been deployed in hundreds of cruisers in state              and local police agencies throughout New Hampshire  Moreover  the              Project54 system has received national acclaim and is setting new              standards for law enforcement technology  with a direct impact              on the safety and effectiveness of law enforcement officers in              the field  A special effort in the coming year will focus on a              new way of providing low cost wireless data services to local police              departments  solving a major problem that almost all of them face               None of this would have occurred without the efforts of Senator              Gregg
