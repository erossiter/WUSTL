                               GREGG CALLS FOR IMPROVED PLAN               FOR BORDER SECURITY MANAGEMENT                 WASHINGTON               U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Appropriations              Subcommittee on Homeland Security  has called on the Department              of Homeland Security to quickly develop a comprehensive plan for              national border security  Senator Gregg sent a letter with this              recommendation to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff              last week  The text of the letter sent on May 19  2004  follows   I continue to grow concerned with the approach that the Administration              has taken to determine resource levels for the Department of Homeland              Security  and specifically the level of resources necessary to              properly manage our Nation s borders  The ultimate goal remains              unmet  to ensure the smooth passage of trade and people with legitimate              business across our borders while stopping those who would do us              harm   Currently  the Department reacts in a piecemeal fashion to each              crisis as it occurs  For example  the Arizona Border Control Initiative              was launched in March of 2004 to achieve operational control of              the Arizona border  causing a large influx of resources into that              region while contributing to the creation of new crises by drawing              down resources needed elsewhere along the border  We must address              the entire border systematically and not continue pouring resources              into stove piped organizations and narrowly construed strategies    The final recommendation in the December 13  2004  Heritage Foundation              report DHS 2 0  Rethinking the Department of Homeland Security              could not be more clear on this subject   DHS must conduct a national              assessment of the resources required for effective border security               including all the layers of security that impact securing the border               This analysis should be used to help Congress and the Administration              determine where to direct resources to ensure that funding is directed              toward programs that provide the greatest contribution to supporting              the critical border security mission    The lack of an independent assessment of the optimal staffing              and equipment levels required to close border gaps and vulnerabilities              severely limits the Administration s ability to make informed recommendations               and the Congress s ability to make appropriate resource decisions               This situation must be remedied    The Department should immediately contract with an outside organization to  conduct an assessment of the personnel  including border patrol agents  inspectors   investigators  trade enforcement agents  detention officers  etc   air assets   marine assets  electronic surveillance equipment  detention beds  and any resources  needed to achieve proper control of the borders    I trust you agree  and will act on this recommendation expeditiously               We need to know the appropriate level of resources required to              secure our Nation s borders and put the Department on a timetable              for meeting those needs  Please respond in writing  within 30 days               on the progress you have made to initiate this national assessment            and the timeline for its completion
