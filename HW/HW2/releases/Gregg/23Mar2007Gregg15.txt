Senator Gregg Comments on Senate Passage of FY 2008 Budget Resolution  The budget passed by the Senate today is not a good budget for the country  It increases taxes by more than  700 billion on American families and businesses  it contains billions in new spending  and it drives the debt up by at least  2 4 trillion  But most regrettably  this budget squanders the opportunity to address the fiscal tsunami we will face as the Baby Boom generation retires      Reasonable amendments that would help keep entitlement programs like Medicare solvent and lessen the crushing burden on future generations have been rejected  So what we are left with is a classic tax and spend budget that grows the government and yet does nothing to help our children pay for it     With  67 trillion in unfunded obligations  this issue is too big to ignore  I will continue to work to address the serious problems posed by entitlement spending  and hope to join forces with colleagues in a bipartisan manner to find solutions
