               GREGG CALLS FOR REVISITING EXCESS PROFIT TAXES ON OIL  FUNDS TO                BE USED FOR LIHEAP AND DEFICIT REDUCTION                                   WASHINGTON               U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made a statement calling for              reinstitution of an excess profit tax on oil  Senator Gregg stated   Over the past few days  while the public and our nationaleconomy are suffering under the huge burden of costs of oil and gas  it is infuriatingthat one part of the economic sector is reporting record breaking profits  somein the  10 billion quarterly range  With people being forced to pay  3 a gallonfor gas and  2 50 for oil to heat their homes  it is apparent that the oil companieshave taken advantage of the trust of the American people     As a result of this  I believe it is time to take a serious              look at reinstituting an excess profit tax on oil companies with              the proceeds being put towards the low income home energy assistance              program and deficit reduction  I intend to pursue options in this              area over the coming weeks    Some might call this a novel approach for me  but I cannot sit              back in good conscience while those in our society struggling to              heat their homes are being left in the cold by oil companies
