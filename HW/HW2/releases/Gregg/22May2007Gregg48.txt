Senator Gregg To CoSponsor Bipartisan Iraq Legislation  Contact Erin Rath  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that he intends to cosponsor legislation authored by Senator Ken Salazar  D CO  and Senator Lamar Alexander  R TN  that seeks to legislatively implement the findings of the Iraq Study Group  The bipartisan Iraq study group  which was co chaired by James Baker  a former Secretary of State under President George H  W  Bush  and Lee Hamilton  a former Democratic U S  Representative from Indiana  announced their findings and recommended solutions in late November 2006  Distinguished panelists also included Sandra Day OConnor and Leon Panetta  among others  The Salazar Alexander legislation  which I intend to cosponsor  officially establishes the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group as our nations policy  and it requires the President to report to Congress periodically on actions being taken to implement them  stated Senator Gregg  While the Administration already has taken some significant steps along the lines of the Iraq Study Groups report  taken as a whole  the report lays out a comprehensive plan that was forged out of consensus  and I believe that it is one that can change the political climate here in Congress and lead to an acceptable end to the Iraq war  Among other things  this legislation expressly ties our military and economic support for the Iraqi government to benchmarks  makes the training of the Iraqi security forces a top priority  and addresses the full impact of the war in Iraq on our nations budget and the U S  military  To date  the war in Iraq has been difficult and mistakes have been made  The coming months will be a critical period that tests our nations resolve even further and could have ramifications for decades to come  The Iraq Study Group Implementation Act of 2007 helps chart a responsible path forward and it does so in a way that prizes serious  thoughtful policy over partisan rhetoric  We cannot expect the Iraqi government to make difficult political compromises in a short period of time unless we lead by example here in Congress  I applaud the leadership of Senators Salazar and Alexander and hope that all of my Senate colleagues can support our bill  Over the coming months  I will continue working to help chart a path forward in Iraq that can give the Iraqis the best chance for a better future and long term stability for the region and beyond  As the distinguished co chairs of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group wrote  our likelihood to succeed in Iraq is directly tied to our ability to forge a broad consensus here at home that crosses party lines and supports a policy which is adequately funded and sustainable  I supported an Iraqi government benchmark and U S  troop redeployment proposal offered by Senator John Warner last week  which received a majority bipartisan vote of 52 44 but was ultimately not adopted since it failed to obtain the necessary 60 votes for cloture  I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group Implementation Act of 2007  which will be introduced shortly  will be a proposal that can generate even broader support and put in place a balanced  responsible plan for the war in Iraq
