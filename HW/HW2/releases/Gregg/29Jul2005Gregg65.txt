being undertaken at some of these forests and wildlife refuges              in New Hampshire is having a greater impact than merely protecting              beautiful lands  It is giving scientists and researchers ways to              protect and improve similar environments around the country  They              are doing outstanding work making sure thousands of acres of some              of New

beautiful  lakes  while at the same time providing housing for scientists of the Hubbard  Brook Ecosystem Study  HBES   HBES has become a world force in ecosystem thinking   making major discoveries regarding the effects of timber harvesting  climate  change  acid rain  and other natural and manmade disturbances  NSRC provides  vital funding for a wide variety of research projects across the Northern Forest   from ecosystem science to forest economics to timber management practices   Senator Gregg understands completely that good environmental policy flows from  a solid base of scientific knowledge  often on very complex issues    Dennis Shaffer  Northern New England Field Office Director for              the Trust for Public Land  stated   The Trust for Public Land applauds
