Senator Gregg Comments on Immigration Cloture Vote Contact  Erin Rath   U S  Senator Judd Gregg stated  Although I strongly believe we need immigration reform  the bill as amended on the floor has a number of fatal flaws and due to the procedural situation  a vote for cloture would lock in those flaws  Thus I have voted against cloture in hopes that we can return to the bill and amend and improve it   Senator Gregg s May 2007 OpEd on the need for Immigration Reform  Protecting Americas borders and reforming our immigration system are two of the most significant issues we face today as a nation  A porous border poses a tremendous threat to our national security and illegal immigration undermines our sensibilities about the rule of law and fairness  At the same time  we must never fail to remember that the culture and strength of America is defined and energized by immigration  It is hard to imagine what our country would be like today without the contributions of immigrants  Our nations success  the victories in the battlefield  the expansion of our nations frontiers  the creation and growth of successful companies such as Intel or Google  is the product of our longstanding embrace of immigrants   Immigration reform starts with border security  and we have made significant progress over recent years in this area  During the last Congress  as Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee  I made increasing border security funding a top priority to help rein in illegal immigration and restore control of our nation s borders  In 2006 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act included  5 3 billion in increased funding for border  port  and maritime security  Among other things  this legislation provides  1 5 billion for new border security fencing  infrastructure  and technology  and it added 4 000 new Border Patrol agents  1 373 new detention personnel  and 6 700 new detention beds for apprehended illegal aliens  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  now has the necessary resources to end its catch and release policy for apprehended illegal immigrants  Also  in 2006  ICE set a new record for removing illegal immigrants from the country  and the agency has stepped up its worksite enforcement efforts   Border security alone cannot effectively address the issues raised by illegal immigration  Human nature says that as long as a person trying to feed and care for his or her family will make five dollars a day in Mexico  while they would be able to make fifty dollars a day in the United States  there will be huge incentive for that person to want to come here  This is why we now have millions of immigrants here illegally  making up over five percent of our labor force  I understand and share the concerns of many Americans about this reality  I believe that we must address it and fix our immigration system once and for all so that we do not encourage more illegal immigration in the future  First  we need a new guest worker system that will give employers no more excuses for hiring undocumented aliens to fill jobs when Americans are unavailable  Employers would be required to use this new program  which should have adequate visa levels and protections in place so that American workers are not adversely impacted  Guest workers would come in under a temporary visa and be required to leave once the visa expires  Rigorous enforcement  including a mandatory employment verification system and tough penalties for those that hire illegal immigrants outside the program  will help ensure that employers follow the law   For the millions of illegal immigrants who have been here for years  we must offer a realistic  balanced approach that will bring people out of the shadows so we can account for them  We should provide an opportunity for these immigrants to stay here lawfully if they meet certain conditions  namely  if they have resided here for many years  learn English  pay a sizeable fine and taxes  and pass criminal background checks   We must reform how our nation distributes green cards  which give immigrants legal permanent status and puts them on the pathway to citizenship  For decades  green cards have been distributed mainly on the basis of a family relationship with someone who already has a green card or is a U S  citizen  including relatives well outside the immediate family  This ineffective system must end  Instead  the privilege of receiving a green card and citizenship should be based on the shared goals of unifying only immediate family members and our national interest  similar to the immigration policies of Canada and Australia  Like these countries  we should establish a merit based point system that gives preference to visa applicants who have the skills and attributes that will make our economy and way of life stronger  For years  I have pushed for legislation along these lines  including proposals to provide more visas to high skilled workers and reallocate green cards to a new lottery program for those who have advanced degrees in engineering  science  and other critical areas vital for our nations economy  The issue of immigration raises strong passions on both sides  however  this must not stop us from passing comprehensive reform that truly fixes our immigration laws  Our immigration system can  and should  be more closely tied to our national interests  and it must be structured so that we restore the rule of law and give those who want to come here a reasonable and legal opportunity to do so  Building on my continued work to improve border security  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on this critical issue and hope that this Congress can pass a bill of which we can all be proud   To read Senator Gregg s floor statement on the immigration reform bill  pleaseclick onthe following link Immigration Reform Bill
