Gregg Announces Senate Support for Granite State Ocean and Fisheries Research Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that the Senate has approved  14 086 million in federal funding for two joint University of New Hampshire National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine programs in the 2008 budget for NOAA  The measure contains  7 424 million for the Joint Hydrographic Center and  6 662 million for the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science  Senator Gregg has secured this funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 funding measure  which now heads to a joint House Senate conference committee before returning to each chamber for final passage  The funding for these projects is included within the Committee allocation set out for the Fiscal Year 2008 spending measures  A full description of each program is attached   Senator Gregg stated  So much of New Hampshires history has been shaped by coastal activities and we have a responsibility to preserve our oceans and coastline for future generations to enjoy  The researchers and students at UNH are leading the field in a wide variety of critical coastal studies  including mapping of the ocean floor and pollution detection and prevention  UNH has taken the initiative to concentrate on these areas and its strong dedication will ensure the future health of sensitive coastal areas  With Senator Greggs continued support  the UNH NOAA Joint Hydrographic Center is making important contributions to the Nations nautical charting and seafloor mapping programs  says Dr  Larry Mayer  UNH co director  New tools and technology developed at the center have led to higher quality charts and maps and improved productivity in the nautical charting process  In the coming year  also thanks to Senator Greggs leadership  the Joint Hydrographic Center will play a primary role in conducting continental shelf surveys to extend the jurisdiction of the United States beyond the existing 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone and help secure the Nations access to and protection of valuable seafloor resources  We are indebted to Senator Gregg for his longstanding support of science that directly targets the needs of coastal communities  says Dr  Richard Langan  UNH co director of CICEET  the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology  a partnership of UNH and NOAA  So many of the environmental challenges along our coasts begin with the decisions we make about how coastal land is developed  and this year CICEET is launching a new initiative to address that  Thirteen projects  in states ranging from New Hampshire to Washington  are advancing technologies that coastal communities need to make decisions to protect natural resources  preserve cultural character  and maintain economic viability  In addition to our focus this year on land use  CICEET will continue to develop tools to manage storm water runoff  clean up polluted sediments in coastal waters  and stabilize shorelines in the face of sea level rise and extreme storms   Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Bill  New Hampshire Projects Securing Senate Approval  7 424 million  Joint Hydrographic Center  The NOAA UNH Joint Hydrographic Center is a national center of excellence developing innovative approaches to coastal and ocean mapping in support of safe navigation  fisheries management  national security and sovereignty  environmental and archaeological studies  and offshore exploration  Educational programs are interwoven with research to immerse NOAA personnel and students from around the world in advanced aspects of ocean mapping  With this award  the project will explore the use of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles for critical shallow water mapping needs  including  harbor security  improving the efficiency and productivity of national seafloor mapping programs  developing techniques to map and visualize large swaths of the water column in order to understand fish behavior  distribution  and perhaps biomass  and mapping the seafloor in support of US resource sovereignty under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea  Since 2000  Senator Gregg has secured  34 million in federal funding for the Center   6 662 million  Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology  CICEET is a UNH based national center that engages research institutions  the government and the private sector to develop and implement new tools to achieve clean water and healthy coasts  CICEET targets innovative solutions that are affordable  practical  and accessible to detect and prevent pollution and recover degraded coastal habitats  With these funds  CICEET will  enhance the use of new technologies to identify sources of bacterial and viral pathogens through demonstration  evaluation  and dissemination of results  implement initial evaluations of contaminated sediment treatment technologies in a new test site in the Piscataqua River near the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  improve capabilities of coastal decision makers to assess and predict pollution and habitat degradation resulting from different land use alternatives  and conduct research and development activities to reduce the cost  improve the ease of use  and increase availability of new water quality monitoring technologies   Since 1997  Senator Gregg has secured  58 7 million in federal funding for the CICEET
