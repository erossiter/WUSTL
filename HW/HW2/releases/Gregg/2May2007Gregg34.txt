Senator Gregg Comments on FDA Warning to Consumers About Illicit or Counterfeit Internet Pharmacies  Contact Erin Rath Jeff Turcotte  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  today commented on the recent warning by the U S  Food and Drug Administration that 24 websites identified by the FDA were selling counterfeit prescription medication  Senator Gregg has an amendment pending to the FDA reform bill being debated on the Senate floor this week that will require all Internet pharmacies which dispense prescription drugs in the United States be licensed by the Food and Drug Administration  and requires distributors to carry a tamper resistant seal of approval on their website to help consumers identify websites that are licensed by the FDA   FDAs recent warning serves as clarion call that there are rogue Internet pharmacies operating in cyberspace that can cause serious harm to consumers  Most of these websites are legitimate businesses that offer convenience and competitive pricing on genuine medications  However  as the FDA showed in their warning yesterday  there are Internet pharmacies that have the potential to harm their consumers   During our debate on the FDA reform bill in the coming days  I hope the Senate will approve my amendment to license Internet pharmacies operating in the United States  The Senate should have no greater concern during a debate on drug safety than the quality  reliability  integrity  and safety of the medicines consumers may be purchasing on line  As the FDA has shown  failing to guarantee their safety can have potentially disastrous results for unsuspecting consumers  Senator Greggs amendment is based on his Safe Internet Pharmacy Act of 2007  S  596  he introduced earlier this year  During the 109th Congress  Senator Gregg introduced the Safe IMPORT Act  S  184  which included provisions similar to those in the Safe Internet Pharmacy Act of 2007 regarding the licensing of Internet pharmacies  The warning by the FDA can be found at  http   www fda gov bbs topics NEWS 2007 NEW01623 html
