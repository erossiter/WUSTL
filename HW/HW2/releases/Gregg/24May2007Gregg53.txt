Senator Gregg Introduces Measure to Create a Safe Process to Provide Lower Cost    Follow On    Biological Medicines  Contact Erin Rath Jeff Turcotte  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  today introduced the Affordable Biologics for Consumers Act  ABC Act  of 2007  a measure that will give patients greater access to safe and affordable biologic medicines while protecting innovation and encouraging the development of new life saving therapies  The Senate HELP Committee is expected to mark up follow on biologics legislation in mid June   Biologics  which include many vaccines  insulin  intravenous medications  and a number of cancer treatments  differ from traditional prescription drugs because they are derived from living therapeutic proteins  Therefore  unlike a generic prescription drug  an exact duplicate is extremely difficult to produce  Current U S  law does not provide an accelerated approval process for follow on  or biosimilar  versions of biologic products after key manufacturers patents expire  Therefore patients do not have access to less expensive versions of biologic therapies in the same way that they have access to traditional generic prescription drugs   Biological products are among the most promising and effective medicines for the treatment of serious and life threatening diseases  Unfortunately  they are very expensive in most cases  stated Senator Gregg  While the federal government has created a system to bring lower cost alternatives to brand name prescription drugs to the market  manufacturers trying to create biosimilar products still have to undertake the same costly and time consuming process already completed by its predecessors  Congress must enact an accelerated path to market biosimilar products to help reduce the cost of health care while ensuring the safety of the products coming to market  Senator Greggs bill is co sponsored by Senators Richard Burr  R NC  and Tom Coburn  R OK  and is supported by a number of patient groups   Senator Gregg stated  This bill not only benefits the patients that will receive access to potentially life saving medicines at more affordable prices  but it will encourage innovation by ensuring intellectual property is respected and protected  Manufacturers of biologics spend millions of dollars on the research  manufacturing  and clinic trials for its products  and this bill encourages continued medical breakthroughs by protecting market based incentives for research and development without giving them a lifetime monopoly on their products    The Affordable Biologics for Consumers Act of 2007  Key Provisions Access to Biosimilars  Amends the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biological products that are similar to currently approved biologics   Science Based Standards  Recent reports have reminded everyone that medicine can have dangerous side effects  To ensure safety and efficacy of biosimilar products  they must meet the same approval standard as any other biological product by meeting the safe  pure  and potent standard  The legislation requires FDA to develop science based rules for approval of biologics to meet that test  The approval process must include   Data on the consistency and robustness of the manufacturing process for the similar biological product    Data on the stability  compatibility  and integrity of the active ingredient   Data fully characterizing the biosimilar in comparison with the reference product    Data from clinical trials and non clinical studies demonstrating that the biosimilar has a similar safety profile as the innovator product    A plan for post marketing safety monitoring including further immune reaction testing and additional clinical trials where appropriate     In addition  the manufacturing facilities where the biosimilar is made must meet good manufacturing standards  and the applicant must consent to an inspection of its facility     Protect Innovation  Unless biotechnology companies have a meaningful period of time to recoup the extraordinary expenses incurred in bringing these life saving medicines to market  U S  based research and development and patient access to new biotech medicines will be threatened     The legislation provides fourteen years of data exclusivity for innovator drug manufacturer products  with an additional two years available if the Secretary approves a new indication for the reference product that offers a significant clinical benefit during the twelve years after its initial authorization   The legislation establishes a patent notification process to handle potential patent disputes in an expedited fashion    Interchangeability  Physicians and other healthcare providers must retain the authority in all cases to determine  on the basis of their own professional judgment  which of two similar biological products a particular patient should receive     Because biosimilar products are not identical to the innovator product they resemble  this legislation therprohibits FDA from designating biosimilars as therapeutically equivalent to reference products  This protects physician patient relationship by preventing automatic substitution without the involvement of the treating physician      However  because there may come a day when biologic products can be produced that are equivalent to the innovtors reference product  the legislation also requires the Secretaryof HHS to report to Congress on whether therapeutic equivalence determinations have become scientifically feasible for biologics  and if so  what statutory criteria should govern them
