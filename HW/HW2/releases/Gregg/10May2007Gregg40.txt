 please find a transcript of Senator Greggs comments and a portion of the question and answer period of todays hearing   U S  SENATOR JUDD GREGG  R NH  OPENING STATEMENT    GREGG  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and thank you for holding this  hearing  And thank you  Madam Secretary  for being with us today  You  keep such a hectic schedule  I don t know how you do it  And we  appreciate you taking the time to be here  I know that the senator didn t mean to imply this  but I think  it s important for us to reinforce the fact that defending liberty and  promoting liberty around the world is not a mistake  It s a purpose  and a cause of our nation    has been and always should be  That we as a nation understand that freedom is something that  comes at a dear price  And we re willing to pay that price  And our efforts around the world have been to promote freedom and  to give people who haven t had the opportunities that we have had as a  nation  maybe the chance to see the light of freedom  Have we done it correctly at all times  No  But have we done it  with good purposes  Absolutely yes  And I would hope that we would  always view our foreign policy in that nature  In addition  the chairman asked  and rightly asked  how we can  create better relations around the world  because that should be one  of our causes and our goals  And I would say  one of the best ways to  do it is to have the secretary of state we have  You do an exceptional job  And I greatly admire your efforts   And I think when you travel across the globe  as you do on a regular  basis  you bring a face of America that is proud  intelligent   thoughtful and respected  And as a result  you yourself personify the great strengths of  our nation and present them so well across the world  We re very  lucky to have you serving us  So  I thank you for being here today  and I appreciate your  service  QUESTION AND ANSWER  GREGG  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  I recently had the chance to travel to  South America  and I recently had the chance to meet with the  president of Colombia  I would be interested in your assessment of the situation in  South America  especially relative to Colombia and our relationship  with Colombia and Venezuela  Because it appears to me to be a region  where we ve got some friends and we ve got some people who don t like  us that much  and we should be with our friends   RICE  Well  thank you  In fact  the president  Senator Gregg  as you remember  was  recently in Latin America and visited Colombia during that time   visited Bogota  The fact that he was able to go to Bogota says  something about how far Colombia has come in a relatively short period  of time  We do have a challenge in Latin America  We have a challenge   because those who have been democratically elected are trying to  deliver for their people and trying to remain allies of the United  States  And there are those  like Venezuela  that would challenge just  about everything about American interests and policy  including free  markets  including nationalizing industry  And they re a real  challenge to free markets  open economies and to democracy in Latin  America  It makes it even more important that states like Colombia  which  are trying to do the right things in terms of democracy and open  economies and free trade  be supported by the United States  In the year that President Uribe came to power  I think it s fair  to say that Colombia was on the brink of failure  on the brink of  being a failed state  It was  after all  a country where large  portions of the territory were uncontrolled by the government  where  terrorists were able to prevent the police or the army from even  coming into those areas  where bombings in Bogota  where security for  the population was something that was very difficult  almost  impossible for the government to deliver  And through a very strong campaign against terrorism  President  Uribe has begun to deliver some security to his people  I think it s  why he was reelected by such a large margin  They also are going after paramilitaries from the other side of  the political spectrum  He ordered paramilitary leaders to surrender  in August of 2006  Fifteen of the 24 top leaders did  They ve been  going after the others  And  frankly  the  inaudible  the judiciary and the supreme court  has been bringing people to account for what has happened in Colombia  over the last years  And so  I think  while it is not by any means perfect  and we  continue to have a dialogue with Colombia about the need for human  rights protections  the need for labor protections  the need for  continuing to prosecute the paramilitaries  this is really a case of a  democratically elected leader that has been able to bring his country  back from the precipice of being a failed state  And just imagine what South America  with the challenge of  someone like Hugo Chavez  would be without strong allies like Colombia  in the Andean region  GREGG  Thank you  It s represented by some that Chavez and the Venezuelan  government is basically protecting  or at least not extraditing  narcoterrorists back to Colombia    members of FARC   Is that the view of the State Department that that s an accurate  representation  RICE  There are cases that the Colombian government has raised   I think  with the Venezuelans concerning who may be continuing to live  in or operate in Venezuela  And we just hope that all of Colombia s  neighbors will not harbor  in any fashion  people who ought to be  brought to justice  GREGG  On another subject  you recently had an opportunity to  meet with representatives of Syria  As we look at the Middle East   obviously  Syria has for years been a funder of terrorism and  terrorist groups  There seems to be a mutation  however  of the terrorist cadre  in  that the more structured terrorist groups  such as Hamas and  Hezbollah  now find themselves with the more distant groups  such as  Al Qaida  that are not as orchestrated  essentially  or at least  funded  And so  I m interested in your view of where Syria now    what  Syria s role now is in the area of funding  supporting and promoting  terrorism in the traditional struggle relative to Israel and in the  struggle in Iraq  RICE  Syria continues to be a major funder of terrorism  a major  harborer of those elements of the Palestinian political elite  for  instance  who are opposed to a two state solution  who are the ones  who continue to perpetrate violence in the Palestinian territories and  to attempt to do it in Israel  And so  in terms of Middle East peace  the Syrians are a real  problem for leaders like Mahmoud Abbas  who want to take a different  course toward a two state solution  When it comes to Iraq  we are very concerned about the foreign  fighters that are transiting the Syrian border and are  therefore   doing great harm to innocent Iraqis and to our forces  And that was  the focus of the conversation that I had with the Syrian foreign  minister  It was about Iraq  This was not a conversation about U S  Syrian relations  This  was about what Syria needs to do to stem the tide of those foreign  fighters and to help the Iraqis to secure their borders  And then finally  as to Lebanon  there Syria and its allies  continue on a daily basis  really  to threaten the stability of the  democratically elected government of Fuad Siniora  to resist theestablishment of an international tribunal  despite the fact that thattribunal is established by the United Nations  Their allies continue to try to block the convening of that  tribunal  And Syria needs to allow that tribunal to go forward   because people need to answer for what happened to former prime  minister  Rafik Hariri  And we need to see who was behind it   And so  Syria is a significant problem  not just for American  policy in the Middle East  but for democratic forces that are trying  to take hold in the Middle East  One point that I made to my Syrian counterpart is that we should  talk about Iraq and we should talk about what we can do to help the  Iraqis  But U S  Syrian relations would depend on a great deal more   GREGG  I appreciate that  I guess my question    the logical follow up question is    how  should we engage Syria  And how does Israel view Syria   RICE  Well  I ll not try to speak for the Israelis  except to  say that their statements are consistent in public and in private with  what they say in public and what they ve said to us in private   And obviously  everyone would like to see peace between Israel  and Syria  If it were possible  I think everybody would jump at the  chance  But Syrian behavior is such that  particularly in the support  that it gives to elements of Hamas that are preventing a two state  solution  it s not exhibited an attitude that suggests that it s ready  for or intending to try and pursue peace  As to how we deal with Syria  we have had this limited discussion  with them on Iraq  because we want all of Iraq s neighbors to help  Iraq  It makes only good sense  if the neighbors believe what they re  saying  which is that a stable Iraq is in their interest  then they  need to behave that way  And that was the message to Syria  But beyond that  we ve been very clear that there is nothing to  be done that does not allow that tribunal to take place in Lebanon and  that does not stop support for the Palestinian organizations that are  engaged in terrorism
