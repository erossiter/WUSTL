                               SENATOR GREGG COMMENTS ON TOMORROW S BRAC COMMISSION HEARING IN                BOSTON                    WASHINGTON                 U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement              regarding tomorrow s hearing of the Base Realignment and Closure              Commission in Boston   Senator Gregg stated   Tomorrow is obviously the big day for              us as we make our presentation to the BRAC Commission relative              to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  The delegation  working with              the Governors  has made a tremendous commitment to this effort               I think we ve got our ducks in order  We intend to be very fact based              and make a very strong presentation and I believe we can show incontrovertibly              that the Navy substantially deviated from the criteria that it              was supposed to follow when it made this decision     Clearly Portsmouth is necessary for the strategic capability              of our country  The Navy simply can t keep the ships in the ocean                the submarines in the fleet   if it doesn t have Portsmouth s              capabilities  And we know the closing of Portsmouth means you take              out of the Navy Yard the most efficient Navy Yard in the Navy and              as a result the cost of overhauling these ships is going to go              up dramatically  So that s the essence of our case   that it violates              the rules relative to strategic value and that it will cost a heck              of a lot more to the taxpayers if Portsmouth were to close     We ve going to make an aggressive case and I m looking forward              to being a part of the presentation along with the rest of the              delegation and the Governor  We ve got two very significant folks                former Admirals   participating also so this is going to be a              strong presentation and a team effort    Senator Judd Gregg also recorded an audio actuality on tomorrow s              BRAC hearing  Senator Gregg s audio comments will be available              by calling 1 800 545 1267 and accessing mailbox 332 or on the Internet          at http   src senate gov public
