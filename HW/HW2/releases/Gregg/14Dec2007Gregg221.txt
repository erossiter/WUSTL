Senator Gregg Applauds Senate Passage of Mortgage Forgiveness Legislation Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WashingtonSenator Judd Gregg  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  today applauded the Senate passage  by unanimous consent  of legislation that will help millions of American homeowners hurt by the downturn in the housing market  Senator Gregg had originally offered the proposal as an amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill  but due to the urgent nature of the issue  he worked with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus to pass it as a free standing bill rather than be included in the Farm Bill  which is not expected to be signed into law until early next year  Today the Senate passed my language relative to mortgage forgiveness  The effect of this language is that people who unfortunately are subject to foreclosure as a result of this subprime meltdown  because their interest rates have jumped so dramatically  will not also be hit with an IRS tax lien   Its really unfortunate and clearly unfair to people whove gone through the trauma of having their home foreclosed on that all of a sudden theyre deemed by the IRS to have income for the forgiven part of their loan that is affected by the foreclosure  This is totally inappropriate and its something that shouldnt happen to anyoneto first have your home foreclosed on and then to have the IRS tax collector come after you for income that you never even received  So this amendment would put an end to that  and its a good amendment  Im glad that the Senate has agreed with it  and has passed it  and I hope that we can get it down to the President soon     As home prices and home sales have dropped precipitously across the country  more than 600 000 U S  homes are currently in foreclosure and more than 3 million Americans are currently behind on their mortgage payments  Senator Greggs legislation  which is co sponsored by Senators John Sununu  R NH   Wayne Allard  R CO   Arlen Specter  R PA  and Norm Coleman  R MN   encourages individuals and their lenders to negotiate a solution to avoid additional foreclosures by offering temporary tax relief     The Gregg legislation permits any homeowner who obtained a mortgage before January 1  2007 to receive mortgage forgiveness from their lender  tax free  The bill covers restructured mortgage agreements entered into after January 1  2007 and before December 31  2009  The tax forgiveness is available on mortgage indebtedness of up to  1 million  AUDIO  available at http   gregg senate gov or by calling 1 800 545 1267 and accessing mailbox 332
