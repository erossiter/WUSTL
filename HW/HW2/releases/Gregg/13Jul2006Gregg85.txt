                                                              SENATOR GREGG ANNOUNCES  4 5 MILLION FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY              RESEARCH AND FORECASTING EFFORTS MOVING THROUGH                  WASHINGTON                 U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that the Senate              Appropriations Committee has approved a measure containing  4 5              million in federal funding to continue projects that measure and              forecast air quality throughout New Hampshire and the Northeast              Region  The Fiscal Year 2007 budget for the National Oceanic              and Atmospheric Administration  approved by the Committee today              includes  3 8 million for the AIRMAP project   350 000 for              the High Elevation Air Study  and  350 000 for New England              Weather Technology Initiative at Plymouth State University  As              a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  and former Chairman              of the Subcommittee that oversees funding for NOAA  Senator Gregg              was able to include the funding in the bill  which now awaits consideration              by the full Senate   Senator              Gregg stated  The researchers and students at UNH and Plymouth              State undertaking this research continue to break new ground in              the fields of air quality and weather  They are adding national              and global accolades to New Hampshires strong research reputation  New              Hampshires location on the East Coast affords its residents              numerous benefits  however  New Hampshire also has become the tailpipe              of the nation as pollution and smog settle over our state  These              research projects are using this unintended result to discover              ways to improve the quality of our environment and weather forecasting              models   Dr               Robert Talbot  AIRMAP Principal Investigator  stated  In              the past five years  UNHs AIRMAP program has established              a world class atmospheric observing network in New England and              hosted two air quality field campaigns with one being the largest              ever world wide  These achievements by faculty and students               made possible by continued support from Senator Gregg  have lifted              AIRMAP to national and international prominence in atmospheric              sciences   Ken              Kimball  the Appalachian Mountain Club s Director of Research said   We              are very pleased that Senator Gregg continues to support research              into the impacts of climate change on the alpine resources of the              White Mountain National Forest  Alpine habitats are among              the rarest ecosystems east of the Mississippi  with much of them              found in New Hampshire s Presidential Range  Climate change              and air pollution pose great threats to these ecosystems  This              funding supports research that combines the AMC s expertise in              alpine ecology with the expertise of the Mount Washington Observatory              and the University of New Hampshire in climate change and air pollution    Together               we seek to decipher how climate variability impacts these important              resources  We applaud the Senator for his continued leadership              in supporting conservation of natural resources in New Hampshire  Sara              Jayne Steen  President  Plymouth State University  stated  We              at Plymouth State University thank Senator Gregg for his support              of this project  We are very proud to use the expertise of PSU              faculty and students to bring increased safety and environmental              benefits to the State of New Hampshire  The network of meteorological              equipment to be installed will significantly improve weather forecasting               reduce unnecessary road salt usage  improve traffic safety  and              assess air quality conditions throughout the state  We are enormously              pleased to partner with Senator Gregg and the N H  Department of              Transportation on this important work          Air Quality and Air Forecasting Programs U S  Senator Judd Gregg  Member  Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce             Justice and Science     3 8 million    AIRMAP  AIRMAP            is a cooperative program between the UNH and NOAA  created in 1999             designed to provide a detailed understanding of various sources of            pollution by studying the dynamics of New England s atmosphere  air            quality and weather  The program combines NOAAs atmospheric            research with UNH led systematic monitoring of the regions            atmospheric chemistry in order to develop the ability to predict            air quality changes as an addition to daily weather forecasts  Continued            funding for the AIRMAP project will allow researchers to expand and            improve the project by initiating climate air quality assessment            for the Northeast  including detailed measurements of mercury and            other trace metals  Researchers will also continue to validate            their forecasts and models using the projects detailed research   Since              1999  Senator Gregg has secured  29 million in federal funding            for the AIRMAP program    350 000   High Elevation Air Study     In            2006  the Appalachian Mountain Club  in collaboration with the New            Hampshire Department of Environmental Services  the White Mountain            National Forest  the Mount Washington Observatory and UNH  launched            an effort to study the Northeasts alpine zones    This            study seeks to expand current understanding of how and at what rates            climate variability and air pollutants impact the unique northeastern            alpine ecosystems  This area harbors some of the rarest            biological community types in the eastern US and rare mountain top            islands of flora and fauna  More than half of all such habitat            is located in the Presidential Range in NH  However  project            participants are concerned with changing climatic and chemical environments            that could threaten their existence  The study will help assess            this regions future and develop policies to protect it      In the past  Senator Gregg has secured  350 000 in federal funding              for this study     350 000   New England Weather Technology Initiative              This program  based at Plymouth State University  in conjunction            with the New Hampshire Department of Transportation will provide            the next generation of observational sites to measure  record  and            transmit meteorological and air quality data  This initiative will            expand and accelerate the present multipurpose New Hampshire mesonet  i e              the establishment of additional ground based  instrumented observational            sites that will help to fill in the gaps between the current observational            network  consisting of 13 airport weather reporting sites and also            from another site at the summit of Mount Washington  Meteorologists            need these higher density observations to define smaller mesoscale weather            features not seen with conventional networks  These sites will            be equipped to measure surface and subsurface temperatures  as well            as atmospheric ozone   In the past  Senator Gregg has secured a total of  2 6 million            for this initiative
