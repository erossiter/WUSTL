Senator Gregg Calls on U S  Department of Health and Human Services to Clarify Breakdowns and Review Future Procedures in Recent Tuberculosis Incident  Contact Erin Rath  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  joined Senator Richard Burr  R NC  in asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to review our nations current level of preparedness to combat a highly contagious disease  pandemic  or bioterror attack in response to the recent case of a patient diagnosed with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis who traveled overseas and returned to the United States  The recent incident in which a U S  citizen diagnosed with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  was able to travel overseas and back without being stopped by U S  or foreign authorities provides an important opportunity to identify policy and process changes necessary to better protect the American people from potentially deadly infectious diseases or biologic agents  stated Senator Gregg in a letter sent to Secretary Leavitt late yesterday  In light of the continued threats we face from a possible influenza pandemic or a bioterrorist attack  we must be vigilant in our continuous efforts to improve the nations preparedness and eliminate roadblocks to effective response  This case raises questions about the ability of our federal  state  and local public health officials to effectively isolate and quarantine patients  the level of coordination between our public health authorities and homeland security officials  and the role of international cooperation during international public health emergencies  Last year  we made progress in public health and medical preparedness through the enactment of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act  P L  109 417   however  this incident highlights that gaps in the system still remain  The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act  S  3678   passed during the 109th Congress and signed into law by President Bush in December 2006  contained initiatives introduced earlier by Senator Gregg  including the Republican Leadership biodefense preparedness bill  S 3  and the SAFE Act  S  2792   Both bills were designed to improve the public health and medical response to biological outbreaks  including the establishment of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the Office of Emergency Preparedness  to fund cutting edge research and development of medical countermeasures  including drugs and vaccines  to fight bioterrorism and natural disease outbreaks   The full text of the letter appears below    Dear Secretary Leavitt   The recent incident in which a U S  citizen diagnosed with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  was able to travel overseas and back without being stopped by U S  or foreign authorities provides an important opportunity to identify policy and process changes necessary to better protect the American people from potentially deadly infectious diseases or biologic agents  In light of the continued threats we face from a possible influenza pandemic or a bioterrorist attack  we must be vigilant in our continuous efforts to improve the nations preparedness and eliminate roadblocks to effective response  This case raises questions about the ability of our federal  state  and local public health officials to effectively isolate and quarantine patients  the level of coordination between our public health authorities and homeland security officials  and the role of international cooperation during international public health emergencies  Last year  we made progress in public health and medical preparedness through the enactment of the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act  P L  109 417   however  this incident highlights that gaps in the system still remain  Therefore  we would appreciate a timely response to the questions below   Public Health Authorities  1 In Senate testimony  the Fulton County Department of Health  Wellness stated it did not have the authority to preemptively prohibit the patient from traveling internationally  Had the patients XDR TB diagnosis been finalized prior to his travel  would the local health department have had the authority to restrict his travel  At what point does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  step in to assist State and local officials  Is there a need for the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to work with States to revise State and local quarantine laws  2 What clarifications or changes need to be made in current federal isolation and quarantine laws or regulations so HHS CDC can prevent patients from leaving the U S  when necessary  The public comment period for proposed revisions to federal quarantine and isolation rules ended in March 2006  What is the status of this proposed rule  3 How long does it currently take to complete an XDR TB laboratory diagnostic test  Do any State public health departments have the capability to conduct these tests themselves  What efforts are underway to develop more rapid diagnostic tests  International Authorities   4 What entities  national or international  have authority to isolate or quarantine a U S  citizen in a foreign country  Similarly  what entities have authority to isolate or quarantine an infected foreigner in this country in the event of a health emergency  With what foreign entities does the U S  have bilateral agreements to deal with such situations  What is the formal U S  process for dealing with sick U S  citizens in other countries  More specifically  what is CDCs current policy for transporting U S  citizens with infectious diseases of concern  5 Please describe the communications between HHS CDC and the Italian Health Ministry and the World Health Organization  WHO  in this XDR TB case  Why did HHS CDC postpone contacting the Italian Health Ministry directly  What role could the WHO have played in this case   6 Currently  the U S  and Mexico have a bi national surveillance system to monitor infectious diseases along the U S  Mexico border  Would a similar system along the U S  Canada border have made a difference in this instance  What are the barriers to developing such an agreement  Homeland Security Coordination  7 In the event of pandemic influenza or if a bioterrorist agent is carried on an airplane  obtaining flight passenger information will be critical for epidemiological investigations and slowing the spread of disease  Did HHS CDC experience any hurdles in obtaining flight manifests and tracking down passengers on board the patients flights  If so  what were the barriers  Please describe the process HHS CDC undertook in contacting individual passengers  8 What steps are being taken to expedite communication flow and notification of health emergencies between HHS CDC and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    Bioterrorism Lessons  9 What other lessons has HHS CDC learned from this case that will aid in preparing for pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist event  Thank you for your assistance in a timely response to these important questions   Sincerely    Richard M  Burr Judd Gregg  United States Senator United States Senator
