Gregg and Sununu Urge Solicitor General to Support Goss International s Supreme Court Petition Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon  GREGG   Barbara Riley Liz Chamberlain  SUNUNU   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  today announced that they have asked the Solicitor General of the United States  Paul D  Clement  to file a brief in support of Goss Internationals petition to the U S  Supreme Court  Earlier this week  Goss  which has over 1 000 employees at its Dover and Durham facilities  filed its petition requesting that the Supreme Court review a ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals  This ruling reversed a lower courts injunction against TKS  a competitor of Goss  which would have prevented the Japanese company from recouping a  31 6 million judgment that Goss had successfully won in an antidumping lawsuit against TKS  In a letter to Clement sent yesterday  Gregg and Sununu argued that the Eighth Circuits ruling could pose a significant threat to our trade laws and the sovereignty of our nations judicial system  The letter requested that the Solicitor General file a legal brief in support of Gosss petition and urge the Court to review the Eighth Circuits ruling  Text of the letter is included below  Senator Judd Gregg stated  It is critical for Goss International  its workers in New Hampshire  and for anyone who believes in fair trade  that foreign companies which have broken our trade laws be brought to justice  If such a company is found guilty in our courts and is required to pay millions in damages  a foreign government should not be allowed to nullify this judgment through retaliatory acts that are solely intended to subvert our rule of law  This is an affront to our judicial system and our sensibilities of fair play among trading partners  I hope that the Administration will actively support Gosss efforts to overturn the Eighth Circuits ruling so we can protect not only our trade laws  but also the hundreds of manufacturing jobs at Goss  Senator John Sununu stated  Goss International is justified in seeking Supreme Court review of its legal case  and the Solicitor Generals involvement would increase the likelihood that the Court will consider the case  TKS should not be allowed to circumvent U S  legal and regulatory processes  Moreover  this case brings to light the retaliatory trade law enacted by the Japanese government to protect TKS from legitimate enforcement actions  Goss has 1 000 employees in New Hampshire and their jobs should not be jeopardized by foreign efforts to undermine U S  trade law  The text of the letter follows  Dear Solicitor General Clement  We write to request your support for Goss Internationals petition for a writ of certiorari  We believe that this case presents a compelling federal interest  to protect U S  laws and judgments from being invalidated by foreign governments   In 2003  a Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids  Iowa  entered a  31 6 million jury award in Goss Internationals favor  The jury found that TKS  a Japanese competitor of Goss International  had violated the Antidumping Act of 1916  1916 Act  by dumping printing presses in the U S  market with the express intent of destroying the U S  industry  The District Court also found that TKS attempted to cover up its dumping by agreeing to a fraudulent price increase  providing a secret rebate  and destroying documents to conceal its fraudulent conduct  In a separate investigation  the Department of Commerce found that TKS actions constituted fraud against the U S  government and that TKS behavior was a uniquely egregious display of misconduct by a respondent in an antidumping proceeding  After unsuccessfully appealing the District Courts judgment to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and seeking Supreme Court review  which was denied  TKS paid approximately  38 million in damages to Goss International  However  in December 2004  the Japanese Diet passed clawback legislation specifically designed to invalidate the District Courts judgment by allowing TKS to file suit in Japan and collect from Goss International or a wholly owned subsidiary the full amount of the U S  judgment  plus interest  costs  and attorneys fees   When TKS announced its plan to use the Japanese law to clawback the final judgment  the U S  District Court ordered TKS not to proceed  The court found that TKS intention to exercise the clawback law was a direct attack on this courts judgment  and a frontal assault on the jurisdiction of this court and the federal judiciary as a whole and was for the sole purpose of terminating this courts judgment  On June 18  2007  the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Courts injunction  finding that it lacked jurisdiction to protect Goss Internationals final judgment  While the court acknowledged that TKS would effectively nullify the remedy Goss legitimately procured in the United States courts after seven years of litigation  it reasoned that the courts interest in the matter ended once TKS paid the judgment to Goss International  On August 10  2007  TKS initiated proceedings in Japan against Goss International and its Japanese affiliate to claw back the judgment that was legitimately awarded to Goss following due process in U S  federal courts   We believe that Gosss petition for writ of certiorari is worthy of your attention and support for several reasons  First  we understand that this decision represents the first time a federal court has held that a litigant is free to use a foreign clawback statute to nullify a final federal court judgment  Under the decisions reasoning  foreign firms and governments may use clawback legislation to effectively evade any U S  law they find objectionable  Such a result would impair the federal judiciarys power to enforce a wide range of U S  laws against foreign firms doing business in the United States  More recently  the Second Circuit has adopted a more aggressive use of its jurisdiction to prevent parties from relitigating in foreign courts issues that were already decided in a federal court  Second  this decision will undoubtedly embolden foreign nations to pass clawback legislation aimed at important but internationally unpopular aspects of our judicial system  These include treble damage statutes  such as the antitrust and RICO laws  punitive damage awards  and enhanced damages in patent infringements and other intellectual property suits  Federal judgments based on these and other laws and procedures are now vulnerable to nullification under the holding in this case  essentially giving foreign litigants immunity from U S  laws and undermining our ability to legislate in areas that other nations deem unpopular  Even the Eighth Circuit recognized that clawback statutes like that enacted by Japan can be regarded as an affront to the laws and judicial rules of the United States  Indeed  such retaliatory clawback legislation is an attack on the jurisdiction of U S  courts and the integrity of U S  law   Third  we understand that the Eighth Circuits decision rejects the proposition that a federal court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction after satisfaction of a money judgment  Specifically  the Eighth Circuit found that a federal courts jurisdiction to protect a judgment ends when the judgment is paid  If left standing  such a ruling would tie the hands of the federal courts where a losing defendant seeks to invalidate a judgment through subsequent actions and it would strip federal courts of the ability to protect their judgments  The impact of the Eighth Circuits decision presents an issue of exceptional importance for Supreme Court review  The United States should take appropriate action to prevent Japan from nullifying a final U S  judgment and  more generally  to prevent U S  laws from being thwarted by foreign governments  Federal courts need to have ongoing jurisdiction to protect their judgments  even after the judgment is paid or satisfied  We therefore respectfully request that you consider filing an amicus curiae brief in support of Goss Internationals petition for writ of certiorari  Thank you for your attention to this important matter   Sincerely  U S  Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu
