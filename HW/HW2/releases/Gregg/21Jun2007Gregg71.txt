Senator Gregg Supports Veto Override Of Stem Cell Legislation  Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   today announced that he intends to vote to override the Presidents veto of stem cell legislation  Sen  Gregg voted in support of S  5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007  in April  Sen  Gregg stated  I intend to vote in favor of overriding the Presidents decision to veto the stem cell research bill  Weve heard from a number of people  including the head of the National Institutes of Health  that further research from stem cells is needed to successfully pursue cures for a number of diseases  In order to accomplish that  additional stem cell lines are needed  If we proceed in a very ethical and moral way  stem cell research can be done appropriately  Under strict guidelines  we should continue research in the stem cell area  and I will not support the Presidents position on this issue     Currently the National Institutes of Health  the worlds premier biomedical research institution  is funding some of our nations brightest scientific investigators embarking on this innovative field of medical research  The Director of NIH  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  is encouraged by the research that has taken place to date using the federally funded stem cell lines available to scientists under the Presidents policy  and believes that much more can be done with greater access to newly derived and genetically diverse embryonic stem cell lines  At a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing this past March Dr  Zerhouni stated that  Since 2004  I think its very clear from the point of view of science and what I have overseen that these cell lines will not be sufficient to do all the research we need to doSo  from my standpoint  it is clear today that American science would be better served and the nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines In addition  Dr  Story Landis  Chair of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force and Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke testified before the Senate HELP and Appropriations Subcommittee in January and said  Yes  we are missing out on possible breakthroughsthe cell lines that are eligible for NIH funding now have been shown to have genetic instabilityScientists who are funded by NIH would also like to have access to cell lines that have been derived without the use of feeder cell lines or animal products and  finally  there are a number of cell lines  many cell lines that have been generated since the Presidents policy was put in place that have in them mutations specific to human disease  like Huntingtons and ALS and Parkinsons So  yes  more cell lines would be incredibly important
