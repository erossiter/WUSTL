Senator Gregg Comments On Energy Bill Being Signed Into Law Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following comments regarding the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  which was signed into law by the President this morning  Senator Gregg stated  It is good news today that the President has signed the energy bill  This is a major step forward in our efforts as a country to try to get energy independence  It increases the fuel standards for cars very significantly  to 35 miles per gallon for the fleet of various cars that companies produce  and this is a big plus  It also has a very significant effort in the area of renewable fuels  especially ethanol   It is clear that we  as a nation  need to try to do everything we can to reduce our reliance on foreign oil  especially oil that comes out of the Middle East where the countries dont like us to begin with  And this bill  although it isnt the solution to the entire problem  is a step in the right direction  As a result I think this is something that is going to help us out as a country  and obviously  help out the environment  too
