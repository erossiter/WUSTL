Senator Gregg Comments on Senate Passage of SCHIP Reauthorization Conference Report Contact  Erin Rath Betsy Holahan  I strongly support the effort to reauthorize the existing State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  so that all low income children have health insurance coverage  However  I cannot support a radical expansion of this worthy program that allows families with an annual income as high as  80 000 to receive taxpayer funded coverage  and keeps adults in the program     To make matters worse  this dramatic expansion of the federal SCHIP program  which will supposedly cost taxpayers  71 billion over ten years  contains a budget gimmick that hides  40 billion in costs that are not paid for and will be added to the nations credit card  the deficit     Equally troubling is that this bill is another step in the majoritys march toward the nationalization of U S  health care  I have long opposed health care being in the hands of the federal government  as we have seen this system in other countries lead to rationing of health care services  a significant reduction in investment in medical and pharmaceutical research and development  and a hike in taxes to pay for it  Clearly  that approach would be harmful to the countrys health  both physically and economically     So while I fully support ensuring that all low income children receive the health care services they deserve  and strongly support a short term reauthorization of this program to allow for additional negotiations  I regretfully cannot support the way this program is being used to expand the size of government  advance a national healthcare system  and pass the cost along to hard working Americans  If this measure is vetoed by the President as expected  I look forward to working with my colleagues to refocus this reauthorization on the people it is intended to benefit  low income children who need and deserve our support
