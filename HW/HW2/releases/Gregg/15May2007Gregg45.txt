Senator Gregg Calls for Extension of Pro Growth Tax Relief That Has Spurred Dramatic Economic Growth   Senator Judd Gregg  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  today called for the permanent extension of the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends  which have helped create jobs and spur strong economic growth  as Democrats prepare to pass a budget that contains the largest tax increase in U S  history      Higher taxes  in many instances  actually reduce revenues to the federal government because they reduce economic activity  said Senator Gregg  And they certainly reduce expansion of the economy and the creation of jobs  Three presidents have proved beyond any reasonable doubt that when you lower income tax rates  you generate economic expansion     This month marks the fourth anniversary of Senate passage of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  which lowered the tax rates on capital gains and dividends to 15 percent  5 percent for lower income taxpayers  falling to 0 percent in 2008 2010       Since the tax relief measure went into effect  the economy has grown at an average quarterly rate of 3 1 percent  as compared to 1 5 percent in the two years before this legislation was enacted  Since August 2003  the economy has created more than 7 8 million jobs  and unemployment has dropped to 4 5 percent  from 6 1 percent in August 2003       The strong economic growth produced by the tax relief Republicans passed has significantly increased revenue to the federal government  Since the 2003 tax relief was implemented  tax receipts to the federal government have risen nearly 35 percent  This strong revenue increase has helped drive down the deficit  which has declined by  165 billion over the past two years  In fact  strong revenue growth helped cut the deficit in half three years ahead of the Presidents schedule   Senator Judd Greggs Floor Remarks on 4th Anniversary   of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003   Unofficial Transcript   Mr Gregg  First  I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his eloquent statement and his accurate statement  And I want to pick up where the Senator has left off      The Senator talks about the fact    and this is a fact    that revenues to the federal government have jumped dramatically  dramatically in the last three years  In fact  in the last three years we ve seen more revenues flowing into the federal government than ever in history  and the percentage of increase of those revenues has also been historic  as this chart clearly shows  We are now seeing revenues to the federal government which actually exceed the historic revenues to this government  Historically  the federal government has gotten about 18 2  of Gross National Product in revenue  Today we re up around 18 5   We re headed towards 18 7   That s significant increase in revenues to the federal government      What effect does that have  As the Senator from Texas said  it s had a dramatic effect on the deficit  It has caused the deficit to drop dramatically  Now  the other side of the aisle argues  Well  so what  taxes are still too low on Americans  We should raise the taxes on Americans  So they brought out a budget which is going to increase taxes on Americans by about  700 billion  the largest tax increase in American history should it come to fruition  They mean what they say on the other side of the aisle      What will that do to federal revenues  that dramatic increase in taxes  What will that do to the economy  We re not sure but we suspect it will slow the economy dramatically  Some of these great gains we ve seen in the economy  the 7 8 million new jobs  may be significantly impacted by that type of a tax increase  We also know that it will create a tax code that is taking a lot more money from Americans who work hard  We happen to believe on our side of the aisle we should let Americans keep the money they earn as much as possible  have a fair tax system  and as a result generate a benefit to working Americans by saying  Listen  if you re going to work hard we re going to give you more money  We re also going to get more revenues  which is the way this has worked out      And why have we gotten more revenues even though we ve reduced the tax burden on the American people  Well  the answer is pretty simple  It s called human nature  When you set tax levels at a fair level  which is what we have today  people are willing to go out and invest  They re willing to take risks  They re willing to work harder because they know they re going to keep more of what they earn  What does that do  It creates a stronger economy which puts more people to work  which is what we want    more jobs for people  The more people that have jobs the more tax revenues you end up getting      In addition  especially in the area of capital gains  if you have a fair capital gains rate  which is what we have today  it causes people to go out and sell an investment which they otherwise might hold on to  A person has an asset    a home  small business or stock    and they don t want to sell that asset when they re going to have to pay 30   25  in taxes on that sale because they don t want to have to pay taxes on that asset they spent their whole life building up  trying to make ends meet and trying to create a nest egg for themselves  When you put a fair rate on that  then people are willing to go out and sell that asset      And when they sell that asset  what happens  Well  two things which are very good for the federal government happen  One  capital gains occur  So we get revenues  Otherwise we wouldn t get those revenues because people would sit on those assets  They re not going to sell them and pay the high tax rate  When you have a fair tax rate they sell them  The federal government gets the revenues  The other thing that happens is they take that new money they have from the sale of that asset and they reinvest it  By human nature they reinvest it in something that s more productive  So you have a more productive society where capital assets are being used more effectively      As a result you get this great job creation and this economic growth  In fact  in the area of capital gains we ve seen a dramatic increase in revenues  Capital gains have increased over what the projection was by CBO  the Congressional Budget Office  by 68   That s a huge jump  a huge jump in revenues which we really didn t expect    at least the Congressional Budget Office didn t expect    but which we ve received because human nature kicked in and people were willing to sell assets  take that money  reinvest it in things that are productive  create jobs  As a result we ve got these revenues  That s why today the federal government is actually getting more in revenues than it got under the old tax law where the rates were a lot higher  And that s why we ve gotten more economic expansion and more jobs  And so that s the good news      From the other side of the aisle  we hear this constant patter  Well  the rich aren t paying enough taxes and these tax laws are disproportionate in their application  I think we need to talk about that for a little bit because let s see what s happened as a result of reducing these tax rates  Basically what s happened is that even with the lower tax rates today wealthy people are paying more in revenues to the federal government than at any time in history  Today the top 20  of people in this country who have income are paying about 85  of the tax burden  Let me restate that  The top 20  of people with income in this country are paying 85  of the federal tax burden  Under the Clinton years  the top 20  of people with income paid 81  of the federal tax burden  So even though we ve cut rates  we ve actually created more revenue from high income individuals      Again  you re going to say how does that happen  Again  it s called human nature  If you have a high income situation  an individual with a high income  they could either invest it in opportunities which are going to produce taxable events or not produce taxable events  I mean  they ve got the position to do that  So if you have a fair tax rate  they ll take the risk  They ll make the decision  They ll be the entrepreneurs who create the job  And as a result  they ll make an investment which is taxable      But if you have a tax rate that s too high  which is what the other side of the aisle likes to have  then you basically create an atmosphere with these folks are going to go out and invest a fair amount of their money in things that are tax avoidants  Legally tax avoidants  They re going to invest in non taxable events    stocks and bonds that don t generate income to them that s taxable  What we ve done is created a tax law where essentially high income people are willing to go out and take risks and do it in a taxable way  which generates revenue back to the United States  And as a result we have the top 20  of American income payers paying more in taxes today  significantly more than they did under the Clinton years      And the alternative to this is also fairly interesting  At the low income of the scale  the bottom 40  of people who have income don t basically pay taxes  income taxes  They pay obviously withholding tax  But as a practical matter  that segment of our society pays virtually nothing in income taxes  They get money back  in fact  under the Earned Income Tax Credit and other benefits that the federal government puts in place  Under the law today  under President Bush s law  those bottom 40  of income earners are now getting about twice as much back from the federal government as they did under the Clinton years      So what s the combined effect of these two facts  of these two things  The tax law  even though we re generating a lot more revenue for the federal government  even though we re well over that mean number of 18 2  of Gross National Product  even though we ve had jumps in revenue of 15   12   11   we ve actually got a tax law today that s generating more revenue but is also more progressive  High income individuals are paying more of the tax burden  Low income people are getting more money back from the federal government      And there s another factor here that needs to be pointed out  and that s what s happening to senior citizens  Senior citizens disproportionately benefit from a low dividend tax rate  Why  Well  it s logical obviously  Most seniors are retired  If they have income  it s going to be social security action some pension program or dividends  And most pension programs also involve dividends  And so senior citizens are really the people who are benefiting the most from a low dividend tax rate  And yet  the folks on the other side of the aisle have just passed a budget where they want to jump the tax rate on dividends by 100   They want to go from a 15  tax rate to a 40  tax rate on dividends  Who are they going to hit  They re going to hit senior citizens primarily  That s the people they re going to hit      If you look at the proposals from the other side of the aisle  they come out with a 1930 s philosophy of economics  which was pretty soundly rejected in the 1960  the 1970 s  the 1980 s and the 1990s   It is this theorem that says you raise taxes and the federal government will get more money and we ll spend it for you  In other words  it s a theory that says  We re smarter than you  We ve been elected to the United States Senate  We re good members of the Democratic party  We know more than you know  Therefore  we should take your money and we should spend it for you  and we could spend it more effectively than you can spend it  Well  that s a philosophy that should and has been rejected as we move towards a much more market oriented economy  It s also a philosophy that presumes higher taxes always generate more revenue to the federal government  which isn t true  Higher taxes actually in many instances reduce revenues to the federal government because they reduce economic activity  And they certainly reduce expansion of the economy  And they reduce the creation of jobs  Three presidents have proved beyond any reasonable doubt that when you lower income tax rates  you generate economic expansion because people are just people  They just have common sense  and they know if they re going to be able to keep more of their money they re willing to go out and work hard to get more money      But we also know if the federal government is going to take more of their money and a disproportionate amount of their money  they re not going to work quite so hard  They re not going to take that risk  they re not going to create that restaurant  open that little small business  create those jobs because they don t want to pay all their money to the federal government  President Kennedy knew that  and that s why he cut income tax rates and was successful and generated revenue for the federal government  President Reagan knew that  He cut income tax rates  and as a result the revenues to the federal government jumped and the economy expanded  President Bush has shown it once again  Cut income tax rates  expand the economy  And as a result get a fair tax level and human nature kicks in and revenues flow into the federal treasury      But what s unique about President Bush s initiatives are that at the same time that he s cut rates  created this much more progressive system which I just outlined  The fact that high end income tax payers are now paying so much more than they did under the Clinton years of the federal share of income taxes and lower income individuals are getting much more back than they did under the Clinton years for a more progressive system  And it also disproportionately benefits senior citizens  people on fixed incomes  because of the dividend rate      Unfortunately  though  we now have the Democrats presenting to us a budget which wants to take us to the French path  which is going to dramatically increase the cost of the federal government to Americans and dramatically increase the tax level on Americans  And we ll go down that path that France has gone down  And I have to tell you  it doesn t work in France  Productivity is not up in France  Jobs are not being created in France  People don t want to go out and work harder in France  And they certainly don t have a more progressive or effective economic system than we have here in the United States  So I think we should reject the Democratic approach under their budget of raising taxes and stay with the tax law that is generating new revenue  is progressive and has such a strong benefit for senior citizens
