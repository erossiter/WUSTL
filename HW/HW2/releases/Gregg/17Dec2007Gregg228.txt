R NH  today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill contains more than  2 million in federal funding for three statewide law enforcement initiatives in New Hampshire  The

University of New Hampshire  Funding for these projects is included within the Appropriations Committee allocation set out for Fiscal Year 2008 funding measures  A detailed description of each project is included below  The House is expected to vote as early as tonight on the omnibus package that contains 11 out of the 12 annual spending measures  the Senate will likely debate the measure later this week  If passed by both chambers  the legislation will then be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  Senator Gregg stated  New Hampshire communities have long been some of the best places to live and raise families  and that is due in large part to the outstanding work of our law enforcement officials  But New Hampshire is not immune to some of the most dangerous and widespread crime trends throughout the country  namely the spread of criminal drug activity and gang violence  We need to make sure that the men and women of New Hampshires law enforcement community  who put their lives on the line every day to protect us  have the most up to date tools and resources they need to carry out their duties safely and effectively  These projects in New Hampshire are exemplary demonstrations of collaborative efforts that are working and truly making a difference  Gregg continued  Though the Democratic Leadership has pushed this years appropriations process into the 11th hour  it is important to note that Republicans efforts to control spending were successful and forced the elimination of  18 billion in new spending  I am pleased my colleagues were able to reach across the aisle and come up with an omnibus package which is more in line with the budget request and still includes funding for important New Hampshire initiatives  Kelly Ayotte  New Hampshire Attorney General  stated  Senator Gregg has been tireless in his efforts to support law enforcement in New Hampshire and enhance public safety  I want to commend Senator Gregg for his efforts in securing funding to provide additional resources enabling local law enforcement to take drug dealers off the streets and keep the public safe  Colonel Frederick H  Booth  Director of the New Hampshire State Police  stated  The New Hampshire State Police is pleased with the announcement that through the efforts of Senator Judd Gregg  we will receive a  846 000 Streetsweeper Grant in the 2008 federal budget  The grant will assist State and local police in further enforcement of drug interdiction  gang activity and other related crimes  Some of these funds will be directed towards the partnership program that was initiated last fall after the killing of Officer Michael Briggs of the Manchester Police Department  The partnership program teamed Troopers from the State Police with Manchester Police Officers in an effort to curb violence in the City by targeting drug dealers and gang activity in the City  The program continues to be very successful in reducing drug activity  gang violence  apprehending wanted felons and removing guns from the street  Without the continued support and commitment of Senator Gregg to law enforcement and the Streetsweeper program  it would be challenging to find the additional funding needed to support these vital programs  UNH thanks Senator Gregg for his continued strong support of the Project54 effort  This allows us to bring new technology to New Hampshires law enforcement and public safety first responder communities  says Dr  Andrew Kun  principal investigator for the Department of Justice RD program with UNHs Consolidated Advanced Technology Laboratory  With the support from Senator Gregg  CATLab has established a nationally recognized technology development program  We look forward to continuing our collaborative RD with our partners in New Hampshire  including the New Hampshire Department of Safety and over 150 first responder agencies around the state   New Hampshire Drug Task Force    752 000   The New Hampshire Attorney Generals Drug Task Force is a statewide  multi jurisdictional task force with the purpose of combating street level drug trafficking  Illegal drug trafficking  production  especially of methamphetamine  and abuse are ever increasing concerns for New Hampshire  New Hampshires Drug Task Force has 19 state  county and local law enforcement agencies participating in four regional teams throughout the state  The Task Force also funds one county drug prosecutor in an effort to enhance judicial efficiency in drug case prosecution and provide a resource to police and other prosecutors to maximize conviction  Operation Streetsweeper Task Force    846 000   In existence through federal support since Fiscal Year 1998  this collaboration between the New Hampshire State Police  the U S  Attorneys Office in New Hampshire  and local New Hampshire towns and cities  works to combat gang and drug related violence and crime throughout the state  focusing particularly on the New Hampshire Massachusetts border  These funds will be used to continue grants and provide operational support to law enforcement agencies    Since 1997  Senator Gregg has secured  10 million in federal funding for Operation Streetsweeper and Operation Streetsweeper Task Force  CATlab    658 000   The CATlab program works to address problems with electronic devices inside police cruisers and to improve the communication ability between law enforcement officers and their headquarters  The innovations being pioneered through the project significantly enhance the information available to officers in the field  including voice recognition commands and linking law enforcement radios through computers  The program is a collaborative effort between UNH and the New Hampshire Department of Safety   Since 1999  Senator Gregg has secured  32 5 million for the CATlab program
