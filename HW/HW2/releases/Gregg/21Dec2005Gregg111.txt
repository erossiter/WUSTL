               SENATOR GREGG COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE                OF                DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT                                                   WASHINGTON               The United States Senate today passed the Deficit Reduction Act              by a vote of 51 50  with Vice President Dick Cheney casting the              tie breaking vote  Several technical alterations to the conference              report were approved by the Senate today  requiring the bill to              now go back before the House for their vote to concur  When that              occurs  on a timetable that must be determined by the House  the              bill will be ready to send to the President for his signature                 U S  Senator Judd Gregg  Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee                   stated   Today s successful vote on the Deficit Reduction Act                  is a victory for the American people   and for future generations  It is the first time in eight years that the Congress  has taken the necessary steps to curb entitlement spending and begin to put            our fiscal house back in order                 This bill represents a reduction in the federal deficit of nearly                   40 billion over five years  Yes  there is more to be done                   but it is a step in the right    direction  We simply cannot continue on the path to higher deficits  saddling    our children and grandchildren with this generation s fiscal obligations                   They deserve better than that                 The Deficit Reduction Act  in addition to being              fiscally responsible  also makes some good government reforms that              will improve services                  for the Americans    who    need them  Grant aid to low income college students will be increased by                  99 percent  as well as provides more assistance to low  and                  middle income borrowers    in the    student loan program  The bill expands Medicaid benefits to 1 million more    disabled children  offers more home and community based health programs for    the elderly    and disabled low income  and provides  2 billion in additional Medicaid benefits    to nearly 2 million hurricane victims in the Gulf Coast region    Unfortunately  the Democrats have decided to technically amend              the conference report  jeopardizing billions of dollars in assistance              to Katrina victims       needy families  seniors and students over some minor technical issues               This type of      delaying tactic is not in the best interest of the American people  who            want to see Congress making fiscally responsible decisions                 It is my hope that the Congress will continue the hard work                  we have done here  by seeking to reduce the rate of growth                  of government at every opportunity         By focusing on how to make government programs work more effectively                  and at        a lower        cost  And by making fiscally responsible decisions about what kind of                  economic future we want to leave to our children and grandchildren
