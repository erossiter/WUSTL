Senator Gregg Announces Senate Appropriations Committee Support For Granite State Ocean And Fisheries Research   Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  14 086 million in federal funding for two joint University of New Hampshire National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine programs in the 2008 budget for NOAA late last week  The measure contains  7 424 million for the Joint Hydrographic Center and  6 662 million for the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estaurine Environmental Technology  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science  Senator Gregg has secured this funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 funding measure  which is now ready for consideration by the full Senate later this year  The funding for these projects is included within the Committee allocation set out for the Fiscal Year 2008 spending measures  A full description of each program is attached   Senator Gregg stated  So much of New Hampshires history has been shaped by coastal activities and we have a responsibility to preserve our oceans and coastline so future generations will continue to enjoy these vast resources  The researchers and students at UNH are leading the field in a wide variety of critical coastal studies  including mapping of the ocean floor and pollution detection and prevention  UNH has taken the initiative to concentrate on these areas and its strong dedication will ensure the future health of sensitive coastal areas  Senator Gregg s continued support for the UNH NOAA Joint Hydrographic Center is greatly appreciated by both UNH and NOAA  says Dr  Larry Mayer  UNH co Director of the Center  We have made great strides in developing new tools that have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the nation s seafloor charting and coastal habitat mapping efforts and to lay the groundwork for extending our sovereignty over seabed resources under the Law of the Sea Treaty  During the coming year  we look forward to continuing our efforts and exploring innovative approaches like the use of autonomous undersea vehicles in shallow water environments critical to estuarine ecosystems and to our Nation s commerce  Portsmouth Harbor will be a particular focus for us  Senator Gregg recognizes that coastal communities in every state need tools to address environmental challenges  says Dr  Richard Langan  UNH co Director of CICEET  Because of the Senator s enduring commitment to the environment and the resiliency of coastal communities  CICEET has been able to develop technology and know how that is helping to rebuild eroding beaches  restore coastal habitats  clean up pollution  protect public and economic health  and manage community growth with foresight and balance  Through his support  CICEET has launched more than 150 environmental technology projects around the country  In N H  alone  we have been able to invest nearly  12 million in projects related to the preservation  protection  and understanding of Great Bay   Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Bill  New Hampshire Projects Securing Senate Appropriations Committee Approval   7 424 million  Joint Hydrographic Center  The NOAA UNH Joint Hydrographic Center is a national center of excellence developing innovative approaches to coastal and ocean mapping in support of safe navigation  fisheries management  national security and sovereignty  environmental and archaeological studies  and offshore exploration  Educational programs are interwoven with research to immerse NOAA personnel and students from around the world in advanced aspects of ocean mapping  With this award  the project will explore the use of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles for critical shallow water mapping needs  including  harbor security  improving the efficiency and productivity of national seafloor mapping programs  developing techniques to map and visualize large swaths of the water column in order to understand fish behavior  distribution  and perhaps biomass  and mapping the seafloor in support of US resource sovereignty under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea    Since 2000  Senator Gregg has secured  34 million in federal funding for the Center   6 662 million  Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estaurine Environmental Technology  CICEET is a UNH based national center that engages research institutions  the government and the private sector to develop and implement new tools to achieve clean water and healthy coasts  CICEET targets innovative solutions that are affordable  practical  and accessible to detect and prevent pollution and recover degraded coastal habitats  With these funds  CICEET will  enhance the use of new technologies to identify sources of bacterial and viral pathogens through demonstration  evaluation  and dissemination of results  implement initial evaluations of contaminated sediment treatment technologies in a new test site in the Piscataqua River near the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  improve capabilities of coastal decision makers to assess and predict pollution and habitat degradation resulting from different land use alternatives  and conduct research and development activities to reduce the cost  improve the ease of use  and increase availability of new water quality monitoring technologies   Since 1997  Senator Gregg has secured  58 7 million in federal funding for the CICEET
