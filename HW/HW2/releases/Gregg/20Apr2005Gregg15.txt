                                                CHAIRMAN GREGG                OPENING STATEMENT                 SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY                                               HEARING WITH DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECUR   Today               the Subcommittee will review the Fiscal Year 2006 budget request              for the Department of Homeland Security  I am pleased to welcome              as our witness this morning the Secretary of the Department of              Homeland Security  the Honorable Michael Chertoff   I think we would all agree  Mr  Secretary  that you have taken              on a tremendous challenge  There is no doubt that the Department              of Homeland Security  which became operational just two years ago               has made steady progress to improve the safety and security of              America  But  there is much work remaining   As you  I am also new to the job  and I am disturbed by reports              and findings that the Department continues to struggle with financial              management difficulties and structural instability  that its operations              are not fully integrated  and that  perhaps  we have not moved              quickly or successfully enough to identify and address risks and              vulnerabilities  So  I applaud the fact that you have stepped into              office and immediately initiated a comprehensive review of the              Department s organization  operations  and policies  and that you              have committed to let an analysis of threat and risk drive the              Department s structure rather than the other way around  This is said  not to undermine our efforts so far  but to underscore              awareness of the significant challenges still ahead as the Department              continues to work to prevent terrorism  to reduce the nation s              vulnerability to terrorist acts  and to increase preparedness and              response capabilities should such an attack occur  Mr  Secretary  you bring talent and commitment to this job  We              will review the budget request submitted by the President and work              with you to provide the resources the Department requires to manage              its responsibilities and to successfully carry out its mission
