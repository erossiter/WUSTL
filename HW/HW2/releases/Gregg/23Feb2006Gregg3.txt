                               SENATOR GREGG URGES NMFS TO CONSIDER                  ALTERNATE                  PLANS FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT                                            WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   today wrote              to the Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service to request              that NMFS help ensure a timely and thorough analysis of an alternative              proposal for a portion of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management              Plan  Although it remains to be seen whether this alternative              proposal will meet certain biological targets that are legally              required  it could result in less economic harm on New Hampshire s            fishing fleet  The                text of the letter to Dr  William Hogarth  Director of the National            Marine Fisheries Service  follows   Three              weeks ago  the New England Fishery Management Council approved              Framework 42 to Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery              Management Plan  The new management measures  if also approved              by the National Marine Fisheries Service  would reduce the allocation              of days at sea for all vessels and substantially alter the counting              methodology for days at sea in the inshore Gulf of Maine and off              Southern New England  Taken together  these measures could              reduce the days at sea for most ground fishermen in my state by              over 50 percent a potentially huge blow to a fishing fleet            that already is facing hard times               In              order to rebuild the stocks off our coasts  the decision making              process for Framework 42 is based on the science and the fishing              mortality targets required by Amendment 13  and not on economic              and social considerations  The management measures that come              out of this process directly affect peoples livelihoods              and entire fishing communities that have been around for centuries  I              am concerned to hear that  during the Council meeting a few weeks              ago  NMFS officials spoke out against helping the Council analyze              alternative proposals  in particular  a total allowable              catch management option  that could also meet fishing              mortality targets and possibly impose less economic hardship on              fishermen in my state  I understand that the NMFS has other              priorities that may warrant more immediate action  however  this              alternative proposal must be properly analyzed prior to the Councils              next meeting  especially considering the economic and social consequences            at play here   The              views expressed by NMFS officials a few weeks ago may not reflect              the agencys actual participation in the analysis process              of the total allowable catch management option proposal  I              would certainly hope so  And while there are time and resource              constraints  I respectfully urge that this alternative proposal              be analyzed in a comprehensive and objective manner and with a              seriousness that reflects the gravity of this issue  New              Hampshire has a proud fishing heritage  and my states fishermen              have long shaped the character and economies along our coast  The              fishermen and their families deserve no less from the NMFS and              the Council before stringent conservation measures are implemented
