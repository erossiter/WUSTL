Gregg Comments on Immigration Vote Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement regarding todays cloture vote on the immigration bill   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  stated  The immigration situation in this country is a mess and this bill  which was a work in progress  was our last opportunity in the foreseeable future to take the action necessary to fix this acute problem  It is critical that we get control of our borders  and as a result of language that I included in my amendment  this bill would have dramatically increased the number of border patrol agents and detention beds  and expanded the fencing at the Southern border at a level that would allow us to gain control there   In addition  we need a functioning guest worker program that allows people to come here and work in jobs that Americans are not available to do  without becoming U S  citizens  We also need an employer ID system that makes it clear that when an employee is hired  he or she is here legally  Also critical  this legislation would have moved our immigration system forward to encourage capable and highly trained individuals to come to America and contribute to strengthening our economy and culture  Each of these issues was taken up and addressed in this bill    That said  I would have opposed the bill as currently drafted because it still had some serious flaws  and it had a long way to go before it was in an acceptable form that could have been passed  I was hopeful that we could continue to work to make improvements to this bill and move this important debate forward through the amendment process  However  this approach is no longer available and we will need to find other means to secure our borders and create a workable immigration system
