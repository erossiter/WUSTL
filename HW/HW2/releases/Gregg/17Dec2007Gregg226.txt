Senators Gregg and Sununu Announces Funding For North Country Broadband Initiative Included In Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Judd Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill contains  700 000 in federal funds for an initiative to expand broadband service to the North Country  This program will initiate an open access  fixed wireless broadband infrastructure throughout Coos  Carroll and Grafton Counties  Broadband has been identified as a critical infrastructure need for economic growth  but it remains inconsistent throughout the North Country  These funds will be utilized primarily for the design  acquisition and construction of the infrastructure  Funding for this project was included within the Appropriations Committee allocation for Fiscal Year 2008 spending measures      The House is expected to vote as early as tonight on the omnibus package that contains 11 out of the 12 annual spending measures  the Senate will likely debate the measure later this week  If passed by both chambers  the legislation will then be sent to the Presidents desk for his signature  Senator Gregg stated  The Internet is a critical tool in todays society  it aids people in almost every facet of everyday life  from entertainment and personal communication to research and business transactions  To date  much of the North Country has been unable to access the Internet at high speeds  Completion of this project will not only ensure that the North Country has a competitive advantage  but it will also help ensure that its a place people want to come and raise a family  I applaud the Littleton Industrial Development Corporation  NCIC and those individuals and groups who are working hard to provide these much needed services for the North Country  Gregg continued  Though the Democratic Leadership has pushed this years appropriations process into the 11th hour  it is important to note that Republicans efforts to control spending were successful and forced the elimination of  18 billion in new spending  I am pleased my colleagues were able to reach across the aisle and come up with an omnibus package which is more in line with the budget request and still includes funding for important New Hampshire initiatives  Senator Sununu stated  Expanding wireless broadband deployment across Coos  Grafton  and Carroll Counties remains one of my top priorities and will strengthen the regional economy  Significant geographic and infrastructure challenges exist in expanding wireless broadband  however  the Northern Community Investment Corporation and Littleton Industrial Development Corporation have demonstrated a commitment and ability to overcome obstacles  These resources will help build on achievements already made and will help expand wireless broadband deployment across the North Country  Jon Freeman  President of Northern Community Investment Corporation  stated  We appreciate Senators Judd Greggs and John Sununus work to assist in creating this critical infrastructure in the North Country where there has recently been significant job loss from multiple paper mill closings  This project is a cornerstone of establishing what will be a new and vibrant economy created across the North Country through the exciting opportunities offered to business  visitors  healthcare  first responders and education  Thank you Senators Gregg and Sununu
