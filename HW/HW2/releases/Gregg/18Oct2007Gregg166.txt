Senator Gregg Calls for Responsible Compromise on SCHIP Reauthorization Contact  Erin Rath Betsy Holahan  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today called for a responsible compromise after House Republicans sustained the Presidents veto of legislation to dramatically expand the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  to higher income families and adults at a taxpayer cost of  110 billion over ten years  In addition  the current bill would advance a nationalized health care system  I strongly support the reauthorization of SCHIP for the low income children it is intended to help  and am hopeful that Congress and the President can now begin work on a realistic and responsible compromise  said Senator Gregg  the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   I have joined Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in introducing legislation to reauthorize SCHIP  while focusing on low income children who are eligible but not yet enrolled in the SCHIP program  said Senator Gregg  The Kids First Act would provide more than  14 billion in new SCHIP funding over the next five years  a 60 percent increase  This fiscally responsible alternative allows Congress to aid those children in need without wasting millions of taxpayer dollars  The Democrats refusal to negotiate may come at the expense of the low income children this bill is meant to serve  said Senator Gregg  Im hopeful they will stop playing politics with this issue and enter into serious negotiations that can pass Congress and be signed by the President   30  The SCHIP Bill Was Vetoed For Valid Reasons  It Includes a Budgetary Gimmick  The bill includes a budgetary gimmick to hide the true cost of the bill  CBO estimates the gimmick would increase the bills cost by  40 billion  triggering a Pay Go point of order  In other words  this gimmick allows the Democrats to get around their own Pay Go rules   It Displaces Private Insurance Already in Place  The bill increases SCHIP rolls by 4 4 million in 2012  However  2 4 million of these children already have coverage under private insurance or Medicaid    1 6 million of the new SCHIP enrollees already have private sector coverage and 800 000 already have Medicaid coverage     More than 36 percent of the cost of the SCHIP expansion is for children who already have private sector health care coverage   It Expands SCHIP to Higher Income Households  The bill covers children in households with incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty line  FPL    61 950 for a family of four     It grandfathers in New Jerseys level of coverage at 350 percent of FPL   72 275 for a family of four  at the enhanced match rate and would allow New York to reapply to expand its SCHIP program to cover upper middle class families earning  82 600 per year  four times the federal poverty level    o After the passage of the bill  Senator Schumer issued a press release stating  The Schumer backed legislation could expand eligibility to New York families earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty lineby far the most inclusive standard in the nationand add upwards of 300 000 new  currently uninsured kids to the coverage rolls    In August  the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  issued new regulations to require states to cover children below 200 percent of FPL before expanding their programs to higher income levels  These rules were used to deny New Yorks application  However  these benchmarks were eliminated in the SCHIP bill  HHS believes without these rules  it does not have the authority to deny any new requests to cover kids at or even above 400 percent of FPL   It Continues SCHIP Coverage of Adults  Currently  approximately 13 percent of SCHIP funds go to cover adults     The Administration is currently working with states to transition all non pregnant adults from SCHIP to Medicaid or other coverage  The bill reverses their progress by allowing states to continue covering adults  keeping more in the program  It Opens SCHIP to Fraud and Abuse  The Social Security Administration has written a letter explaining that the citizenship documentation provision in the SCHIP bill relaxes provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act that were intended to prevent ineligible and illegal immigrants from signing up for SCHIP     The SCHIP bill allows states to avoid current rules requiring that applicants show certain types of identity documents verifying U S  citizenship when they apply for Medicaid and SCHIP  This opens the program to fraud
