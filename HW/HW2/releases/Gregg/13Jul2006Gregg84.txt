  RESEARCH                                             WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that               20 2 million in federal funding has been secured for joint University              of New Hampshire National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration              marine programs in the 2007 budget for NOAA and the U S  Department              of Commerce  As the former Chairman  and still a member               of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice              and Science  Senator Gregg was able to secure the funding in the              2007 CJS measure which was approved by the Senate Appropriations              Committee today  The bill is now ready for consideration              by the full Senate later this year  A full description              of the seven programs is attached    Senator              Gregg stated  So much of New Hampshires history has              been shaped by coastal activities and we have a responsibility              to preserve our oceans and coastline so future generations will              enjoy these vast resources  The researchers and students              at UNH are leading the field in a wide variety of critical coastal              studies including mapping of the ocean floor  pollution detection              and prevention  and the ability to understand and maintain our              fish stocks  The University has taken the initiative to concentrate              on these areas and their strong dedication will ensure the future              health of sensitive coastal areas   Dr               Larry Mayer  the UNH Co Director of the center stated  These              funds will allow the center to continue to help NOAA meet the needs              of the nation through the development of new approaches to seafloor              mapping and data processing  The techniques developed at              the center help ensure safe navigation  define essential fisheries              habitats  explore our marine archaeological heritage  understand              the fate of marine pollution and contribute to national security              and sovereignty  We are grateful to Senator Gregg and his staff              for recognizing the importance of these contributions to the well being              of the nation   We              are grateful for Senator Gregg s consistent ability to secure funding              that leads to innovative tools for clean water and healthy coastal              environments   said Dr  Richard Langan  director of the NOAA UNH              Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology   This              appropriation will allow CICEET to continue to develop and apply              technology based solutions like the UNH Stormwater Center to coastal              problems nationwide    Additionally               we are pleased that Senator Gregg was successful in securing an              appropriation for UNHs Atlantic Marine Aquaculture Center   stated              Dr  Richard Langan  the Center s Director   We share his vision              for a new and environmentally responsible offshore aquaculture              industry in the U S   and we look forward to contributing to its              development    Dr               Christopher Glass  Director of the UNH led Northeast Consortium              for cooperative fisheries research  said  Our efforts to              work closely with commercial fishermen in developing and managing              projects has led to gear designs that reduce bycatch  increase              selectivity  and or reduce habitat impacts in groundfish  shrimp               scallop  crab and lobster fisheries  It also has produced scientific              findings that have informed stock assessments and ecosystem based              fisheries management plans  This ongoing effort has been possible              only because Senator Gregg is so successful in securing funding              for this innovative effort   Dr               Nancy Kinner  the UNH Co Director of the Coastal Response Research              Center notes  UNH s Coastal Response Research Center thanks              Senator Gregg for his continued support of its important partnership              with NOAA to develop and implement new approaches for marine spill              response and restoration  In the last 12 months  natural disasters              and accidents have spilled 9 million gallons of petroleum into              U S  waters  The Senator s vision in securing funding for the Center s              work will help our nation meet these environmental challenges   Dr               Janet Campbell  Director of the Center for Coastal Observation              notes  We are extremely grateful to Senator Gregg and his              staff for their continued support of the Coastal Observing Center              at UNH  This funding will enable us to continue to provide              critical environmental information to State and local partners              in the Seacoast region  For example  the information we provide              helps managers understand the effects of recent floods on lobsters              and other harvested species in Great Bay and offshore   Dr               Molly Lutcavage  Director of the UNH Large Pelagics Research Center               said  We appreciate Senator Gregg s success in securing              continued funding for our comprehensive program to protect migratory              marine species like tunas  sharks  marlin  and sea turtles through              better management  This is making possible development and demonstration              of cost effective new research tools   such as miniature tags and              new types of sensors to track migration   as well as a dynamic              research program at UNH   New Hampshire Ocean and                  Maritime Projects Fiscal Year 2007

involving both commercial fishermen and scientists that                address current and pressing questions on management of commercial                fisheries and ocean ecosystems  The Northeast Consortium                seeks to bring fishermens information  experience  and                expertise into the scientific framework needed for effective                fisheries management  This cooperative approach is unique                in that fishermen assist in the operation of the Northeast Consortium                 help select relevant and timely research topics and serve as                co principal investigators on each project  With additional resources                 the Consortium will  administer a proposal based grant competition                in partnership with the
