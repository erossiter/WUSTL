 Floor Statement on Border Security                                  by U S  Senator Judd Gregg  Chairman  Senate Appropriations                Subcommittee on Homeland Security                 Thursday  March 30  2006                  Unofficial Transcri   Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  the issue before us              is a critical one  how we maintain the atmosphere of this nation               which has basically been the essence of our definition as a culture               which is that we are an open society that invites people from around              the world to participate in our society  It was the reason we went              with the motto E Pluribus Unum  from many  one  And how we maintain              that atmosphere  that way of life which has given us so much energy              as a nation and given so many people the opportunity to pursue            the American dream is what this debate is all about                 Whatever we do  we do not want to chill that great tradition which                is really the engine for our strength as a nation  that people                come here seeking a better life and as a result they energize                our society to be even more productive and successful and stronger                 And we are  as has been mentioned by most of the speakers today                 most all of us immigrants  Certainly everyone in the Senate since                the departure of the great Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell falls                under that category  The issue breaks into two obvious parts  The first is how you secure the border the second is how you deal with the fact that there are a large number of peoplein this country who are here illegally today and that there are a large numberof people who would like to come to this country for the purposes of earninga living  and that they will come into this country however they can  And itis illegal  they come here illegally  and how we change that atmosphere                 On the first issue which has been discussed here and which is the                purpose of the bill before us  the bill filed by the Senate Majority                Leader  this is resolvable  Wecan secure our borders  That has been said by everybody  We should  We must We cannot survive if we do not have borders that are secure  if we do not knowwho is coming in the country and why they are coming here  If we have large numbersof people coming in illegally it undermines us as a nation of laws  There s noquestion that this can be resolved  however  It doesn t really take a lot ofnew laws to do that to be very honest  We can control who is coming into thiscountry    I want to get into the specifics of how we do that because I              do have the good fortune to chair the subcommittee which has jurisdiction              over the borders in the appropriations area  I want to talk about              what we need there   But before I do that  I also want to address              this issue of amnesty and guest worker and how we deal with the              folks who are here and who are here illegally  Let s assume for              the moment that we are able to secure the southern border which              I think we can  Might take two or three years but I m absolutely              sure that we can do that so that the vast majority of people coming              across the southern borders will come across in some manner that              is legal for a purpose which is not to harm us                 It is a little more difficult to do on the northern border  We              don t have the human wave coming across the northern border  The              northern border is more of a terrorist threat for us actually in              many ways but it doesn t have the human wave issue that we see              on the southern border  But the question becomes  how do you deal              with the folks that are already here illegally  There s this term              we can t give them amnesty  Amnesty is wrong  Well  as a practical              matter they have amnesty  Our system is not able to deal with these              individuals unless they become criminals  unless they take an act              that violates the law in an open way  commit a felony  do something              that is clearly a transgression to our society  If they are here              working as many of them are  supporting themselves and their families              and their families back home  for all intents and purposes they              have amnesty because we re not doing anything about it and we don t              have the capacity to do anything                 I think it s a straw dog  this argument of amnesty  The more fundamental              question is how do you set up a system which allows the people              to come out from behind the bushes where they have to hide so that              they aren t taken advantage of  so that they can be even more productive              in their role here in the United States and do it in a way that              doesn t basically affront our sensibility as a nation of laws and              especially address the issue of citizenship  There are a lot of              ways to do that and a lot of ideas being put forward                 The essence of the question is how you deal with the issue of citizenship               If you are here illegally  getting citizenship should probably              not be attainable  But there should be a way to allow you to participate              in our society so you don t have to hide  That assumes  however               that you have effectively set up a border enforcement mechanism              which works  because you can t move to any sort of  as the point              was made by the Senator from Louisiana  you can t move to any sort              of effort to try to redress or address the issue of people who              are here illegally unless you have border control over the borders              because you simply will create incentive for even more people to              come in illegally                 But let s remember that if we were able to solve the problem of              the people who are here illegally and who are working and who seek              nothing more than to be working  if we were are able to give them              some sort of status which would allow them to participate as workers              in this country in a public way so that they were able to participate              in systems like paying into the health care system  paying into              the retirement systems  I think we might actually be moving towards              a more constructive result than what we have today  which is essentially              a large number of people we know are here  we just turn our eyes              to the fact that they re here illegally                 They re going to be here  they re going to continue to be here               We re certainly not going to remove them because we have no way              to remove 10 million or 20 million people  however many there are               So I think the debate is misfocused in some ways when the word amnesty becomes              the hot button  nomenclature versus the more substantive question              about the people who are already here and have the right to be              here  As long as they re acting legally within the context of their              jobs  we re not going to do anything about that   we don t have              the capacity to remove 11 million people and our society wouldn t              be able to absorb it                But getting into the issue which I want to speak about today  which              is the specifics of the border patrol question and how you upgrade              the border patrol  the bill before us authorizes an additional              1 400 border patrol agents over the next few years  authorizes              more beds for detention  authorizes more technology for the purposes              of guarding the border  That s all well and good  and I strongly              support those authorization efforts   The bottom line is that the rubber does not meet the road with the authorization                            bill  The rubber meets the road when we spend the money  which is the appropriations                            bill  The problem we have is we are not committing resources in this area at                            the level that we need do to accomplish what is already on the books in the way              of obtaining security along the border                 Security along the border basically breaks down into three basic              components  First  how many agents  how many feet on the ground              do you have down there  Second  how many beds do you have so that              when you find people who are coming across illegally  you can actually              control where they re going so that you re not basically catching              and re releasing  but you can actually hold these people and send              them back and  third  what technologies are necessary to first              monitor the border and second evaluate people who are coming into              our country as to whether or not they re coming in to participate              in our society in a positive way or whether they re coming here              to do us harm                In all four of those categories    three categories with a couple              of subcategories    we have not been able to put the resources              in that are necessary to get where we want to  This doesn t mean              we haven t tried  In the last two years we have increased the number              of border patrol agents by 1 500  That s almost 1 300 more than              what the Administration asked for  We ve added over 2 000 beds              to detention  We have significantly increased funding for the surveillance              and technology area  especially in the area of U S  VISIT  which              is the program which is essentially going to try to  through technology               be able to evaluate people as they come into the country legally              and know whether or not they re people who we want to have visit              us or whether they re people who may be here to do us harm                 But that has not generated the results that we need  I want to              go through a fair number of statistics which are stark but should              be talked about because you are not going to get resolution around              here unless you talk about it                 The first is the issue of border agents  We have been increasing              our number of border agents rather significantly over the last              couple of years  as I just mentioned  but we also know that we              need to increase them even further in order to hit that goal  With              20 000 agents on the border  we can accomplish what we need to              do relative to boots on the ground  That means we have to increase              by 1 500  2 000  2 000  2 000 over the next several years  The              problem is very simple  It is a dollar issue which should be able              to be resolved  Secondly  it takes 30 000 applications in order              to hire 1 000 agents  It is very difficult to find the people we              need  It s that simple  because of the language requirements and              because of the education requirements and because of the demands              of the job                A second problem we have is that the technology situation is dire               especially in the area of aircraft where we re functioning with              a fleet of aircraft that has long overlived its purposes  We have              20 P 3s  The average life of the P 3s we have in the air should              be 20 years  I want to show you a picture of the problem we have              with our P 3s  This is a crack in the bathtub fitting of the P 3               As a result  last year we had 11 000 hours of P 3 flight  But this              year alone we ve had to reduce the P 3 flights by over 1 000 hours               because we have to retrofit these planes  Why  Because they re              40 years old  They should have only flown for 20 years  We have              the same problem in our helicopter fleet where the average life              is supposed to be 15 years for our helicopters  We re flying helicopters              which have average lives of 30 years                 These are problems of resources which need to be addressed  I ll              talk in a second as to how they should be addressed                The third issue is the area of surveillance  We ve heard about              the Predator  which is the unarmed  in this case  air surveillance              system along the border  This is a great breakthrough for us  There              are certain sections where there are heavily populated communities              where you are going to have to have fencing  But the great majority              of the border should not have fencing  It is the wrong image for              us  And we can do a lot with technology  One of the key issues              is that we only have one of them  We need 18 in order to effectively              do the border  So  again  it is an issue of resources  putting              resources in this area                 In the area of beds  we know that the states are absorbing a huge              amount of the costs of basically taking care of the illegal aliens              that have been arrested  We know that we do not yet have the beds              necessary to be able to even hold the non Mexican arrests  which              are the people we are most concerned about from a terrorist standpoint               We need to add a lot of new beds and we need to be creative about              this  not just physical buildings  We need to figure out ways to              use swing beds  We need to figure out ways to use closed military              facilities  maybe tent capabilities  This Congress has attempted              to do so by adding over 1 800 beds in the last few years                 We ve got serious resource issues  How do we address these  There              is a supplemental coming through here in a week  which is the supplemental              to fight the War on Terror  Now  it seems to me that probably one              of the core elements of fighting the War on Terror is making sure              the border is secure  And I would hope that within the limits of              that supplemental we would be able to fund the capital needs or              the at least make the first down payment on the major capital needs               which I ve just outlined of the border areas  Specifically  the              aircraft  replace those P 3 aircraft  buy more Predators  replace              the helicopters  make sure the cars that these agents drive can              go out in the field day after day and still work well  so that              we can move the agents out into the field  make the capital investments              in the buildings necessary in order to take care of these people                 That is something we should do now  and it s something we should              do in the context of national defense and it should be done as              part of this supplemental  The bigger problem we have is that when              the homeland security bill hits this floor  we re going to have              to figure out a way to pay for this  The Administration has proposed              that we increase fees on air transportation  Well  air transportation              fees do not necessarily line up with border patrol needs  In fact               the border patrol needs are not affected by air transportation              fees  Air transportation fees fund things like TSA  so it is unlikely              that fee is going to occur  But if we don t do it  we will have              a hole in the transportation security budget  I am making my commitment              to do that                 The reason I wanted to speak today is to make it clear that we              can  with additional resources  accomplish the first step to border              security and to immigration  good immigration policy  which is              border security that allows us to know who s coming into this country               And it is a very doable thing  All it takes is resources  and I              believe we should have  as a Congress  a willingness to commit              these resources  Mr  President  I yield the floor
