GREGG COMMENTS ON DEMOCRATIC ATTEMPT TO FORCE A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE ON RUMSFELD WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding a Democratic attempt to issue a no confidence vote in Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in a political posturing move against the War on Terrorism  Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  I ve listened to the Senator from Massachusetts s  Kerry  discussion  and in many ways I find it a bit disingenuous  I had planned to speak specifically about other points relative to this resolution  but I do think it is appropriate to respond in some manner to what he has said because of course he is the former standard bearer of the party in the prior election and  therefore  a voice of considerable import on policy in this nation relative to the positions of the Democratic Party   He gave the litany of what he deemed to be errors  some of which I believe were errors actually  but have occurred relative to the way we have pursued this battle in Iraq  The litany as if he is a Monday morning quarterback and had the answer now to what would have been the correct process  Sort of makes you think that if he were giving a discussion about the Red Sox he would have said that he wouldn t have put Bill Buckner at first  he wouldn t have pitched to Bucky Dent  and definitely wouldn t have traded Babe Ruth  I mean the concept that you come to the floor and pick out a series of events as unique items which flowed within the context of a major effort to confront the terrorist threat in this nation  confronting this nation  is truly    well  he uses the term hubris and mismanagement  I would say it is a bit of hubris  to take that position on this floor   He failed to mention  for example  that as a result of the initiatives of this Administration led by this President and by this Secretary of Defense that over 50 million people today are free who were not free  that women in Afghanistan are no longer closeted in their homes and threatened with death if they wear the wrong garment on the street and shot in soccer stadiums in Afghanistan  but women have the right to move about as they wish  that there have been elections in Afghanistan that have brought to power a democratic government  which is under pressure today  yes  because those forces which represent our enemies and are our enemies seek to undermine that democracy  He failed to mention that Iraq  which had suffered for 20 years from a genocide executed by a homicidal leadership is now free and that the people of Iraq no longer have to fear mass murder of the proportions which occurred under Saddam Hussein  that a government which was and had produced chemical and biological weapons and had used chemical weapons against their own people    specifically the Kurds    was no longer in power  And that we have had a series of democratic actions in Iraq which have led to a freely elected government which involves a coalition of very disparate groups    Sunnis  Shiites  Kurds and subdivisions within those various plans of political purpose    and that that government is moving forward and that it has stood up an army  which is a responsible army  not an army of threat to its people but an army of defense to its people and is in the process of taking responsibility for defending those people from forces in that nation who wish to return to chaos  to genocide  and to a government which is lawless in the name of fanaticism   He failed to mention any of that as a results of the efforts of this Administration  Those are pretty big things  Instead  he picks out the event    the little event    fairly big in some instances    of error  and yes  there have been some  Nobody denies that for a second  But the purpose is to defeat our enemies  and we have set as a goal in that process setting up a government in Iraq and a nation of Iraq which will speak to the basic values which are fundamentally Western  of individual liberty  of democracy  of rights for women  of a marketplace economy  and we have had considerable success in that effort   We are not there  And we do not know if we will accomplish the final goal because obviously there are forces at work who do not wish to have us accomplish that goal  But to dismiss this as a failure and to point to a series of incidences as the example of failure and never acknowledge the 50 million people who are free  the fact that an entire half of the population which had been written out of the ability to participate in civilized life    specifically women    are now brought into the process of having a decent lifestyle  the fact that we have had elections  the fact that we have an army in place  which is not our army but is their army  the fact that we are moving towards a nation based on democracy and law we have a long way to go but we re moving that way to dismiss that and to say that because of a series of errors  which he deems to be errors and in some instances I ve said that I agree with that  to dismiss that progress and call for this removal of the Secretary of Defense because of those events is just    well  it s ignoring reality  It s    in fact  he used the terms innumerable instances saying that he did not want to see a partisan fight  that he thought the Secretary of Defense should be above politics   You know  I mean  how can you then come to the floor and make the speech that was just made  which was overtly political  to use his terms  which was for the purpose of executing a political strategy  the strategy being that if you attack the Secretary of Defense  you weaken the presidency and you do better in the election  which was  to use his terms  viciously partisan in its attack  I mean  there is an inconsistency here that cannot go uncalled and so let me point it out  This is not an attack  this proposal  on Donald Rumsfeld  That s not the purpose of this attack that s the politics of this attack  It generates a good press release and it is a sound bite event  to call for the Secretary of Defense s resignation  But that s not what this is about  We all know that    This is about the policy of fighting people who have determined that America should be extinguished from the face of the earth and that Americans should be killed and that our culture should be destroyed  And whether or not the efforts in Iraq are a legitimate part of that effort as we confront that threat  It is the position of the other side  it appears  that Iraq is not part of the battle or essential to the battle against Islamic fundamentalists  I find that position to be untenable  That is hardly the position taken by our enemies  The words of Al Zarqawi  the words of Bin Laden have been very specific  Iraq is where they see the war being waged   Their purpose is to use Iraq as a bootstrap to pursue their goals of basically undermining and destroying Western culture and killing Americans  You need to believe their words  If your enemy tells you what they re going to do and your enemy then does what they tell you they re going to do  youve got to start taking them seriously when he tells you something else  And when Osama Bin Laden and Al Zarqawi said  Iraq is where the war is being fought  is where Islamic Fundamentalism is being pursued and aggressively undertaken  then you have to take that seriously  But it appears the other side feels that Iraq is a distraction to our efforts  Well  the track record doesn t show that   Have we been attacked in the United States since 9 11  The reason we haven t been attacked in some measure is just good luck  good fortune  But it s also the fact that this Administration has put in place an aggressive effort to fight terrorism  Islamic Fundamentalism   not in America  not on our soil  but to take the fight to their soil and to meet them where they are  And that policy appears to be working  We can t take great solace obviously because  obviously  who knows when they will attack us again and when they will reach our capacity to be secure   I don t claim that we are anywhere near secure  In fact  I ve made it very clear that I have serious reservations about things we need to do to make ourselves secure  But the fact is that the concept  the basic philosophy of pursuing the terrorists  the Islamic Fundamentalists  on their territory not wait for them to attack us and hoping to get them through our intelligence capability before they do that is a policy that is the correct policy  And yet  the other side of the aisle has had enough of it  They ve had enough of it  And so they want to use the stalking horse of attacking the Secretary of Defense as a process for basically undermining the policies and efforts which have led us at least to this point to some level of security as a nation  They don t appear  from what I heard here so far  to really even have an offer of an alternative that is specific enough that it could be said to be a real alternative   The letter was sent to the President outlining their alternative  Four initiatives they outlined pursuing aggressively  The response from the Administration was put in the record earlier today by the Senator from Arizona  Diplomatic process is going forward  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts talk extensively about a diplomatic need  This should be resolved diplomatically  And I believe his words were that there is no military solution  that there is only a diplomatic solution  I would just point out the obvious  You can t get to a diplomatic solution without having a military on the ground that makes things stable enough so that diplomacy can go forward  You withdraw in the military  you have chaos  and there is no diplomacy that s going to straighten that out  So that argument is a little disingenuous  to say the least  Sure  there isn t a military solution in the sense that this is a war involving nationhood  nation against nation in the tradition of the wars of the 20th century  But there are military actions that can be taken and need to be taken which involve finding those people who wish to do us harm and eliminating them before they can do us harm  And a big part of that involves the intelligence and the on the ground capability which we gained by being in Iraq and having an influence on that nation which is leading towards a form of democracy   Another big part of that  which is again military based  is allowing Iraq to evolve to the point where it can actually show the rest of the Islamic world that democracy is not an enemy  that democracy gives people good options  That giving people rights  especially women  is not bad for them  but actually is good for them  That a culture that is open  that is market oriented  that has a reasonable level of freedom is a better way of life than a culture that is closed and that denies people the rights to participate other than through some sort of extremist control such as the Taliban had  It becomes a beacon of opportunity to look to  We aren t there yet  but you re never going to get there if you don t make the effort  And so you look at their proposals  And as I said  three of them have already been met  And what s the fourth one  The fourth one is to begin what they refer to as    and I ll quote this  It is actually not their fourth one  It is the second one  although the other three have been met in their letter to the President  Beginning the phased redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq before the end of this year  this year  The Senator from Massachusetts kept saying a year from now is a reasonable time to begin the redeployment  Their position is not a year from now  Their position is this year to begin redeployment   What does this mean  this term phased redeployment  I wonder how many focus groups they ran that one through before they decided to use that terminology    phased redeployment  I ll tell you what it means  It s a phrase  the purpose of which is to give political cover to those who wish to be able to stand in opposition to the Administration relative to what is happening in the war against the Islamic Fascists  And in practice  were it ever to be executed    in other words  if you were to actually start to pull down troops before the end of this year  you would have set an arbitrary date and you would start removing American troops  And what would happen to the troops who were left there    We all know that Iraq is not yet ready to defend itself  Would that not put at even greater risk American soldiers left on the ground  How would you look the people in the face who are in the divisions and who are in the brigades who have been left behind as you start to pull people out prematurely and said oh  good luck  you re now a bigger target because we aren t there to give you the cover you need   Phased redeployment before the end of this year  arbitrary date set for the purposes of making a political statement as we head into an election  And it s not very good policy to say the least  even if it is policy  it isn t policy  It s just politics  a political statement  And who are they going to replace Donald Rumsfeld with  Howard Dean  Ned Lamont  These are the standard bearers of the position of their policy  They want to take out Donald Rumsfeld  I presume they want to put in Howard Dean and Ned Lamont  two people who speak for the party  to immediately withdraw  take our troops out of there now and to let happen what happens  You know  I m not going to use the pejorative to describe that  I think the American people are sophisticated enough to recognize that policy makes no sense  Howard Dean as Secretary of Defense  Maybe we should amend this and say and we shall replace him with Howard Dean   Howard Dean was a pretty good Governor of Vermont  I enjoyed working with him when I was Governor of New Hampshire  He wouldn t be a very good person in the Defense Department  He is not a very good person on foreign policy  and he clearly does not understand the threat  in my opinion  that the Islamic Fundamentalists reflect  Howard Dean  Ned Lamont policy is a policy based on naivete it is a policy that rejects the reality of the situation  which is there are people out there who wish to kill us and destroy our culture    and there are a lot of them  unfortunately  And they feed off of weakness  And they believe we are weak and believe we are truly weak to be able to make that case   Should we begin a phased withdrawal this year  when we have no military capability of covering that withdrawal and protecting our troops who are left behind  It is a policy that is firmly grounded in Birkenstocks and clearly not grounded in the reality of the world as it is  but the world as they wish it was   We have a truly extraordinary military  I recognize that everybody on both sides of the aisle understands that  And there isn t a member in this chamber who hasn t been to a funeral and tried to console the member of a family of someone who has been lost in this war in  this battle  These are exceptional people who defend us and who carry forward our flag  And they need to understand that their purpose is good and their purpose is right  And it is  Their cause is to find the people who wish to do America harm and who have said they intend to do America harm  and to eliminate them before they can attack us and do us further harm   Iraq is an integral part of that cause  Have there been mistakes there  Absolutely  Absolutely  And it is terribly unfortunate  and we all recognize that  But have there been successes there  and very significant successes there  Yes  there have been  As I said before  50 million people between Iraq and Afghanistan are now free  Women brought from behind the closeted doors of their houses into society  Press availability  Elections  Governments formed  Security forces who report to a government  We have a long way to go  but these soldiers have served extraordinarily well  and they have accomplished a great deal  And to use this attack on Donald Rumsfeld as a stalking horse for an attack on the policies of Iraq  I don t believe does anybody any good   If the other side of the aisle wishes to debate the Iraq issue in context of the policy  fine  But to personalize it this way in such a manner which    to quote the Senator from Massachusetts    is viciously partisan and overtly political is not constructive to our ability to pursue this war or to our need to assure our soldiers in the field that they fight for a right and just cause   Under the leadership of this President and the Secretary of Defense  Secretary Rumsfeld  the military has received the largest increases in resources in its history at any time since World War II  We have taken an approach to the military which has been essentially to get them whatever they need to do the job and do it right and make sure that our soldiers are safe  Errors have been made along the way in accomplishing that  but the intention and the commitment of resources have been there  And this President and this Secretary of Defense take a second seat to no one in our history relative to their commitment to the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America  Mr  President  I yield the floor
