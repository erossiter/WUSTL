Senator Gregg Signs On To Resolution Condemning States That Issue Drivers Licences To Illegal Immigrants Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today cosponsored a resolution which condemns states that issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants residing in the United States  This resolution  sponsored by Senator Norm Coleman  R MN   expresses the sense of the Senate that states who issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants are disregarding federal immigration laws and  consequently  putting our national security at risk  Eight states currently issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants  and New York will begin doing so soon Senator Gregg stated  Like most Americans  I believe common sense would dictate that someone who is here illegally should not be allowed to obtain a drivers license  It is irresponsible for states to loosely hand out these documents without checking that the recipients are here lawfully  This poses a national security risk  encourages illegal immigration  and is an affront to our sensibilities about the rule of law  Over the years  Ive supported legislation to make sure that illegal immigrants cannot obtain drivers licenses  and I hope this resolution sends a clear message to the states that they must act responsibly   The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Mitch McConnell  R KY   Lamar Alexander  R TN   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Jim DeMint  R SC   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Mel Martinez  R FL   Johnny Isakson   R GA   Pat Roberts  R   KS   Trent Lott  R MS   David Vitter  R LA   Richard Burr  R NC   Kit Bond  R MO   James Inhofe  R OK   Tom Coburn  R OK   and Lindsay Graham  R SC
