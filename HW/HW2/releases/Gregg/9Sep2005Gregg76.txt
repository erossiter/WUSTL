                               GREGG MAKES FLOOR STATEMENT ON                  HURRICANE KATRINA SUPPLEMENTAL                                  WASHINGTON               DC  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the Senate Budget              Committee and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee              on Homeland Security  today made the following floor statement              on the Hurricane Katrina Supplemental Spending bill expected to              come before the Senate later today  The Administration has requested               51 8 billion in emergency spending for efforts in the Gulf Coast   Senator Judd Gregg              Floor Statement              Thursday  September 9  2005 Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  we will sometime later today be seeing              a supplemental request here in the Senate to continue to fund the              needs of the relief effort in Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama               which will be approximately  50 billion on top of the  10 billion              that s already been spent  Obviously  it is essential that we get              these dollars down there and put them to use aggressively in order              to try to help the people who are in such dire straits and to try              to begin to bring some order and some relief to those who have              suffered so much  And as we proceed in this effort  we should err              on the side of making sure that we get the dollars there quickly              in order to support these individuals who are in such dire straits              and to try to assist this part of the country that has been hit              by this catastrophic event                 In the process  I think it is important that we have some fiscal                oversight that allows us to feel comfortable that the dollars                  that are being spent are going effectively  quickly  and aggressively                to relief efforts which are legitimate and appropriate  And                   thus                 I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for putting                in the Supplemental and identifying within the Supplemental  15                million  which will be assigned to the Inspector General s office                to start to put together the auditing process    and the oversight                process on how the money is being spent  which I believe is critical                We ve seen some initiatives here which  obviously if they are                  pursued logically make sense  but if they are pursued in a                  way that is                  not logical  they re going to cost us a lot of money and probably                  not give us a lot of relief  For example  there was a report                  in my state paper that said that all the dealerships who sell                  Winnebagos                  in New Hampshire has been contacted and told to get ready to                  transfer their entire inventory over to the federal government                  because they                  were going to ship it all out  Well maybe that s what we ll                  end up doing  but I would hope before we bought up all the                  Winnebagos                  and send them to the Gulf Coast  we would think about whether                  that s the best way to proceed                 There are a lot of ideas out there and I do think it is important                    that we have the structure in place that starts to monitor                    costs and how the money is being spent  and so I congratulate                    the House                     In addition  I think the President s decision    along with                    the Vice President    to have the Vice President physically                    go and                    be on the ground in the region is a very positive step in                  our efforts to get order in the process of delivering relief                  there                     Anybody                    who knows the Vice President    and I ve had the good fortune                    to serve with him in the House and now to serve here  as                  he s been                    Vice President    knows that he is a no nonsense individual                     He looks at an issue  decides how you re going to get the                  best results                    to resolving the problem and moves forward  He did that as                    Defense Secretary  He s done it as Vice President  He will                    bring immediate                    coherence  intelligence  and aggressive action to solving                  the problems and moving forward the complexities of this reconstruction                    and                    relief effort of  So I think it s an excellent decision to                    have the Vice President step into the middle of this and                  basically                    try to calm the waters but  more importantly  execute what s                    going                    on there in the area of the federal relief effort                 However  it does lead to the point that I ve made earlier                      and which I want to stress once again which is that this                      is not                      an overnight                       two month  three month exercise  To rebuild this region                  is going to take a significant amount of time  a tremendous                      amount of                      resources and a lot of thought and intelligence process                       We need to set up                       I believe  as we move forward here    and obviously not                  within                      the next few days but certainly within the next month                         some type of structured               Commission along the lines I would suggest of what was                      done in the horrific floods of 1926 when Herbert Hoover                      led the                      effort                       where you basically have a focal point with an individual                      of great ability and national recognition leading the effort                      that                      will manage                      the federal dollars as they come in from all the various                      federal agencies that will be impacted and then make sure                      that those                      federal dollars are effectively  efficiently  and quickly                      brought to bear                      on the problem in concert with the state and local governments                       And that s going to  I believe  take a separate type of                      entity to be created here  I would hope that we would be                      thinking                      about how we structure that entity and I would certainly                      be looking                      to people like Senator Shelby  Senator Lott  Senator Sessions                      and                      the Senators from Louisiana  Senator Landrieu and Senator                      Vitter  for ideas on how we should set that up                 We should be starting on that process  So I wanted to come                        to the floor to say that as we move forward on this Supplemental                         it is                         50 billion  that it is important that we retain this                  language and I guess we re going to try to move this through                  the                        Senate without any amendments  It is important that we                        retain this                        language                        which makes sure that the Inspector General has the resources                        that the office needs in order to effectively monitor                  how these funds                        are managed to make sure that we re getting the best                  return in the most prompt way for these tax dollars which are                        in dire need                        down there in order to pursue the reconstruction and                  relief                        effort
