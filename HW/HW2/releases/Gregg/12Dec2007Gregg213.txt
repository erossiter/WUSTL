Senator Gregg Offers Amendments to Eliminate Wasteful Spending in Farm Bill Contact  Betsy Holahan Emma Post  Senator Judd Gregg  ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee  today offered three amendments to the 2007 Farm Bill that will eliminate some of the excessive and wasteful spending included in the  603 billion package     Despite a strong farm economy  farm income is expected to be up 44  this year  this bill proposes to spend billions of dollars to support the agricultural sector  said Senator Gregg  The bill establishes  5 billion in new mandatory spending for agriculture disasters which benefits only a handful of states  sets up new programs for targeted special interests  and authorizes frivolous earmarks  This is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars  and my amendments are a step toward restraining some of the more egregious abuses     Senator Gregg today offered an amendment that would eliminate the new  5 1 billion five year mandatory agriculture disaster assistance trust fund  most of which would likely go only to Texas  North Dakota  Minnesota  South Dakota  Kansas  Iowa and Georgia  Nearly  1 billion of that money would instead be directed to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2008 to help respond to this winters skyrocketing energy prices  with the remaining savings used for deficit reduction     This new  permanent mandatory funding stream is a benefit not offered to any other industry in America  said Senator Gregg  Despite expanding federal crop insurance in 2000 in order to alleviate the need for ad hoc disaster aid  this assistance continues year after year  the most recent example being  3 7 billion enacted as part of the FY2007 supplemental  This permanent disaster assistance wont prevent additional disaster money from being appropriated  A better use of these dollars would be to assist low income families and seniors struggling to pay their heating fuel bills this winter while also reducing the deficit so future generations arent left out in the cold     Senator Gregg also offered an amendment to eliminate  15 million in payments to asparagus producers  a crop that is only commercially produced in three states  California  Michigan and Washington  The third amendment would eliminate the authorization of a new spending earmark  the creation of a Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network  which would supposedly provide behavioral health programs to farmers and ranchers     While the Farm Bill contains excessive spending  equally distressing is the fact that it includes  34 billion in budget gimmicks and mechanisms to avoid Pay Go budget discipline  as well as  15 billion in tax increases  said Senator Gregg  The bill shifts commodity and crop insurance payments  corporate tax payments  and sunsets programmatic increases  all with the express purposes of masking the true cost of the package and avoiding paying for it  What cannot be hidden is that these sleights of hand will have long term budgetary consequences for the American taxpayer   Budget Gimmicks And Pay Go Avoidance    All Used to Pay for Farm Bills Excessive Spending  A Budget Perspective The U S  Senate is currently considering the 2007 Farm Bill  which consists of the Food and Energy Security Act as reported by the Senate Agriculture Committee  combined with the Heartland  Habitat  Harvest and Horticulture Act as reported by the Senate Finance Committee  Despite a strong agricultural economy  spending under this bill totals  603 billion over ten years  Even more egregious is the fact that the bill includes  34 billion in budget gimmicks and mechanisms to avoid pay go budget discipline as well as  15 billion in tax increases  all of which will have long term budgetary consequences       Overall Cost of Bill is High  Despite Strong Farm Economy      34 Billion of Budget Gimmicks Used to Mask Spending  Avoid Pay Go   Bad Fiscal Policy   Contains New Programs For Targeted Special Interests   Expands Existing Programs for Targeted Special Interests
