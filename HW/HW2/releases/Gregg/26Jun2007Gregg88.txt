Senator Gregg Votes To Continue Debate On Immigration Reform Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg today joined 63 of his colleagues in supporting a motion to proceed to debate on S 1639  a comprehensive immigration reform package   Senator Gregg stated  Today I voted in support of debating immigration reform  one of the biggest issues facing our country  The bill in its present form needs to be fixed  but so does our immigration system  There is no way to improve this bill if we refuse to take it up and debate it   It is a known fact that our current immigration laws and procedures are not working  Our borders are porous and we have not done enough to ensure that we know who is coming into our country on a daily basis  We must establish control over our borders  especially our border with Mexico  before we make sweeping changes in our immigration laws and issue visas to millions of undocumented immigrants   We need to address the fact that our current immigration laws undermine our nations future competitiveness in the global economy  Instead of encouraging the best and brightest to come here and create economic opportunities for all  we slam the door in their faces through arbitrary restrictions and an overemphasis on family relations over individual merit  While this bill makes some improvements in this area  it also takes some significant steps backwards by undermining important visa programs  namely  the H 1B visa program  that are critical for recruiting highly skilled individuals  It is quite possible that over the next few days  proposed amendments may make the bills flaws only worse with respect to the H 1B program  and this is unacceptable when our nation is facing a growing shortage of workers with the skills and education necessary for todays growth industries  I will not support a debate that does not follow regular process and give individual members  including myself  a fair opportunity to address this issue and make sure that our immigration laws are aligned with our nations priorities   Any plausible immigration reform must also increase the number of available guest workers so that employers have legal alternatives if U S  workers are unavailable  A workable guest worker system  which has wage protections and other measures to ensure that U S  workers are not adversely affected  is critical to help ensure that employers and immigrants play by the rules  as well as take pressure off our Southwest border  This bill  however  fails to create a practical guest worker program for all employers  and I find it hard to believe that any comprehensive immigration reform will work unless we fix this problem  Unfortunately  the Senate will not even be allowed to consider an amendment that addresses this issue  So I have voted to allow debate on this important measure  but do so with serious reservations about the present form of the legislation  I am hopeful that substantive improvements can be made to this bill  however  if they are not  this bill will fail and I will vote against it
