Senator Gregg  Baby Boomer Retirement Has Begun  Entitlement Reform Cannot Be Put Off Any Longer Contact  Betsy Holahan Emma Post  Yesterday  the nations first Baby Boomer applied for Social Security benefits  an event which will be repeated by roughly 70 million more Boomers over the next two decades    thats nearly 10 000 people every day  This massive demographic shift will trigger an explosion in the cost of federal health and retirement programs  which by 2034 will absorb 20 percent of GDP  equal to the entire federal budget today      We cannot tax our way out of this problem  and it cannot be remedied through economic growth alone  To simply pass on the bill for trillions in entitlement spending to our children and grandchildren would be a disgrace      Therefore  the time has come for Congress and the President to begin to address the structure of programs serving the retired population  in order to prevent the collapse of the federal benefit system under its own weight  Any solutions to our fiscal challenges must be bipartisan  this problem impacts all Americans  so both political parties should be committed to solving it  The Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action  S  2063   a joint legislative proposal from Senator Conrad and I that would prompt swift  bipartisan action to address our long term fiscal imbalances  is the right place to start  Yesterdays milestone shows that we cannot delay any longer
