However  this development is threatening sensitive              ecosystems  and these two projects are perfect examples of local              and state leaders stepping up to guarantee their future protection               They not only protect valuable habitat and wetlands  but miles              of recreational trails and help ensure the safety of a significant              amount of drinking water for the Seacoast   It is the collaboration between state and local officials              that makes conservation projects like these possible in New Hampshire  stated              Congressman Bradley  These two projects present an opportunity              to preserve hundreds of acres of land in one of the fast growing              regions of the state  Not only will these tracts of land offer              recreational access for the public  they will protect wildlife              habitats and will help to safeguard drinking water quality for              Newfields and Newmarket

town  state  and private funds being raised  This property              is at the heart of our rural character  and we are excited to have              the opportunity to preserve that character
