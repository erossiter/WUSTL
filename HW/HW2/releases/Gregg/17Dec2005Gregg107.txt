                               SENATOR GREGG COMMENTS ON PATRIOT ACT                                              WASHINGTON               U S Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today made the following statement              regarding the USA PATRIOT Act  The failure of the Senate to renew the PATRIOT Act is a              serious blow to our ability to defend ourselves from the forces              of Osama bin Ladin  whose purpose is to kill Americans indiscriminately               and who  if they have the opportunity  will use a nuclear or biological              weapon to attack us   The PATRIOT Act  in a measured and responsible way  corrected              may of the failures in our intelligence and law enforcement communities               which lead to our lack of anticipation of the attacks on 9 11               The Act would allow agencies like the Department of Defense and              the CIA to transfer information on foreign terrorists to the FBI              and local law enforcement  who need to have this type of information              in order to know who is out there threatening us and to coordinate              with each other  It would allow law enforcement  under strict guidelines               to intercept and investigate those who would use America s openness              as a society as weapon in their plans to harm us  but allow their              activities to be monitored under court review  and thus hopefully              catch them before they attack us   This is not an academic exercise  The real threat to individual              freedoms is the likelihood that Islamic fundamentalist terrorists              will succeed in their purpose to commit mass murder here in the              United States and fundamentally harm our nation through the use              of a weapon of mass destruction  The failure to extend the PATRIOT              Act leaves us much more vulnerable to these people and their purposes               they are the true threat to our freedom and our nation
