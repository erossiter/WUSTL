 Statement of Senate Budget Committee Chairman                  Gregg on Senate Passage of the Tax Relief Reconciliation Conference                  Agreement                I              applaud my colleagues in the U S  Senate on their votes to extend              pro growth tax policies that will keep our economy on the right              path  continuing the trend of economic expansion  job creation              and surging revenues that have resulted from the enactment of Republican              tax relief in 2003  These policies created incentives for Americans to work              harder and invest  which has triggered a massive explosion in economic              activity over the past two and a half years  5 3 million new jobs               GDP at more than 9 percent  record levels of productivity  and            fiscal year to date revenues up by more than 11 percent   I am pleased to see that attempts to revert to a 1930s              tax policy of raising taxes to generate revenue was recognized              for the poor plan that it is  and defeated  The best way to generate              revenue for the government is to stimulate the economy  something            these pro growth tax policies have clearly done
