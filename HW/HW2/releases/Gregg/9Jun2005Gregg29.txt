six conservation initiatives              in northern New Hampshire  The Fiscal Year 2006 Interior Appropriations              bill passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today  and now              heads to the full Senate for its consideration  As a member of              the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior  Senator              Gregg was able to include language for the six projects in the              bill    Senator Gregg was successful in including the following projects               Silvio O  Conte National Wildlife Refuge   1 million  with  500 000

       being undertaken at some of these forests and wildlife refuges              in New Hampshire is having a greater impact than merely protecting              beautiful lands  It is giving scientists and researchers ways to              protect and improve similar environments around the country  They              are doing outstanding work making sure thousands of acres of some              of New Hampshire s most pristine forests remain that way and will              for generations of future residents and visitors     David Sleeper  Executive Director  Hubbard Brook Research Foundation  stated    I am delighted to learn that Senator Gregg has included funding for the Mirror  Lake Project and the Northeastern States Research Cooperative  NSRC  in this  year s Interior Appropriations bill  Both appropriations have environmental  ramifications far beyond the borders of New Hampshire  The Mirror Lake Project  protects forestland and shorefront at one of the Granite State s most beautiful  lakes  while at the same time providing housing for scientists of the Hubbard  Brook Ecosystem Study  HBES   HBES has become a world force in ecosystem thinking   making major discoveries regarding the effects of timber harvesting  climate  change  acid rain  and other natural and manmade disturbances  NSRC provides  vital funding for a wide variety of research projects across the Northern Forest   from ecosystem science to forest economics to timber management practices   Senator Gregg understands completely that good environmental policy flows from  a solid base of scientific knowledge  often on very complex issues      more     Dennis Shaffer  Northern New England Field Office Director for              the Trust for Public Land  stated   The Trust for Public Land applauds              Senator Gregg for his leadership to ensure that millions of dollars              in conservation funding for the state of New Hampshire were included              the FY 06 Senate Interior Appropriations bill  His efforts have              brought us one large step closer to protecting some of the state s              most threatened rivers  lakes and forests  and the communities              that treasure them including Rossview Farm  Mirror Lake and Lake              Umbagog and Silvio Conte National Wildlife Refuges     Charles Levesque  Executive Director of the North East State              Foresters Association  stated   Thanks to Senator Gregg the Northern              Forest Partnership Program has been able to fund many important              small grant initiatives in the last two years to encourage community              and business based projects centered on the conservation of the              forests of the Northern Forest region  This new information on              the FY 06 appropriations for the Program is wonderful  Senator              Gregg has done yeoman s work on conservation issues like this over              the years and is to be congratulated for these efforts     Jane A  Difley  President Forester  Society for the Protection of New Hampshire  Forests  stated   Senator Gregg has again demonstrated his strong commitment  to land conservation both nationally and here in New Hampshire  The scope of  New Hampshire conservation projects funded in this year s Interior bill is  especially remarkable given federal budget constraints  The Forest Society  is deeply grateful to Senator Gregg for his dedication  and his effectiveness   in protecting New Hampshire s most precious landscapes for future generations    Fiscal

will serve to establish a conservation campus to support              the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study  The protection of this land              will help ensure the integrity of the hydrologic and water quality              data that has been gathered at Mirror Lake for over four decades              and allow for future research to continue on acid rain  mercury              and nitrogen pollution and other long term threats to our environment  Northern Forest Partnership Program    350 000   These funds will              help continue a small grants program to support innovative
