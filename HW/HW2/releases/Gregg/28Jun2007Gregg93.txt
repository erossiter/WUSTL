Senator Gregg Announces Senate Appropriations Committee Support For Two New Hampshire Lake Preservation Projects  Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved  400 000 in federal funding for two New Hampshire lake conservation programs  The measure includes  200 000 for the New Hampshire Lake Host Program to continue education programming in preventing the spread of milfoil and other invasive species in lakes and ponds  and  200 000 for the New Hampshire Volunteer Lake Assessment Program to evaluate the quality of lakes and ponds in cooperation with trained volunteers  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice and Science  Senator Gregg included these funds in the Fiscal Year 2008 funding measure  which is now ready for consideration by the full Senate later this year  The funding for these projects is included within the Committee allocation set out for the Fiscal Year 2008 spending measures    A detailed project list is included below  Senator Gregg stated  Together with our mountains and vast stretches of forest land  our water resources play a critical role in enhancing our states natural beauty  However  as New Hampshire continues to grow  one of the most pressing challenges we face is ensuring that our lakes and ponds remain healthy and vibrant  Fortunately  both of these projects understand the need to act now  and are taking important steps to protect our unique natural resources  Jared Teutsch  President of NH Lakes Association  stated  Once again Senator Judd Gregg has proven to be New Hampshires best advocate for protecting our wonderful resources  especially our lakes  Through his leadership  we anticipate a continued federal partnership with the NH Lakes Association Lake Host Program  the premier aquatic invasive species prevention and education program   protecting our public waters from invasive aquatic weeds like variable milfoil  Since the Lake Host Program began in 2002  Senator Gregg has made it a priority to help protect New Hampshires pristine public waters  including our lakes  We cannot thank him enough for his continued commitment to New Hampshire and our quality of life  Tom Burack  New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Commissioner  stated  New Hampshire continues to reap the benefits of Senator Greggs dedication to the environment and the quality of life that we have come to expect  The funding secured by Senator Gregg will greatly enhance the ability of our staff and volunteer groups to collect water quality data from New Hampshires lakes and rivers  With over 900 lakes and ponds and only a handful of limnologists  aquatic biologists  to monitor and maintain water quality  New Hampshire is fortunate to have over 500 volunteer monitors throughout the state who provide water testing  sample collection and delivery to state laboratories for chemical and biological analyses  These statewide volunteer monitors become the eyes and ears of state biologists for the waterbody they live on  Volunteer monitoring data is extremely valuable in assessing state and national lake quality trends and provides a key link in education efforts between lake associations  municipalities and the DES  Volunteers provide DES with fish for mercury analyses that provide data for state mercury advisories and are trained to spot exotic aquatic plants and report them to biologists before they have a chance to spread throughout the lake  These funds will be extremely helpful to bolster one of the Departments most popular programs  Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce  Justice and Science Appropriations Bill   New Hampshire Projects Securing Senate Appropriations Committee Approval New Hampshire Lake Host Program    200 000   The New Hampshire Lakes Association Lake Host Program is an education and prevention program designed to be the first line of defense against exotic invasive aquatic plants  Through the Lake Host Program  trained paid and volunteer lake hosts staff public motorized boat launch sites to  1  educate visiting boaters about exotic plants  2  conduct courtesy boat and trailer inspections  3  show boaters where to look for plant hitchhikers and encourage them to self inspect  4  send samples of suspicious plants removed from boats to the NH Department of Environmental Services for identification  Since the start of the Program in 2002  lake hosts have inspected over 143 000 boats while recording 135 saves of exotic species either entering or leaving a waterbody  In addition  the rate of the spread of exotic aquatic plants has rapidly declined in New Hampshire and no new exotic plant infestations have been found in lakes being protected by the NH Lakes Association Lake Host Program  Since 2002  Senator Gregg has secured  579 400 in federal funding for the Lake Host Program  New Hampshire Volunteer Lake Assessment Program    200 000   The New Hampshire Volunteer Lake Assessment Program  VLAP  was initiated in 1985 in response to an expressed desire of lake associations to be involved in lake protection and watershed management  There are more than 900 lakes and ponds in New Hampshire  and with only 10 DES biologists  this program allows volunteers to be trained to gather trend data from lakes and ponds  VLAP is a cooperative program between volunteer monitors and the DES  which leads to local awareness of land use and human practices that may be detrimental to lake quality and also empowers communities in their decision making regarding lake management issues  Approximately 500 volunteers from 154 lakes and ponds located throughout the state presently participate in VLAP
