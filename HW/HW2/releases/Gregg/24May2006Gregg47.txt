                                                              SENATE APPROVES TWO GREGG              AMENDMENTS                TO IMMIGRATION BILL                 WASHINGTON The              Senate tonight voted in favor of two amendments sponsored by U S               Senator Judd Gregg  Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee              on Homeland Security    One amendment by U S  Senators Judd Gregg  R NH  and Maria Cantwell               D WA  is to reform the current green card lottery program by reallocating              two thirds of the 50 000 visas currently issued to a new advanced              degree lottery system  The visas issued under the proposed advanced              degree visa lottery would only be available to applicants who have              a masters or doctorate degree in science  technology  engineering               or mathematics  The Gregg Cantwell amendment  approved by a vote              of 56 42  represents a bipartisan response to address shortages              in these areas   Speaking on the Senate floor today on the Byrd Gregg                Amendment               Senator Gregg stated  It s going to take us about  2 billion              to move forward a fully implemented sensor technology on the border               We know it will cost approximately  2 billion in addition to the               2 billion I just mentioned  to do a fully integrated communications              system on the border  And we re talking here about all the borders               not just the Southern border  We know that in order to upgrade              the air fleet  which is extremely aged  the P 3 s being almost              20 years over their useful life  the helicopters being 20 years              over their useful life  that it will be another  2 4 billion  So              there is great need for funds to adequately secure the border               And I think we have all agreed in this Senate    and I think it s              the consensus of the American people    that the first effort in              the area of controlling illegal immigration should be the securing              of our borders and especially our Southern border  which has been              the point of most concern relative to illegal immigrants coming              across    And this amendment reflects that understanding  that for              all the good intentions and all the good words  if they aren t              backed up by resources    a point I ve made on this floor enumerable              times and which is made by this amendment    you simply can t accomplish              your goal  The goal obviously is to secure the Southern border              so to the extent you can do it  you limit people coming in here              illegally through the use of an intelligent border security system               That means electronics  it means boots on the ground  it means              adequate aircraft  it means adequate unmanned aircraft  it means              adequate Coast Guard  But it all takes dollars  And the Senator              from West Virginia has pointed out  the dollars simply haven t              been in the pipeline  And the dollars are not in the pipeline               as I have mentioned before on this floor   An amendment by Senator Gregg and Senator Robert C  Byrd  D WV               would provide funding for border security through a  500 supplemental              fee on individuals wishing to change their status from illegal              aliens to legal  This amendment was approved by a vote of 73 25    Speaking on the Senate floor today on the Gregg Cantwell                Amendment               Senator Gregg stated  The purpose of this amendment is really              pretty simple  We as a nation are in the process of addressing              how we handle the illegal immigrant situation  how we handle immigration              generally  We re about to basically give a large number of people                 10 million  maybe 12 million people    who arrived here illegally              the opportunity to get in line and earn their citizenship  Those              people for the most part don t have any unique skills that made              them special to America s society    But we didn t seek them out because we felt they were              going to add and create jobs here in the United States  But we              do have this program called the lottery program where we essentially              say to anybody in certain countries which are alleged to be underserved              in the sense that they have few people coming into this country                 emigrating into this country  you can get into a lottery and              you can get in line and become an American citizen  get a green              card and become an American citizen  And there are 50 000 winners              handed out every year  And it just seems to us that if you re going              to have such a program in the context of overall immigration reform               you ought to be saying that people who can participate in this              lottery are people who we as a nation actively need in order to              make our nation stronger socially and economically    What we re proposing essentially is to bring people into              our country who will create jobs  who are job creators by definition              because they have certain skills and abilities  certain talents              which we as a nation we know we need  Take  for example  the issue              of engineers  We are confronting a world where countries like Japan              and especially China are graduating literally four  five  six times              the number of engineers we re graduating  We re just not producing              enough people in those disciplines  the science disciplines to              keep up with our needs as a nation to be competitive economically               So it makes sense that we should go around the world and say to              people who have those types of talents  if you want to come to              the United States  we ve got certain programs which we can use              to help you come here
