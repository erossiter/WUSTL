Senator Gregg Announces Funding For Three Seacoast Environmental Initiatives Signed Into Law Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill which contains funding for three important Seacoast environmental initiatives in the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration budget was signed into law today  The measure includes  7 247 million for the Joint Hydrographic Center   6 502 million for the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology and  3 52 million for the Great Bay Resource Protection Partnership  Funding for these projects is included within the Appropriations Committee allocation set out for Fiscal Year 2008 spending bills  A detailed description of each project is included below  Senator Gregg stated  So much of New Hampshires history has been shaped by coastal activities and we have a responsibility to preserve our oceans and coastline so future generations will continue to enjoy these vast resources  The researchers and students at UNH are leading the field in a wide variety of critical coastal studies  including mapping of the ocean floor and pollution detection and prevention  UNH has taken the initiative to concentrate on these areas and its strong dedication will ensure the future health of sensitive coastal areas  Gregg added  The Great Bay is one of the most extraordinary environmental resources in our state and ensuring its protection is critical  The work being done by the Partnership continues to make sure that generations of New Hampshire residents and visitors will be able to enjoy the Bay in all its natural splendor  I applaud the Partnership for its continued success in protecting the Bay and look forward to its future accomplishments which will be aided by this funding  Gregg continued  Though the Democratic Leadership pushed this years appropriations process into the 11th hour  it is important to note that Republicans efforts to control spending successfully eliminated nearly  18 billion in new spending  I am pleased my colleagues were able to reach across the aisle and come up with an omnibus package which is more in line with the budget request  provides critical funding for troops in the field  and still includes funding for important New Hampshire initiatives  We are grateful for Senator Greggs continued support of the UNH NOAA Joint Hydrographic Center  The Center continues to advance our Nations nautical charting  seafloor mapping and ocean charting capabilities  said Dr  Larry Mayer  UNH co director  We continually develop new tools  technology and software at the center  these have led to higher quality charts and maps and have enhanced our nautical charting processes  In addition  Senator Greggs leadership has allowed the Joint Hydrographic Center to continue its primary role in conducting continental shelf surveys to extend the jurisdiction of the United States beyond the existing 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone and help secure the Nations access to and protection of valuable seafloor resources  We will also begin the development of tools that will allow the sonars and autonomous vehicles now used to map the seafloor to provide information on fisheries habitat and fish behavior    both critical to the successful management of our fisheries  We greatly appreciate Senator Greggs continued support of science and technology that directly targets the needs of coastal communities for preserving and protecting our valuable coastal resources  said Dr  Richard Langan  UNH co director of CICEET  the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology  a partnership of UNH and NOAA  This year CICEET will focus on innovative approaches to protect and restore shoreline habitats  The shorelines of our bays and estuaries are rapidly eroding  putting coastal properties and important near shore habitats such as sea grass and shellfish beds at risk  New restoration approaches are needed to prevent future degradation of coastal resources  In addition to our focus this year on shoreline restoration  CICEET will continue to develop tools to manage storm water runoff  clean up polluted sediments in coastal waters  and reduce human health risks at swimming beaches from sewage borne microbes  Protecting Great Bay has been a long term  deliberative initiative  based on the very best science  detailed conservation planning  and strong relations with communities  said Daryl Burtnett  state director of The Nature Conservancy in New Hampshire  Senator Gregg understands the urgency for action at remarkable places like Great Bay  where the window of opportunity is steadily closing  Federal funding through NOAA will enable the protection of hundreds of acres of estuary and river shoreline  rich wetlands  and rare coastal forests  maintaining public recreational opportunities and providing important natural services like water filtration and flood storage  Peter Wellenberger  Manager of the Great Bay Research Reserve  The Great Bay Resource Protection Partnership continues to protect and conserve key parcels of land throughout the Great Bay Estuary  The recently announced 79 acre Conservation Easement in Durham along the shores of Great Bay is just another example of the success achieved by the Partnership  The funds being allocated in the 2008 NOAA budget will allow the Partnership to continue their protection efforts  Some of the priority areas for 2008 include the Crommet Creek area and the tidal portion of the Cocheco River   7 247 million  Joint Hydrographic Center   The NOAA UNH Joint Hydrographic Center is a national center of excellence developing innovative approaches to coastal and ocean mapping in support of safe navigation  fisheries management  national security and sovereignty  environmental and archaeological studies  and offshore exploration  Educational programs are interwoven with research to immerse NOAA personnel and students from around the world in advanced aspects of ocean mapping  With this award  the project will explore the use of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles for critical shallow water mapping needs  including  harbor security  improving the efficiency and productivity of national seafloor mapping programs  developing techniques to map and visualize large swaths of the water column in order to understand fish behavior  distribution  and perhaps biomass  and mapping the seafloor in support of US resource sovereignty under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea    Since 2000  Senator Gregg has secured  34 million in federal funding for the Center   6 502 million  Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology   CICEET is a UNH based national center that engages research institutions  the government and the private sector to develop and implement new tools to achieve clean water and healthy coasts  CICEET targets innovative solutions that are affordable  practical  and accessible to detect and prevent pollution and recover degraded coastal habitats  With these funds  CICEET will  enhance the use of new technologies to identify sources of bacterial and viral pathogens through demonstration  evaluation  and dissemination of results  implement initial evaluations of contaminated sediment treatment technologies in a new test site in the Piscataqua River near the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  improve capabilities of coastal decision makers to assess and predict pollution and habitat degradation resulting from different land use alternatives  and conduct research and development activities to reduce the cost  improve the ease of use  and increase availability of new water quality monitoring technologies    Since 1997  Senator Gregg has secured  58 7 million in federal funding for the CICEET   3 52 million   Great Bay Partnership  These funds will support the continued conservation efforts around Great Bay  Current priority areas include Crommet and Lubberland Creeks  lower Lamprey River  Tuttle Swamp  and the Great Bay and Little Bay shorelines  The GBRPP is led by the Nature Conservancy and includes the NH Fish and Game Department  Ducks Unlimited  NH Audubon  and the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve  It seeks to permanently protect critical habitats at Great Bay  Since 1999  federal funds have helped the Partnership protect 4 456 acres  Local communities and other organizations have protected an additional 3 020 acres  Since 1997  Senator Gregg has secured  50 million in federal funds for the Partnership
