Senator Gregg Joins Bi Partisan Effort to Provide Affordable Health Insurance to All Americans Contact Erin Rath Betsy Holahan  WASHINGTON  DC  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today announced that he will co sponsor bi partisan legislation to overhaul the nations health care system  in an effort to make quality  affordable health insurance available to all Americans  The Healthy Americans Act was introduced by Senators Ron Wyden  D OR  and Robert Bennett  R UT  earlier this year     The cost of health care in this country is spiraling out of control  and represents a growing financial crisis for many Americans who either cannot afford it  or are struggling to keep the insurance plan they have  said Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  The Healthy Americans Act uses the private health insurance market to ensure that all Americans have a quality plan they can afford  It is by no means a perfect plan  but it is a good starting place for a bi partisan dialogue on health care reform  an issue everyone agrees must be a priority    The Healthy Americans Act establishes a new consumer focused private market based health insurance system to ensure that all Americans  not already covered by Medicare or the U S  military  have a quality and affordable private insurance plan  Under this proposal  plans will be linked to the individual  not the individuals employer  thereby allowing coverage to follow the individual from job to job     In addition  the bill provides incentives for preventive health care  wellness programs  and disease management  as well as a stronger focus on health care cost containment measures  These measures include lowering administrative costs and focusing on chronic care management  health information technology and medical malpractice reform as tools to control costs      With health care reform so urgently needed  this plan is a good alternative to those being offered by the Democratic presidential candidates  said Senator Gregg  This is a private market approach  We do not want to go down the path of a nationalized  single payer health care system run by the federal government  which will lead to rationing and a reduction in quality of the care available  I do have some serious concerns about this plan  including the imposition of mandates  its impact on current market competition  and its impact on domestic businesses and our global competitiveness  That said  I am hopeful that by joining forces with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a private market approach  we can begin a bi partisan dialogue  work through our differences  and find workable solutions that will result in a better health care system for all
