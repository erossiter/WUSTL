Senator Gregg Comments on Iraq Study Group Legislation Contact  Erin Rath Laena Fallon U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  made the following statement regarding the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act  S 1545   of which he is an original cosponsor  Last month  I joined four of my Democratic colleagues and three of my Republican colleagues in introducing the Iraq Study Group legislation  which officially establishes the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group as our nations policy and requires the President to report to Congress periodically on actions being taken to implement them  The recommendations proposed  and the ensuing legislation  provide a clear and concise blueprint for drawing down our troops in Iraq in a responsible and organized way  while attempting to protect our troops and our national security and establish a stable government in Iraq   I am pleased that more colleagues on both sides of the aisle are joining us in supporting this legislation that was crafted through serious  thoughtful policy discussions rather than dissolving into partisan rhetoric  which distracts from the important issues at hand of protecting our troops and protecting our national security     I do not support efforts by Senators Reid  Obama and others who have essentially called for an immediate withdrawal of funding for our troops  This sort of action would completely undermine the morale of our troops and endanger their safety  This would be precipitous and counterproductive and would result in chaos in Iraq and severely compromise our national security
