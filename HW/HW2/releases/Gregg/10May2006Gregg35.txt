                                SCHUMER  GREGG CALL FOR LIFTING STEEP TARIFF ON FOREIGN              ETHANOL IMPORTS  COULD SAVE DRIVERS 8 CENTS PER GALLON                U S               Senators Chuck Schumer  D NY  and Judd Gregg  R NH  announced bipartisan              legislation to lift the steep tariff on foreign ethanol imports              until the end of the year in order to temporarily to increase the              supply of the federally mandated fuel additive  New requirements              forcing gasoline to be blended with ethanol  a shortage in production              of domestic ethanol and a huge tariff on each gallon of imported              ethanol increase prices at the pump  By allowing foreign imports              of ethanol  lifting the 54 cent per gallon tariff could quickly              reduce the cost of gas for consumers by about 8 cents per gallon                 Last week  President Bush expressed support for temporarily lifting              the tariff and prominent Democrats and Republicans in both the              House and Senate have expressed support as well   The summer isnt even here yet and consumers              are being tipped upside down at the pump  Schumer said               Without immediate and concrete efforts by the federal government               we could even higher prices for gasoline  drastically increased              airline tickets  and the average American family will be stuck              with the bill  Because we do not yet produce enough ethanol              keep pace with this new mandate  we are reliant either on a limited              domestic supply or on a foreign supply that is made more expensive              by a heavy tariff  In order to solve this problem in the              short term  we need to immediately drop the 54 cent per gallon              tariff on imported ethanol until domestic production can keep up      Gregg stated  As the weather starts to turn              warmer  families are getting ready to prepare summer travel plans  Yet               gas prices remain at an all time high  The bill we are introducing              today will bring about a real change that drivers will feel in              their wallets  By temporarily repealing the ethanol tariff               we will be increasing the number of available ethanol sources and              supplies to consumers                Currently  ethanol produced outside of the United States is subject              to a  0 54 per gallon tariff meant to level the playing field for              domestic ethanol producers in competition against cheaper  foreign              produced ethanol  As a result of federal regulations and              the ethanol mandate included in the recently passed Energy Bill               the United States must consume 4 billion gallons of ethanol  Gasoline              currently sold in the United States containing ethanol is typically              10  ethanol by volume                              The problem is there has not been a corresponding increase in the              production and supply of ethanol  Domestic production is slowly              growing  but cant keep up with current demand  One              factor that contributes to the supply crunch is that ethanol produced              outside of the United States is subject to the 54 cents per gallon              tariff  Since ethanol supply is so tight  the price of ethanol              in the United States has gone up  which is contributing to the              price spike at the pump  According to data provided by Platts               the price of ethanol in the New York Harbor Market on Friday was               2 85 per gallon  about  0 53 higher than the gasoline it must              be blended with before being sold                   Schumer and Greggs legislation would suspend              the 54 cent tariff until the end of the year and              would create the necessary circumstances to temporarily allow more              foreign ethanol into the country  thereby increasing supplies and              lowering ethanol prices  As the price of ethanol would move              closer to the price of the gasoline it must be blended with  retail              prices at the gasoline pump could be lowered an estimated three              to eight cents
