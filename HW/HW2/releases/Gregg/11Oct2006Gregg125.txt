Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg Comments On Year End U S  Treasury Statement for Fiscal Year 2006   Todays year end announcement from the U S  Treasury that the fiscal year 2006 federal deficit  at  248 billion  is  71 billion lower than last years deficit  shows that this economy continues to thrive  We have met the Presidents goal of cutting the deficit in half   three years earlier than planned    Republican pro growth tax policies enacted by President Bush and the Republican Congress have spurred the economy to grow at an annual average rate of 3 7 percent since 2003  with 18 consecutive quarters of economic expansion  During the same time  5 8 million new jobs have been created  and unemployment has dropped to a low 4 6 percent  Business investment continues to grow at a rapid pace    These positive indicators have boosted tax revenues  which is driving the deficit lower  We should not turn back the clock on this economy  as liberals advocate  We should instead extend the very tax policies that are responsible for keeping the economy strong
