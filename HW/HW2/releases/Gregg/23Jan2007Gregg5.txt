Senator Gregg Comments On State Of The Union Speech Contact  Erin Rath  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  tonight made the following statement regarding President Bushs State of the Union speech to Congress      The President has outlined an aggressive domestic agenda that requires serious consideration  but it also raises issue with the proper role of the federal government in addressing some of these national concerns such as healthcare  energy and the environment  With only two years left in the term of this presidency  the likelihood that all the initiatives that have been outlined tonight could be effectively pursued in that time frame is slim  It is incumbent upon us to choose areas where positive results can be accomplished and aggressively pursue resolutions to those issues  This is most likely to occur in the areas of energy independence and fiscal responsibility  We must also work to make much needed progress in making healthcare more affordable and available and in addressing the need of passing on to our children a cleaner and more sustainable environment   As to the President s initiatives in Iraq and the war on terrorism  it is my intention to continue to give our troops in the field the support they need to do their jobs and to maintain their safety and to support efforts which will allow us to find the terrorists  especially those who subscribe to Islamic fundamentalism  before they attack America or American citizens
