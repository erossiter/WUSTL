                                                              GREGG SIGNALS CONCERN OVER              VETERANS                PERSONAL INFORMATION LEAK                               WASHINGTON               U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   expressed his strong concern over              the recent news that the Department of Veterans affairs has lost               through theft  personal data including names  Social Security numbers               and dates of birth for 26 5 million veterans and some spouses  Senator              Gregg has written to U S  Secretary of Veterans Affairs R  James              Nicholson to request immediate attention to this matter  The              letter states  This is certainly very upsetting to veterans              who could now possibly suffer devastating financial ruin as victims              of identity theft schemes  In order to alleviate the anxiety              and deep concerns expressed by many New Hampshire veterans  I would              appreciate knowing what steps the VA is taking to protect the affected              veterans and to tighten VA data security safeguards  including              perhaps data encryption  to ensure that this can never happen again
