Senator Gregg Comments on Baker Hamilton Commission Report Contact  Erin Rath    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   today made the following comments regarding the findings of the Baker Hamilton Bipartisan Iraq Study Group  The results of the study were presented to President George W  Bush and Congress this morning  Senator Gregg stated  The Baker Commission report today is an important step forward in our efforts to try to resolve the morass that has become Iraq  There is no question but that we need to figure out a way to extricate ourselves from Iraq in a reasonable way that doesnt undermine our commitment to trying to make that country independent  free and oriented towards the market economy  But if were going to accomplish that  were going to have to proceed in such a way as is outlined in the Baker Commission  which will lead to the country of Iraq and the people of Iraq assuming much more responsibility for their own security and for their government  This should be done sooner rather than later  and certainly with the Baker Commission as a blueprint for how we can proceed  This is a positive step and one which we should take seriously and follow
