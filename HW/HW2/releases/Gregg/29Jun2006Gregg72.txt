Gregg and John Sununu  R NH  today announced              that conservation efforts in Cheshire County have received a significant              boost from a bill moving through Congress  The Senate Appropriations              Committee today approved the Fiscal Year 2007 Interior Appropriations              measure  which includes  3 million in Forest Legacy funding for              the acquisition and protection of significant wildlife habitat              at Robb Reservoir in Cheshire County  The bill is now ready for              consideration by the full Senate   As the second phase of the Willard Pond Conservation project               this award will assist in the protection of a 1 667 acre tract              of land at Robb Reservoir  This parcel of land will link with the              1 466 acre Willard Pond  the New Hampshire Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary               the 1 000 acre French family conservation easement area  and the              Price family conservation easement area to create a block of over              5 000 acres of permanently protected forestland  The Robb Reservoir              Project Area has been identified as a critical target for protection              due to its ecological value and central location in the Quabbin to Cardigan              Conservation Initiative  an inter organizational collaborative              organized to establish a contiguous conservation corridor through              New Hampshire and Massachusetts   The funding in the Fiscal Year 2007 Senate Interior Appropriations              Bill represents a continuation of Gregg and Sununus dedication              to environmental conservation and protection work  Last year they              secured  542 000 for the Willard Pond project as part of the Fiscal              Year 2006 Interior Appropriations Bill   Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee              on the Interior  stated  As the number of Granite State              residents increases  we must ensure the protection of valuable              wildlife habitats and sensitive environmental areas  This award              for the Robb Reservoir will allow local and state officials and              environmental organizations to make certain that these beautiful              and vulnerable tracts of land are protected for generations of              New Hampshire residents and visitors alike  These funds are a direct              result of the work and dedication of the local leaders who have              identified land in need of protection and stepped up to guarantee              its protection   Senator Sununu stated  Permanently preserving land across              New Hampshire is important to maintaining the strength of our states              economy and environmental character  Working with state and local              conservation advocates  I have strongly supported the Forest Legacy              program during my time in Congress  Acquiring an easement on land              in the Robb Reservoir Project Area  which will be linked to existing              protected tracts  provides a rare opportunity to conserve 5 000              acres of contiguous forestland in southern New Hampshire  I am              pleased to have been able to help secure funding for this project              in the past  and look forward to working with my colleagues to              ensure that these additional funds move this project closer to              completion    Conserving Robb Reservoir area and the surrounding wetlands              and forests as part of the Willard Pond Forest Legacy project has              been a priority for the Harris Center for Conservation Education              for over 15 years  said Meade Cadot  Executive Director  Senators              Gregg and Sununu s overwhelming support of this conservation project              will not only protect important wildlife habitat  but will conserve              a variety of local traditional uses  including timber harvesting             hiking  fishing  hunting and wildlife viewing   The Trust for Public Land applauds Senators Gregg and Sununu for including               3 million of federal funding for the Willard Pond Robb Reservoir project  said              Dennis Shaffer  Northern New England Field Office Director  This is a              critical step to the conservation of the 1 667 acre Robb Reservoir property              in Stoddard  We greatly appreciate their outstanding leadership and commitment              to conserving New Hampshires natural resources  recreational opportunities              and the Forest Legacy Program   New Hampshire Audubon Interim President Bruce Schwaegler is pleased              with the appropriations  New Hampshire Audubon has worked              with partners for decades to secure long term land and wildlife              habitat protection in the Monadnock area  particularly around Willard              Pond  This funding will help create a lasting conservation legacy              of more than 5 000 acres of protected forestland
