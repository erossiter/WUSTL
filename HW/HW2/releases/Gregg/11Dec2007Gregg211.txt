Senator Gregg Sponsors Amendment To Farm Bill To Provide Nearly  1 Billion For LIHEAP Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today introduced an amendment to the 2007 Farm Bill which would eliminate the new  mandatory  5 1 billion five year agriculture disaster trust fund  and instead provide nearly  1 billion in Fiscal Year 2008 to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   The remainder of the savings achieved by eliminating the trust fund  which totals more than  4 billion  would be directed to reduce the national deficit  Senators John Sununu  R NH   Olympia Snowe  R ME   and Susan Collins  R ME  also cosponsored the amendment  Senator Gregg stated  With home heating costs at a record high  LIHEAP is an important program which provides federal heating assistance to those in need  It is critical that we act now  so that low income families and seniors can afford to heat their homes this winter  This amendment takes a more fiscally responsible approach to funding this important program by eliminating what basically amounts to a slush fund  money that is guaranteed to be spent every year on agriculture whether there is a real emergency or not  By passing this amendment we can ensure that those in need stay warm this winter  but also pay for such assistance in a way that is more taxpayer friendly than giving another wasteful handout to the agriculture industry  Senator Sununu stated  This fuel assistance is essential to thousands of families across New Hampshire  It helps to ensure that they have the resources to stay warm in their homes during the winter months  Theres absolutely no reason why Congress cant find the money to help those most in need across the nation  I have strongly supported LIHEAP since I came to Congress in 1997 and continue that commitment today through my support of Senator Greggs amendment  The LIHEAP program is in a desperate funding situation and I remain committed to raising this issue in every possible capacity  said Senator Snowe  Currently  our heating situation is in a crisis and the federal governments priorities need to be reflective of this emergency  Heating is not a luxury  it is a basic necessity and we must recalibrate our funding allocations to mitigate the increase in energy costs  Senator Collins stated  We need to direct funds to low income families and the elderly who need immediate help heating their homes  So many Maine families are currently struggling with the high cost of energy and are worried about being able to afford to stay warm this winter  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide additional funding for the LIHEAP program in order to help our neediest families overcome this energy emergency
