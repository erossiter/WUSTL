Senator Gregg Criticizes Democratic Leadership For Dropping A Senate Approved Amendment To Provide Critical Border Security Dollars Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today joined Senators Lindsey Graham  R SC   John Kyl  R AZ   Johnny Isakson  R GA   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Jim DeMint  R SC   Mel Martinez  R FL   Jeff Sessions  R AL  and Saxby Chambliss  R GA  in criticizing the actions of the Democratic Congressional Leadership in their failure to fund an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Appropriations bill which would provide  3 billion in emergency funding to help achieve and maintain operational control over the entire U S  Mexico border  In October  this amendment  written by Senator Gregg  was approved by a vote of 95 1 before the full Senate  Unfortunately  yesterday  in the joint House Senate committee of conference  the Democratic Leaders did not include funding in the FY08 DoD conference report  Senator Gregg  a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security  stated  The American people clearly want immediate action on border control  and I am disappointed that the Democratic Congressional Leadership decided to exclude  3 billion in border security funding from the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense appropriations conference report  This was a chance to get critical resources to the President as soon as possible  and unfortunately this chance has been squandered  Border security funding is as much a part of national security as funding for the war on terrorism  and our amendment  if enacted  would have put the funds in the pipeline to help achieve control over our borders  fix our broken immigration system  and assure the American people that its government takes border security seriously  Theres no reason why the Democratic Congressional Leadership should hold up this funding  The amendment  the Border Security First Act of 2007  would provide funding for the hiring and training of additional border agents  deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  installation of additional ground based sensors  cameras  and vehicle barriers  and building the 700 miles of border fencing required under the Secure Fence Act of 2006  It also would boost enforcement of immigration laws at the worksite by providing substantial funds for improved employment eligibility verification  as well as increased detention and removal of those who are here illegally
