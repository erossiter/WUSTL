Senator Gregg Lauds Passage Of Bipartisan Head Start Reauthorization Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  lauded passage of the Head Start reauthorization  the Improving Head Start Act of 2007  which was approved unanimously this afternoon by the Senate  The legislation reauthorizes the national Head Start program  which makes grants available to public and private non profit and for profit agencies so they can provide disadvantaged children and families with child development and educational services  The transcript of Senator Greggs floor speech is attached below  The Improving Head Start Act places a strong emphasis on ensuring that preschoolers develop the foundational reading and math skills necessary for future academic success  Specifically  the bill includes important provisions to strengthen and improve the quality and accountability of the program  increase academic requirements and performance expectations  and strengthen teacher training and qualifications  Much of the language included in this legislation was modeled after the Head Start Improvements for School Readiness Act which Senator Gregg authored during the 108th Congress as Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  Senator Gregg  a member of the HELP Committee  stated  Head start is one of those federal programs that actually works  This is a project Ive been working on now for four years  its been fairly complicated  unfortunately  but the final product is very good  It not only takes the Head Start program which gives low income kids the chance to go to a safe place during the day where they will get good food and learn socialization skills  it takes that program and expands it so that these young children start to learn how to deal with school curriculum  how to read  and how to do math  This is very important because many of these kids come from a background that doesnt necessarily give them these tools  and when they get to first grade or kindergarten  they arent able to compete with their peers  So this expanded program will be a major step forward in making sure that everybody can participate in getting a good education and getting an early start to that good education  Im very happy to be able to support the final passage of the Head Start reauthorization program  Other provisions in the legislation include creating a program review process  clarifying and strengthening the role of the Head Start governing board  increasing parent and community participation  requiring that grants be renewed every five years  and placing a commonsense salary cap on senior level staff  The bill also requires all Head Start teachers to have a minimum of 15 hours of in service training each year  strengthens teacher degree certification requirements  requires teachers to receive on going training to best meet the needs of early English language learners  and encourages Teach For America participants to pursue Head Start as an employer  AUDIO  available at http   gregg senate gov or by calling 1 800 545 1267 and accessing mailbox 332  Unofficial transcript of Senator Greggs floor speech follows  Mr  Gregg  I thank the Senator from Wyoming  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts  And I want to rise to express my appreciation for their excellent work on this piece of legislation  It s been a long time in gestation  and I think it reflects their commitment to legislating in a bipartisan and effective way that the bill is now at this stage  And I really do congratulate them   I think anybody who s been exposed to Head Start has been impressed by the programs  There have been studies  and there have been reports of things that can be done to improve the program  and hopefully this bill will work in that direction  But the underlying idea of giving low income kids the ability to come into an atmosphere where they get nurturing  where they get good nutrition  and now  because of this bill  where they get the starting blocks for learning how to deal with an academic program is totally appropriate and something that has succeeded   If you look at what we re facing as a nation    and it s been discussed here at considerable length  and I heard the Senator from Tennessee and I thought he made an excellent statement on the needs of education  What our country really needs is the ability to bring into the educational mainstream children who today  unfortunately  aren t able or do not come to school with the skills necessary to compete with some of their fellow students   Head Start gives those children that opportunity  It gives low income kids the ability to start kindergarten  get into first grade with an understanding  first  of how to be social and deal with an atmosphere where there are other children  secondly  to have the nutrition necessary to get through the day and be able to learn and  third  begin the building blocks of learning  So this is a program that does work and it has worked and it s something that should be continued to be supported by the federal government but also by the local communities who stand behind Head Start  That s one of the great things about Head Start  quite honestly   In my experience  you go to a local Head Start center in New Hampshire  or anywhere  for that matter    I had a chance when I was Chairman of this Committee to visit Head Start centers all across this country    and you see that they re usually community oriented events  Usually behind those teachers and those committed people who are willing to spend the day with those children and try to make those children s lives better during the day  there re usually a lot of volunteers and there are a lot of people from the community who are stepping up to also make those programs work well    So Head Start is one of those success stories  and it s one of those things we need as one of the building blocks in order to continue to make America a great place to live and give people the opportunity to participate in the American dream  So once again  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for leading this effort  and I thank the Senator from Wyoming for orchestrating this effort also  And I yield back the balance of my time
