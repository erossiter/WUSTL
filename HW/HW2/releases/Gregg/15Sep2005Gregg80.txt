                               GREGG COMMENTS ON HIS PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN                 AUTHORITY                   TO OVERSEE FEDERAL RECOVERY EFFORT FROM HURRICANE                                  WASHINGTON                 U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today commented on his recent              proposal to create an oversight authority to oversee the use of              federal funds related to Hurricane Katrina recovery and rehabilitation               More details on Senator Gregg s proposal can be found on his website              at gregg senate gov   Senator Gregg stated   One thing that s pretty clear is that              we re going to spend a tremendous amount of money to try to help              the people out in the Gulf states and to initiate the reconstruction              effort  A lot of it is going to come through the federal government               Also something that s very clear is that we are now proceeding              in a rather haphazard way  I ve therefore suggested that we put              a person on the ground down there who has the authority and the              ability to manage all the federal dollars and all the different              federal agencies that will be involved  We know there is probably              going to be twenty or thirty different federal agencies that are              going to have an impact here  and literally tens of billions of              dollars are going to be spent  We need some leadership in making              sure that this is a coordinated effort  that the money isn t wasted               and that the money gets to the people who need it  and that the              reconstruction effort is done in an efficient and cost effective              way  Therefore  we need to have a centralized management point               but more importantly we need to have an individual who has the              energy and the leadership and the national reputation to accomplish              this  And that s why I ve suggested that we set up such an agent    Senator Gregg s audio comments will be available by calling 1 800 545 1267              and accessing mailbox 332 or on the Internet at http   src senate gov
