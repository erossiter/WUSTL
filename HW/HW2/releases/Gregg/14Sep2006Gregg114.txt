Senator Gregg Introduces Bill to Improve Health Care Quality and Reduce Costs WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today introduced the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act  a measure designed to improve the quality of health care for patients while lowering costs  The bill authorizes the release of Medicare data to qualified organizations  known as Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations  MQRO   so they can develop reports on the cost and quality of health care while including necessary safeguards to protect patient privacy  Any reports or results derived from this data must be released to the public within one year   The United States spends more on health care as a percentage of the economy than any other industrialized country  and costs continue to rise  said Senator Gregg  Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and former Chairman and current member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  However  there is significant variation in the quality of health care consumers receive   Attempts are already being made by employers and insurance companies to measure the quality of health care they are receiving  said Chairman Gregg  However  with limited amounts of privately held data  their analysis is not broad enough to provide the most accurate results  This bill will provide these groups with an enormous database to refine and improve their studies  and yield ways to improve the quality of the health care they offer at a lower price without compromising the safety of Medicare beneficiaries  This well crafted and balanced legislative proposal would bring enormous benefit to patients and their doctors  said Dr  Arnold Milstein  MD  co founder of the Leapfrog Group  a program aimed at mobilizing employer purchasing power for health care  In today s performance blind environment  both have struggled with only rare success to attain consistently excellent and affordable care  When enacted  it would enable both to understand their current starting point and accelerate their shared pursuit of breakthrough in clinical excellence and affordability   Privacy of Medicare information is ensured by requiring that all Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations protect individual beneficiary privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Privacy Act  The bill also requires a privacy review by the Department of Health and Human Services of any analytical report prepared by an MQRO prior to its release  In recent years  consumer groups  employers  insurance companies  and others have repeatedly requested access to Medicare claims data in order to improve the quality and reduce the cost of the health care they provide  The bill is endorsed by  The American Nurses Association The American Hospital Association  Consumers Checkbook Center for the Study of Services Corporate Health Care Coalition HR Policy Association American Benefits Council Business Roundtable ERISA

below   Medicare Quality Enhancement Act Summary The United States spends more on health care as a percentage of the economy than any other industrialized country and costs continue to rise However  there is significant variation in the quality of health care consumers receive The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act seeks to improve U S  health care by providing qualified private sector organizations access to Medicare data for the development and release of reports on the quality  cost  efficiency  and effectiveness of our health care system  Background  Consumer groups  employers  insurance companies and others have repeatedly requested access to Medicare claims data to improve the quality of the health care provided to their members  employees and beneficiaries and to help control the ever rising costs of health care  While there remains legal debate over whether this data can be released  the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the data collected by Medicare and paid for by the taxpayer can be utilized by qualified organizations to measure quality and control costs while protecting beneficiary privacy  How the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act will help  The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act  Requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to provide Medicare enrollment  claims  survey and assessment data to private sector Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations  MQROs  to develop reports to measure health care quality for the public  Mandates the protection of beneficiary privacy  Empowers consumer groups  providers  employers  insurance plans  labor unions and others to request reports from MQROs  and Provides for the public release of all reports  Attempts are already being made by employers and insurance companies to measure quality However  with limited amounts of privately held data  their analysis is not broad enough to provide the most accurate results However  MQROs will have access to Medicare data and be authorized to aggregate both private and public data  providing a significantly more robust assessment of both quality and efficiency while requiring the complete protection of beneficiary health information  The bill also promotes existing efforts to develop model quality standards and methodologies for establishing and applying such standards Through the formation of a Quality Advisory Board within the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  the bill encourages the Administration to continue its extraordinary work with providers  consumers  insurers and others in the health care community toward sound quality measurement for all patients  Why the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act is necessary  In order for Americas health care system to improve  we need to understand the quality of the care we are purchasing The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act begins to provide health care consumers with the information they need to make educated decisions about health care  information they already have to make decisions on other products they purchase in the marketplace The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act requires that information paid for by the taxpayer and held by Medicare is fully available to improve our health care system The public will then finally have the tools necessary to make informed health care decisions for themselves and their families
