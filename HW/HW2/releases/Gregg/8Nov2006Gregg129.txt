Senator Gregg Comments on Election Results  I want to congratulate my colleagues across the aisle  Theyve obviously won a tremendous victory  A significant win  probably of historical proportions  has occurred here and that is a reflection of the American peoples view  and especially in New Hampshire  people in New Hampshires view  that change was needed  It does  however  mean that they are now responsible for governance  especially here in New Hampshire where we have some very big issues facing us which I believe require fiscal prudence and responsible government  For my part I intend to work with my colleagues across the aisle  as I have always tried to  and continue to focus on the issues that I consider to be important  such as controlling the federal budget  controlling spending  and making sure we find the terrorists before they find us  This is going to be an interesting undertaking and Im looking forward to it  Itll be a challenge  but again I congratulate my Democratic colleagues
