Senator Gregg Lauds Passage Of Energy Bill Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today further praised successful passage of HR 6  the Renewable Fuels  Consumer Protection  and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007  The Energy bill passed the Senate Thursday  December 13  2007  by vote of 86 8  and the bill now heads back to the House of Representatives  The Senate last night passed an Energy bill  which is going to be a major step forward in our efforts to try to get control over the cost of energy in this country  For the first time in almost 30 years  well be raising what is known as the CAFE standards  which is the mileage standards for cars in this country  and as a result  well be able to put pressure on the automobile industry to produce cars which are more energy efficient  It is absolutely critical in my opinion that we control and try to limit our use of foreign source oil  Its very clear that when we are buying foreign oil  we are basically paying people who dont like us  and thats certainly inappropriate and not good for our national security  And more importantly  were spending money overseas that we could put to good work here in the United States   So I want to do whatever we can to limit the purchase of foreign oil and allow us to produce our domestic products and also conserve more of our products here in the United States  In the area of increasing the fuel mileage of automobiles  known as CAFE standards  this is a major step in that direction  Plus  I think this is a very good bill  Its a big step forward  Its a major initiative relative to energy  conservation  and its something that I strongly support   AUDIO  available by calling 1 800 545 1267 and accessing mailbox 332
