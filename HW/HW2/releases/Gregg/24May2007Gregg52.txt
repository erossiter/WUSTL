Senator Gregg Comments On Passage Of Supplemental Democrats Use Pork Projects To Garner Support For Troop Funding  Contact Erin Rath Betsy Holahan  WASHINGTON U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Ranking Member on the Senate Budget Committee  tonight made the following comments regarding the supplemental spending bill  Senator Gregg voted for the supplemental to get the resources and assistance needed to the men and women of our armed services fighting the war on terror   Senator Gregg stated  This supplemental bill is urgently needed to fund U S  troops in harms way  I fully support making sure our service men and women have the equipment they need to do their jobs and come home safely   However  it is certainly ironic that following Democratic calls for fiscal responsibility and tougher budget enforcement  the majority party has used this important measure as a vehicle for pork projects unrelated to the troops or the war  in order to guarantee the support of Congressional Democrats who would otherwise vote against supporting our men and women in uniform
