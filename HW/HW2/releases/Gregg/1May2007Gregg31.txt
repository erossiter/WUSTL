Senator Gregg Lauds Inclusion of his Drug Safety Surveillance Provision in Managers   Amendment to FDA Reform Measure  Contact Erin Rath Jeff Turcotte  WASHINGTON  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   a member of the Senate Health  Labor  Education  and Pensions Committee  today applauded the inclusion of legislative language based on S  1024  the Safer DATA Act he introduced earlier this year  The language is included in the Food and Drug Administration Reform Act currently being debated on the Senate floor  This language puts drug safety data surveillance at the center of the FDAs efforts to monitor and improve the safety of our nations drug supply  The HELP Committee passed the FDA reform bill on April 18  Senator Gregg stated  I am pleased this very important drug safety surveillance language has been included in the managers amendment to the legislation we are now debating in the full Senate  My Safer DATA initiative relies on sound science and thorough and timely surveillance to be the centerpieces of the FDAs overall drug safety strategy  It gives the FDA the tools it needs to identify safety problems quickly and respond in an efficient and wide ranging manner  This surveillance system will act as a clearinghouse for feedback on the effectiveness for prescription medications of all kinds for the thousands and thousands of Americans that rely on them  The managers amendment also includes language Senator Gregg offered during the HELP Committee mark up to exempt bioterror countermeasures from the provisions in the bill that limit a physicians ability to prescribe medicine to their patients in the event of a public health emergency   As this bill is written  it would create harmful roadblocks from health care professionals being able to treat their patients during a bioterror attack  Physicians need the ability to use their training and react quickly in the case of an emergency  and the bioterror response provision I authored that has now been included in the managers amendment gives medical professionals the freedom to respond effectively during a time of crisis  stated Senator Gregg      Despite the inclusion of the language from my Safer DATA bill and other improvements  I still have concerns about several provisions in this bill  I hope as the week progresses  members will have the ability to debate and offer substantive amendments to this wide ranging bill that will directly impact the safety of millions of people through the way prescription drugs and biologics are created  tested  and brought to market
