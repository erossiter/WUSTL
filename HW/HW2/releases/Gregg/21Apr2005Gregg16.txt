                          SENATOR GREGG CHAIRS BUDGET HEARING ON FUTURE OF              NATIONAL FISCAL OBLIGATIONS WITH FED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN                WASHINGTON    U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Chairman of the              Senate Budget Committee  today discussed the state of our nation s              financial obligations to future generations with Chairman of the              Federal Reserve Bank Alan Greenspan  Chairman Greenspan told the              Committee that lawmakers will be forced to make difficult decisions              on budget priorities as costs associated with the retirement of              the baby boom generation and soaring health care expenditures begin              to squeeze out other priority programs  Greenspan stated   I fear              we may have already committed more fiscal resources to the baby boom              generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity              to deliver  The fundamental fiscal issue is the need to make difficult              choices among budget priorities  and this need is becoming ever              more pressing in light of the unprecedented number of individuals            approaching retirement age   Greenspan warned that current tax and spending trends forecast              an  unsustainable path  for the federal budget  resulting in large              deficits which lead to rising interest rates and increasing interest              payments that augment future deficits  Greenspan continued   In fiscal year 2004  federal outlays for              Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid totaled about 8 percent              of GDP  The long run projections from the Office of Management              and Budget suggest that the share will rise to approximately 13              percent by 2030  So long as health care costs continue to grow              faster than the economy as a whole  the additional resources needed              for these programs will exert intense pressure on the federal budget   Senator Gregg stated   The problem is that we have  44 trillion              of unfunded liabilities on the books already  To put that in context               the total amount of taxes paid to the federal government since              the Revolution equals  38 trillion  So the question becomes  how              do we address this as a government   I believe the first step is to pass a budget that puts some controls              on entitlement spending  This year we made the effort to address              one of these accounts so at least one of these elements driving              out year fiscal costs will begin to be addressed   The Senate passed budget resolution includes a reconciliation              instruction for committees to produce  17 billion in savings over              five years after an amendment on the Senate floor stripped  15              billion in savings from the Finance Committee instruction  The              Senate and House budget conferees are working to reach a compromise
