Senator Gregg Blasts Democratic Leadership For Stalling Appropriations Process Which Includes Important NH Initiatives Contact  Andrea Wuebker Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  today criticized the actions of the Democratic Congressional Leadership for stalling the appropriations process by refusing to send a freestanding veterans funding bill to the President for his signature       By September  both Houses of Congress had passed their respective Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction Veterans Affairs  MilCon VA  spending bills  enabling MilCon VA to advance through the appropriations process as a freestanding bill and be signed into law without further delay  The bill includes crucial funding for construction of military and National Guard facilities and veterans health care  However  last week  the MilCon appropriations bill was attached to the Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  Labor HHS  Appropriations Conference Report  The House is expected to vote as early as today on the package that contains both spending measures  the Senate will likely debate the measure later this week  If passed by both chambers  the legislation will then be sent to the President  who has vowed to veto the measure due to the excessive spending in the Labor HHS Education bill  Within the conference report  Senator Gregg secured funding for a number of important New Hampshire initiatives  Funding for all projects was included within the original Committee allocations for Fiscal Year 2008 spending measures  The MilCon VA section contains       8 9 million for Pease Air National Guard Wing Facility   The Labor HHS section contains    Support for continued efforts to bring a Job Corps Center to New Hampshire      200 000 for electronic medical record system at Elliott Health System      400 000 for physical upgrades and equipment for NH Community Health Centers      589 000 for patient focused technology initiative at St  Joseph Hospital      370 000 for an electronic medical records system at the new Center for Disease Management at Wentworth Douglass Hospital      140 000 for North Country Gear Up to prepare high school students to pursue post secondary education opportunities     150 000 to expand City Year NHs Young Heroes program     350 000 for Tech Based Education at Franklin Pierce University     200 000 for the Institute for Sustainable Rural Economics at Plymouth State University     404 100 for New Hampshire Community Technical Colleges for technology programs and initiatives     200 000 for Civic Education Programming at Saint Anselm College   Senator Gregg stated  The Democratic Majority has attempted to use the Military Construction and Veterans spending bill as a shield in order to heighten spending in non military accounts by as much as  11 billion over budget in this legislation  As a result of these policy maneuvers by the Democrats  the President will be forced to veto this bill if it is approved by the House and Senate  As Congress plays an expensive game of political chicken with the President  our veterans and military personal who need our support are left waiting for the critical resources to which they are entitled  The Democratic Majority must cease this high stakes political chess game that puts our real prioritiesour servicemen and women and our nations veteransat risk  Congress must quickly pass the Military Construction and VA spending bill as a freestanding measure so the President can sign it into law by Veterans Day     Congress has not sent any of the 12 annual spending bills to the President for signature to date  marking a breakdown in the appropriations process that has not occurred since 1987
