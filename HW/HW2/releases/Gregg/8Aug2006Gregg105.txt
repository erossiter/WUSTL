Completion                              Newfields                 New Hampshire  U S  Senator Judd Gregg                 R NH  joined Chair of Newfields Board of Selectman Janet McBride                Smith  the Rockingham Land Trust  The Trust for Public Land  TPL                 and other local and state officials and residents in Newfields                today  to celebrate the recent completion of the Piscassic Greenway  A              new sign was unveiled to mark the completion of a 2 year effort              that protects a crucial link between two blocks of existing protected              lands  creating a wildlife and recreational corridor of more than              2 600 acres from Newmarket to Exeter   Through the leadership of              Senator Judd Gregg  the Piscassic Greenway received nearly  4 0              million in grants from NOAAs Coastal              and Estuarine Land Conservation Program  CELCP    U S               Senator Judd Gregg stated  I want to thank the Rockingham              Land Trust  TPL and especially the people of Newfields for the              extraordinary steps they took to protect our states environment  The              completion of the Piscassic Greenway initiative is a great example              of the effectiveness of the partnership of conservation groups               public agencies and local residents in NH  Conserving the              critical wildlife habitats  water resources and greenway corridor              that characterize this unique place not only protects the physical              landscape but strengthens the quality of life here  I have              been proud to support these efforts and am happy to recognize all              those who made this celebration possible  In 2004  the current              owner  Halls Mill Realty Trust  proposed to develop the site with              89 house lots and 2 miles of new roads  But              through the 2000 Regional Environmental Protection Plan  REPP               and the 2001 Open Space Plan  Newfields residents consistently              identified this area as a priority for the conservation of wildlife              habitat  water quality  trail connections  and greenway corridors  According              to Newfields Selectman Janet McBride Smith  the response from the              town to see the greenway protected rather than developed was overwhelming               it was like an Aha    moment  On              behalf of the Town of Newfields  we want to thank Senator Judd              Gregg  The federal money for coastal conservation he secured gave              us the confidence that we could achieve this vision and make it              possible  Without his support  conserving the greenway wouldnt              have been possible  At the request of the Rockingham Land              Trust  TPL began negotiating the purchase of the land in October              2004 and secured an agreement to acquire the land for the price              of  7 55 million  a significant discount from its appraised fair              market value  TPL negotiated              an agreement to purchase the property and worked with the Rockingham              Land Trust  the Town of Newfields and local advocates to seek funding                Whitney Hatch  Regional Director and Vice President of TPL  credited              Gregg for his vision in preserving New Hampshires coastal              character  Senator Gregg is a leader who can look              to the future and see that if we dont act now  beautiful              and essential river corridors such as this one will be lost to              urban sprawl  We greatly appreciate Senator Gregg s hard work and              leadership in securing funding through CELCP  On behalf of              all the partners involved in this effort  we thank him for his              commitment to land conservation  and his effectiveness in Washington              which brings federal conservation funding to New Hampshire  Hatch              also credited the voters of Newfields and the fantastic leadership              of the Rockingham Land Trust  RLT   Newfields              voters responded overwhelmingly to the opportunity to conserve              the Greenway  approving a  1 5 million bond in March of 2005 with              87  support  With the addition of  500 000 in funding from a previous              bond  the Towns contribution totaled  2 million  The Rockingham              Land Trust led a private campaign drive that raised over  1 6 million              in private contributions toward the conservation of the Piscassic              Greenway  TPL recognizes the local forces that made              a significant investment in the future of this community  Generous              contributions from supporters of the project  the strong leadership              from RLT  and the commitment from everyone who dedicated their              time and talent to making this project a success are a shining              example of how communities can take action before its too              late  said Hatch  Tom Chamberlin  President of the              Board of the Rockingham Land Trust  also thanked the more than              675 individuals  businesses and foundations who contributed private              dollars toward the protection of the Piscassic Greenway  We              are inspired by the generosity and support of the residents of              greater Rockingham County  as well as those from other places who              love this area  and who clearly value the conservation of community              lands such as the Piscassic Greenway  said Chamberlin  Creation              of the Piscassic Greenway helps preserve 106 acres of wetlands               two vernal pools and 1 200 feet of shoreline on the Piscassic River               a tributary to the wild and scenic Lamprey River and Great Bay  The              land  a mix of upland forests and wetlands  includes diverse habitats              for common and rare wildlife  including moose  bear  whip poor will               and mallard  The protection of the land ensures continued public              access for outdoor recreation  including hiking  skiing  fishing               hunting  and trapping  In addition to preserving recreational opportunities               a conservation easement held by the Town of Newfields includes              provisions designed to protect water quality  wildlife habitat              and ecologically sensitive areas  Over the next year  the Rockingham              Land Trust will work with a management advisory committee to prepare              a formal land management and stewardship plan  This plan              will guide the recreational uses and wildlife habitat management              activities on the property   We look forward to working with              area residents and the Town on the management of this land
