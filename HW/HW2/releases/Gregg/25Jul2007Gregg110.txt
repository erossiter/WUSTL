Homeland Security Appropriations Act   Unofficial Transcript Mr  Gregg  Mr  President  let me begin  before congratulating the Senator from South Carolina for bringing forward this extremely important amendment  let me begin by congratulating the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Mississippi  Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee  who also are Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security  for bringing forward a bill which makes major strides towards addressing our needs as a nation to protect ourselves and to make sure our borders are secure   This had been has been a very integral issue for these leaders for many years  Senator Cochran chaired this Committee four years ago before the Democratic majority took over and Senator Byrd has been ranking on this Committee for years and has been intimately involved in the effort to try to make sure that we adequately address things like port security  And their leadership here is extraordinary and this bill is a reflection of that  I do not want this amendment to in any way imply that they have not made an extraordinary effort and a very effective effort to move forward with border security because within the context of the dollars that they had available to them  they have done excellent work   What this amendment does  however  and I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for bringing it forward  is acknowledge the fact that what we have here is an emergency  It is as big and as important an emergency relative to national security as the war in Iraq  And I look at them pretty much as the same type of national emergency  The issue of controlling our borders is an issue of national security  making sure that we as a country are safe and that we maintain our viability as a nation  A country that does not control its borders is not safe and will lose its viability as a nation  Nothing is more important to us from a standpoint of protecting our national security than making sure that we get operational control over the borders  as the Senator from South Carolina has so effectively pointed out  and as this amendment moves forward to do   Some have said  well  why would the former Budget Chairman and now Ranking Member on the Budget Committee be willing to offer an emergency resolution which pluses up this bill by  3 billion  Well  the reason is that I have voted for the efforts to make sure that our troops in the field are fully funded in Iraq  And I am voting for this amendment because it will make sure that we have the people    not troops in this instance  although National Guard is obviously there    but the people we need on the border to ensure that our national security is maintained by maintaining security over the border   This amendment will for once and all put in place the necessary funding    this isn t an authorizing event  remember    the necessary funding to be sure that we have the boots on the ground  the technology in place and the detention capability in place in order to manage the border  It takes the present situation  where we re ramping up to 20 000 border agents  and increases that number to 30 000 border agents by the year 2012 and funds it    prefunds it  for all intents and purposes  And in addition  it gives us 45 000 detention beds  which we know we need in order to stop the catch and release process so that when the border agents apprehend someone whom they deem to be in this country inappropriately  they have a place they can put that person  where they can find them when the court system makes a final determination of whether that person is illegally in this country and should be returned   The way the law works now  unfortunately  we do not have enough beds and what happens is the person gets detained  the court system says return in a couple weeks and we ll dispose of whether or not you are legally here or not legally here  and for the most part they don t show up for their court date  This amendment will end that practice of catch and release  which I congratulate the Department for having worked hard to try to do with the resources that they presently have in place   In addition  this amendment will fully fund the commitment which we as a Congress made at least two years ago now  to put in place the necessary hard fence and virtual fence so that we know who is crossing the border or when someone is crossing the border illegally and we can stop  as well as possible  those who attempt to illegally enter this country  We know that we need hard fencing in our urban areas and we know that we need virtual fencing along the less populated areas  And we ve put out a plan  we ve hired a contractor to put up the virtual fencing   This amendment guarantees that the virtual fencing  which involves a lot of electronics  it involves air observation through predators  and it involves the equipment necessary such as helicopters and vehicles to be able to move the people who are on the ground and are going to apprehend these individuals illegally quickly to the site where the crossing occurs  It involves the necessary resources and capital investment to accomplish all of that  which is absolutely critical  So it has the capital resources in it necessary to get the job done of protecting our borders  And the American people  if this amendment passes  will be able to look at dollars that have been put into the pipeline which will accomplish what is the first thing that the American people want relative to immigration reform  which is secure borders   I happened to support the last comprehensive immigration bill  I was one of the few members on our side of the aisle who ended up voting for that bill  I think there were 12 of us  I believe we do need to do something in a comprehensive way  But I also recognize the reality of the situation  which is that the American people will not move forward or will not accept movement in the area of comprehensive immigration reform until they are confident that we have regained control over our borders  And this amendment accomplishes exactly that   In addition  as was noted  there are a number of authorizing events in here  And I recognize that authorizing on appropriations is an anathema to many of us and a concern  But as was pointed out so eloquently by the Senator from South Carolina  we don t have effective immigration reform here and so the vehicle for accomplishing very targeted law enforcement reform    this is law enforcement reform in the area of protecting our borders    is going to have to fall to the Appropriations Committee  And it has not been unusual for the Appropriations Committee to assume the role of taking on an authorizing event when it is narrow and when it is aimed at doing something which delivers a better service    and in this instance  it s protecting our borders   That s not an unusual event for the Appropriations Committee  It s a lift but it s something the Appropriations Committee has done in the past and has done rather well in the past  I ve chaired a couple of Committees where that s been done  And this is the time to do it  This is the time to put in place the authorizing language necessary to do the demonstration programs on U S  Visit  which we absolutely need  to address the issue of how you deal with a criminal alien  somebody who s committed a felony  a rape  a child abuser  That language is in here  Address the issue of how you deal with sanctuary cities and especially give state and local law enforcement individuals the authority to be an adjunct to the law enforcement effort being put forward by the Border Control and Customs in the area of making sure that our borders are secure   You know  when someone comes through the Northern border  for example  we don t have a lot of security on the Northern border in the sense that we have it on the Southern border because the border is mostly forest or terrain that s not open  People can cross that border fairly quickly and fairly easily and always have been able to  We don t have the same problem on the Southern border  We have waves coming across illegally but people can come across illegally and regrettably most of the major terrorist events that have occurred around here have unfortunately involved some sort of Northern border incursion   The first individuals who usually meet those people who are of a law enforcement nature are probably not going to be your Customs and Border Patrol agents at the checkpoints  It s probably going to be somebody south of there  somebody in Epping  New Hampshire  or New Ipswich  New Hampshire  who notices something and says I want to know if you re here illegally and has to have some authority to be able to raise that issue  Has probable cause  of course  before they do that but has to have the authority to step forward when they have probable cause  This bill gives that authority  So this is a good piece of legislation  it s an appropriate piece of legislation for to us take up at this time   I recognize that it puts the bill in further jeopardy because it s an emergency funding and it adds  3 billion to the bill  But this is a national security issue and it needs to be done  I also recognize that the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out that this bill has received a letter from the Administration saying that they may or may not veto it  but implying that they would veto it because it is over the allocation  Like the Senator from West Virginia  that concerns me a great deal because I again must state that I don t see a whole lot of difference between fighting the war in Iraq and fighting the war on the border to protect ourselves from people coming into this country who may do us harm  Those are two issues of national security which merge  in my opinion  in this entire question of how we fight the war on terror   I can separate this bill out from the other Appropriations bills which may be over the Administration s request  maybe in Agriculture  maybe in my own bill of Foreign Operations  maybe in Education Labor or maybe in Transportation  these fund the actual day to day operations of government  But when it comes to fighting the war on terror and protecting our national security  I do believe we have to do everything necessary to accomplish that and that means in this instance  fully funding the necessary people to go on the border and the necessary capital to go on the border  the capital resources necessary to support those people on the border
