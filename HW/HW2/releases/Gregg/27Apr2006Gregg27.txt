                               SENATOR GREGG SUPPORTS REPEALING                OIL SUBSIDY TAX  INCREASING MILEAGE STANDARDS                  WASHINGTON  U S               Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today voiced his strong support for efforts              to address the spiraling costs of gas and oil   A Republican              proposal  the Gas Price Relief and Rebate Act of 2006  was offered              last night as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Emergency Supplemental              Appropriations Bill for the War on Terror and Hurricane Katrina   Senator              Gregg stated  Gas and oil prices nationwide have skyrocketed               draining wallets and forcing individuals and families to make very              hard spending choices  At the same time  oil companies are              yet again reporting record profits  Immediate action should              be taken to relieve this serious situation  starting with repealing              egregious tax breaks for oil companies  During this Congress               I have cosponsored efforts to take away these unnecessary tax breaks              and put dollars back in the pockets of consumers where they belong   In              addition  we should be making the cars we drive more efficient              through new fuel economy standards  As someone who has repeatedly              supported increasing CAFE standards to as high as 40 miles per              gallon  I believe  at a minimum  that the Secretary of Transportation              should have stronger authority to put in place a new rule for higher              mileage requirements  Increasing CAFE standards would be              one of the most effective ways we could reduce gasoline demand               lower prices  and lessen our dependence on foreign oil  Through              targeted tax incentives we must also support new research to develop              energy efficient vehicles and encourage the expansion of domestic              refinery capacity   Taken              together  these actions will make important strides to get gas              prices under control and reduce our dependence on foreign oil               particularly from countries with unstable or antagonistic governments
