SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $92,644 FOR ATWATER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Atwater Fire Department has been awarded a $92,644 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase safety equipment for the department's firefighters, specifically Self Contained Breathing Apparatus.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for helping the Atwater Fire Department improve the safety of its firefighters," said Coleman. "On a daily basis, firefighters across Minnesota put their personal safety on the line to protect their communities, and they deserve the best resources possible. With the help of this grant, firefighters in Atwater will be better protected, and I am pleased they have been selected for this funding." 
   "We're very grateful and appreciative of all the government entities involved in securing this grant," said Gerald Schwarz of the Atwater Fire Department. "With the help of this grant, we'll be able to purchase SCBA equipment centered on our individual department." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
