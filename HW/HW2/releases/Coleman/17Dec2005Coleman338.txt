SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON AGRICULTURE BUDGET RECONCILIATION PACKAGE
  "I was extremely disappointed to learn that a decision on an agriculture budget reconciliation package was reached today by Congressional leadership that singles out some farmers for cuts while upsetting the careful balance between nutrition, conservation, and farm interests achieved in the Senate passed bill.  
 My sugar farmers, in particular, were singled out for cuts under the plan advanced by House leadership despite strong Senate objections. I am particularly disheartened to learn that while President Bush traveled to Minnesota touting the 2002 Farm Bill as a "good bill," Administration officials worked overtime to bring down the Senate package that sought to maintain the integrity of this important bill for Minnesota. Unless things change, I will oppose the reconciliation bill when it comes before the United States Senate."
