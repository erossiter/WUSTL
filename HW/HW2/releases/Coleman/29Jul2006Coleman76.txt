SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS INCLUSION OF RURAL RENAISSANCE PROVISION IN TAX RELIEF BILL PASSED BY HOUSE
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded House passage of the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act, which included Coleman's provision to provide $200 million in Rural Renaissance tax credit bonds to finance economic development in rural communities. The measure will provide rural communities throughout America the ability to fund critical utility infrastructure and affordable housing.  
   Previously Coleman had secured inclusion of the provision in last fall's Tax Reconciliation bill, but it had been removed during the House-Senate conference on that bill. Coleman was encouraged by the measure's inclusion in the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act and looks forward to the legislation's becoming law after Senate consideration, expected next week. 
   "I have traveled across Minnesota and seen firsthand the need to address the aging infrastructure in our rural communities," said Coleman. "With House passage of this bill, the Senate now has the opportunity to empower these communities to upgrade their basic infrastructure in order to attract new investment and jobs. Without question, there is hidden value in rural America. Our job today is to figure out how to protect it and make it flourish, and I intend on working closely with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure this bill lands on the President's desk." 
   Since taking office, Senator Coleman or a member of his staff has made a personal visit to every one of Minnesota's 853 cities listed by the League of Minnesota Cities.
