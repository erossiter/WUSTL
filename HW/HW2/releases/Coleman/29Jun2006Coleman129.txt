SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $116,350 RURAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE GRANT FOR LAKE BRONSON
  Sen. Coleman today announced the City of Lake Bronson has been awarded a $116,350 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Business Enterprise grant. The grant will establish a revolving loan fund to finance small and emerging private business enterprises in the city.  
   "It brings me great pleasure that the City of Lake Bronson has received this USDA grant," said Coleman. "As a proud member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and an unabashed advocate of Minnesota's rural communities, I know the importance of grants like this to help encourage growth in towns like Lake Bronson. During my recent visit to the community, I saw the excitement and enthusiasm residents have towards development in their hometown, and I thank the USDA for giving them an additional resource to help foster that development." 
   "The whole point of the grant is to create new jobs," said Lake Bronson City Clerk Megan Hanson. "The revolving loan program will allow us to loan money to small businesses at a low interest rate, and interest payments will go back into the program to be loaned to more businesses. The grant is good for businesses that aren't able to get funding elsewhere and hopefully will give an incentive to start new businesses." 
   The revolving loan fund established by the grant is expected to create several new jobs in the community. Rural Business Enterprise Grants allow USDA Rural Development to provide funding to public agencies, private non-profit corporations, and Indian groups for financing and facilitating development of small and emerging private business enterprises. 
   Senator Coleman previously joined Lake Bronson residents in May to celebrate nearly $1 million in USDA Rural Development assistance for the repair and replacement of the city's wastewater treatment facilities.
