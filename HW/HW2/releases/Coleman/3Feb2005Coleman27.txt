SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOLCKER'S INTERIM REPORT
  "I'm pleased with the preliminary report presented by Mr. Volcker.  
 It confirms many of the findings of our investigation at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. In the coming days, investigators from PSI and I will closely review this report. 
   This preliminary report shows that the OFF procurement process established by the U.N. was inherently flawed. It also shows that the U.N. internal audit mechanisms were 'under funded,' 'undermanned,' and 'unable to meet' the challenges of the Program. 
   This report exposes the corrupt actions of Benon Sevan, head of the OFF program. The report shows that he repeatedly lied to investigators, has misled the inquiry about the source of $160,000 in cash deposits and unethically steered oil for food contracts to close associates and lied about those relationships to authorities. 
   Based on this evidence, I urge Secretary General Annan to lift Benon Sevan's diplomatic immunity so this case can be reviewed by federal prosecutors. There is more than enough probable cause to believe Benon Sevan's actions constitute criminal activity. 
   There are still, however, many questions that my Subcommittee is continuing to seek answers to, perhaps most importantly, whether the billions of dollars in illicit revenue from OFF abuses are funding the violent insurgency in Iraq. 
   In the interests of transparency, I hope the United Nations will provide my investigators with the same access to key U.N personnel and documentation that Mr. Volcker's investigators have. My own investigation at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will continue."
