SEN. COLEMAN'S STAFF TO ADDRESS FLOODING CONCERNS, LOCAL ISSUES IN NORTHWEST MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that Matt Ketelsen, regional representative for Coleman, will be visiting ten northwestern Minnesota communities beginning today, Wednesday, April 5th through Friday, April 7th, to meet with local mayors and officials to discuss the current flooding in the region and to update the senator on local concerns.  
   "As a former mayor, I know the importance of reaching out to local communities and officials who lead the charge in the managing disasters and organizing the efforts of our state's communities," said Coleman. "I know Northwest Minnesota is facing unique challenges with substantial flooding, and I want to ensure we are working directly with them to offer support wherever we can. It's important to have Matt out in the field so we can get a direct understanding of current conditions and offer our support to these communities." 
   "I'm anxious to meet with the local residents in Northwest Minnesota who are once again facing the challenges of spring flooding," said Ketelsen. "Senator Coleman wants to ensure we are doing what we can to help them, and this is a great chance to work directly with the folks being affected."
