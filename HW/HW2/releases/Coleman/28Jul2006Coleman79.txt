SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $9,500 FOR HOLLOWAY FIRST RESPONDERS UNIT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced first responders in the City of Holloway have been selected for a $9,500 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding is expected to be used to purchase jackets, ECG machines, stethoscopes, oximeters, and a radio to expand the city's first responder unit.  
   "I am excited the folks in Holloway will benefit from this funding," said Coleman. "First responders like those in Holloway are the first line of safety for rural communities. This grant will have a positive impact on the safety of residents in and around Holloway, and I am pleased the USDA Rural Development understands the importance of this grant for the community." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
