SEN. COLEMAN SAYS PASSAGE OF BIPARTISAN ANTI-METH BILL MARKS MILESTONE IN WAR ON DRUGS
  Sen. Norm Coleman praised the Senate passage on Thursday of the Combat Meth Act which he said will further squeeze those who make and deal methamphetamine by limiting access to cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine, the primary ingredient used to make the illegal drug. The bill was included in the USA-Patriot Act Conference report that passed the Senate by a vote of 89-10.  
   "The goal of the Combat Meth Act is to make certain legitimate consumers have access to the medicine they need, while cutting off the meth cooks from the ingredients they need to cook meth," Coleman said. "I know first hand from talking to victims and communities that meth is our number one drug problem, not just in Minnesota but throughout the Midwest. Fighting it requires a comprehensive approach by assisting states, local law enforcement and prosecutors to crack down on the cooks and traffickers of meth, while enhancing community education and awareness and treatment options for those addicted to this dangerous drug." 
   The bill moves cold medicines containing the ingredients needed to cook meth behind the pharmacy counter and limits how much one person can buy in a month to 7.5 grams. The measure also authorizes $43 million in new anti-meth funding for law enforcement, training, and treatment, including $25 million for local law enforcement and federal prosecutors to bring meth manufacturers and dealers to justice, $13 million for meth treatment and research, and $5 million to help children who have been affected by meth. 
   Specifically, The Combat Meth Act of 2005: 
   * Moves cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine behind the counter, sets a limit of how much one person can buy at 7.5 grams a month, and will require signatures and identification for purchases (the Attorney General will develop regulations to ensure uniformity). 
   * Creates alternate procedures for stores without pharmacies and stores in rural areas. The Drug Enforcement Administration and States will be able to develop additional procedures to continue to allow cold medicine to be sold at retail stores without pharmacies and in rural areas (but which meet appropriate security criteria), consistent with the intent of the bill to limit access to pseudoephedrine. 
   * Establishes a uniform federal standard that strengthens all existing state laws. 
   * Creates a national meth treatment center to research effective treatments for meth abuse. 
   * Authorizes $43 million for enforcement, training, and research into treatment. 
   Methamphetamine is perhaps the most deadly, fiercely addictive and fastest spreading drug in the U.S. In the past decade, meth use in some communities has increased by as much as 300 percent. Meth is cheap, potent and available everywhere. In Minnesota, there has been a 65 percent increase in out-of-home placements strictly because of methamphetamine abuse.
