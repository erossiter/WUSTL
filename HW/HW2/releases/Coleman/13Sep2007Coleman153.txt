SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS ON IRAQ
  Statement Of Senator Norm Coleman On Presidential Address On Iraq: 
   I'm encouraged by the progress our military is making under the leadership of General Petraeus. The confirmation this evening that we will see an initial troop reduction of 5,700 troops by year's end and significant troop withdrawals numbering up to 30,000 or more by next summer is the right decision. While this is a positive development in the short-term, Americans need to know there is light at the end of the tunnel well beyond that time frame. That is why I pressed General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker during their Senate testimony this week for a long-term plan that reflects the objectives of our shift in mission and assigns a military timeline for substantial troop reductions from a position of strength and success. Our military strategy must reflect the changing conditions on the ground, but we also have to continue to apply pressure to the Iraqis to accelerate political reconciliation. America's role in Iraq is not unending, nor do they have a blank check.
