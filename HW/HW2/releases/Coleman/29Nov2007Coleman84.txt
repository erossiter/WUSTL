SEN. COLEMAN CELEBRATES COMPLETION OF VISITS TO EVERY MINNESOTA COUNTY IN 2007
  Senator Norm Coleman made the rounds in the communities of Detroit Lakes, Moorhead, Breckenridge, Morris, and Benson on Thursday, completing his visits to all 87 Minnesota counties this year. During his trip to the four western Minnesota communities, Coleman met with local officials and residents to discuss their concerns and his work in Washington. In addition to visiting every Minnesota county in each of the last two years, since taking office in 2003 Coleman and his staff have visited all 853 cities in the state.  
   "These visits are a wonderful opportunity to connect with and listen to the citizens of our great state," said Coleman. "I have always believed that the best ideas in Washington come from the people on the ground back home. Minnesotans' input on every issue from renewable energy to agriculture to health care have greatly influenced my work in the Senate. I take very seriously my role in representing the thoughts and concerns of all Minnesotans, and I want to thank everyone who took the time to turn out for these get-togethers this year." 
   Coleman's visits on Thursday included a presentation of a Purple Heart to World War II veteran Donald Wambach, who was wounded aboard the USS Kimberly during a 1945 naval battle in the Pacific Theater. Mr. Wambach, a resident of Moorhead, was finally awarded his Purple Heart with the assistance of Senator Coleman's staff, and Coleman presented it on Thursday morning during a ceremony at the Moorhead City Council chambers. 
   Coleman ended this year's visits to all 87 Minnesota counties in the seat of Swift County with a meeting at Benson City Hall. Minnesota's senior senator began his 2007 travel around the state on January 3rd by meeting with several southwestern suburban mayors over coffee at Millie's Deli in Chanhassen, a swing that also included stops in Shakopee, Woodbury and Shoreview.
