SENATE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN AMENDMENT TO HELP HMONG AFFECTED BY TERRORIST CLASSIFICATION
  Senator Norm Coleman last night was successful in attaching a compromise amendment to the 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that will resolve the negative unintended consequences the "material support" bar has had on Minnesota's Hmong community. The material support provision, which was enacted as part of the Real ID Act of 2004, broadened the definition of who is a terrorist, and inadvertently made the Hmong and other ethnic groups ineligible for refugee status and other immigration-related adjustments. Coleman's amendment, also sponsored by Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), brokers a solution to ensure the Hmong and other groups are no longer classified as terrorists, thereby removing the penalties that had been in place. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill passed the Senate by a vote of 81-12, and now proceeds to a conference with the House.  
   "Since the Vietnam War, Hmong refugees have dedicated their service to this nation, and to be classified as terrorists is simply unacceptable. They have looked to the U.S. as a place of hope and a sanctuary from persecution, and with passage of this amendment, we can finally move ahead on a solution to this injustice," said Coleman. "I have been fighting to change this law ever since I learned about its unintended consequences, and I will continue working until this matter is resolved." 
   Coleman was a principal author of an amendment last year with a similar intent. Senate Amendment 4117 was offered to last year's immigration bill (S. 2611), but was opposed by the Administration and defeated on the floor. In January 2007, however, the Administration publicly endorsed the need for a solution, and Coleman has been working closely with Senators Kyl and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to broker a solution.
