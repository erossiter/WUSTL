SEN. COLEMAN AMENDMENT CALLING FOR FAIR TREATMENT OF ISRAEL INCLUDED IN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman's efforts to promote the fair and equal treatment of Israel found solid ground today as his provision calling for more accountability from the members of the United Nations was included in the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which is expected to pass Congress soon.  
 Coleman's amendment calls for the State Department to create a list of anti-Israel votes cast by member countries of the United Nations General Assembly and unites our diplomatic community to dissuade the General Assembly from voting to condemn Israel -
    "We need a simplified list from the State Department so that we can hold countries that continually vote against Israel accountable," said Coleman.
   During the fifty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, the General Assembly adopted a total of 80 resolutions by roll call vote, twenty-three of which were related to castigating Israel.
   "With the end of the Cold War and the beginning of this new era of terrorism, the time has come for the General Assembly's anti-Israel obsession to come to an end," Coleman concluded.
