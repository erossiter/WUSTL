SEN. COLEMAN TO VISIT ROCHESTER, RUSHFORD, HOUSTON ON MARCH 10
  Sen. Norm Coleman will visit the communities of Rochester, Rushford and Houston on Saturday, March 10th during a visit to southeastern Minnesota. Coleman, who visited all 87 counties during 2006, will begin the day at a public forum hosted by the Rochester Coalition to discuss the circumstances surrounding the recent denial of the DM&E Railroad loan and other area concerns. He will then attend a briefing on the recent ice storm damage in southern Minnesota during a meeting at Tri-County Rural Electric Cooperative in Rushford, before attending a coffee meeting to discuss local issue with area leaders in Houston.  
   "My trips to the counties across Minnesota last year have been extremely valuable to me and I am anxious to visit these communities on Saturday," said Coleman. "In Rochester, the DM&E loan denial is a major development and I look forward to discussing this and other local issues with area residents. Additionally, the ice storm damage in southern Minnesota from the recent winter storms is a major area of concern for me, and I hope to get further details on the problem in order to help address this issue. I also look forward to hearing directly from local folks in Houston, which is the best way to stay in touch with my constituents about issues that matter to them most."
