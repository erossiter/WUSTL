SEN. COLEMAN, FEINGOLD INTRODUCE BILL OUTLINING COMPREHENSIVE SOMALIA STRATEGY
  Citing the necessity for a substantive and sustained U.S. response to Somalia's political and humanitarian crisis, Sen. Norm Coleman today joined Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) in introducing legislation that would require a comprehensive U.S. strategy to aid the war-torn country. The legislation also includes a provision continuously advocated by Sen. Coleman that calls for the appointment of a special envoy to the area to increase the diplomatic presence of the United States. Coleman and Feingold have previously worked on similar legislation that was amended to last year's Department of Defense Authorization bill.  
   "As a Senator from Minnesota, which has the largest community of Somalis outside of Somalia, I have heard firsthand from our Somali community about the harsh realities on the ground in their home country," said Coleman. "Somalia continues to be ravaged by instability, humanitarian tragedies and even natural disasters. This situation has had devastating effects on citizens of the war-torn nation and their families who have found refuge abroad. Additionally, given the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis and the potential for creating a terrorist haven in an unstable nation, we cannot afford to ignore the crisis in Somalia. Developing a pro-active and comprehensive strategy to address the problems in the region is a good first step in restoring peace and stability to Somalia." 
   The legislation includes the following: 
   * Appointment of a Special Envoy for Somalia responsible for coordinating U.S. government policy, reporting on challenges and progress in Somalia, and pursuing reconciliation; 
   * Support for a regional or international peacekeeping force for Somalia under the umbrella of the African Union; 
   * Providing assistance aimed at strengthening the federal institutions of Somalia; and 
   * Convening an international donor conference and increasing coordination with international partners. 
   "A comprehensive approach to Somalia will better enable the U.S. to assess the economic, political and developmental needs for the nation and in the process bring peace and stability to the region," Coleman added. 
   Coleman pressed for the appointment of a Special Envoy for Somalia today during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with witnesses that included Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer and USAID Assistant Administrator Michael Hess. At the hearing, Coleman raised long-standing concerns about U.S. diplomatic capacity to formulate and carry out policy toward Somalia, as well as the level of humanitarian assistance to that country.
