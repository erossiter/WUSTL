SEN. COLEMAN CONDEMNS MOVEON.ORG AD SLANDERING GENERAL PETRAEUS
  "The attack on the integrity and character of General David Petraeus is a detestable act that marks a new low in the defeatist politics of Moveon.org. General Petraeus represents the very best of our service men and women and to slander his name in order to advance a political agenda demeans our entire military and all those currently fighting in Iraq. General Petraeus is a man of honor who has dedicated his entire career to serving this nation. Moveon.org's politics of personal degradation and character slander have no place in this debate. I hope that all Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle condemn this disgraceful slander. I urge my colleagues to embrace this as a turning point in which we put aside destructive, partisan politics and engage in a thoughtful discussion amongst ourselves and with the Administration as we chart the best way forward together at this critical time for our nation."
