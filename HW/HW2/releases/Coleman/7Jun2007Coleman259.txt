SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  "We need comprehensive immigration reform that determines who is living inside our country, secures our borders, and restores the rule of law to our immigration policies and enforcement. This, however, cannot be achieved without full and complete debate - debate that Sen. Reid is cutting off prematurely. This is a bill that was never considered by Committee, and brought directly to the floor before most of us had a chance to fully review it. My colleagues and I - on both sides of the aisle - have amendments that have not received a vote. Literally hundreds of amendments have been filed and only a few dozen have had the opportunity to be voted on, just 12 from the Republican side.  
   I support comprehensive immigration reform, and I still hope the Senate will be able to finish this task some time in the future. However, the repercussions of this bill are too great, and I could not in good conscience support moving forward with legislation that is incomplete and unfinished."
