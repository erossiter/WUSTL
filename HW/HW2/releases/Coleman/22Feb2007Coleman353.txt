SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON WHTI CHILD TRAVEL DECISION
  STATEMENT FROM SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON WHTI CHILD TRAVEL DECISION:  
   "I welcome today's announcement that children under 16 will not be required to purchase passports or passport equivalents as part of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. This will help address the concerns I have raised about the cost to border residents, as well as the Initiative's impact on hockey teams near the border, school trips, and other low-risk travel. While I will press ahead to address some other concerns related to the Initiative, such as enabling a secure drivers license to be used as an alternative to a passport and ensuring adequate time and resources for implementation, I think today's news shows the Department of Homeland Security is listening to the valid concerns myself and others have heard from folks living along the border."
