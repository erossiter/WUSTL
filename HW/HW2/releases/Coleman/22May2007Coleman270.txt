SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $583,911 FOR WINSTED AIRPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Winsted has been selected to receive a $583,911 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grant will be used for runway improvements at Winsted Municipal Airport.  
   "I am excited that folks in and around Winsted will benefit from this grant," said Coleman. "During my visits to communities across the state, I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. This grant will help improve the safety of the runway at Winsted Municipal, and I applaud the FAA for awarding this funding." 
   "The rehabilitation of the turf runway is greatly needed and will complete the first step in a future project to pave the runway," said Winsted Mayor Steve Stotko. "The City of Winsted appreciates the support of the FAA, MN DOT, and Senator Coleman's office." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
