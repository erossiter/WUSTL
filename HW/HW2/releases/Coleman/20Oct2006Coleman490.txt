SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION FOR HEAD START PROGRAM IN MORA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Lakes and Pines Community Action Council, based in Mora, has been awarded a $1,537,742 grant for its Head Start Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The grant will enable the organization to continue its Head Start program, which currently serves approximately 350 eligible children and their families in the seven counties of Aitkin, Carlton, Chisago, Isanti, Kanabec, Mille Lacs and Pine.  
   "As a strong supporter of Head Start, I believe the key to fulfilling America's promise of equal opportunity is ensuring that every child has access to educational resources during early childhood," said Coleman. "This grant will go a long way towards reaching that goal for folks in Mora and the surrounding area, and I am thrilled this money will be coming to Minnesota through the Lakes and Pines Community Action Council." 
   "Head Start has been shown to be one of the most effective anti poverty programs over the past four decades," said Lake and Pines Community Action Council Executive Director Bob Benes. "As we look to the future, we hope to continue to deliver Head Start in a way that is respectful and inclusive of the diverse population in East Central Minnesota and develop services to meet the needs of families with younger children, where science tells us we can have an even greater impact on both children and parents as they work to escape poverty and develop to their fullest potential." 
   Senator Coleman has worked extensively to support Head Start during his time in the Senate. Earlier this year, Coleman circulated a letter to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to include at least $234 million in additional funding for Head Start.
