SEN. COLEMAN: ECONOMY MOVING IN RIGHT DIRECTION
  Sen. Norm Coleman said the economic results released today by the U.S. Department of Labor showing a steady increase in jobs and wages combined with a further decrease in the unemployment rate provide further evidence that the President's pro-growth economic policies and tax cuts work and should be extended.  
   According to the most recent figures, the U.S. added 193,000 jobs in January, while the nation's unemployment level fell to 4.7 percent - the lowest since July 2001. January marks the 32nd consecutive month of positive job growth. The Labor Department also upwardly revised its numbers for both November (354,000 v. 305,000) and December (140,000 v. 108,000). The economy has created over 2 million jobs over the past year and more than 4.7 million since August 2003. 
   "As we begin a new year I'm encouraged to see that the economy continues to grow jobs and the unemployment rate remains below the average of the last three decades." Coleman said. "The President's economic agenda, highlighted by pro-growth policies and tax relief, continues to benefit the United States and the people of Minnesota." 
   While the economy continues to grow, Coleman believes that more can be done to increase job growth. The Senate Thursday night approved a $70 billion tax cut bill to continue spurring economic growth and innovation." 
   "Congress needs to send this bill to conference and complete its important work," Coleman said. "This legislation extends a number of the key tax relief provisions that will make sure that hard working moms and dads, small businesses, teachers and college students across Minnesota do not see their taxes go up." 
   Minnesota also continues to show steady job growth. Throughout the past year, nearly 34,000 jobs have been created in Minnesota, while the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent - down from 4.4 percent one year ago.
