SEN. COLEMAN HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF HISTORIC NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM ACT
  Sen. Norm Coleman praised the passage today of the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, which includes several key amendments crafted by the Minnesota Republican, as a serious and historic step that will significantly increase our nation's ability to track down and deter terrorists and make Americans more secure. This legislation was crafted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which held extensive hearings on the subject of national intelligence reform during the Senate's summer recess. Coleman, a member of the GA Committee, played an active role in shaping this legislation and attended each of the Committee's hearings on this subject in full. The senator also assisted in managing the bill during its consideration by the Senate at the request of the Senate Government Affairs Committee Chairman, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). 
   "Reforming America's intelligence operations, the first line in the fight against terror, is serious business, and I felt we needed to proceed quickly but carefully," Coleman said. "At the Government Affairs Committee hearings in August, of which I attended every one, we learned that the need for serious reform was real. I believe this legislation accomplishes what we set out to do: centralize our intelligence operations so that federal agencies can work more efficiently and cooperatively in tracking down those who would hurt our homeland. It will make America safer. "
   The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 makes Americans safer by:
   * Creating a strong National Intelligence Director with significant powers to transfer budget and personnel
   * Creates a National Counterterrorism Center, which will collect the best people from all agencies and develop a common strategy for combating terror.
   * Creates an Information Sharing Network that will link all intelligence agencies and allow them to exchange information and improve communication.
   * Safeguards privacy and civil liberties by setting up a separate watchdog board.
   Three of the amendments which Coleman authored address the creation of information networks that would allow intelligence agencies and first responders to communicate with each other in case of a natural disaster or terrorist attack. Central to these efforts is the creation of an Incident Command System.
   The 9/11 Commission recommended that: "emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt the Incident Command System (ICS). When multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved, they should adopt a unified command. Both are proven frameworks for emergency response...In the future the Department of Homeland Security should consider making funding contingent on aggressive and realistic training in accordance with ICS and unified command procedures."
   For the past two years, Coleman has worked closely with the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities on a proposal to create such a system from existing components and technology.
   "I believe an integrated system that allows the first responders at the scene of a natural or terrorist disaster to communicate with each other is a critical part of homeland defense," Coleman said. "It is also vital that the system allow first responders to access databases that would help them understand and react to what they are facing. I am hopeful that this bill will spur the Department of Homeland Security to make greater progress in seeing that this system becomes a reality."
   Three of Coleman's amendments accomplish the following:
   * Stated the Sense of Congress that the nation should create the ICS called for by the 9/11 Commission.
   * Clarified that the ICS should be able to access the Information Sharing Network for intelligence agencies called for in the intelligence reform bill.
   * Ensured that training costs and the cost of participation to State and local jurisdictions and private sector entities will receive early consideration when the Network is created. Coleman has pledged to work closely with states and local law enforcement officials to ensure that their voice is heard when decisions on communications network is made.
   Coleman's fourth amendment accepted by the Senate preserves the Homeland Security Council as a separate agency within the Executive Office of the President. This body, which works closely with the National Security Council, ensures that interagency issues dealing with homeland security receive high-level attention
   The final amendment offered by the Minnesota Senator, and coauthored with Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), imposes a one-year moratorium on senior bank examiners before they can accept employment at a bank that they formerly supervised, and requires the Treasury Department to make recommendations on how to strengthen U.S. anti-terrorist financing efforts.
   Finally, an amendment co-authored with Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), and Sen. Thomas Carper (D-DE), streamlines the state and local domestic preparedness grant programs and gives local jurisdictions greater flexibility in spending federal money. It creates a one-stop office for jurisdictions to learn what grants are available and how to apply for them.
