SEN. COLEMAN JOINS SENS. SPECTER, DORGAN IN INTRODUCING BIPARTISAN BILL CREATING NATIONAL SEX OFFENDER DATABASE
  Today, Sen. Norm Coleman, along with Sens. Dorgan and Specter, introduced Dru's Law, legislation that combines all 50 state registries of sex offenders into one national database that the public can access online.  
 The bill also requires prisons to notify their state attorney general whenever a "high risk" offender is about to be released, allowing a state the time to petition for continued confinement on a case-by-case basis. Dru's Law requires all released "high risk" offenders to be monitored for at least one year. 
   "Federal law requires each state to keep a registry of known sex offenders, but what happens when an offender crosses over into another state and re-commits his crime?" said Senator Coleman. "Tragically, this is what happened in Dru's case, and we must take all measures to make sure that it never happens again. Sexual predators aren't confined by state borders, and neither should the public's ability to keep track of them. If a sex offender is determined by experts to have a particularly 'high risk' of reoffending, I believe the states should have the opportunity to prevent his release into the public. [deleted text]" 
   In 2003, Dru Sjodin, of Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, was tragically abducted by a released sex offender who had been rated as having a "high risk" for reoffending. Although Alfonso Rodriguez was on a Minnesota registry as a sex offender, he chose to live in a small Minnesota town close to the North Dakota border. Dru was attending the University of North Dakota when she was kidnapped, but North Dakota does not keep track of Minnesota's sex offenders. 
   In 2004, the Senate unanimously passed Dru's Law.
