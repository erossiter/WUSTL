SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORT ON IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
  Senator Norm Coleman issued the following statement on today's report from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction:  
   "It is troubling that today's report from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction shows the Iraqi government is continuing to lag in their own reconstruction responsibilities. Although reconstruction progress in Iraq is moving slower than any of us would like, it is critical that we continue to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars in Iraq are protected. I commend the Special Inspector's office for their continued work to ensure independent, honest and timely oversight of reconstruction efforts in Iraq." 
   SIGIR Background: 
   The office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) is a temporary federal agency, created by Congress, serving the American public as a watchdog for fraud, waste, and abuse of funds intended for Iraq reconstruction programs. SIGIR oversight is accomplished via independent audits, field inspections, and criminal investigations. 
   Last year, Senator Coleman led a bipartisan group of Senators to save and extend the term of the SIGIR office when members of the House inserted a last minute provision to terminate the office before its job was done. Sen. Coleman joined Senators Feingold, Lieberman and Collins by immediately cosponsoring legislation to stop the early termination of the SIGIR. The legislation passed both the Senate and the House, and was signed into law in December of 2006 - effectively extending oversight of reconstruction efforts in Iraq.
