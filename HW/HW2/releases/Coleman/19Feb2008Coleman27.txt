SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF CASTRO
  "For decades, Castro has ruled over the people of Cuba with tyranny and oppression. While his resignation is a welcome development, it is clear that his brother Raul - who has also not been democratically elected by the Cuban people - plans to maintain the status quo of despotism in Cuba. The Cuban people deserve to exercise the basic freedoms that have been forcefully withheld from them for decades, including the ability to choose their own democratic government. While I hope the resignation of Castro will help remove some of the major obstacles for democracy in Cuba, I will wait until the people of Cuba are able to freely choose their own leader before I celebrate the end of tyranny in their country.
