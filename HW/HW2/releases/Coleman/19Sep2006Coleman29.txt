SEN. COLEMAN AGRICULTURE REPRESENTATIVE TO VISIT LITTLE FALLS, FOLEY, LONG PRAIRIE, WAITE PARK TO DISCUSS DROUGHT, CROP CONDITIONS
  As part of his ongoing effort to assist Minnesota farmers affected by the summer's dry weather, Sen. Norm Coleman will be sending his Agriculture Representative, Matt Ketelsen, to visit the counties of Morrison, Benton, Todd and Stearns during a visit to central Minnesota on Wednesday, September 20th. Farmers in these areas struggled with adverse weather conditions over the summer, and Coleman is sending Ketelsen to get an updated assessment of the crop situation and to hear specifics concerns from local farmers and representatives of Farm Service Agencies (FSA) in Little Falls, Foley, Long Prairie and Waite Park.  
   Coleman has been a consistent advocate of securing disaster assistance for Minnesota farmers affected by flooding last year and severely dry weather this year. Most recently, Coleman joined his colleagues in co-sponsoring the Emergency Agriculture Disaster Assistance Act. This legislation expands Coleman's previous disaster aid efforts by adding $2.5 billion in 2006 drought relief to the $4 billion in 2005 disaster assistance for flooding and hurricane related energy costs. 
   Specifically, this legislation provides crop production and quality loss assistance to farmers for the 2005 and 2006 seasons, while adding economic loss payments for the hurricane-related high energy costs from last year. Also included is $100 million available to specialty crops and livestock, $147 million in economic assistance to dairy producers, and $24 million for sugar beet disaster assistance.
