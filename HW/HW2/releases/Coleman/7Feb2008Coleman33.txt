SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement today following Senate passage of economic stimulus legislation: 
   "The bipartisan stimulus package passed today will provide a much-needed confidence boost to our economy by putting money back into the pockets of hardworking middle class families and offering critical pro-growth incentives for businesses. I'm particularly pleased the Senate bill includes much-needed relief for 20 million seniors and 250,000 disabled veterans, while also ensuring that illegal aliens will not get tax rebates. Minnesotans are rightly worried about the economy and expect those of us in Congress to work together to help ensure economic and job growth. Passage of this bill is a victory for Minnesotans and the entire nation."
