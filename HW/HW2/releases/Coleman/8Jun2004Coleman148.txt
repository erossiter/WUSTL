SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $200,000 FOR WHITE EARTH LAND RECOVERY PROJECT
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded $200,000 to the White Earth Land Recovery Project. 
   The White Earth, Minnesota, non-profit will use the funds - a $150,000 rural business enterprise grant and $50,000 in technical assistance - to help with its efforts at marketing rice and other products from 50 Native American households on the White Earth Indian Reservation.
   "My number one priority is to focus on job creation and economic development for Minnesota," said Coleman. "These USDA funds help ensure strong economic growth in rural Minnesota, and I am quite pleased that families on the White Earth Indian Reservation will benefit from this important USDA funding."
   The funding will protect four jobs and leverage an additional $200,000 from the Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation.
   The USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service is part of President Bush's efforts to spur economic development in rural areas of America. Since 2001, President Bush has provided over $1.8 million in rural business enterprise grants to 22 Minnesota projects.
