SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR CITY OF OGEMA
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the City of Ogema will receive a $619,000 grant and a $372,000 loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   The USDA Rural Development funds will be used to help construct a municipal water system. A component of the project includes a transmission line to be constructed between White Earth and Ogema, which will now be able to purchase water from the White Earth Tribe.
   "My number one priority is to focus on economic development for Minnesota," said Coleman. "These USDA funds help ensure strong economic growth in rural Minnesota by assisting in infrastructure. I am quite pleased that both the residents of Ogema and the White Earth Tribe will benefit from this important USDA funding."
   USDA Rural Development recently administered over $4 million in grants and loans to four Minnesota towns and community projects. This funding is part of President Bush's efforts to spur economic development in rural areas of America.
