SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON THANKSGIVING
  THANKSGIVING DAY STATEMENT  
   Each year we pause to reflect on the blessings and liberties that cherish as Americans with friends, family and loved ones.  
 I am touched by the thoughts, prayers and support my family and I have received throughout the past year and give my thanks in return. I am truly blessed to represent and serve wonderful people and this great state. 
   As John Fitzgerald Kennedy once said, "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." This past year, our country has gone through trials and triumphs, and throughout each challenge and opportunity, America has risen to offer the support for our fellow Americans that demonstrate the best of the American spirit. It is that spirit we celebrate this holiday season. 
   We also give thanks to the brave men and women who selflessly serve and defend our freedoms every day. At this time of year especially, we offer our praise for their bravery and prayers for their safe return home, as well as for the military families that have lost loved ones serving overseas. This is a tremendous sacrifice, but I hope some comfort can be found in knowing how grateful we remain as a nation on this Thanksgiving Day. May God bless you and continue to bless the United States of America.
