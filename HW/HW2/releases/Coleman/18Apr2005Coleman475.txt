SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TARGET'S DECISION TO PLACE PRODUCTS CONTAINING PSEUDOEPHEDRINE BEHIND COUNTER
 "Once again Target Corporation has displayed its tremendous civic leadership in the Minnesota community.  
 By placing products containing pseudoephedrine - the primary ingredient in methamphetamine production - behind the counter, Target has done the right and responsible thing, and I hope many more pharmacies will follow their lead. I introduced legislation last January called the Combat Meth Act that would make the policy of keeping products containing pseudoephedrine the law of the land. Target's decision today is an important step forward in cracking down on methamphetamines - a dangerous drug that has ruined too many lives and torn too many families apart in Minnesota."
