SEN. COLEMAN COAUTHORS BILL TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONGRESS
  In an effort to increase both transparency and accountability in Congress, Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) today joined Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) as a coauthor of the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act of 2005 (S. 2128 ). This legislation, which was originally introduced in December of 2005, contains a number of substantial reforms to increase disclosure, accountability, and transparency throughout the entire legislative process.  
   "At a time when there is significant confusion and concern surrounding the practices and rules governing certain areas of Congress, it is crucial that we make every effort to ensure complete transparency and disclosure in Congress," said Coleman. "In order to achieve this goal, we need to enact real reform to the system. This bill will do that exactly that- by not only demonstrating the Senate's will to enact reform, but laying out a clear, tangible set of changes that will have a direct impact some of the current problems with the system. I am proud to join my colleagues today in offering my full support for this set of critical reforms." 
   Along with coauthoring this bill, Coleman also announced he will be posting detailed records of his Senate travel - both in and out of state - on his Senate website beginning tomorrow, January 20th. Although Coleman has never taken a trip paid for by lobbyists, the general questions surrounding private Congressional travel have led to some confusion over the process. Furthermore, Coleman is committing to voluntarily accelerate his official travel reporting to ensure that his official Senate trips are reported much sooner than the current 30-day requirement. Along similar lines, Coleman is also weighing the possibility of calling for the creation of an independent commission that would operate outside of the institution of the Senate to review ideas and to provide a series of recommendations to the Senate on how to best address the related concerns of the American people. 
   "Like every other member of our Minnesota Congressional delegation, I have taken non-taxpayer funded trips that are important to official business and Minnesota's priorities," said Coleman. "Although this information has already been publicly disclosed, my intention is to make this information more accessible and transparent to the public. Whether it is combining with my staff to visit every Minnesota community, or traveling to Hong Kong to examine port security procedures to stop the illegal shipment of Weapons of Mass Destruction, I have gained extremely valuable insight through my travel that has allowed me to be a more effective Senator. Hopefully, posting this information on my Senate website will serve to further ensure my constituents that they are being made well aware of any and all private travel I am taking - travel that is immensely important for Minnesota and the nation." 
   Specifically, the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act would: 
   * Require faster reporting of lobbying expenditures and greater public access to reports filed by lobbyists and their employers; 
   * Increase disclosure of lobbying activities, including so-called grass-roots lobbying; 
   * Increase disclosure by lobbyists, lawmakers and congressional staff of travel arranged or financed by lobbyists or clients; and 
   * Require members of Congress to notify the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate if their discussions with potential new employers pose any conflicts of interests. 
   Additionally, the House and Senate ethics committees would be directed to set standards for "reasonable expenditures" on official travel, and the ban on former senior executive personnel, former Members of Congress, and legislative branch personnel preventing them from lobbying the entity in which they previously served would be extended from one to two years. The bill would require lawmakers to pay fair market value for travel on private aircraft and tickets to sporting or entertainment events, while increasing the civil penalty for failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements up to $100,000. 
   Some of the documents that will be listed on the Coleman's website as of tomorrow, along with the overall list of travel, include: 
   * A list of more than 50 town hall meetings Coleman has held in Minnesota 
   * A case study of the benefits from a trip the senator took to Brazil to learn about renewable fuels and lessening energy imports 
   * A standard committee disclosure form for travel 
   * Questions and answers about the importance of transparency and for making the senator's travel more easily accessible to the public.
