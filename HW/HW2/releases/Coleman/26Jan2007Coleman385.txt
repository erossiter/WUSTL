SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $88,262 FOR LITTLEFORK FIRE DISTRICT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Littlefork Fire District has been awarded an $88,262 grant under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase safety equipment for the department's firefighters.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for helping the Littlefork Fire District improve the safety of its firefighters," said Coleman. "Everyday, firefighters across Minnesota put their personal safety and lives on the line to protect their communities, and they deserve the best resources possible. With the help of this grant, firefighters in Littlefork will be better protected, and I am pleased they have been selected for this funding." 
   "We really appreciate this grant," said Bruce Grotberg of the Littlefork Fire District. "We're going to use this grant to buy new equipment like boots, pants, jackets, hoods, helmets, air compressors, and self contained breathing apparatus." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
