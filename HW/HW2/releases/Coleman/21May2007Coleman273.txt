SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $274,338 FOR ROCHESTER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Rochester has been selected to receive a $274,338 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grant will be used to update the airport master plan and increase capacity at the passenger screening checkpoint. Coleman's office notified airport officials of the award today.  
   "Rochester has truly become a worldwide destination and as the city continues to grow, it will be imperative that future development at Rochester International Airport stays ahead of the curve," said Coleman. "This grant will help in planning for future development at the airport, while also expanding capacity at the passenger checkpoint. I am thankful the FAA recognizes the importance of this airport to the economy and quality of life in Rochester and I applaud them for awarding this grant." 
   "We are excited to receive this important federal funding to improve Rochester International Airport," said Kurt Claussen, Assistant Airport Manager. "With this money, we plan to start updating the airport master plan and increase the capacity of our passenger screening checkpoint to better serve our traveling public. We'd like to thank Sen. Coleman and the rest of the Minnesota delegation for ensuring this federal assistance is available to airports like ours on a consistent basis." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
