SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $250,000 FOR BENTON COUNTY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the Benton County Department of Economic Development has received a $250,000 guaranteed loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding, which is administered through USDA's Intermediary Relending Program (IRP), will provide low-interest loans for public and non-profit organizations to re-lend for business and community development in the Benton County area.  
   "Anyone living or traveling in Greater Minnesota understands the need to encourage and foster greater economic development," said Coleman. "Over the past three years, I have heard from countless communities in rural Minnesota about the need for greater economic development. Projects like this have enormous value in Greater Minnesota and I am pleased Benton County has received this important funding. I applaud USDA for awarding this grant." 
   "We are excited about the news that we will be receiving another loan from USDA to recapitalize our loan program," said Benton County Economic Director Nancy Hoffman. "Benton County provides loan funds for new and expanding businesses within the county and a focus is to retain our existing businesses and to assist them in their expansion. The IRP loan program is a tool that will assist us in meeting those goals for the residents of Benton County. 
   The USDA Rural Development program's mission is to deliver programs which will support increased economic opportunity and improve the quality of life of rural residents across the country. The specific purpose of the Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) is to finance business facilities and community development projects in rural areas. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
