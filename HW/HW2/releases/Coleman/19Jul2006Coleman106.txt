SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS SENATE PASSAGE OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT
  In an effort to address the nation's pressing need to upgrade the infrastructure of its waterways, Sen. Norm Coleman joined a bipartisan majority of his Senate colleagues today in supporting the Water Resources Development Act, which was approved by a voice vote in the Senate today. Vital for Minnesota, the legislation authorizes a number of Army Corps of Engineers flood control projects, as well as navigational improvement and ecosystem restoration of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway. Coleman is an original cosponsor of the legislation.  
   "Our nation's waterways are the lifeblood of our national commerce and transportation system, and it is imperative that we provide the tools needed to keep these national resources passable and environmentally sound," said Coleman. "The Mississippi River is the greatest river system on our continent. It is essential for Minnesota agriculture and industry, serving as a gateway to the world market and allowing us to remain competitive at an international level. This legislation will allow us to effectively use the Mississippi River, while still protecting its environment with critical investment in ecosystem restoration. Today's Senate passage of WRDA is a victory for economic development and environmental protection." 
   "The passage of the Water Resources Development Act is long over due," said Minnesota Farm Bureau President Kevin Paap. "The Mississippi River transportation system provides Minnesota's farmers with an important means to compete in the global market place, as well as a resource to get needed inputs back up to the Midwest. The passage of WRDA establishes the improvements and modernization to the Upper Mississippi River locks and dams that will allow us to continue to effectively and efficiently transport our goods." 
   Provisions of WRDA include: 
   * Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Restoration (UMR-IWW): The legislation authorizes $2 billion for navigation improvements along the waterway along with $1.5 billion in ecosystem restoration. It also authorizes the construction of seven new 1,200 foot locks on the UMR-IWW to expedite shipping on the waterway. 
   * Authorization for the St. Paul Holman Field project 
   * Authorization of a $25 million for the Crookston, MN flood control project 
   * Authorization of $9 million for improvements to Duluth Harbor. 
   "If we do not invest in our infrastructure, we run the risk of falling behind the world market," said Coleman. "I have said many times that we must take the lead on issues critical to global competitiveness and the investments provided in WRDA are a key part of that strategy." 
   The UMR-IWW makes commercial navigation possible between Minneapolis and St. Louis on the Mississippi River, and along the Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi River. Five of the nation's top agricultural production states; Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin; have relied on the UMR-IWW system as a principal conduit for export-bound agricultural products, mostly bulk corn and soybeans.
