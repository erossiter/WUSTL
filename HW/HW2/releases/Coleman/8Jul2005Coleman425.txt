SEN. COLEMAN COMMENDS CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today acknowledged that the recent economic and jobs data released today by the Labor Department shows strong and sustained economic growth across the country. According to new government figures, 146,000 new jobs were created in June, signaling the 25th consecutive month for job gains, and since May 2003, the economy has created 3.7 million jobs. In addition, the unemployment rate fell to 5.0 percent, reaching its lowest levels since September, 2001.  
   "I'm pleased to see that economic growth continues to climb strongly and steadily," said Coleman. "I believe that today's numbers reflect the work we've been doing in Washington and show that the President's and Congress's pro-jobs policies are working. For the past two years, the U.S. economy has grown faster than the economies of any other major industrialized nation. With the passage of last month's Energy Bill, and our continuing efforts on the Highway Bill, more opportunities for good paying jobs are being created and businesses are expanding. I am especially pleased with the inclusion in the Energy Bill of Mesaba Energy and the Renewable Fuels Standard to more than double ethanol use in America by 2012. Legislation like this passed in Washington means real jobs created at home in Minnesota. Still, we can't afford to stand on our past accomplishments-we must keep moving forward, and I guarantee that we will do our part in the Senate to make sure job creation continues for the 26th consecutive month." 
   According to data released last month, Minnesota's unemployment rates fell to 4.3 percent from its previous level of 4.6 percent last year, and since the beginning of this year alone, more than 10,000 Minnesota jobs have been created.
