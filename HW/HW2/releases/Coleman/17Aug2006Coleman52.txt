SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM JUDICIAL RULING
  STATEMENT BY SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM JUDICIAL RULING  
  "We know from the plot just revealed in Britain that terrorists continue to target the U.S. We also know that the Terrorist Surveillance Program has undoubtedly helped prevent terrorist attacks and the innocent loss of life. The ruling by a federal judge to shut down this vital program, which has been carried out with the knowledge and oversight of Congress, is a reckless act that surrenders one of our key weapons against terrorism and leaves Americans more vulnerable. I fully support the Administration's efforts to stay, and hopefully, overturn this foolhardy decision that undermines our duty and ability to fully protect the American people."
