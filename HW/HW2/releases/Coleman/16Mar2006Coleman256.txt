SEN. COLEMAN CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER HALLIBURTON/KBR PROVIDED U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ CONTAMINATED WATER
  Sen. Norm Coleman, Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), said today that his Subcommittee staff is continuing to review an internal Halliburton report outlining problems in providing U.S. troops in Iraq contaminated water as part of a continuing PSI investigation into the matter. PSI investigative counsels reviewed the issue again today in a previously scheduled meeting with representatives of the Department of Defense.  
   "I am deeply concerned about any suggestion that our troops who are risking their lives for our national security would have to fear the very water they drink," Coleman said. "This inquiry, like all PSI investigations, is being conducted in a thoroughly bi-partisan fashion. Our Subcommittee will drill down into the facts, and get to the bottom of these allegations." 
   On February 7th, 2006 the Subcommittee opened an inquiry into the reports that U.S. troops and personnel in Iraq may have been exposed to contaminated water. To date, the Subcommittee has issued Chairman's Letters, which request a broad array of relevant documents, from both the Defense Department and Halliburton. Pursuant to those letters, the Subcommittee has received and reviewed critical documents, including the report recently mentioned in certain press accounts. 
   The Subcommittee has also conducted extensive briefings and interviews of certain essential parties, including Halliburton, KBR and DoD. The Subcommittee expects to receive significant additional documentation concerning these issues and will conduct many additional interviews with crucial witnesses. As with any other open investigation, the Subcommittee will not present any preliminary conclusions or further comments until the completion of the investigation.
