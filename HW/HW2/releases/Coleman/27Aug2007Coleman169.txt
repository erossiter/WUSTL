SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  Statement On The Resignation Of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: 
   "Attorney General Gonzales had lost the credibility needed to effectively run the Justice Department, and his resignation today will allow the country to move forward. Moreover, it will allow Congress to spend time working on the major issues before our country, rather than spending time on Congressional hearings regarding the Attorney General. It is absolutely essential to have a leader in this position that the American people can trust. Going forward, I will work with my colleagues to confirm a replacement that has the ability to not only restore the faith of the American public, but also bring transparency to the department."
