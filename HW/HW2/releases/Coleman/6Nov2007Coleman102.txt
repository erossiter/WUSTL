SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FORD-AUTO WORKERS AGREEMENT
  "I'm thrilled that Ford and Union officials were able to come to an agreement that will protect healthcare plans for retirees. For years, the St. Paul plant has provided Minnesotans with thousands of good paying jobs. By extending the life of the plant by another year, I am hopeful that we can find a long-term solution to keeping this plant operational. The additional time will also provide a sense of financial security for the workers and their families."
