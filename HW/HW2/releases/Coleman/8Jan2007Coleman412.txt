SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR KHALILZAD
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON NOMINATION OF ZALMAY KHALILZAD: 
   The nomination of Ambassador Khalilzad is a positive step forward in maintaining strong U.S. leadership at the United Nations. Having met with the Ambassador on several occasions, I have full confidence in his abilities as a skillful diplomat to push for U.S. interests at the U.N. I urge my Senate colleagues to resist allowing his nomination to fall prey to the same partisan politics that forced the resignation of John Bolton. Ambassador Khalilzad is a magnificent choice for U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and I have the utmost confidence that he will provide the strong leadership and voice needed at Turtle Bay during this crucial time.
