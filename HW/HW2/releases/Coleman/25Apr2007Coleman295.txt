SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR RED ROCK RURAL WATER
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Red Rock Rural Water System, based in Jeffers, Minnesota, has been selected to receive a loan of $867,000 and a grant of $133,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The federal funding will be used to expand rural water service to new users by connecting users to existing water lines, as well as through the addition of a new supply line. Coleman's office notified the organization of the grant.  
   "As a former mayor, I understand that basic infrastructure is the key to economic development and overall quality of life," said Coleman. "The major expansion project being undertaken by Red Rock Rural Water System is an important one for folks across southwest Minnesota. Both the need and cost of this project are high, and thanks to the critical funding from USDA Rural Development, both of those aspects are being met." 
   Red Rock Rural Water System is currently in the middle of a massive expansion project that is expected to include the construction of 231 miles of pipeline and rural water services to hundreds of new users in Brown, Cottonwood, Jackson, Lyon, Martin, Murray, Redwood, and Watonwan counties. 
   "This will help get water to additional members in our system and build a line to help connect additional parts of our infrastructure," said Red Rock Rural Water System Manager Dominic Jones. "I want to give my sincere appreciation on behalf of new members that will now have an opportunity to get quality water. I also want to thank USDA Rural Development and our legislators for continuing the funding mechanisms that benefit Red Rock Rural Water System." 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $4.3 billion into rural Minnesota for a variety of improvements. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
