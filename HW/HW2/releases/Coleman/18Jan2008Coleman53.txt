SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN
  "I strongly welcome the President's call today for a stimulus plan to help ensure economic growth and jobs in these challenging times. As I travel the state and speak with Minnesotans from all walks of life, I have become deeply concerned about the health of the economy. I recognize that with jobs harder to come by, mortgage payments soaring, home values falling and gas prices running high, hardworking Minnesota families are feeling uneasy about their finances and the future direction of our economy. Given the present-day challenges, it is imperative that we move quickly to pass an economic stimulus package, while at the same time continuing our efforts to limit the spillover effects of the housing downturn on the economy. While there are a number of stimulus proposals being mentioned, I will work to ensure that we craft a bipartisan proposal that provides incentives for job growth and tax relief to struggling working families."
