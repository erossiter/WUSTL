SENS. COLEMAN, COLLINS URGE ADMINISTRATION TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
  In light of the extension of the deadline for the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) passed in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, Sens. Norm Coleman and Susan Collins are urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State to use the additional time to ensure the program is efficiently implemented without additional hardship to U.S. residents. In a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Sens. Coleman and Collins outlined steps that each department should take to ensure that each portion of the program will be operating effectively before the new June 1, 2009 deadline. 
   "The extension we secured for the WHTI deadline will mean little if DHS and the State Department don't use the additional time to work out kinks in the program that could cause major headaches for Minnesotans affected by the new travel requirements," said Coleman. "Senator Collins and I are working hard to ensure that the additional time is used wisely so that we accomplish the goals of WHTI in an efficient and effective manner."  
   "The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department must work together to strengthen border security and ensure that we are not allowing people into the country who may want to do harm," said Senator Collins. "However, I feel strongly that the initiative must balance the need to strengthen border security with the needs of people living on the border. In my home state of Maine, for example, many citizens rely on the ability to quickly and easily cross the border to travel to their jobs, attend church, and visit family and friends. Many Canadians also frequently cross the border into Maine in order to visit family and friends, shop in our stores, dine in our restaurants, and work in our health care facilities in border towns." 
   WHTI will require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean, to have a passport or other accepted document that establishes the bearer's identity and nationality to enter or re-enter the United States. This is a change from prior travel requirements. The proposed changes were originally scheduled to go into effect by December 31, 2007. However, an amendment to extend the deadline to June 1, 2009 was passed as part of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations conference report. 
   The letter's recommendations include: 
   * Developing regulations that will minimize disruption: Student groups should not be required to acquire passports or Pass Cards, affordability should be considered carefully for seniors and border community residents, and technology for Pass Cards should be chosen carefully so as to ensure disruptions will be minimal; 
   * Creating a plan to avoid border delays: The Departments should develop plans now to manage any possible border delays due to the change in requirements, and an aggressive outreach program should be undertaken both before and after the WHTI implementation deadline; 
   * Reexamining the cost of the Pass Card alternative: Each Department should revisit the costs associated with the card and the execution fee for first-time applicants and identify how these costs can be reduced from the recently-proposed $45; 
   * Increasing cooperative efforts with Canada: The Departments should work with the Canadian government to develop acceptable documentation for Canadian citizens, and ensure a common vision for WHTI implementation; 
   * Testing the new Pass Card technology at border crossings: Each Department should begin Pass Card testing at a less busy border crossing, and then consider the challenges at larger crossings; 
   * Testing the viability of a driver's license option: Because of the delay, some states may have REAL ID drivers' licenses in place prior to the WHTI deadline. The Departments should explore ways to harmonize these two programs, on a voluntary basis; 
   * Considering creative solutions for Americans who regularly travel through Canada: Programs for boat travel between remote areas of the U.S. and Canada are simply unrealistic when such travel does not bring individuals near manned ports of entry. The Departments should also find creative solutions for American communities in which residents and visitors must commute through Canada or Canadian waters simply to access basic services, such as Minnesota's Northwest Angle. 
   Senator Susan Collins was successful in securing language in the recently approved Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act Conference Report that will delay the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) until June 1, 2009. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs, Coleman has held two hearings on the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. He has also held sessions in northern Minnesota to explore the impact of the Initiative. Senator Coleman had introduced a bipartisan amendment on WHTI to the Immigration Reform Act of 2006, which was passed by the Senate.
