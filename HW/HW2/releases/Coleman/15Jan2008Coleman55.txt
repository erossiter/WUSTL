SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NTSB INTERIM REPORT
  "When we stood at the site of the bridge collapse in August, we committed ourselves to preventing a similar tragedy from ever happening in this country again. NTSB's interim report is an important step in that direction and I appreciate the work of Chairman Rosenker and his staff, especially their recommendation to expand the scope of bridge inspections everywhere. Looking forward, improving our national infrastructure is as important as ever. From our bridges and highways to our rail lines, waterways, and aviation network, we need to continue to invest in a transportation system that is good for our economy and safe for our families."
