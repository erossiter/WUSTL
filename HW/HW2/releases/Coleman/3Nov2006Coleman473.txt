SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT GRANTS FOR ARGYLE, HALSTAD, CASS LAKE & NEVIS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that four fire departments in the northern Minnesota communities of Argyle, Halstad, Cass Lake and Nevis have been awarded federal grants to improve local fire operations and safety under the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) program.  
   "These grants will help ensure the safety of both the citizens and firefighters of Argyle, Halstad, Cass Lake and Nevis," said Coleman. "Across Greater Minnesota, local fire departments are comprised of volunteers who risk their lives to protect their neighbors. It is critical that they have the best resources possible. I applaud the AFG program and these individual fire departments for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of these communities are well-protected."
   The AFG program awards grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The AFG program provides financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. 
   Specifically, the grants were awarded as follows: 
   * $25,365 for the Argyle Volunteer Fire Department 
  * $59,343 for the Halstad Volunteer Fire Department 
  * $23,829 for the Cass Lake Rural Fire Association 
  * $38,859 for the Nevis Fire Department
