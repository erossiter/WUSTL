SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS AUGUST JOBS GROWTH; VOWS TO HELP CONCENTRATE EFFORTS ON KATRINA RECOVERY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today lauded the recent economic and jobs data released today by the Labor Department and feels it demonstrates that the underlying economic condition in this country is strong.  
 According to new statistics, 169,000 new payroll jobs were created in August, signaling the 27th consecutive month of job gains. Additionally, unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent from its level of 5 percent in July, its lowest level since September 2001. 
   "With the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Katrina, we in Congress must use our economic growth occurring in the country to now focus our attention on the Gulf Coast," said Coleman. "Despite today's good economic news and the lowest unemployment rate in four years, we must continue our efforts to keep our country on a course of strength. Our action last night, in passing a $10.5 billion emergency supplemental is a good start, but we must do more and we will." 
   July's job gains were revised up to 242,000 from an earlier estimate of 207,000, and payroll employment has increased by 2.2 million over the year.
