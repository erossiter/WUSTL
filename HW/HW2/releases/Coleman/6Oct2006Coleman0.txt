SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF SOMALIA STRATEGY REQUIREMENT; URGES APPPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL ENVOY
  Recognizing the need to develop a pro-active U.S. strategy toward Somalia, Sen. Norm Coleman applauded the inclusion of a Somalia amendment he had cosponsored with Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) in the final version of the Department of Defense Authorization bill, which passed the Senate last week and is on its way to the President's desk for signature. The amendment requires the U.S. government to coordinate a comprehensive strategy to aid the war-torn country.  
   "I have been frustrated at the lack of a pro-active U.S. strategy toward Somalia," said Coleman. "Without an Ambassador it is difficult to maintain a consistent focus on the area, but recent history shows us that Somalia is a country that we overlook at our own peril. This is a matter of humanitarian and diplomatic importance, but also one of our own national security. We cannot allow Somalia to become a failed state in such a strategic part of the world." 
   The amendment directs the U.S. government to: 
   * Clearly state a policy toward Somalia that will help establish a functional, legitimate, and unified national government in Somalia; 
   * Strengthen diplomatic engagement with Somalia, both bilaterally and with partner countries; and 
   * Develop a plan to address transnational security threats in Somalia and throughout the region. 
   Coleman also plans to push for the appointment of a special envoy to the area to increase the diplomatic presence of the United States. 
   "Developing a strategy to address the problems in Somalia is a good first step toward securing that area of the world. However, we need to continue building on this program by appointing an envoy to serve as the point person for the strategy," Coleman added.
