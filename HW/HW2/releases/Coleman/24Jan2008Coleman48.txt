SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS AGREEMENT
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement regarding the economic stimulus agreement announced today: 
   "A bipartisan economic stimulus package is critical in these challenging economic times and I am pleased the President and Congressional leadership have agreed on a package that will help restore confidence in the economy, encourage growth and provide much-needed relief to American families who are struggling. In my travels around the state, folks from all walks of life have shared with me their concerns about the economy, as folks are impacted one way or another by the housing downturn, stock market instability, higher gas and food prices and a weakening job market. I am hopeful that this bipartisan spirit will lead to quick enactment of these rebates and small business relief."
