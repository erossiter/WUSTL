SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES USDA AID TO NONPROFITS FOR HUNGER ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the Department of Agriculture has extended the National Nonprofit Humanitarian Initiative (NNHI) to donate nonfat dry milk and its products to faith-based and community organizations to distribute to needy recipients through Sept. 30, 2005.  
   The initiative will provide up to 3.2 million pounds of instantized nonfat dry milk (INDM) and up to 2 million pounds of non-fortified nonfat dry milk (NDM) per month that will be exchanged, before distribution, for dairy products such as puddings, soups, ultra-high temperature shelf-stable milk and energy bars. Since the initiative started in September 2003, the USDA has distributed roughly 92.8 million pounds of NDM and 44 million pounds of INDM, helping to meet the nutritional needs of the disadvantage while reducing surplus stock at the same time. 
   "Minnesota's nonprofits will be better equipped to assist those in need of nutrition assistance," said Coleman. 
   USDA has a long history of establishing partnerships with faith-based and community organizations to deliver assistance through domestic and international feeding programs. Those receiving dry milk products from the NNHI include organizations such as Feed the Children, Inc., Goodness Outreach Depot, Midwest Mission Distribution Center, and several Salvation Army posts. 
   USDA also administers 15 domestic nutrition programs that reaches one in every five people each day, including the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, the Food Stamp Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.
