TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PETERS APPROVES SEN. COLEMAN'S REQUEST TO CUT BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE
  In an effort to expedite the reconstruction process of the Interstate 35 West Bridge, Transportation Secretary Mary Peters today approved Senator Norm Coleman's request for the Department to immediately waive any regulations or administrative practices that might unnecessarily delay the delivery of $5 million in transit funding provided by Coleman's emergency assistance bill, which unanimously passed the Senate late last week.  
   "As one of Minnesota's most vital and most-traveled roadways, the I35W Bridge must be rebuilt as quickly and as efficiently as possible," said Coleman. "We cannot allow the restoration of a structure that plays such a significant role in so many Minnesotans' lives to be hampered by bureaucratic red tape. I thank Secretary Peters' for responding to my request and allowing this project to proceed without the usual long and frustrating administrative process. This bold move clears the path to restoring life in the Twin Cities." 
   Coleman's approved request comes less than a week after he and Secretary Peters jointly toured and assessed the damage of the August 1st bridge collapse in Minneapolis. 
   In addition to the $5 million for transit funding, Coleman's legislation, which the President signed into law yesterday, includes $250 million for repair and rebuilding of the bridge and also waives the current cap on emergency funding dollars currently placed on each state, which will allow the State of Minnesota to proceed with reconstruction efforts with the promise of federal reimbursement.
