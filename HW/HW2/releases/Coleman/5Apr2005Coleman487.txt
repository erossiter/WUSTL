SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF ENHANCED BORDER SECURITY MEASURES
 "Clearly there are serious concerns about the abuse of identity documents used to enter our country.  
 That's why the Intelligence Reform bill included a provision to require the use of documents to prove a person's identity and citizenship. At the same time, we need to be careful about how we implement this new reform so it is not onerous and does not discourage leisure or business travel between our two nations. Besides passports, the law would also allow other IDs that confirm identity and citizenship. The plan does not go into effect until 2008 so we have some time to make certain that national security concerns and the freedom of travel between are countries is balanced."
