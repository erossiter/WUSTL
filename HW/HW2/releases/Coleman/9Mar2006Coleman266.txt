SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $89,800 FOR NORTHEAST MINNESOTA FROM SCENIC BYWAYS PROGRAM
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that scenic byways in northeast Minnesota have received a combined $89,800 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways Program. Specifically, the grants will be aimed at improving and expanding use of many of Minnesota's scenic byways and implementing corridor management along specific routes in the region.  
   "I am pleased these respective projects have received this important funding," said Coleman. "In northeast Minnesota, the beautiful scenery and vast outdoors are a major draw for tourists, as well as a great benefit to local residents. The various improvements for these byways will allow more people to enjoy the beautiful scenic roads around the North Shore and bring greater attention to the abundant resources the area has to offer. I applaud the Federal Highway Administration for recognizing the importance of these grants in Minnesota." 
   Specific funding for the individual projects is as follows: 
   * $64,800 for a project to develop a byway tour brochure for travelers to identify sites along highway 61 from Two Harbors to Grand Portage. 
   * $25,000 for the implementation of the North Shore Corridor Management Plan used to plan activities, goals, and strategies for the local communities around highway 61 from Two Harbors to Grand Portage.
