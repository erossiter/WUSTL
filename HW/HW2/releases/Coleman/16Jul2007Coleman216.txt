  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that local airports in Moose Lake, Rush City and Princeton have been selected to receive federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  
   "Local airports continue to be an extremely valuable resource across the state and I am pleased these airports were selected for this funding," said Coleman. "From greater access for residents and visitors, to the potential for future community development, these airports are very important to their communities and the surrounding area. I applaud the FAA for recognizing this value by awarding these grants." 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $104,500 for Moose Lake Carlton County Airport for runway, apron and taxiway rehabilitation. 
   $194,750 for Rush City Regional to update the airport master plan, including an environmental assessment of a proposed crosswind runway, and replacement of an airport beacon 
   $171,000 for Princeton Municipal to install airfield guidance signs and to update the airport layout plan, including an environmental assessment for a proposed runway. 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to promote the development and modernization of public and private airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security and environmental concerns.
