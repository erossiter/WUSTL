SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONFIRMATION OF BEN WHITNEY
  Today I had the privilege of personally calling Ben Whitney and announcing that he has received Senate confirmation to be our nation's Ambassador to Norway. In all of Ben's previous endeavors he has served with class and distinction. I am confident that as Ambassador, he will bring these strengths to overseeing and managing U.S. interests with this important U.S. ally. Serving as Ambassador is a wonderful honor and I wish Ben much success in his new position.
