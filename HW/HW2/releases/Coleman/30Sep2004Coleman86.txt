SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES
  "President Bush presented to the American people a person of resolve and mature, determined leadership. The citizens of America, and the world, saw clear differences this evening. Our American President made it clear that he will not waver - he will not retreat - and we will win this war on terror. I am proud of him and his leadership."
