SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman re: Un Human Rights Council: 
  I was deeply disappointed by the draft resolution unveiled last week by General Assembly President Jan Eliasson to create a new UN Human Rights Council. Although I hold the deepest respect for Mr. Eliasson, this text has missed the mark on its goal: to form a credible and effective body capable of acting decisively on human rights issues. As I told Secretary Rice in my February 17 letter, I support the creation of a new Council to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission, but I am concerned that the current proposal would continue to enable the most notorious of human rights violators to serve on this body, while making it more difficult for the U.S. to be a member. I strongly urge the State Department to stand firm and withhold support of the Human Rights Council until it meets the standards needed to enforce basic human rights. Negotiations must continue. We need to make this a credible institution and not merely act to meet a timeline.
