SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IAEA REPORT ON IRAN
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman On IAEA report On Iran:  
   Today's IAEA report should come as no shock, as Iranian behavior has been characterized by willful defiance and deception. The report released by the IAEA verifies the Iranians' claim that they are enriching uranium and clearly states that Iran has not met the deadline set by the Security Council last month to bring itself into compliance with its obligations to the IAEA. We have given the Iranians more than enough opportunities to negotiate, but their continued defiance of the IAEA and Security Council show that they cannot be reasoned with or trusted to uphold any commitment made. Their possession of uranium enrichment capabilities, now confirmed by the IAEA, is a red-line that has been crossed and demands an immediate response. As the President said today, diplomacy is just beginning, and it is my hope the Security Council will move as swiftly as possible to implement sanctions.
