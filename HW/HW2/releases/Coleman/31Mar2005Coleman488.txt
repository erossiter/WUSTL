SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF TERRI SCHIAVO
  "I am very saddened by Terri Schiavo's death. Her courageous struggle to live has come to an end.  
 I want to extend my prayers and condolences to Mary and Robert Schindler and the rest of Terri's loving and brave family. We have all been touched by Terri's life and the strong outpouring of love that has surrounded her. In her fight to live, Terri was a tremendous teacher. She has shown us that life is a gift from God that we cannot and should not give up on. Her silent struggle has now become ours, and we must recognize that there exists a profound need to protect those, like Terri, who cannot defend themselves. May Terri's family find some peace and comfort in God's grace on this very difficult day."
