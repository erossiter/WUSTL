SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES GRANT OF $596,500 FOR PACER CENTER
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that PACER Center. Inc., based in Minneapolis, MN, has received a $596,500 federal grant from the United States Department of Education. The funding will be used to foster student achievement through PACER Center's Minnesota Parent Center (MPC). This grant will help develop programs that educate parents on the importance of their involvement in their child's education and programs that more actively engage parents in student learning activities.  
   "I am very pleased that PACER Center has received this support from the Department of Education," said Senator Coleman. "Providing opportunities that assist schools and parents in teaching Minnesota's children is a welcome and important endeavor. I am thankful that the Department of Education recognizes the good work being done by PACER Center here in Minnesota." 
   "We are thrilled to have received this grant from the Department of Education," said Paula Goldberg, Executive Director of PACER Center. "This grant will be used through our Minnesota Parent Center and is for all parents with children, but with a special emphasis on disadvantaged families. Research shows that parent involvement makes a difference in student achievement." 
   The mission of PACER Center is to expand opportunities and enhance the quality of life of children and young adults with disabilities and their families, based on the concept of parents helping parents. From California to Minnesota to New York, PACER resources make a difference in the lives of 6.5 million children with disabilities nationwide. PACER Center was founded in 1977.
