SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTHWEST AIRLINES' FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on NWA's Filing for Bankruptcy 
   I have great concern for all of the employees, communities, and families who depend on Northwest Airlines, one of our most reliable and important employers. There's no question that Northwest Airlines has been wrestling with a number of challenges since 9/11, including high labor costs, growing competition, enormous debt, and now the recent surge in the price of oil. Northwest has stated that going into bankruptcy is not their preferred choice, but circumstances have made it necessary. I have deep concerns that we protect employee pensions, and it's vital that we address the issue of pension reform. I am continuing to work with my colleagues in addressing this matter. It's crucial that Northwest recovers and gets back on track in order to minimize the economic impact on our state and to reassure those Minnesotans whose lives will be greatly affected.
