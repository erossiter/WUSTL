SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT FREE SPEECH DECISION
  Sen. Coleman statement on supreme court free speech decision today: 
   "The right to free speech is every American's fundamental right and today's Supreme Court decision confirms that the freedom to speak out on political issues cannot be blacked out right before an election. In fact, there's no more important time to exercise our right to speak out than in the weeks and days leading up to an election. Just as importantly, this decision restores the constitutionally protected right of grassroots advocacy groups like Wisconsin Right to Life, the plaintiff in this case, to engage in political debate the same as other Americans, regardless of their views, political affiliation or the issue under debate."
