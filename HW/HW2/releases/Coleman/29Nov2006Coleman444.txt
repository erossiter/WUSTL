SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $67,481 FOR CLARA CITY VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the Clara City Volunteer Fire Department received $67,481 in funding as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG), which is a program designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The grant will be used for operation and safety measures. Coleman sent two letters of support for this grant in April of this year.  
   "I am pleased that the AFG was able to provide additional funding for the Clara City Volunteer Fire Department to improve their emergency capabilities," said Coleman. "Firefighters are on the frontlines of Minnesota's public safety. Improving community units through increased funding is necessary to the safety of our state's citizens and this funding will better prepare our state's fire departments." 
   In addition to the funding awarded to Clara City Volunteer Fire Department, AFG also awarded Clearwater Fire Department $106,292 for operations and safety improvement measures.
