SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman expressed continued confidence in the state of the national economy following today's release of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report for the fourth quarter, which shows the economy expanding for 21 straight quarters at a 3.5 percent annual rate during the last three months of 2006. For 2006, the report shows that the economy grew by 3.4 percent compared to 3.2 percent in 2005 and 3.9 percent in 2004.  
   "Time and again, economic indicators continue to show the success of pro-growth policies that have brought us solid economic growth and a robust job market," said Coleman. "Keeping these policies in place is key to continuing our current economic success. However, while we continue to see positive results, I want to ensure that every Minnesotan is reaping the benefits of our growing economy. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the everyday financial concerns of Minnesota's working and middle class families." 
   In addition to strong economic growth, pro-growth policies have also led to strong job growth. According to the latest national jobs report, December marked the 40th straight month of job growth and during these months more than 7.2 million new jobs have been created.
