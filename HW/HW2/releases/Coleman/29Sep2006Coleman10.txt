SEN. COLEMAN FIGHTS FOR HOSPITAL IN CASS COUNTY
  Citing rural Minnesota's need for accessible healthcare, Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced legislation that would allow Cass County to construct a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) in the city of Walker. Under current law, Cass County is unable to build a CAH in Walker because it does not meet the federal 35-mile minimum distance rule from the nearest hospital. Coleman's legislation will provide the county with an exemption to this requirement.  
   "I am concerned for the families in Cass County who have to travel over an hour to receive emergency medical attention," said Coleman. "During a recent trip to Walker, the residents expressed to me the urgent need for a hospital within a reasonable distance. In particular, I heard from a mother who fears that she will not be able to get her asthmatic son to the hospital in time. We can not allow government red tape and regulations to stand in the way of safety for this community, and I will work with my colleagues to make this a reality for Walker." 
   "I applaud Senator Coleman's efforts in helping to bring a Critical Access Hospital to our area," said Brad Walhof, Mayor of Walker. "Health care is one of this community's biggest concerns. And it is simply unacceptable for people in need of urgent care to have to drive 50 miles to get it." 
   Since 1975 Cass County has been one of only three counties in Minnesota without a hospital within its borders. Residents and visitors in north-central Cass County have to travel up to an hour or more to hospitals in Bemidji, Park Rapids, Deer River, Crosby, Staples or Brainerd to seek urgent care in emergency rooms and other hospital-based services.
