SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NWA/DELTA MERGER
  "Any merger must protect Minnesota jobs, retain the MSP airport hub, and also protect the interests of consumers. With four airlines filing for bankruptcy in the last two weeks, today's announcement is a reflection of an industry responding to the new economic realities of our time. Along with the entire Minnesota delegation, I will review the details of this merger in the coming weeks and work to ensure that any final agreement is in the best long-term interests of Minnesota."
