SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9-11
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 9-11: 
  September 11th marks the fifth anniversary of the despicable terrorist attacks that challenged and changed our country forever. On this somber day, we as a nation still mourn for the innocent lives that were lost and remember the spouses, children, parents, and friends of these innocent victims. For the past five years we have been working diligently to secure our nation's security from terrorists here and abroad. Without question, we are safer today than we were five years ago. I support the President's efforts to bring the perpetrators of the 9-11 attacks to justice and I applaud our men and women in uniform who are continuing the fight to keep us safe and free. 
   Today, as ever, the resolve of the American people is strong. As we recall that fateful day, we rededicate ourselves to put back what was lost and, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, '?strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle?to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations'.
