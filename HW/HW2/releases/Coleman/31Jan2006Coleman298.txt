SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $52,628 FOR NORTHWEST REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Northwest Regional Development Commission (NWRDC) based in Warren, Minnesota will receive a $52,628 grant from the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA). The EDA grant is an annual installment that will be used to support long term regional economic development and planning efforts.  
   "I am excited to announce the Northwest Regional Development Commission will receive this grant and continue working as a steward for economic development in Northwest Minnesota," said Coleman. "This grant will help to encourage and foster greater planning and development that is vital for future economic success. I am pleased NWRDC has received this funding and I applaud the EDA for awarding this grant." 
   "Serving as an Economic Development District has allowed us to help local communities address critical issues including job development, value added agriculture, flood recovery, tourism promotion, comprehensive planning, and affordable housing," said NWRDC Executive Director Leon Heath. "The EDA has been an excellent partner because they understand rural communities and always make the extra effort to support local ideas and projects. We appreciate the willingness of federal legislators to make this investment in the NWRDC and Minnesota." 
   The Northwest Regional Development Commission was created through the actions of local units of government in 1973. The NWRDC serves mainly the Minnesota counties of Kittson, Marshall, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake and Roseau. 
   The EDA provides financial support to help meet economic needs of distressed communities across the United States. As part of their federal economic development agenda, the EDA helps American communities prepare for success in the global economy by promoting innovation and competition.
