SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN WHEATON, ALEXANDRIA AND MONTEVIDEO
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced three airports in western Minnesota have been selected to receive federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Specifically, grants were awarded to local airports in Wheaton, Alexandria and Montevideo.  
   "Local airports are an important part of our state's transportation infrastructure and a source of economic opportunity for rural areas," said Coleman. "During my visits to communities across the state, I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. These grants will help ensure the viability of these airports in western Minnesota and I applaud the FAA for awarding this funding." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns. 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $737,935 for Wheaton Municipal for runway rehabilitation and an updated visual guidance system. 
   $132,050 for Chandler Field in Alexandria to extend the taxiway 
   $61,750 for Montevideo-Chippewa County Airport to design a new taxiway and rehabilitate runway lighting
