SEN. COLEMAN CONTINUES TO PRESS IRAQ GOVERNMENT TOWARD RECONCILIATION
  As part of his continuing efforts to help assess U.S. policy on the Iraq War, Sen. Norm Coleman yesterday met with Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Barham Saleh of Iraq and Iraqi Ambassador to the United States Samir Sumaid'ie to discuss the latest developments in Iraq and the U.S. involvement in that country. The meeting was a follow up to Sen. Coleman's visit with Dr. Saleh during the Senator's most recent trip to Iraq in April of this year. Sen. Coleman had also met previously with Ambassador Sumaida'ie in March 2007.  
   "My discussions with Dr. Barham have given me great insight into the challenges the Iraqi government faces in making progress toward political reconciliation," said Coleman. "The bottom line is that the Iraqi government needs to take a more responsible role in the security and governance of their country. America's commitment is not open-ended. I have continually stressed the need to establish benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet in order to earn our continued support. Dr. Barham's perspectives have only solidified my view that such benchmarks are essential for advancing our policy in Iraq." 
   The Senator, Dr. Barham and Ambassador Sumaida'ie also discussed the regional conference on Iraq that was held in Egypt earlier this month, as well as current deliberations by the U.S Congress over the future of the U.S involvement in Iraq.
