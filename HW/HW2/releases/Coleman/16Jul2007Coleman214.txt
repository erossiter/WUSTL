"During my visits across Minnesota, I consistently hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a need to improve and expand them in the future. These grants will help ensure the viability of these airports and I applaud the FAA for awarding these funds." 
   Specific funding is as follows: 
   $104,500 for Rushford Municipal to rehabilitate a runway, apron and taxiway, as well as to install airfield guidance signs and update the airport master plan study 
   $156,750 for Quentin Aanenson Field in Luverne to for the design to construct a new runway 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports.
