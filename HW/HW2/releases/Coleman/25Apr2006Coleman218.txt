SEN. COLEMAN ENCOURAGES CONSTITUENTS TO REPORT SUSPECTED PRICE GOUGING
  In wake of rising gasoline prices across Minnesota and the nation, Sen. Norm Coleman today encouraged his constituents to take advantage of the U.S. Department of Energy website established for citizens to report any suspected instances of price gouging or price fixing. The website, http://gaswatch.energy.gov, exists for citizens to report any suspicious activities in terms of gasoline pricing at their local gas stations, with the complaints being registered for investigation where appropriate.  
   "Anyone filling up at the pump lately understands skyrocketing gasoline costs are affecting working families in Minnesota and across the nation," said Coleman. "And while many factors - such as torrid global demand and rapidly growing economies in places like China and India - are helping push prices upward, we need to ensure companies are not taking advantage of their consumers. To that end, I am reminding and encouraging anyone who suspects price gouging is occurring to take advantage of the Department of Energy website in place to investigate potential cases of price manipulation. While most local businesses are run by honest folks, we need to ensure consumers are not being exploited during this gasoline crunch - this website is a great tool for exposing such wrongdoing." 
   In addition to the website, consumers who do not have access to the Internet can report suspected cases by calling 1-800-244-3301. Last year, nearly 35,000 people reported complaints of price manipulation to the Department of Energy via the website and telephone hotline. Each complaint registered is collected and transmitted to the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual State Attorneys General for investigation and prosecution when deemed appropriate.
