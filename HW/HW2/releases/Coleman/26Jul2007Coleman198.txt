SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $105,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE CITY OF SUNBURG
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Sunburg has been awarded a loan of $85,000 and a grant of $20,000 from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will be used to help purchase a replacement ambulance for the city.  
   "I applaud USDA Rural Development for providing this important funding to the City of Sunburg," Coleman said. "We all depend on first responders to come to our aid in life threatening situations, and it is crucial that they have the best resources available. This funding will help in the purchase of a new ambulance for the community, which will improve the safety and quality of life for area residents." 
   "We are very pleased that the USDA chose to award us this funding," said Sunburg Mayor Jim Feldman. "It is very much appreciated by the city council and the seven townships we serve. The USDA was very helpful throughout the process of purchasing our new ambulance, which we should obtain in February of next year." 
   USDA Rural Development provides funding to rural communities for housing, clean water, hospitals, community centers, first responder needs, and business and economic development, as well as other essential community infrastructure.
