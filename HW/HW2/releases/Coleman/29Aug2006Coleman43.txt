SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON USDA DROUGHT FUNDING
  I appreciate the Secretary's announcement today that USDA will provide some assistance to American farm and ranch families continuing to struggle from drought. However, I know from my visits to farms across Minnesota that we need to go much, much further to provide the level of drought assistance that is so desperately needed right now in farm country. Unless and until that happens, I see no alternative but to continue to press for emergency legislation in Congress that meets this crisis head on.
