SEN. COLEMAN STAFF TO DISCUSS LOCAL CONCERNS IN METRO AREA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that Andy Burmeister, regional representative for Coleman's St. Paul Office, will be visiting six communities in the metro area on Tuesday, June 14th, 2005, to meet with local mayors and officials in an introductory meeting to familiarize the Senator on local issues. This tour is part of the Senator's goal of visiting each community across Minnesota.  
   "As a former mayor, I know the importance of reaching out to local communities and officials who lead the charge in the growth and development of our state's urban communities," Coleman said. "I know that the Metro Area is facing important local issues. I'm delighted to have Andy out in the field so he can address these notable concerns." 
   "I look forward to going out and meeting members of the local community," Burmeister said. "It's important to know the needs of Minnesota's communities and the best way to do this is to meet face to face with city officials. I am privileged to visit each community's official(s) on the Senator's behalf." 
   Burmeister's visit will include stops in Dayton, Hanover, Corcoran, Loretto, Maple Plain, and Long Lak.
