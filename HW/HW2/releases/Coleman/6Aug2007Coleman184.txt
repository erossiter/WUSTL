SEN. COLEMAN TO ATTEND FARMFEST, VISIT SOUTHWESTERN MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES AUG. 7-9
  Senator Norm Coleman will visit the southwestern Minnesota communities of Glencoe, New Auburn, St. James, Jeffers, Slayton, Marshall, Tyler, Granite Falls, Montevideo, Dawson, Ortonville and Browns Valley during a visit to the region from Tuesday, August 7th through Thursday, August 9th. During the visit, Coleman will also participate in a Farm Bill discussion panel at Farmfest near Redwood Falls and a take a crop tour in Nicollet County. 
   "I am looking forward to visiting these communities in Southwest Minnesota," said Coleman. "On issues ranging from renewable energy to rural healthcare to the upcoming Farm Bill, my visits to these counties has always proven immensely valuable to me. With Congress in recess for the month of August, I fully intend to use my time speaking to constituents across the state so I can effectively address their concerns in Washington."  
   The trip will conclude with a Thursday afternoon stop in Browns Valley, a community recovering from spring flooding that Coleman has worked to provide federal assistance to this year. 
   "As we work to recover in the Twin Cities from the 35W bridge tragedy, we must also remember the rural communities who are still recovering from natural disasters that also scar our landscape," Coleman added.
