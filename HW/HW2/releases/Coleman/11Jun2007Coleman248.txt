SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SACRIFICE OF GEN. PAO ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS DURING VIETNAM WAR
  "The courage and sacrifice of Gen. Vang Pao on behalf of American soldiers during the Vietnam War is legendary. The general has been a well-respected leader in the Hmong community, and like all Americans, is innocent until proven guilty. The senator will continue to monitor this case closely as it moves forward in the judicial system."
