SEN. COLEMAN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO RE-ESTABLISH CAMP RIPLEY AS MOBILIZATION STATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman is working to include provisions in the Defense Authorization Bill that would bring Camp Ripley one step closer to becoming a mobilization station for Minnesota National Guard and Reserve units. Coleman is seeking to get this important provision for Minnesota men and women in uniform added as an amendment to the DOD reauthorization legislation. 
   "I have heard from our Minnesota reservists," Coleman said. "We believe that Camp Ripley has the space and expertise to serve once again as a mobilization station. I am working right now to include a provision that would accomplish our goal added to the Defense Reauthorization bill. Reestablishing a mobilization station at Camp Ripley will be a win for Minnesota and a win for the U.S. Army."
   Coleman's provision would call for a feasibility study within 120 days of passage of the bill to lay out exactly what reestablishing Camp Ripley as a mobilization station would entail.
   Camp Ripley used to be one of 11 mobilization stations across the country, but the decision was made in 1994 to downsize from 11 to four stations. In recent years, however, reservists have been mobilized in unprecedented numbers. Currently, mobilized reservists must train at bases in states such as California and Colorado, where many are housed in temporary overflow facilities. After hearing extensively from reservists during a recent visit to Camp Ripley, Coleman is urging the Army to take another look at the issue.
   "This would be a winning situation for the men and women serving in our Minnesota National Guard and Reserve," Coleman said. "It would allow them to be closer to their families, have better contact with their employers and increase their quality of life. This is the least we can do for Minnesota men and women who are willing to serve."
