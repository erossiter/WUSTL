SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $254,777 FOR ROSEVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Roseville Fire Department has been awarded a $254,777 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase safety equipment for the department's firefighters, specifically Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and Rapid Intervention Team equipment.  
   "Across Minnesota, firefighters put their own safety on the line in order to protect their communities, and it is important that they have the best equipment available," said Coleman. "This grant will ensure the safety of the firefighters in Roseville, which will in turn increase the safety of community residents. I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program and the Roseville Fire Department for their combined efforts in making sure both the firefighter and residents of this community are well-protected." 
   "We are extremely appreciative of Senator Coleman's efforts to make sure these funds are available not only to our fire department, but also to other departments across nation," said Chris Snyder, Deputy Chief of the Roseville Fire Department. "Public safety is the backbone of a community, and we need to protect first responders so they can protect the public. These funds will be used directly to ensure the safety of our firefighters in Roseville." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
