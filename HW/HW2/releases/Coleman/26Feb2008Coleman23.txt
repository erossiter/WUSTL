MINNESOTA AWARDED OVER $2 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER PROGRAM
  Senator Norm Coleman announced today that over $2 million has been awarded to the State of Minnesota through the federal Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program. This funding will support social service agencies in cities and counties across the state to help feed and shelter the hungry and homeless. EFS Program funds are used to supplement food, shelter, rent, mortgage, and utility assistance programs for people with non-disaster related emergencies. 
   "The Emergency Food and Shelter Program has a longstanding history of helping the least fortunate among us," Coleman said. "This funding will directly impact the hungry and homeless across Minnesota, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact of this grant on folks in need."
   In each funded jurisdiction, a local board advertises the availability of the funds, establishes local priorities, selects local non-profit and government agencies to receive supplemental funding, and monitors program compliance.
   The EFS Program has been in existence since 1983 and was authorized under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. With the FY 2008 allocation, more than $3.105 billion in federal aid will have been disbursed through the EFS Program since its inception to communities nationwide, and has accounted for millions of additional meals and nights of shelter to the hungry and homeless most in need across the nation.
