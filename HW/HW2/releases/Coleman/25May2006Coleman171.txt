SENATE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN AMENDMENT DELAYING NEW BORDER TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS, REQUIRING PILOT PROGRAM
  Continuing his efforts to ensure the concerns of border residents and communities are addressed before implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the U.S. Senate passage of his bipartisan amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill that will delay implantation of WHTI until at least June 1st, 2009, while also expanding the types, availability, and affordability of acceptable documents citizens can use as an alternative to the passport. As a whole, the amendment, which was attached to the Immigration Reform Act of 2006, will ensure that the new restrictions are not put into place until it has been certified as ready by the Departments of State and Homeland Security that alternatives to a passport will be available and will not impede cross-borer traffic.  
   "Passage of this amendment is fantastic news for our border residents and communities - in Minnesota and across the nation," said Coleman. "Over the past year, I have worked continuously to ensure the voices of my constituents living along the border are heard in Washington, and this amendment directly addresses their concerns. By delaying implementation of the program, expanding the number of documents acceptable for travel and requiring a pilot program to test new documents and technologies, this amendment will minimize the potential negative impact on the folks who would have been affected the most with this initiative." 
   The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to and from Canada, the Americas, and the Caribbean, to have a passport or other accepted document that establishes the bearer's identity and nationality to enter or re-enter the United States. This is a change from prior travel requirements. The proposed changes were originally scheduled to go into effect by December 31, 2007. Coleman also sponsored an amendment by Senators Stevens and Leahy to extend the implementation date. 
   WHTI AMENDMENT PROVISIONS: 
   * Deadline extension: Extends WHTI deadline to the later of June 1, 2009, or 3 months after the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security can certify documentary alternatives are ready to be used, which ever is later. 
   * Passport Cards: Allows new State Department Passport Cards to be used for all land and sea travel in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda, ensures the passport cards are affordable and widely available, and waives the fee for children under 18. 
   * Driver's License Pilot Program: Creates a voluntary pilot program for states that would like to offer their citizens the option of including citizenship information on a driver's license. 
   * Frequent Travel Programs: Expands frequent traveler programs like NEXUS for people who want to pay more and submit themselves to a background check in exchange for faster processing at the border. 
   * Process for Individuals who Don't Have the New Documents: Requires the Secretary of DHS to set up a 72-hour "day pass" program, or otherwise facilitate people who come to the border without documents. 
   * Travel by Children: Authorizes the Secretary to waive documentary requirements for children traveling in groups of six or more to/from Canada, provided that each child can demonstrate parental consent. 
   * Public Promotion Strategy: Requires an aggressive public education program shall to be conducted to ensure affected parties are made aware of changes in advance of implantation. 
   * Certification: Makes the deadline contingent upon the certification of the following: 
   - PASS cards have been distributed to at least 90 percent of applicants, are turned around in a timely fashion, and have been tested in a pilot. 
   - Border patrol officers are prepared to accept these documentary alternatives to a passport. 
   - US border crossings have been equipped with document readers and technology so that the new requirements will not substantially slow the flow of traffic.
