SENATE PASSES LOBBYING REFORM BILL CONTAINING SEN. COLEMAN COMMISSION TO ASSESS REFORMS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today cast his vote in favor of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006 (S. 2349), which passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 90 - 8. This comprehensive legislation reforms the way Congress interacts with the lobbying community by providing a greater level of transparency and accountability. Included in this bill is an amendment, authored by Coleman and Sen. Ben Nelson (D-NE), to create the Commission to Strengthen Confidence in Congress, which will provide an independent long-term review of the enacted reforms and recommend any additional reforms necessary to help restore public confidence in the legislative process. The bipartisan commission will create a roadmap for the Congress by examining issues such as disclosure, earmarks and travel.  
   "Today, we sent a strong message to the American people that demonstrates our commitment to working in an open and transparent environment; and the creation of a Commission will ensure we implement effective and rational reform for the long-term," said Coleman. "While I strongly support the adoption of the immediate measures to improve transparency contained in this legislation, we still need to take careful stock of what kind of reforms we are proposing. By creating the Commission, we are taking a giant step toward restoring the public's trust in this great institution, and at the same time ensuring the reforms we enact in the future are appropriate and fully address public concerns, rather than change for change's sake." 
   This bill also contains an amendment, proposed by Coleman, to require lobbyists, lobbying firms and organizations that arrange or direct travel for members or staff, to report this activity within 30 days. Current Senate ethics rules require Members and staff to report travel paid for and arranged by outside groups within 30 days of the travel taking place. 
   "From the beginning of this debate, I stressed that a central theme of reform must be transparency, and to that end, I have posted my complete Senate travel records on my website," Coleman added. "I strongly believe that by requiring both Congress and the lobbying community to report all arranged travel in a timely manner, we are a creating a solid foundation on which to rebuild the public's confidence."
