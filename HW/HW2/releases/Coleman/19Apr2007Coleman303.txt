SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $106,001 GRANT FOR ELBOW LAKE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Elbow Lake has been selected to receive a $106,001 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grant will be used to acquire snow removal equipment for Elbow Lake Municipal Airport.  
   "This is good news for the folks in and around Elbow Lake," said Coleman. "This grant will help improve the safety and operability of the airport during the winter months, when it is needed most. Across Greater Minnesota, local airports are a valuable resource for local residents and businesses, and I am pleased the FAA recognizes the importance of the airport in Elbow Lake." 
   The FAA uses the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to provide grants for the planning and development of qualified public-use airports. The grants are awarded to eligible projects that enhance security, capacity, and environmental concerns.
