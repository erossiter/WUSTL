SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON SEN. DAYTON'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION
  "Today we learned that Senator Dayton's time in the Senate will end in January 2007.  
 His term here capstones a proud and lifelong career of public service. 
   I have always been proud of the productive working relationship Senator Dayton and I forged since day one. 
   I also respect the passion with which our senior senator has worked to ensure quality and affordable health care for Minnesota seniors. His commitment to this important cause has been unwavering and should be saluted. 
   Senator Dayton has been good and decent public servant with a big heart for the people of Minnesota. I respect his willingness to serve the state he and I both care about so deeply. I imagine this is a difficult day for my colleague, and I want to wish him and his family the very best."
