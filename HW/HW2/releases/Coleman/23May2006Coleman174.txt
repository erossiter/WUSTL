SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $249,750 FOR GRAND PORTAGE BAND OF CHIPPEWA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Grand Portage Band of Chippewa Indians has received a $249,750 grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Tribal Wildlife Grant Program. The grant, which is part of nearly $8 million in recently awarded grants across the nation, will be used for a wildlife conservation study looking at the area's local wolf pack size and density, and the resulting effects on local prey such as deer and moose.  
   "I am pleased the Grand Portage Band has been selected for this funding," said Coleman. "Across Minnesota, and specifically on tribal lands, wildlife is an important part of people's lives. This grant will go a long way towards ensuring the vitality of wildlife for the folks on the Grand Portage Reservation and I applaud the Fish and Wildlife Service for awarding this grant." 
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently awarded a total of nearly $8 million to help federally recognized tribes conserve fish and wildlife on their lands. The Service's Midwest Region - which includes Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin - received five grants totaling nearly $780,00 for wildlife projects, including two in Minnesota, two in Wisconsin and one in Michigan.
