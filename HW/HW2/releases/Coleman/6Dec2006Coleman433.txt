SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $56,406 FOR DEXTER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Dexter Volunteer Fire Department has received a $56,406 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The funding is expected to be used in the purchase of a thermal imaging camera, as well as new gear for the department's firefighters.  
   "Across Minnesota, local firefighters put their own safety on the line to protect their neighbors, and they deserve the best resources available," said Coleman. "This funding will help improve the resources for firefighters in Dexter, which will in turn benefit the local residents they serve. I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program for awarding this grant." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
