SENS. COLEMAN, DAYTON COMMEND MINNESOTA-BASED AMERICAN REFUGEE COMMITTEE'S 25 YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED SERVICE
  Sens. Norm Coleman and Mark Dayton joined today in praising the important humanitarian work which the American Refugee Committee (ARC) has accomplished for the last 25 years.  
 Dayton and Coleman are honorary sponsors of a reception and photography exhibit honoring the organization in Washington this evening. Coleman is attending a funeral in Minnesota this evening and unfortunately will not be able to attend the event. 
   "The ARC does great work and I am proud that this fine organization calls Minnesota home," Coleman said. "The work of ARC knows no boundaries or borders. This organization works to protect innocent civilians caught in the periphery of battle, such as in the Darfur region of Sudan. This is noble work indeed, and I am proud to be a sponsor of tonight's event." 
   "As a former American Refugee Committee board member, I know firsthand about the commendable work ARC has been engaged in for 25 years," said Dayton. "They have helped more than one million victims of war and civil conflict around the world to rebuild their lives by supplying them with medical care, legal assistance, counseling, and many other humane services. I am honored that ARC calls Minnesota its home. ARC has represented the people of Minnesota with great honor for the last quarter century." 
   The American Refugee Committee (ARC) is an international nonprofit, nonsectarian organization providing humanitarian assistance and training to more than one million people in 12 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. ARC works for the survival, health, and well-being of people caught in the crossfire of war or civil conflict. For more information on the organization please visit www.archq.org.
