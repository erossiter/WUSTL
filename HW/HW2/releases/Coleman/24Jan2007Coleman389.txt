SEN. COLEMAN'S SPOKESMAN COMMENTS ON FALSE DFL PARTY PRESS RELEASE
  Sen. Norm Coleman's Communications Director, Tom Steward, issued the following statement today in response to a false press release issued by the Minnesota DFL party that lied about Coleman's vote on the minimum wage bill before the Senate today:  
   "It is a true disservice to the people of Minnesota that the state DFL party believes partisan attacks are more important than the facts. Despite the false claims in their press release today, the fact is that Senator Coleman voted in favor of moving forward on the minimum wage bill before the Senate today. In fact, Senator Coleman has voted in favor of a minimum wage increase on six previous occasions since taking office. If DFL Chairman Brian Melendez truly wants to 'put partisanship aside' as he says, he may want to start by checking the Congressional record before creating his own reality."
