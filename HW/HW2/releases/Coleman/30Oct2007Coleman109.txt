SEN. COLEMAN TOUTS CONSERVATION FUNDING IN SENATE FARM BILL AS VICTORY FOR MINNESOTA
  After working for a strong conservation title in the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007, known as the Farm Bill, Senator Coleman joined his colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee in passing a bipartisan bill that extends key conservation programs and increases conservation funding, making the bill the largest conservation funding investment to date. Specifically, the bill increases funding for major programs such as the Wetland Reserve Program, the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Grassland Reserve Program, as well as protecting the 39.2 million acres allotted for the Conservation Reserve Program. Meanwhile, this package includes an Open Fields initiative, a voluntary program to encourage property owners to allow public access for hunting and fishing, which Coleman has co-sponsored. All in all, the bill increases conservation funding by over $4 billion above the current budget baseline.  
   "In Minnesota, where our economy and heritage are tied directly to the outdoors, folks are well aware that conservation is critical to maintaining our quality of life for future generations," Coleman said. "Whether you like to spend the spring in a fishing boat, the summer in a campground, or the fall in a hunting blind, conservation efforts have a direct impact on the activities of millions of Minnesotans. Additionally, this year's Farm Bill will mean increased wildlife habitat, cleaner water and a healthier environment for all of us." 
   The Farm Bill, which authorizes federal agriculture, nutrition, conservation and rural development programs, now awaits action by the full Senate. Once approved by the Senate, it will go to a conference committee with the House, before ultimately being sent to President Bush for passage into law. 
   Highlights of the Senate bill's conservation title include: 
   * Conservation Reserve Program - Reauthorized at current acreage cap of 39.2 million acres. 
   * Wetlands Reserve Program - Reauthorized and funded at $1.9 billion above current levels, allowing enrollment of 250,000 acres per year. 
   * Open Fields - Includes the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentives Program, which creates a new $20 million grants program to encourage owners and operators of private lands to allow public access for wildlife-dependent recreation, including hunting and fishing. 
   * Comprehensive Stewardship Program - Reauthorized with an additional $1.28 billion in spending over 10 years to allow enrollment of an additional 80 million acres over the next five years. 
   * Grassland Reserve Program - Reauthorized and increased to a funding level of $234 million. 
   * Environmental Quality Incentives Program - Reauthorized and fully funded at current levels. 
   "The conservation title in the Farm Bill is the most influential piece of conservation legislation this Congress will undertake," Coleman added. "I am encouraged by the product we have so far, but there is still much work to be done before the final bill reaches the President's desk." 
   The Farm Bill reauthorizes and funds dozens of additional conservation measures. For a complete breakdown of the Senate bill, please visit www.agriculture.senate.gov.
