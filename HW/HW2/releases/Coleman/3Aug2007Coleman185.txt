SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $4,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CITY OF BROWNS VALLEY
  Senator Norm Coleman, who plans to visit Browns Valley next week, announced today the community has been awarded a grant of $4,000 from United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will be used to help purchase a severe storm warning siren.  
   "The last thing residents of Browns Valley need to worry about as they continue to recover from this spring's flooding is about another disaster," Coleman said. "This grant will help protect the citizens of Browns Valley from future severe weather like tornadoes by aiding in the purchase of a warning siren in the city. I am pleased USDA Rural Developments has awarded the City of Browns Valley this funding." 
   "With all the stuff that comes up and the extra things that need to be done for our community, the costs can become overwhelming," Browns Valley City Clerk Linda Schwagel said. "Every little bit that we receive from agencies or contributions allows us to continue serving our residents. This funding will help us immensely in any type of disaster situation. The ability to purchase this siren is particularly important for our city because we are located in a tornado area. Our old siren didn't reach every citizen in our community. The funding allocated by the USDA will improve our community, prevent future disasters, and, most importantly, protect our citizens. The city is greatly appreciative of the USDA's staff and representatives and our legislators for all their help." 
   USDA Rural Development provides funding to rural communities for housing, clean water, hospitals, community centers, first responder needs, business and economic development. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion in rural Minnesota for a variety of economic development and infrastructure projects.
