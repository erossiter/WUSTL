SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $300,000 GRANT FOR TWIN CITIES RISE!
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Twin Cities Rise!, a metro area-based job-training organization, has been awarded a $300,000 grant from the United States Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The organization, which seeks to provide employers with skilled workers through specific training programs, will use the grant to provide job training for low-income individuals who have been incarcerated or are at risk of gang involvement. Coleman advocated on behalf of Twin Cities Rise! for the grant, including arranging a meeting between them and the Department of Labor to discuss the project goals.  
   "Since my days as mayor of St. Paul, I have been supportive of the work being done by the folks at Twin Cities Rise!," said Coleman. "This organization has done amazing things to help provide job opportunities for low-income Minnesotans, particularly those who have faced significant personal challenges or made mistakes in the past. By providing the training and incentive to find steady, good-paying jobs, Twin Cities Rise! has helped empower many Minnesotans who need it most. Secretary Chao personally called me earlier this week to give me the good news about this grant, and I am thrilled they have received this award." 
   "We thank Senator Coleman for his terrific effort on behalf of Twin Cities Rise!," said Steve Rothschild, Chairman of Twin Cities Rise!. "This funding will make a real difference in helping us assist more poor Minnesotans and their families on the road to economic self sufficiency." 
   Specifically, Twin Cities Rise! will use the grant to pursue job training efforts directed at low-income, ex-offenders and individuals who are at risk of court or gang involvement. They will test a performance-based program that offers personal one-on-one empowerment coaching, as well as academic and vocational training in writing, applied math, computer applications and more. Incarcerated participants will receive pre- and post-release transitional services. 
   Specific project outcomes include: 
   * Serve 250 incarcerated individuals from the Minnesota Correctional Facility - Faribault and Ramsey County Correctional Facility, providing ten weeks of empowerment training, a component of the core program. 
   * Reduce recidivism rate by 10 percent. 
   * Released individuals who complete the core program, and receive the pre- and post-release transitional services will obtain jobs and retain their jobs for at least one year.
