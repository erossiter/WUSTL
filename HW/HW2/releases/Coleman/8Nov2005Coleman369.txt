SEN. COLEMAN AMENDMENT TO BOLSTER AMERICA'S FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILLS
  Sen. Norm Coleman yesterday was successful in attaching an amendment to the FY06 National Defense Authorization bill to improve America's ability to communicate with the world.  
 The Minnesota Senator's amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to develop incentives for our nation's Military Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) students to study a foreign language, placing a special emphasis on Arabic and Chinese. This amendment will also encourage cadets to recruit foreign language students to participate in ROTC. 
   "America has a strategic interest in being able to communicate our message in key languages, such as Arabic and Chinese," said Coleman. "In today's world, we have to respond to new threats in new ways. Our military's strength resides in more than just firepower, as new challenges have shown. We need to strengthen our foreign language skills in the gathering of intelligence." 
   Overall foreign language enrollment in the US has fallen from 16 percent of American students in 1960 to just eight percent in 2002. Statistics from 2002 indicate that only about 10,000 Americans are studying Arabic, and fewer than 40,000 Americans are studying Chinese, a language spoken by one fifth of the world's population in a country that is increasingly on the global stage. 
   "The 9/11 report found an inadequate number of Arabic speakers in American intelligence agencies," said Coleman. "This amendment's focus on ROTC students will result in a more capable US military officer corps, and in the end, be part of a greater emphasis on Americans speaking a foreign language."
