SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $135,000 FOR THE CITY OF GREENBUSH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the City of Greenbush has received a $135,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. This rural development grant will be used to establish a revolving loan fund to finance small and emerging private business enterprises in the area.  
   "I am excited to announce the City of Greenbush has received this funding," said Coleman. "This grant will provide the city with a chance to assist local business growth - often a significant challenge in Greater Minnesota. The best engine for economic growth and prosperity, both on an individual level and as a community, is small business growth, and I am pleased USDA has awarded a grant to help invest in that engine for the residents in and around Greenbush." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
