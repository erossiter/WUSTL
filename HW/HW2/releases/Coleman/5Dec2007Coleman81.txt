SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PLANNED MORTAGE RATE FREEZE
  "While I have not seen the details, I am very encouraged by the Administration's plan to provide critically-needed assistance for those homeowners at risk of foreclosure as their mortgage interest rates reset in the months ahead. I've seen and heard repeatedly about the widespread effects that these foreclosures are already having on everyone from the individual homeowner to the real estate agent to the construction worker. Foreclosures are a lose-lose proposition for homeowners, lenders and communities, and this plan should help limit the economic and personal tolls inflicted by foreclosures."
