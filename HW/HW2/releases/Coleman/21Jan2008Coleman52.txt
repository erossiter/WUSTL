SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT IN CELEBRATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY
  "We celebrate this day commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr. for his leadership during the Civil Rights movement, his dedication to our country, and his contribution to humanity. Dr. King's vision for America serves as a testament to his dedication to bring fulfillment to those "self-evident truths" that Thomas Jefferson wrote of almost two centuries earlier. While we take this day to celebrate his life, we should also take this opportunity to renew Dr. King's commitment to equality and justice for all, and see to it that the opportunity for "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is preserved for every American."
