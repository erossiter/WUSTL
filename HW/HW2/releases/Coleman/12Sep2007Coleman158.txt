SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GRANTING OF DEFERRED ENFORCED DEPARTURE TO LIBERIANS
  Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement regarding today's granting of Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians currently in the United States:  
   "I am pleased with today's decision to grant Deferred Enforced Departure to Liberians currently in the living in the United States, which will essentially extend an additional 18 months of residence and work authorization to Liberians currently in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status. With Liberia still struggling to rebuild and stabilize following years of civil strife, the country is simply not ready to absorb these people yet. Today's decision will provide 18 months of certainty for Liberians whose status was set to expire at the end of this month. It will also buy time for policymakers to find a more permanent solution for these important members of our community."
