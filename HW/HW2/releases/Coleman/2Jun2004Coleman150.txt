SENATE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN COAUTHORED AMENDMENT TO DEFENSE REAUTHORIZATION EXPANDING HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR GUARD, RESERVES
  The United States Senate passed an amendment coauthored by Sen.  
 Norm Coleman and authored by Sens. Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to the Department of Defense Reauthorization legislation that would expand TRICARE eligibility to members of the National Guard and Army Reserve while they are on inactive status, expand coverage to the member's family, and give certain service members the option of having the Defense Department pay their premiums on civilian health plans while they are called to active duty. The amendment passed by a vote of 70 to 25.
   "The men and women that have served our country so admirably in the National Guard and Army Reserve deserve basic healthcare coverage on or off active duty," Coleman said. "And their families that have often had to go months without seeing their loved one in service deserve the same. This amendment would make that a reality."
   TRICARE is the health plan for all uniformed service members and is the best and most comprehensive military healthcare program in the world.
   "I have heard firsthand from Minnesota members of the guard and reserve that this is also a morale and recruitment issue," Coleman said. "We ask a lot of the men and women in uniform that defend freedom, and the very least we can do is provide the basic healthcare coverage they deserve."
