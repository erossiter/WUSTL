SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE DEPARTMENT AID EFFORT TO SOMALIA
  "I applaud Secretary Rice's announcement of an aggressive humanitarian aid effort by the State Department for the war-torn people of Somalia. I have long conveyed the need for a clear, proactive U.S. policy toward Somalia - one that will help support the establishment of a peaceful, democratic and functional Somali government. Over a decade of wars, droughts and floods have devastated the people of Somalia, and it is imperative that we support those people in Somalia who desire a nation that protects human rights and prevents terrorists from gaining a foothold in this vital corner of the world."
