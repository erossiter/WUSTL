SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  The cloud of suspicion continues to hover over the Attorney General's office surrounding the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys. This political debate distracts from the important work that must be done at the Justice Department. I believe Attorney General Gonzales is unable to provide the type of leadership needed to effectively run the Department. The Department needs new leadership. Sadly, the reputation of Minnesota's former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger has been dragged into this situation. Tom is a first-class prosecutor and Minnesota is grateful for his service. I consider him to be a good friend and an outstanding public servant. I have spoken to Tom many times, and he has assured me that he left of his own accord. Nevertheless, it is disturbing that he was ever targeted for possible dismissal.
