SEN. COLEMAN SAYS TAX CUTS PAYING OFF AS OMB PROJECTS DECLINE IN BUDGET DEFICIT
  Citing the Republican pro-growth policies implemented in 2003, Sen. Norm Coleman today touted the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mid-session budget review which projects a 30 percent decline in the deficit from the initial OMB estimate issued in February this year. According to OMB, this year's budget deficit is now projected to come slightly under $300 billion as opposed to the initial estimate of $423 billion.  
   "Thanks to a resurgent economy which has generated record tax revenues and improving fiscal restraint, we are well on our way to meeting the President's goal of reducing the deficit in half by 2009 and perhaps even earlier," said Senator Coleman. "Going forward we need to be fiscally disciplined while at same time keeping in place the successful pro-growth policies that have spurred the current economic expansion and resulting surge in tax revenues." 
   Since taking office, Senator Coleman has been a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility. Last year, he voted in favor of the Deficit Reduction Act to reduce spending by $39 billion over five years and $100 billion over 10 years and supported line-item veto authority for the President. Also, as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Coleman has investigated and identified over $11 billion in waste, fraud and abuse. 
   "Despite the good news, I have serious concerns over the level of federal spending in Washington," Coleman added. "The war on terror and last year's Gulf Coast hurricanes have presented serious challenges for all of us. Mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security are claiming an ever larger share of spending, and we need to look at ways to address these programs."
