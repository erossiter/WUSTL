SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO, JR.
  Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. today was nominated by President Bush to serve as Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 I am encouraged by the wealth of judicial experience and dedicated public service Judge Alito brings to the table. During his nearly 30 years of public service, Judge Alito has served with distinction on the third Circuit Court of Appeals for 15 years, and worked as Assistant to the Solicitor General and U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, earning a reputation as a litigator who has worked for justice and equality, as well as a fair-minded judge who is committed to the rule of law. Judge Alito's outstanding qualifications appear to meet the standard of excellence for Supreme Court nominees, and I look forward to a careful review of the nominee's credentials so that we may have a full, working bench as soon as possible. Now is the time to focus on Judge Alito's qualifications and set aside partisan politics so that we may have a fair and dignified confirmation process, ending in a timely up-or-down vote.
