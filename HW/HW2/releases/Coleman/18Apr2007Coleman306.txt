SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN RULING
  Sen. Norm Coleman statement on partial birth abortion ban ruling: 
   "Today's decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the ban on partial birth abortion that we passed in 2003 is a historic victory for the majority of Americans who view this procedure as inhumane and contradictory to our core values. This ruling is a reminder that, even in the face of challenges and setbacks, we must never give up the fight to defend the defenseless among us. The millions of Americans who never gave up hope should feel proud today, as we have taken a significant step to reclaiming the culture of life that defines us as a nation."
