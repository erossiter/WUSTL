SENS. DAYTON, COLEMAN, REP. GUTKNECHT EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR DISASTER DECLARATION FOR SOUTHERN MINNESOTA COUNTIES DEVESTATED BY RECENT FLOODING
  Sens. Mark Dayton, Norm Coleman, and Rep. Gil Gutknecht expressed their support for a Presidential Disaster Declaration for the Austin area, which has been ravaged by recent flooding.  
 The disaster declaration, requested yesterday by Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, would include Freeborn, Faribault, Mower, Steele and Dodge counties in Southern Minnesota. It is estimated that damages caused by the flooding could exceed $8 million. Sens. Dayton and Coleman, and Rep. Gutknecht made the request to the Under Secretary of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a letter today.
   "I support a disaster declaration for southern Minnesota, thus opening the door for federal assistance which Austin desperately needs," said Dayton. "We need a decision approving this declaration as soon as possible, so that we can deliver relief to the over 2,500 residents and business owners who have been affected by this ravaging flood."
   "I appreciate Governor Pawlenty's disaster declaration request and I'm pleased to team up with Senator Dayton and Congressman Gutknecht in underscoring our strong support of this request," Coleman said. "I am confident FEMA will respond favorably and in a timely fashion to address the needs of the people of Austin."
   "I have seen firsthand the damage caused by these devastating floods," Gutknecht said. "The loss of crops, damage to businesses and homes and infrastructure problems need to be addressed. I am pleased to work with Minnesota's Senators to help expedite this disaster declaration request."
   Preliminary reports indicate that many of the affected residents do not have flood insurance, and will, therefore, depend upon state and federal aid.
