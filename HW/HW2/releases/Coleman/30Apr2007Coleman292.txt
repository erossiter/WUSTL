BIPARTISAN LETTER URGES ENERGY COMMITTEE TO ADOPT DRIVE ACT FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  As part of his ongoing efforts to break America's addiction to foreign oil, Sen. Norm Coleman today with co-authors, Sens. Evan Bayh, Sam Brownback, Joseph Lieberman, and Ken Salazar, sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources urging them to strengthen their Energy Efficiency Promotion Act (S. 1115) by incorporating the Dependence Reduction Through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy (DRIVE) Act. The letter, sent to Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Ranking Member Pete Domenici, requested that Committee members use their upcoming committee mark up of energy legislation to bring S. 1115 up to the DRIVE Act's strong, bold standards. The letter urges inclusion of DRIVE Act provisions that create a mandatory oil savings program, incentivize energy efficient technologies, and promote renewable fuels and E-85 infrastructure. Sen. Coleman is a lead cosponsor of the DRIVE Act.  
   "I was pleased to see that portions of the DRIVE Act were included in Chairman Bingaman's legislation, but we can go further by including all of the DRIVE Act's initiatives," said Coleman. "The threat to our nation caused by foreign oil dependency is real, and we need solution equal to that challenge. The DRIVE Act provides a real blueprint for gaining energy independence by coordinating a government-wide plan to save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2016-the amount we currently import from the Middle East. The DRIVE Act offers an aggressive strategy and real world solutions. We cannot miss an opportunity to move this critical legislation forward." 
   The DRIVE Act's plan to meet its oil savings requirements include provisions to: 
   * Increase availability of home-grown, renewable fuels like ethanol and expand E-85 infrastructure; 
   * Provide tax credits for manufacturers who want to retool their factories to build hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and flex fuel vehicles; 
   * Require federal and state vehicles to cut oil use by 30 percent by 2016 and ensure that 23 percent of their fleets are advanced diesels, hybrids or plug-in hybrids so that government sets an example and spurs the market for energy innovation; and 
   * Lift the per manufacturer cap on consumer tax credits for the purchase of hybrids and advanced diesels so more consumers receive tax incentives to purchase hybrids. 
   "Now is the time to confront our nation's energy dependence directly if we are going to break our addiction to foreign oil," said Coleman. "To that end, we need to make sure that any legislation that we pass contains nothing but the strongest provisions that will help set us on the road to energy independence."
