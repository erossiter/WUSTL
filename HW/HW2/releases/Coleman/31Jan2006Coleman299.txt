SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CORETTA SCOTT KING
  "Coretta Scott King could best be described as a pillar of the civil rights movement.  
 After the passing of her husband, she continued the struggle to see his dreams become reality. She worked tirelessly to keep the ideology of equality for all people at the forefront of the nation's agenda. She pushed for more than a decade to have her husband's birthday observed as a national holiday, then watched with pride in 1983 as President Reagan signed the bill into law. Her bravery and faith will be deeply missed, and we honor her legacy by continuing to work for equality, freedom and justice for all."
