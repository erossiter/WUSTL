SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ABUSES AT ABU GHRAIB PRISON
  "The world has witnessed something that does not represent America's cause for freedom, democracy and liberty.  
 While our American soldiers toil and sacrifice to bring justice and opportunity to Iraq, there is a small group of soldiers who have undermined the work of this mission through their despicable behavior. 
   The violation of the human rights, dignity and life by any member of the American military of any Iraqi prisoner - for whatever reason - violates not only international law, but human decency. 
   I applaud the President's steadfast commitment that such actions are not only atrocious, but violate the very premise of our mission to provide hope, comfort and compassion to the people of Iraq. His immediate recognition of this once informed of these atrocities is indicative, again, of this President's consistent support for the just cause of freedom and liberty for the people of Iraq. 
   I am, however, outraged by the lack of expeditious action on the part of officials at the highest levels of the Pentagon to hold accountable those who perpetrated these horrendous acts. The responsibility to carry out the mission of the United States does not end behind the bars of a prison. I expect, as I believe the American people expect, that those at the highest levels of the Pentagon step forward to take responsibility for these actions so that we can be confident that they will never happen again."
