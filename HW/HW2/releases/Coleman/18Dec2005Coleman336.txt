SEN. COLEMAN SAVES SUGAR FROM BUDGET CUTS
  Late tonight, Sen. Norm Coleman negotiated a deal with Senate Leadership and the White House to remove sugar cuts from the mandatory program budget reconciliation bill.  
 Earlier in the day, an agreement was reached in the Senate-House Conference report that would have levied a forfeiture penalty on sugar producers, one that would have resulted in almost $30 million in cuts to producers in 2006. Sen. Coleman worked with leaders in both the U.S. House and Senate to complete negotiations and reach an agreement saves sugar from cuts in the budget reconciliation package. 
   "I could not stand for a budget reconciliation package that singled out sugar farmers and upset the careful balance between nutrition, conservation, and farm interests achieved in the Senate passed bill, so I refused to support the package advanced by Congressional leadership unless changes were made," said Coleman. "I held out on the report and pledged to continue working to remove the package's cuts to sugar. Sugar producers deserve to be treated fairly - I was not satisfied until the sugar cuts were taken out of the package, which I'm pleased to say this outcome was achieved tonight." 
   After first learning about the final negotiation, Sen. Coleman issued a statement earlier in the day that expressed his disappointment in the cuts to sugar and upsets in balance between nutrition, conservation, and farm interests reached in the previous version of the agriculture budget reconciliation package. Senator Coleman was also successful in restoring the extension of the Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC) through FY2007 and maintaining the levels of funding to food stamps and the Conservation Reserve Program also threatened in the earlier version of the final package.
