SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN MOORHEAD AND THIEF RIVER FALLS
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that local airports in Moorhead and Thief River Falls have been selected to receive federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  
   "Local airports are critical for the economies of their community and the surrounding area," said Coleman. "In Thief River Falls, major Minnesota businesses like Arctic Cat, Digi-Key and others help drive the economy for local residents. Moorhead is a regional economic hub for Northwest Minnesota. Ensuring the safety and viability of each city's local airport is critical, and I am very excited the FAA has recognized their importance by awarding these grants." 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $250,070 for Moorhead Municipal to acquire snow removal equipment, construct a storage building, and update the airport master plan study to include an environmental assessment for a proposed crosswind runway 
   $500,028 for Thief River Falls Regional to acquire snow removal equipment to enhance the safety and operation of the airport during winter months 
   Last month, Sen. Coleman sent a letter to the U.S. Dept. of Transportation requesting that the City of Thief River Falls receive "Essential Air Service" designation., which would ensure continued air service between Thief River Falls Regional Airport and Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. Following reception of the letter, the Department of Transportation announced they would extend service between the cities, with Mesaba Aviation providing 12 one-stop round trips per week to Minneapolis-St. Paul from Thief River Falls from now through June 1, 2009. 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. For more information, please visit http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/airports/aip.
