SEN. COLEMAN COMMENDS SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE PRYOR
  Sen. Norm Coleman joined a majority of the Senate today in voting to confirm Judge William Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals by a vote of 53-45.  
 The confirmation of Judge Pryor follows the confirmation of President Bush's other nominees to the Court of Appeals, Justice Priscilla Owen and Justice Janice Rogers Brown, after a May 24 bipartisan compromise cleared the way for up or down votes on several nominees. 
   "I am pleased my colleagues in the Senate recognized that Judge Pryor is an outstanding judge and confirmed him today," said Coleman. "Judge Pryor enjoyed bipartisan support in Alabama and served them with distinction, and he is well-qualified to serve on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. I was proud to support him in today's vote, and I'm very glad that we've been able to get these outstanding nominees through, as it's the first step in moving our agenda forward in Congress and getting things done back home in Minnesota." 
   Judge Pryor served as the Attorney General of Alabama and was reelected by 59 percent of the vote in 2002. Pryor also taught at the Cumberland School of Law of Stamford University. Pryor began his legal career as a law clerk for Judge Minor Wisdom, who is known for the landmark decision ordering and implementing desegregation after the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. 
   Justice Pricilla Owen was confirmed on May 25, 2005, and Justice Janice Rogers Brown was confirmed yesterday, June 8, 2005.
