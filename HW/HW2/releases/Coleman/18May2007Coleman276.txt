SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN HUTCHINSON AND PAYNESVILLE
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced local airports in Hutchinson and Paynesville have been selected to receive federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grants were awarded for development and improvement of the respective airports.  
   "Local airports are an important part of our state's transportation infrastructure and a source of economic opportunity for rural areas," said Coleman. "During my visits to communities across the state, I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. These grants will help ensure the viability of these airports in Hutchinson and Paynesville, and I applaud the FAA for awarding this funding." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns. 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $28,500 for Hutchinson Municipal-Butler Field to update the airport layout plan for future development 
   $99,750 for Paynesville Municipal to acquire land for development and update the airport layout plan
