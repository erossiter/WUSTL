SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CUBA
  Statement From Sen. Norm Coleman On Cuba: 
   Fidel Castro's failing health creates an unprecedented moment of opportunity that the Cuban people should seize in order to advance the cause of their freedom. The United States, Latin America, and the world must stand in support of Cuban voices for freedom, and make it absolutely clear - to people in Cuba as well as other actors - that the Cuban people deserve a better future than just a transition from one dictator to another. The people of Cuba have been waiting for this moment for over four decades, and I look forward to a time when the U.S. can engage with a democratic Cuba.
