SEN. COLEMAN TO VISIT HALLOCK, WARREN, RED LAKE FALLS, THIEF RIVER FALLS, WARROAD, BAUDETTE, INTERNATIONAL FALLS, GRAND MARAIS ON JULY 2-3
  Sen. Norm Coleman will visit Hallock, Warren, Red Lake Falls, Thief River Falls, Warroad, Baudette, International Falls and Grand Marais next Monday and Tuesday, July 2nd and 3rd. Coleman will visit an area hospital, tour a local college, and meet with county leaders to hear specific local concerns within these communities. Coleman will also stop at the International Falls Border Crossing, as well as view the Ham Lake Fire area and discuss reconstruction efforts. 
   "I am looking forward to visiting this important region of the state," Coleman said. "My visits to communities across the state are immensely valuable to me in order to connect with folks from all over Minnesota and hear firsthand their concerns and ideas. What I learn on these trips helps guide my work in Washington. I hope to address recent changes in passport regulations and discuss the impact these changes will have on our border residents, which is why I look forward to visiting several of our border communities. In addition, I plan to look at the area impacted by the recent forest fire on the Gunflint Trail and discuss reconstruction and long-term impacts of the fire."  
   Coleman's visit to Kittson, Marshall, Red Lake, Pennington, Roseau, Lake of the Woods, Koochiching and Cook counties are part of his efforts to meet with constituents across the state. Last year, Coleman visited all 87 counties and he plans to meet that goal again this year. 
   Coleman will begin Monday's visit with a tour of Kittson Memorial Healthcare Center. He will then have lunch with Marshall County leaders in Warren. From there, Coleman will visit Red Lake Falls, before traveling to Thief River Falls to tour Northland Technical College. Coleman will finish the day by attending the Warroad Area Chamber of Commerce Fish Fry. 
   On Tuesday, Senator Coleman will have coffee with local and county leaders in Baudette. From there, Coleman will tour the Canadian Border Crossing in International Falls. Coleman will join US Forest Service officials in an aerial tour of the Ham Lake Fire area and discuss its impacts at the Gunflint Lodge in on Gunflint Lake.
