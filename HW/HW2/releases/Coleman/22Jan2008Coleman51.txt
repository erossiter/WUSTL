SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HIS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT, BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP TO DISCUSS ECONOMY
  "While the details on a stimulus packaged remain to be worked out, I left today's meeting at the White House strongly encouraged and hopeful that Congress and the President will be able to quickly come to an agreement for the American people on a stimulus package that will help restore confidence in the economy, encourage growth and help those who have been hurt by the economic downturn. These are challenging and difficult economic times that call for the strong bipartisan spirit displayed at the White House today. I commend the President and my colleagues for their bipartisan desire to get a stimulus package done for the American people."
