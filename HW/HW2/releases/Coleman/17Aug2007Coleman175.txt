SEN. COLEMAN REEMPHASIZES NEED TO DO AWAY WITH SANCTUARY CITIES
  In response to the recent murders of three students in Newark, New Jersey, where an illegal immigrant with a criminal history has been charged in the shootings, Senator Norm Coleman has reiterated his call to end the practice of "sanctuary cities." Sanctuary cities, like Newark, are places where local law enforcement is barred from asking people about their immigration status during routine law enforcement operations. As a consequence, these cities are able to evade their legal responsibilities to share such information with federal authorities for further action. Sen. Coleman has previously introduced legislation in the Senate to end the practice of sanctuary cities.  
   "The tragedy in Newark is another tragic example of why we must end the practice of sanctuary cities," Coleman said. "Open lines of communication between local and federal law enforcement officials are absolutely essential in protecting the security and safety of our citizens. Sanctuary cities like Newark hinder that communication and prevent us from identifying criminals before they act. While it may be impossible to know whether or not these criminals could have been caught before committing these heinous murders, we should never take that chance in the first place. This case and the countless other ones like it demonstrate that it is time to get serious about immigration reform and it starts with enforcing immigration laws on every level. These young people's lives must not be lost in vain. It is my hope this terrible tragedy will open the eyes of many people and strengthen the resolve in Washington to end the practice of sanctuary cities - we owe our citizens nothing less."
