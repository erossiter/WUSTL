SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1,800,000 FOR MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP PROJECTS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Hennepin County, the City of Minneapolis, and the Saint Paul Port Authority will receive grants totaling $1,800,000 as part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Brownfields Program.  
   "I am excited to announce the metro area will receive these grants," said Coleman. "Not only will this EPA funding assess and cleanup the most dangerous and afflicted areas of our urban landscapes, but will also establish a more permanent revolving loan fund to sustain assessment and cleanup for years to come. I am pleased Minneapolis, the Saint Paul Port Authority, and Hennepin County have received this funding, and I applaud the Environmental Protection Agency for awarding these grants." 
   Since its inception in 1995, EPA's Brownfields Program has been a proven, results-oriented program that has changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed. EPA's Brownfields Program is designed to empower states, communities, and other stakeholders in economic redevelopment to work together in a timely manner to prevent, assess, and safely clean up, brownfields. 
   It is estimated that there are more than 450,000 brownfields in the U.S. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these properties increases local tax bases, facilitates job growth, utilizes existing infrastructure, takes development pressures off of undeveloped, open land, and both improves and protects the environment. 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   * $1,000,000 for Hennepin County to capitalize a revolving loan fund from which Hennepin County will provide loans and subgrants to support cleanup activities at sites contaminated with petroleum. Grant funds will also be used to establish and market the loan fund, process and execute loans and subgrants, and conduct site-specific community outreach activities. 
   * $400,000 for Minneapolis for two brownfields cleanup grants. Specifically the grants will be used to clean petroleum contamination from the Blanchard Warehouse at 1131 and 1207 2nd Avenue North and the Special School District site #1 at 1001 2nd Avenue North. The funds will also be used for community outreach activities. 
   * $400,000 for the Saint Paul Port Authority to conduct environmental site assessments throughout the community for potential hazardous materials and petroleum cleanup sites. Funds will also be used to prepare response action plans and conduct community involvement activities.
