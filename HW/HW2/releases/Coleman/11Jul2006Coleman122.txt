SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON INDIA TERRORIST ATTACKS
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on India terrorist attacks: 
   "I am outraged by today's terrorist attacks in India. My thoughts are with the people of India during this tragic time. These attacks, which also injured Americans, further demonstrate the resolve we must have to fight and win the global war on terror. Terrorists want to dismantle the foundation of freedom and democracy, and will use every means at their disposal. America and its allies must stand firm in our shared commitment to defeat those who kill innocent people for no better reason than they can. America will stand strong in its support of India and its people and will do all we can to assist the Indian government in its efforts to bring the terrorists who committed these heinous acts to justice."
