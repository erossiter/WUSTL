SEN. COLEMAN: MINNESOTA FARMERS WANT PASSAGE OF FARM BILL
  Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement following the Senate's failure to move the Farm Bill forward via a cloture vote. Senator Coleman voted in favor of the cloture motion, which failed by a vote of 55 to 42.  
   "Minnesota farmers need this farm bill. I've worked hard over the last year on the Agriculture Committee with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to build a strong farm bill for the state, one that strengthens the farmer safety net, lends a helping hand to Americans with food security challenges, makes a bold commitment to rural renewal, and boosts investment in renewable fuels and conservation. I voted to move this bill forward because I want to pass this farm bill as quickly as possible. However, I did so with deep concern about the partisan strategy of Majority Leader Reid, who has not allowed a fair procedure for consideration of this bill. I will continue to work with all my colleagues to pass this farm bill, which is so important to all Americans."
