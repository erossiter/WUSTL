SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $45,000 FOR CITY OF HAMMOND
  Sen. Coleman announced today the City of Hammond will receive a $45,000 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal Grant. The grant will further assist in the construction of a municipal wastewater system for the city.  
   "I am pleased to announce the City of Hammond has received this grant," Coleman said. "From my visits to small towns across the state, I understand the significance of grants like this for local residents, which is why I have pushed for Rural Renaissance legislation that would address rural infrastructure needs. USDA Rural Development continues to fund critical infrastructure projects for our rural communities, and I thank them for recognizing the importance of these grants to the folks in Hammond." 
   USDA Water and Waste Disposal grants aim to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for consumers by developing effective water and wastewater systems. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
