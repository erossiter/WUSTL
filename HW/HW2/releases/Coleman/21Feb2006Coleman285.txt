SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBAI PORTS WORLD SALE
  "I have grave concerns both about the sale of major U.S. ports to a United Arab Emirates company, Dubai Ports World, and the process by which that sale was approved. The sale must be held up so Congress can fully review its national security implications.  
   To that end, I will be holding a hearing on this issue during March and will be issuing a Chairman's letter requesting all documents as it pertains to this transaction. My Subcommittee will review the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) process to ensure the proper practices were followed in this transaction and that the CFIUS process sufficiently addresses the concerns of the global War on Terrorism. Finally, I am disappointed in Secretaries Snow and Chertoff in not engaging in a more transparent and open review in this matter. It should have been painfully obvious that a sale of this type would raise serious concern in Congress and before the American public."
