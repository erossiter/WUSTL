SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $50,350 FOR PARK RAPIDS AIRPORT
  Sen. Coleman announced today that Park Rapids Municipal-Konshok Field Airport has received a $50,350 grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. The grant will be used to acquire snow removal equipment, improve the runway, and update the airport master plan.  
   "I am excited for the folks in and around Park Rapids to receive this grant," said Coleman. "Local airports are an important part of access and development for Greater Minnesota, and this grant will help ensure the local airport will continue to enjoy unimpeded year-round access. I am pleased they have received this funding and applaud the FAA for its role in making sure Park Rapids will continue to benefit from the opportunities afforded by a quality local airport." 
   "Any money we can get helps us maintain the airport and is an asset to the community," said Park Rapids City Administrator Brian Weuve. "We have two thriving businesses out there, Park Rapids Aviation and Park Rapids Avionics, that draw people to the area." 
   Specifically, the FAA funding will be used to purchase equipment for snow removal vital to safe winter operations of the airport, enhance the structural integrity of runway pavement, and make plans for the future development of the airport. 
   The Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds generally are allocated to projects for the improvement of airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental protection.
