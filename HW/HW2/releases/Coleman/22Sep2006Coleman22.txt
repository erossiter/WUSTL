SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $127,615 FOR CHINESE LANGUAGE PROGRAM IN WILLMAR SCHOOLS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Willmar Public School District has been awarded a $127,615 grant from the U.S. Department of Education under the Foreign Language Assistance Program. The grant will be used to establish a Mandarin Chinese foreign language program for the District's 9-12 grade students. The grant covers a period of one year, but is expected to be administered for a total of three years.  
   "China is a rapidly growing world power that will continue to have a major impact on issues from international security to economic growth," said Coleman. "As Chairman of the Senate China Working Group, I take great interest in the future of our relationship with China and I believe the foundation of our relationship is a basic understanding of Chinese language and culture. I applaud the visionary plan of the Willmar School District in implementing this program and congratulate them on receiving this grant. 
   "This is exciting news," said Charly Leuze, Director of the West Central Integration Collaborative and Project Director for the program. "Despite our relatively small size and rural location, we seek to instill a global perspective in our curriculum and to prepare our students to be leaders in an increasingly diverse society". 
   Specifically, the Chinese for Secondary Students program will be available for students in grades 9-12 in the Willmar School District. The program is expected to serve 25 students in the first year and 75 total during the three-year grant period. The program aligns with Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's initiative to build state capacity for Chinese instruction through strong K-12 world language programs.
