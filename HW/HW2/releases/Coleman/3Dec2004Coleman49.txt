SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON OUTGOING HHS SECRETARY THOMPSON
  "I would like to thank my friend Secretary Thompson for his fine service to our great country.  
 While I'm sorry to see him go, he leaves behind a proud record of accomplishment at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Under his direction, HHS has strengthened the nation's preparedness for a bioterrorism attack and substantially increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, I commend Secretary Thompson for his efforts to implement historic legislation to modernize the Medicare program. These are just a sample of the many achievements HHS has seen over the past four years under Secretary Thompson's leadership. He has much to be proud of, including fourteen fine years as the governor of Minnesota's neighbor, Wisconsin. 
   There is no doubt that Secretary Thompson's successor will have large shoes to fill as the agency has never been better prepared to meet its obligation to protect the health of all Americans. Again, I would like to personally thank him for his many contributions."
