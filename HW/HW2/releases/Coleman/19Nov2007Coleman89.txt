SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PAULOSE RESIGNATION
  "I support Rachel Paulose's decision today to step down from her duties as Minnesota's U.S. Attorney. I have made it clear that I have had concerns about the office of the U.S. Attorney under her watch, and I believe this decision will allow the office to move forward. On behalf of all Minnesotans, I thank her for her efforts and wish her the best in her new duties. Going forward, I intend to work closely with Attorney General Mukasey to ensure that the next U.S. Attorney for Minnesota best represents the interests of Minnesota. It is equally important for Attorney General Mukasey to make the necessary department-wide changes including strengthening human resource management, engaging in active oversight and conducting the training needed from the moment concerns of this nature are raised."
