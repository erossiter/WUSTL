SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES OVER $3.5 MILLION IN USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR LEECH LAKE BAND OF OJIBWE
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe will receive over $3.5 million in water and waste disposal funding to upgrade the community's water systems.  
   United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development will provide a loan of $1.4 million and two grants totaling $2.2 million to construct a water system that will incorporate the local assorted water systems into one unified waterworks that will serve the entire community. 
   "I have long been saying that the federal government needs to be making a greater investment in enhancing rural America and Minnesota's basic infrastructure needs," Coleman said. "This grant represents a move in the right direction, but we need to do even more. That is why I have introduced my Rural Renaissance legislation, $50 billion in federal grants aimed at revitalizing America's rural economy." 
   USDA Rural Development's water and waste disposal program is part of President Bush's efforts to spur economic development in rural areas of America.
