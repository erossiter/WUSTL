SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES YOUTH EXCHANGE SUPPORT ACT OF 2007
  In an effort to encourage more Americans to bring foreign students into their homes and communities, Senators Norm Coleman (R-MN) and Tim Johnson (D-SD) today introduced legislation increasing the tax credit for families hosting foreign exchange students. The legislation, titled the Youth Exchange Support Act of 2007, represents a bipartisan effort to interest more families in opening their homes to foreign exchange students, and better compensate those who do so.  
   "Study abroad programs allow students to understand foreign cultures much better than they ever could out of a text book," said Coleman. "Exchange students enrich families, schools, communities and our international relations by introducing American students to their peers from all over the world. The tax credit this bill provides will help American host families, as well as encourage more families to consider hosting foreign students." 
   "Families who open their homes to exchange students show the best of America to people who otherwise wouldn't get to see our country first hand," said Johnson. "This legislation will help make the process more affordable for those willing to show such hospitality, instead of financially strapping families for being so generous." 
   The Youth Exchange Support Act of 2007 will increase tax credit for families who host high school foreign exchange students from $50 per month to $200 per month. It is supported by the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET) as well as Nacel Open Door - a St. Paul based nonprofit organization dedicated to international understanding and language education. 
   Minnesota ranks fifth in the nation for hosting high school exchange students, with over 1,400 exchange students. This legislation will help all the Minnesota families who have opened their homes and their communities to foreign exchange students.
