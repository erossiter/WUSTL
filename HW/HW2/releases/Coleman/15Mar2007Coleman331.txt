SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO FIGHT CHILDHOOD CANCER
  Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced legislation to encourage the expansion of research programs aimed at preventing childhood cancer. Similar to legislation Coleman introduced last year, the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2007 would provide $30 million over 5 years to expand biomedical research, create a national database to evaluate cancer trends and provide resources to patients and families affected by childhood cancer. Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) is a co-sponsor of the bill.  
   "Childhood cancer has tragically claimed far too many lives, but I believe there still is hope," said Coleman. "Childhood cancer is a unique condition. Although we're finally making progress on increasing survivorship, we're finding that there are unique health issues faced by survivors throughout their lifetime. This legislation helps ensure that researchers, physicians and families have the tools they need to confront this disease. By working together, we can hopefully get that much closer to finding a cure to this terrible disease." 
   Cancer is the number one disease killer of children and more than 12,000 are diagnosed with cancer each year. Sadly, cancer is expected to claim the lives of 2,000 of these children every year. 
   "Behind the numbers and statistics are the stories of the brave children and families who are facing this fight head on, day after day," said Coleman. "Fighting this disease is and must continue to be a national priority, and this legislation will help us move forward with a comprehensive approach to preventing childhood cancer and finding a cure." 
   Specifically, the legislation will allocate $30 million over five years to: 
   * Provide funding for critical biomedical research programs conducted by the Children's Oncology Group aimed at curing and preventing childhood cancer and improving the lives of children with pediatric cancers; 
   * Support a national childhood cancer database to monitor the incidence of pediatric cancers, identify cancer causes and aid in the development of prevention strategies and cures; 
   * Foster clinical and translational research for pediatric oncologists especially in the early stages of their career development; and 
   * Provide informational and educational services to patients and families affected by childhood cancer to help ensure access to the best available therapies for pediatric cancers.
