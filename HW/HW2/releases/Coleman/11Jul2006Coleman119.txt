SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON USDA SUGAR-TO-ETHANOL STUDY
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on USDA sugar-to-ethanol study: 
   America must look toward renewable fuels as an answer to our dependence on foreign oil. I am pleased that the USDA study released today recognizes sugar-to-ethanol has the potential to play a vital role in that solution. A robust sugar-to-ethanol industry in the U.S. will require the same type of leadership and long-term commitment we have seen in Brazil, which no longer has a need for foreign oil. This study states producing ethanol from sugar is profitable at current prices, indicating a properly designed policy could serve as a complement, not a substitute to the Farm Bill's existing sugar program.
