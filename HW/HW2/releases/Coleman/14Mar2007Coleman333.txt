SEN. COLEMAN BILL WILL EXTEND BIODIESEL TAX CREDIT
  Continuing his efforts to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, Sen. Norm Coleman today joined Sen. Blanche Lincoln in introducing legislation to extend the Biodiesel Tax Credit to December 31, 2017. The current tax credit, which is set to expire on December 31, 2008, provides a $1.00 subsidy for every gallon of agri-biodiesel-which can be made from substances such as virgin vegetable oil and animal fat-that is blended with petroleum diesel. Minnesota produces over 63 million gallons of biodiesel annually.  
   "Biodiesel is central to our efforts to free America from our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. By passing the long-term extension of the biodiesel tax credit contained in this bill, we can help ensure that production of this critical renewable fuel continues to grow," said Coleman. "In Minnesota, the only state in the nation with a two percent biodiesel standard, we know that renewable fuels mean cleaner air and water, lower prices at the pump, and more jobs. With three biodiesel plants on line in Minnesota, we need to give biodiesel producers certainty with these tax credits in order to build upon the progress we are making." 
   According to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB), biodiesel is nontoxic, biodegradable, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. In addition, it works in any diesel engine with few or no modifications and offers similar fuel economy, horsepower, and torque, but with superior lubricity and important emission improvements over petroleum diesel. U.S. biodiesel production has shown strong growth in recent years, increasing from under 1 million gallons in 1999 to an estimated 200 million gallons in 2006.
