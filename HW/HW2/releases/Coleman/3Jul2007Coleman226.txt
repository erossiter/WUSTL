SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SCOOTER LIBBY SENTENCE COMMUTATION
  Statement From Sen. Norm Coleman On Scooter Libby Sentence Commutation: 
   Scooter Libby was found to have lied and misled investigators. The President's action does not-nor should it-excuse those actions. As a former prosecutor, I believe the punishment should fit the crime. Personally, I believe that the punishment for this albeit serious crime was overly punitive and that commuting Libby's sentence was the fair thing to do. These are highly partisan times, and the President's actions will be seen in that context and we need to move beyond that. Given the President's decision on commuting Mr. Libby's prison sentence, but not his fines or his conviction, I urge there be no further consideration or discussion of a presidential pardon.
