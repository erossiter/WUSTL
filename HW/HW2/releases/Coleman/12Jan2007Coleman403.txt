SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $133,617 FOR MENDOTA HEIGHTS FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Mendota Heights Fire Department has received a $133,617 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant, which Coleman provided a letter of support for in April of 2006, will be used to purchase Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment for the department's firefighters.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program has awarded this important funding to the Mendota Heights Fire Department," said Coleman. "Local first responders are the first line of safety for their communities and they deserve the best resources available. I was happy to lend my support to this grant application in order to help protect the firefighters of Mendota Heights" 
   "I want to say thank you to the federal government for its assistance in helping in the purchase of this equipment that allows our firefighters to be safe," said John Maczko of the Mendota Heights Fire Department. "The SCBA equipment allows the firefighters to bring in their own oxygen to a hazardous area such as a smoke filled building. It also has a system for firefighter accountability which helps in tracking the firefighters in the event of an emergency." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
