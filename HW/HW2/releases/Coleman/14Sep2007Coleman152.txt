SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $700,000 FOR CONSTRUCTION OF RURAL CLINIC
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Tri-County Hospital, Inc. will receive $700,000 in federal funding from the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development Program. The funding, which includes a $500,000 loan and a $200,000 loan, will fund the construction of a new health clinic in Bertha, Minnesota.  
   "The critical need to maintain access to quality and affordable healthcare in rural communities is one of the most pressing issues Minnesota currently faces," said Coleman. "The Tri-County Hospital clinic that is under construction will help meet the needs of residents of Bertha and the surrounding area by providing access to first rate health care close to home. I have worked long and hard to maintain access and affordability to quality health care in greater Minnesota and I am thrilled that USDA Rural Development recognized the need for this clinic by providing this critical funding." 
   Throughout his tenure as Minnesota's Senator, Coleman has been a leader in maintaining and improving rural healthcare. Earlier this year, Coleman unveiled his comprehensive rural health legislative agenda which, emphasizes the need for improved mental health services in rural communities, the expansion of remote monitoring to make the most advanced healthcare more accessible, the need for long-term sustainability of Critical Access Hospitals (CAH), the rehabilitation of dilapidated CAH buildings, and the need to enable rural hospitals to better compete for funding to modernize their health information technology systems.
