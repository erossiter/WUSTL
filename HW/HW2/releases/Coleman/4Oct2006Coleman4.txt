SEN. COLEMAN TO VISIT DODGE CENTER, ROCHESTER, WINONA, AUSTIN IN TOUR OF SOUTHEAST MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced he will visit Dodge Center, Rochester, Winona, and Austin during a trip to Dodge, Olmstead, Winona and Mower Counties on Friday, October 6th. The visit is part of Sen. Coleman's ongoing effort to visit every county in Minnesota this year.  
   "I am anxious to get to Southeast Minnesota to connect again with local folks and hear about their specific concerns," said Coleman. "I am especially looking forward to meeting with the leadership and staff at Pemstar to get an update on the Land Warrior program that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill helped fund. This funding will most likely mean an influx of jobs and a stronger economy for the Rochester community." 
   Coleman will begin the day in Dodge County where he will meet with the Mayor, Chamber and local leaders to talk about the latest news in Dodge Center & Dodge County. Next he will visit Rochester to attend an event at Pemstar, which recently received $4 million in funding as part of Coleman's efforts on the Department of Defense Appropriations bill. Pemstar will use the funds for the continuing development of its Land Warrior program. 
   Coleman will then travel to the National Child Protection Training Center in Winona where he will meet with center staff and discuss the latest issues in child protection. He will also travel to Austin to meet with local business leaders at an Austin Chamber of Commerce reception. Coleman will discuss a broad range of topics, including health care, rural development, renewable energy, developments in fiber optics and national security.
