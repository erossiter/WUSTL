MADISON TO RECEIVE $16 MILLION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FROM USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT
  U.S. Senator Norm Coleman today announced that the city of Madison has been selected to receive as a $16 million financing package from the from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Program. The city will use the funding to replace its water, sewer and storm water lines using a $12.78 million low-interest loan and a $3.46 million grant awarded from Rural Development. Sen. Coleman's office notified city officials of the funding last week. 
   "Local officials and rate-payers in small towns across Minnesota are all too familiar with the financial strain that wastewater treatment upgrades can place on folks," Coleman said. "I have long fought for increased infrastructure investment in our rural communities to help ease this burden, and USDA Rural Development has been a leading partner in those efforts. I applaud them for awarding this grant and offer my congratulations to the residents and officials of Madison."
   "Strong infrastructure is critical to the well-being of a community," said Madison Mayor Greg Thole. "This project will make long overdue improvements to our water and wastewater infrastructure-improving services, reducing operating costs, and help ensure the future vitality of Madison."
   Rural Development has financing available for infrastructure and economic development projects in rural areas, including housing, hospitals, emergency response, job creation, high-speed Internet, childcare and law enforcement. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested almost $4 billion throughout rural Minnesota. More information can be found at www.rurdev.usda.gov/mn.
