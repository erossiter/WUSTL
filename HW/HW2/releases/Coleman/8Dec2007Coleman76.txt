SEN. COLEMAN 'INSTRUMENTAL' IN ADVANCING FARM BILL DEAL
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, who broke with fellow Republicans last month in an effort to move the farm bill forward, said Friday he had encouraged fellow Republicans to drop their objections after the Democratic leadership agreed to allow a limited number of amendments.  
   The "principled stand" his colleagues were taking to stall the bill if they couldn't offer amendments was no longer relevant, he said. "Folks understood that, agreed, and the thought was, 'Let's go to our leader, and let's get this deal done,'" he said. "And that happened." 
   "We have a path forward." 
   Erin Hamm, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Committee's top Republican, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, confirmed that Coleman urged the members to accept a deal, adding that he "was instrumental in helping the farm bill process get to this point." The agreement allows each party to offer 20 amendments. 
   Minnesota's other senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, said, "I'm very pleased we're moving forward on this bill." 
   Also Friday on the Senate floor, she offered her amendment denying farmers making more than $750,000 and part-time farmers making more than $250,000, after expenses, from receiving government payments. "This would ensure that urban millionaires do not pocket the farm subsidies intended for hardworking farmers," she said.
