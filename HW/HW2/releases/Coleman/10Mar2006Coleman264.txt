SEN. COLEMAN ENCOURAGED BY LATEST JOBS NUMBERS
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman expressed strong optimism today following the release of the U.S. Department of Labor's February jobs report which shows continued strong job growth. According to the report, more than 240,000 jobs were created in February - the 30th straight month of job growth. Since the President's tax relief was implemented in May 2003, the economy has created nearly 5 million new jobs.  
   As a result of pro-growth economic policies, Coleman believes the economy will continue to move in the right direction as more Americans find their way into the workforce. "The economy has been growing steadily for the past two and a half years and is still gaining momentum," Coleman said. "The pro-growth tax policies are working and the job market continues to expand. Minnesotans should feel good about the direction of our economy." 
   "Thanks to the flexibility of the economy over the past few years we can take pride in what we've accomplished and look with optimism towards the future," Coleman said. "Home ownership is at an all-time high and our jobs growth back home is impressive. In the past two years, over 73,000 jobs have been created statewide and a record number of businesses--nearly 54,000--have started this past year alone. That is almost a 40 percent increase since 2000 and is great news for employers and employees alike."
