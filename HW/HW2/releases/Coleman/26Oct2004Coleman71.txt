SEN. COLEMAN ADDRESSES HIBBING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON JOBS, ENERGY
  Sen. Norm Coleman will address the Hibbing Chamber of Commerce today to speak about economic development in Hibbing and northeast Minnesota.  
 This event will follow an appearance in Duluth as Senator Coleman meets with Department of Energy's Secretary Spencer Abraham and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to announce a multi-million dollar grant to a Minnesota clean coal plant.
   "As concerns about the economy and economic development grow in Minnesota," said Coleman, "I want our state to know that I am optimistic about the future. Our unemployment rate is down, Minnesota has produced almost 20,000 new jobs in the past six months, and the economy continues to grow at the fastest rate is has in nearly 20 years. But we always need to look ahead for potential ways to grow, economically and by expanding resources. I think northeast Minnesota will play a big part in that growth."
