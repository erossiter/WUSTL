SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF WILLIAM BUCKLEY
  "I was saddened to learn of the passing of William F. Buckley Jr., who was the founder and, for many years, the face of the contemporary conservative movement. I was among the many of my generation who was first introduced to the merits of conservative philosophy by his writings in the National Review, and I was fascinated by his insightful and always civil commentary on his Firing Line television show. Bill was truly one of a kind-a renaissance man who excelled as a television talk show host, author, and musician. It would be impossible to adequately express the debt that our party, and nation, owe to William F. Buckley Jr. He will be sorely missed."
