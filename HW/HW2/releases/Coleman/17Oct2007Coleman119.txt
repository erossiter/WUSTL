MINNESOTA DELEGATION URGES KEY SENATE, HOUSE CONFEREES TO INCLUDE $195 MILLION FOR I-35 W BRIDGE IN FINAL TRANSPORTATION BILL
  Yesterday, Minnesota's Congressional Delegation sent a letter urging key Senate and House conferees for H.R. 3074, the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (T-HUD) appropriations bill to include an amendment which passed the Senate appropriating $195 million in reimbursement funds for the reconstruction of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, MN. (Delegation member Rep. Betty McCollum fully supports the letter's request, but because the letter was addressed to the House Appropriations Committee on which she serves, she did not sign.) The US Department of Transportation has allocated $55 million of Federal-aid Highway Emergency Relief funding to Minnesota to begin the I-35W Bridge reconstruction. 
   Text of the letter is as follows:

   Dear Chairman Murray, Ranking Member Bond, Chairman Olver, and Ranking Member Knollenberg: 
   During consideration of H.R. 3074, the FY08 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (T-HUD) appropriations bill, the Senate adopted an amendment appropriating $195 million for the reconstruction of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota that collapsed on August 1, 2007. We urge you to include this provision in the final conference report on H.R. 3074. 
   The sudden collapse of the I-35W Bridge was nothing short of a national tragedy. In response, on August 3, 2007, Congress passed and the President subsequently signed Public Law 110-56, providing initial funds for the recovery effort and authorizing an additional $250 million for reconstruction. In the wake of the bridge collapse, Minnesota has increased transit options to serve commuters, set up detours to restore traffic flow, cleared structural debris, and begun laying the general framework for reconstruction. The U.S. Department of Transportation has allocated $55 million of Federal-aid Highway Emergency Relief funding to Minnesota to begin the I-35W Bridge reconstruction. As Minnesota continues to clear the path for a new bridge, we urge Congress to ensure that the additional authorized funds are made available for rebuilding. 
   During consideration of H.R. 3074, the Senate passed the Klobuchar-Coleman Amendment appropriating $195 million for reconstruction of the I-35W Bridge. These funds are vital to Minnesota; the Minnesota Department of Transportation estimates that the loss of the I-35W Bridge costs our economy $400,000 per day. To that end, we respectfully request that you support the inclusion of the Klobuchar-Coleman Amendment in the final T-HUD conference report. 
   Thank you very much, 
   Norm Coleman
