SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING WASHINGTON SENATE OFFICES
  "The Senate Sergeants at Arms, the Capitol Police, and Congressional Leadership have all conveyed to me that there is no intelligence information that necessitates the closing of Washington offices or for my constituents to avoid visiting their Capitol.  
 Although the Senate is in recess, there is still a great deal of work to be done, and my office will remain open to serve the people of Minnesota. And since I have been appointed as a negotiator to the Intelligence Reform conference committee, I will be traveling to and working from my Capitol Hill office several times from now until the election. I have no concerns about being at the Capitol whatsoever. 
   I want the people of Minnesota to know that all of the services that my Washington office provides continue to be at their disposal. Let me be clear: Should I receive any information in the future that leads me to believe that my staff or visitors to my Washington office are in any imminent danger, I will take action. We continue to be open for business."
