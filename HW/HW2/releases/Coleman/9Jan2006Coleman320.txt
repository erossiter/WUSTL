SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE ALITO'S HEARING
  "This week's confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee for Judge Samuel Alito to serve on the High Court is an important step as we near the end of the process.  
 As with all judicial confirmations, I take my advise and consent role very seriously, and I will continue to wait until after Judge Alito's hearing to make my final determination regarding his judicial temperament and philosophy. However, this process has shown Judge Alito to be qualified based on his exceptional constitutional law intellect, judicial experience, and commitment to public service. I have strongly advocated for a fair and dignified process, and my hope is that Judge Alito has a fair confirmation hearing and an up-or-down confirmation vote by the United States Senate."
