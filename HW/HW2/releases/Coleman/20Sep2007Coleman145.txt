13 MINNESOTA AGRICULTURE BUSINESSES SELECTED TO RECEIVE USDA GRANTS
  Senator Coleman today praised U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development for selecting 13 Minnesota-based companies to receive funds through USDA's Value-Added Producer Grant program. USDA announced the funding for Minnesota as part of 162 recipients in 40 states and Puerto Rico set to receive $22.7 million through the program.  
   "These grants will provide valuable assistance to Minnesota farm families and the businesses they rely on for their financial livelihood," Coleman said. "Our farmers are feeding the world and helping fuel the nation, and this funding will help them continue to market their commodities by supporting important agriculture businesses across Minnesota." 
   Value-Added Producer Grants may be used for planning activities or to provide working capital to market value-added agricultural products and farm-based renewable energy projects. A value-added product is created when a producer takes an agricultural commodity, such as milk or vegetables, and processes or prepares it in a way that increases its value to consumers. Rural Development has committed more than $158 million to value-added agricultural investments since 2001.
