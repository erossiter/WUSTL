SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN MANKATO, OWATONNA, BLUE EARTH, WASECA, & FARIBAULT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that five airports in southern Minnesota have been selected to receive federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Specifically, grants were awarded to local airports in Mankato, Owatonna, Blue Earth, Waseca and Faribault.  
   "Local airports are an important part of our state's transportation infrastructure and a source of economic opportunity for rural areas," said Coleman. "During my many travels around the state, I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. These grants will help ensure the viability of these airports and I applaud the FAA for awarding them." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns. 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $1,823,158 for Mankato Regional for runway rehabilitation. 
   $491,000 for Owatonna Degner Regional to acquire snow removal equipment and begin the first phase of a new crosswind runway 
   $94,750 for Blue Earth Municipal to conduct an airport study and layout plan to assist in the future development of the airport 
   $415,200 for Waseca Municipal to construct a new terminal building 
   $353,420 for Faribault Municipal to install a perimeter fence and conduct an environmental assessment for a runway shift
