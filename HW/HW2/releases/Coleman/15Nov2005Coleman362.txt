SEN. COLEMAN TOUTS RURAL RENAISSANCE PLAN TO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES AND LAND GRANT COLLEGES
  Addressing the 118th annual meeting of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC), Sen. Norm Coleman today told delegates that the passage of his Rural Renaissance II Act making its way through Congress will further strengthen their historic mission to promote rural life and values. As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Sen. Coleman, along with Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AK), introduced the bipartisan Rural Renaissance II Act, legislation aimed at assisting rural communities nationwide to improve and expand critical infrastructure in an effort to attract greater economic development and opportunity to rural regions. The Rural Renaissance II Act will establish a private-public partnership with rural electric cooperatives to provide rural development bonds and grants to address infrastructure challenges which undermine the ability of smaller communities to create business and grow new jobs.  
   "The Rural Renaissance II Act is about bringing jobs and economic growth to America's rural communities," Coleman said. "As a former mayor, I know that maintaining basic infrastructure job creation and development are critical components to economic vitality. Yet, throughout rural America today, a lack of basic infrastructure many Americans take for granted is undermining the very ability of small communities to create businesses and grow new and good paying jobs. The Rural Renaissance II Act will empower rural communities to upgrade outdated, inadequate, or nonexistent basic infrastructure in order to attract new investment and jobs." 
   NASULGC is the nation's oldest higher education association, representing 215 of major public universities, including the University of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota-Duluth. Rural Renaissance II will help land-grant colleges and universities perform their Extension missions, which identify priorities in the areas of community development and vitality; land, food and environment; and youth development and family living. Sen. Coleman also noted how critical the support of the NASULCG has been to the steady legislative progress and anticipated passage of this vital rural revitalization measure. 
   "There is no question about the foundational importance of state universities and land grant universities to economic development," said Coleman. "They are the source of research-based information, education and outreach. And they engage with citizens across the country through all manner of outreach programs, and importantly, through the network of Extension...applying their expertise to local problems." 
   Under this legislation, bonds and grants will be made available to small communities of 50,000 or fewer for rural utility infrastructure; water and waste facilities; affordable housing; renewable farmer-owned energy projects; broadband technology; distance learning and telemedicine; and community facilities, including hospitals, fire and police stations, and nursing and assisted living facilities. Rural Renaissance II will be included in the Senate tax reconciliation package, which awaits passage out of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   "There is hidden value in rural America," Coleman added during his speech. "Our job today is to figure out how to protect it and make it flourish. This bill targets rural areas that continue to lose population and suffer economic distress. What rural communities need are financial tools to expand waste water treatment and housing so they can capitalize on the opportunities that are out there for the taking." 
   Since its introduction, Rural Renaissance II has received overwhelming support from national organizations, as well as Minnesota cities and towns. Among them include: 
   * Telecommunications Industry Association 
   * National Council of Farmer Cooperatives 
   * Renewable Fuels Association 
   * American Sugarbeet Growers Association
