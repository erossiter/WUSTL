  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON VETERANS DAY: 
  The blessings of a free nation are never won without cost, and on this day we pause to honor those brave men and women in uniform who have paid for our freedoms with their service. Thanks to their valiant efforts, the freedoms that make our nation so great continue to be preserved and protected. The torch of liberty continues to shine on every person in our nation from all walks of life. As a country, we should use this opportunity to express our gratitude to the servicemen and women who have sacrificed for us all in the pursuit of freedom. We must keep the families of these heroes in our thoughts and prayers.
