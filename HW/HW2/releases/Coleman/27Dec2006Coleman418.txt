SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF PRESIDENT FORD
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE PASSING OF GERALD FORD : 
  Gerald Ford was a man of great integrity and courage, the right man in the right place at a challenging time in our history. His ascendance to the presidency marked a pivotal moment in the history of our constitution. Facing a fractured nation, he sought to restore our confidence in the institution of the presidency and our faith in government in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War. Through his leadership, President Ford brought comfort to the American people by upholding the very ideals this country was founded on - honor and dignity. As a nation, we mourn this loss and honor his service.
