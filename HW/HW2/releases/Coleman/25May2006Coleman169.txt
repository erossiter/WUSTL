SEN. COLEMAN ENCOURAGED BY STRONG FIRST QUARTER GDP GROWTH
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded today's revised GDP report showing exceptionally strong economic growth for the first quarter of this year. According to the report, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a brisk 5.3% in the first quarter, which is up 0.5% from the initial estimate of 4.8%. The economy has now expanded for 18 consecutive quarters and is the second-fastest growing economy among OECD member nations.  
   "With more than 138,000 jobs created in April alone, it is plain to see that our economy is moving forward," said Coleman. "I am encouraged by the revised GDP report. We can see the positive effects of Republican pro-growth policies in the strong economic figures. Even with last year's hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and the recent high energy costs weighing on businesses and consumers alike, the economy has remained fundamentally sound." 
   According to recent Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) figures, 15,800 jobs were created in Minnesota in the month of April. Minnesota has also created more than 80,000 jobs in the past two years as well as starting a record 54,000 new businesses in the past year alone. The state also continues to have a lower unemployment rate at 4.1% than the national average of 4.7%.
