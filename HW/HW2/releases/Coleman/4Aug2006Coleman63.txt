SEN. COLEMAN CALLS ON CMS TO FIX BILLING PROBLEM WITH MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that he will work closely with Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Minnesota Board on Aging to remedy a flaw in the Medicare Part D drug program that is incorrectly billing seniors for unpaid premiums, which should have been automatically deducted from their Social Security checks.  
   "I am working with both federal and state officials to ensure a solution to this problem is found," said Coleman. "I am frustrated that this glitch in the drug coverage system has the potential to adversely affect some Minnesota seniors. However, I want to assure seniors that I am confident that we will be able to quickly establish a smooth process to remedy this situation without causing plan enrollees a major inconvenience. Ultimately, this small hiccup in the system will not affect the Medicare Part D in the future, and I encourage plan enrollees to continue their participation." 
   An estimated 702,000 Minnesotans are eligible for the Medicare Part D program, and at least 547,000 Minnesotans are now being covered by the program. Nationally, 42 million seniors and people with disabilities are eligible. More than 25 million Medicare beneficiaries now have prescription drug coverage. 
   Seniors are encouraged to contact Senator Coleman's constituent services staff for any questions they might have about Medicare Part D at 651-645-0323. Also, Part D beneficiaries can contact the Senior LinkAge Line (1-800-333-2433 or senior.linkage@state.mn.us) and 1-800-Medicare.
