SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $99,999 FOR CITY OF BADGER
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Badger has received a $99,999 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. This rural development grant will be used to establish a revolving loan fund to help finance small and emerging private businesses in the area.  
   "I am excited to announce the City of Badger has received this funding," said Coleman. "This grant will help Badger encourage economic growth and job creation in the area through new business opportunities. I am pleased USDA Rural Development recognizes the importance of this grant in Badger and I applaud their continued support of Minnesota's rural communities." 
   The Rural Business Enterprise Grants Program (RBEG) issues grants to public organizations and private nonprofit corporations to finance and facilitate development of small and emerging private businesses located in rural areas. The grants do not go directly to individual businesses; they are typically disbursed through a local intermediary entity, such as a city or economic development organization. Examples of eligible uses for the funding range from feasibility studies to equipment purchases for small businesses to the creation of revolving loan funds. 
   As a whole, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural development projects since 2001.
