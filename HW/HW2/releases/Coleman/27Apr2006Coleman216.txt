SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $674,000 FOR CALLAWAY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Callaway has received a $337,000 loan and a $337,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to replace, update, and extend the city's water treatment facility, water mains, and water tower.  
   "I am excited for the City of Callaway to receive this funding," said Coleman. "Without the ability to raise funds through a large tax base, rural communities like Callaway need funding from elsewhere to sustain and upgrade basic infrastructure. I have introduced a Rural Renaissance bill to address concerns like this, and while it is making headway in Congress, the need for improvements right now is significant. USDA Rural Development continues to address the needs of our rural communities in Minnesota and I applaud them for awarding this grant to Callaway." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $3 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
