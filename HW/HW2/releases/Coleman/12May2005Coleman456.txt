SEN. COLEMAN'S SPOKESMAN RESPONDS TO GALLOWAY'S STATEMENTS REGARDING PSI REPORT
  Response from Coleman Spokesman to Mr. Galloway's Statements Regarding PSI Report 
   "This report contains the strong denials of wrongdoing by both Mr. Pasqua and Mr. Galloway. Contrary to his assertions, at no time did Mr. Galloway contact the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations by any means, including but not limited to telephone, fax, email, letter, Morse code or carrier pigeon. I would be pleased to have Mr. Galloway appear at the Subcommittee's May 17th hearing entitled, Oil For Influence: How Saddam Used Oil to Reward Politicians and Terrorist Entities Under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. The hearing will begin promptly at 9:30 AM and there will be a witness chair and microphone available for Mr. Galloway's use."
