SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FY 2009 BUDGET RESOLUTION
  "I could not support the budget resolution offered by my Democratic colleagues as it would hit the pocketbooks of middleclass families and seniors by offering the largest tax increase in history and failing to address the long-term solvency of programs like Medicare and Social Security. This debate comes at a time when Minnesota family budgets are under a great strain. Folks are worried about the rising cost of gas, food, and healthcare. I would support a budget that protects families by not raising taxes, by not increasing spending and by taking on trillions in future federal debt. Imposing higher taxes to fund more government programs is not the solution. In these challenging economic times, it is critical that we provide certainty and confidence in the economy by making permanent critical pro-growth tax relief, and I will continue working toward that end."
