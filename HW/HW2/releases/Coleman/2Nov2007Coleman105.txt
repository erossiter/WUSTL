SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON VETO OF WRDA BILL
  SEN. COLEMAN STATEMENT: I AM DISAPPOINTED BY VETO OF WRDA BILL:
   "I am disappointed by the President's veto of the WRDA bill. This bill makes long overdue and much needed investments into critical infrastructure projects in Minnesota and across the country. These upgrades are important to Minnesota's economy, environment and quality of life, and I look forward to using my vote to override this veto as soon as possible."
