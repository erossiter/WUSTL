SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DM&E RECORD OF DECISION
 Sen. Norm Coleman today made the following statement regarding the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) decision to approve the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad (DM&E) project. Now that the ROD has been issued, FRA will have 90 days to make a final decision on the $2.3 billion DM&E loan.  
   "FRA's approval of the EIS starts the 90-day countdown to a final decision on the loan approval. The Department of Transportation is still working to broker a mitigation package between DM&E and the Mayo Clinic, but with only a maximum of 90 days left to find a win-win solution for all sides, I must move forward with a legislative strategy to protect the city of Rochester. I still have hope that a mitigation plan can be agreed upon, and I will remain engaged in those negotiations, but as I have said all along, I will work to stop the project if the concerns of Rochester are not addressed."
