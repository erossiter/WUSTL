SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GROWING AMERICAN ECONOMY
  "America's economy is expanding and growing new jobs at an impressive rate.  
 The U.S. Department of Labor exceeded expectations this morning in reporting that, in April, 288,000 new jobs were created in this country. On top of that great news, we now know that there were 29,000 more new jobs created in March than originally thought, that's 337,000 new posts of employment. In the last eight months, I'm pleased to report, there have been over a million new jobs created. The American economy, it appears, is well on the way to a vibrant recovery."
