SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $450,000 LOAN FOR DEER RIVER TOWNSHIP HALL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Deer River Township will receive a $450,000 direct loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. This loan will be administered directly to the township and will provide funding for the construction of a new town hall.  
   "I am excited to announce that Deer River Township will receive this loan," said Coleman. "This loan will enable the construction of a new facility for citizens to facilitate community meetings, events and activities. In Greater Minnesota, where a smaller tax base and smaller populations create limited funding sources, these loans make the unfeasible a reality - making a real impact on the community. I am pleased that USDA Rural Development program has awarded this funding for the area." 
   "In our township hall, the floor is caving and we don't have a place where people can have events like birthdays, wedding receptions, or anniversaries," said Deer River Township Chairman Terry Stolzman. "This loan has opened up the door where can start doing different things now. We needed a new hall very badly and we're hoping now to get more people involved from the area." 
   USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Rural Development works to make sure that rural citizens can participate fully in the global economy and has an $86 billion dollar portfolio of loans. Rural Development will administer nearly $16 billion in program loans, loan guarantees, and grants through their various programs.
