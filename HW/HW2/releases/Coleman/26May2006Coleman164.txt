SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $40,000 FOR MIDWEST MINNESOTA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION IN DETROIT LAKES
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation (MMCDC), based in Detroit Lakes, has received a $40,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. This funding will be used to provide technical assistance to the people of Rice Lake Village to increase efficiency in harvesting raw goods. As many as 40 people are expected to receive direct assistance through this grant.  
   "I am excited to announce Midwest Minnesota Community Development Corporation will receive this funding," said Coleman. "Organizations like the MMCDC provide vital services to rural residents, and this grant will offer important services that would otherwise be difficult to obtain for Rice Lake Village. I am pleased USDA Rural Development has awarded this grant and I am thankful for their continued support of Minnesota's rural communities." 
   "We appreciate the support of USDA and our elected representatives and we look forward to working with the community of Rice Lake on this important project," said MMCDC Development Officer Jamie Marks Erickson. "This grant will provide funds for a feasibility study to help the people of Rice Lake Village improve their income." 
   MMCDC is a nonprofit organization specializing in economic, housing and community development. MMCDC's primary goal is to provide capital to rural residents, businesses and communities, with special focus on low-income individuals. 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
