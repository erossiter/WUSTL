SEN. COLEMAN STAFF TO DISCUSS HIGH GAS PRICES, NEW ENERGY LEGISLATION IN WEST-CENTRAL, SOUTHERN MINNESOTA
  As part of an ongoing effort to hear how gasoline prices are specifically impacting local residents and businesses across Minnesota, Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Matt Ketelsen, regional representative for Coleman, will be traveling across west-central and southern Minnesota from Tuesday, May 2nd through Thursday, May 4th to discuss high gas prices and Coleman's recently introduced energy legislation with local officials, businesses and residents. The trip will include stops in the following communities: Willmar, Benson, Morris, Redwood Falls, Luverne, Preston and Albert Lea. 
   "In the face of high gas prices, it is absolutely crucial for me to hear directly from folks across the state on how these prices are specifically affecting them, as well as garner any additional ideas they may have in helping combat rising prices," said Coleman. "Additionally, I want to let Minnesotans know I am continuing to work for a national energy strategy that will boost innovative technologies, conserve energy, and promote the production and use of renewable fuels - which will not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil but also provide a boon to Minnesota's rural economy. I am anxious to get Matt out into the state to listen and discuss these important issues with local residents."  
   Today, Senator Coleman announced he will be introducing the Energy Efficiency Act of 2006, a bipartisan bill with Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) aimed at reducing the nation's foreign oil dependence by establishing specific national goals for replacing oil imports through an expansion of renewable fuel infrastructure, incentives for increased use of hybrid vehicles, and increased conservation measures. As a complement to this bill, Coleman and Bingaman also plan to introduce the Enhanced Energy Security Act, which will expand incentives for the purchase and production of advanced vehicles (such as hybrids and fuel cell), along with containing key incentives to help save natural gas. 
   Additionally, Coleman last week introduced the Transforming Energy Now (TEN) Act, legislation that would require 10 percent of our nation's fuel to be blended with renewable fuels, such as ethanol, in the next 10 years. The bill also includes E-85 infrastructure provisions that will invest millions in fueling stations for alternative fuels. Coleman also announced he will work to ensure renewable fuel requirements are protected as the U.S. Senate considers legislation to restrict the number of boutique fuel blends, in order to protect Minnesota's nation-leading 10 and soon-to-be 20 percent ethanol requirement for gasoline and its two percent biodiesel requirement for diesel fuel.
