SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES BILL TO FOSTER HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR SENIORS
  In an effort to explore ways to better prepare the nation to face an expanding population of baby boomers reaching retirement age, Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced legislation that would foster the development of technologies that will bolster the ability of our healthcare system to handle the needs of our nation's changing demographics. The Consortium on the Impact of Technology in Aging Health Services bill will be tasked with advancing the development of technologies that increase the quality of healthcare services, while holding down the cost. The bill previously was introduced last year.  
   "As the baby boomer generation continues to pass retirement age, our healthcare system will be faced with the increasing challenges of a much larger older population," said Coleman. "At the same time demands on our healthcare system are increasing, the workforce that helps fund aging and healthcare services through taxes will be shrinking. Technology is a win-win solution: It promotes health and independence for individuals while increasing efficiency to keep costs low for society. By establishing this consortium, we will get a jump on meeting the needs of our aging population by exploring these technologies that will help keep our healthcare system viable. As a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I will work hard to pass this and other legislation that will alleviate the strain on our nation's seniors." 
   "I applaud Senator Coleman and Senator Reed's leadership, vision and support to improve the lives of countless Americans through the power of technology, collaboration and imagination. We are facing an unprecedented shift in demographics in our country that requires we think differently about aging. We believe emerging technology may be the key to ensuring older Americans can maintain a high quality, independent lifestyle while at the same time reducing health care costs through prevention, wellness and autonomy," said Kathy Bakkenist, Policy Chair for the Center for Aging Services Technology and Chief Operating Officer of Ecumen, Minnesota's largest non-profit provider of older adult services. 
   The legislation would task the Consortium with identifying: 
   * Methods for identifying technology that can be adapted to meet the needs of seniors, individuals with disabilities and the caregivers of such seniors and individuals across all aging services settings; 
   * Strategies for addressing issues such as liability reimbursement, and privacy and security concerns with respect to innovation in aging services technology; 
   * Developments in aging services technology in other countries that may be applied in the United States; 
   * Methods for ensuring that businesses in the United States have a leadership role in the rapidly expanding global market of aging services technology; and 
   * Fostering scientific innovation with respect to aging services technology within the business and academic communities. 
   The Consortium will be comprised of 17 members including researchers, business and government executives and consumers. The chairperson of the group will be appointed by the President and all other members will be appointed by Congress. Twenty-four months after enactment, the Consortium will be required to submit a report to the President and appropriate Congressional committees detailing its recommendations. 
   "It is imperative that we address the healthcare issues and concerns that affect our nation's aging population," said Coleman. "By fostering the development of healthcare technologies and bettering incorporating those technologies we will be better positioned to ensure a high quality, low cost healthcare system. This Consortium will help set us on the path that will make an improved healthcare system a reality." 
   Senator Coleman is on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which looks out for the interests of America's seniors. Among the many issues impacting senior citizens, the committee explores advanced medical research to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; oversight of Medicaid and Medicare; issues such as prescription drugs; and Social Security reform.
