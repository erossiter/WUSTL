SEN. COLEMAN DELIVERS FUNDING FOR CRITICAL MINNESOTA WASTEWATER, FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today was successful in including authorization for federal funding to construct and upgrade aging and inadequate wastewater treatment and flood control projects in Minnesota as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). WRDA authorizes a number of Army Corps of Engineers flood control projects, as well as navigational improvements and ecosystem restoration of the Upper Mississippi River. The measure passed by a vote of 91 to 4. 
   "Our nation's waterways are critical to our national commerce and transportation systems, and it is imperative that we provide the tools needed to keep these national resources easily navigable and environmentally sound," said Coleman. "Across Minnesota, many rural communities are unable to shoulder the financial burden of upgrading or reconstructing key community infrastructure. This legislation is not only essential to ensure the economic vitality of rural communities, but it is also necessary for maintaining the health of our lakes and rivers."  
   "I was pleased to work closely with Norm on these projects important to Minnesota in the WRDA bill that came out of my committee," said Senator Jim Inhofe, Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. "It is clear that Norm is passionate about improving Minnesota's water resources infrastructure. He went the extra mile to secure this critical funding authorization by demonstrating to the Committee how important these projects are to meeting Minnesota's economic, water, and environmental needs." 
   Senator Coleman was successful in securing funding for the following Minnesota projects in WRDA: 
   * $25,100,000 for the City of Roseau's flood control project. The Roseau project will include a 150-foot wide diversion channel that will divert floodwaters around the city to the east, providing reliable permanent flood protection to a majority of the city. In addition to flood damage reduction, the plan includes recreational features such as multipurpose trails, motorized trails, and a trailhead. 
   * $3 million for the City of Goodview's radium filtration plant. The authorization, which represents 75 percent of the project cost - the maximum federal match - will make the city eligible for federal assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to help finance and construct the plant. 
   * $15 million to construct a new wastewater treatment facility in the city of Willmar. The authorization will also be used to construct wastewater conveyance facilities between the new wastewater treatment facility and Willmar's existing wastewater treatment facility. The new treatment facility will be less disruptive to the Minnesota River than the current wastewater treatment facility, which is 70 years old. 
   * $5 million to reconstruct and upgrade the existing wastewater treatment facility in the city of Grand Rapids. The funding is necessary in order to accommodate the proposed expansion by UPM/Blandin to their Grand Rapids paper mill. This expansion is known as the "Thunderhawk Project" and will create hundreds of jobs in the region. 
   * $2 million to upgrade wastewater infrastructure in the Douglas County Lakes Area to maintain the pristine quality of Douglas County's lakes. The funding will assist in developing a sewer system in the townships of Le Grande and Moe. 
   * $9 million for the Duluth Harbor navigation project. 
   Authorizes funding for the Borup flood damage reduction project in the South Branch of the Wild Rice River. 
   Authorizes funding for the Crow River project in Rockford for flood damage reduction. 
   Authorizes funding for the Tower navigation project. 
   The Wild Rice River flood protection project. This provision directs the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the evaluation of the flood protection project and develop alternatives to the Twin Valley lake feature. 
   Asian Carp dispersal barrier. This provision requires the Army Corps of Engineers to study the construction of an Asian carp barrier at lock and dam 11. 
   The legislation also includes upgrades for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Restoration (UMR-IWW), including for critical navigation improvements along the waterway along and $1.5 billion in ecosystem restoration. The UMR-IWW makes commercial navigation possible between Minneapolis and St. Louis on the Mississippi River, and along the Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi River. Five of the nation's top agricultural production states; Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin; have relied on the UMR-IWW system as a principal conduit for export-bound agricultural products, mostly bulk corn and soybeans. 
   "If we do not invest in our infrastructure, we run the risk of falling behind the world market," said Coleman. "I have said many times that we must take the lead on issues critical to global competitiveness and the investments provided in WRDA are a key part of that strategy."
