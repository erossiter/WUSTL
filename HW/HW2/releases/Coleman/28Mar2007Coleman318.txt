SEN. COLEMAN TO VISIT WASECA, OWATONNA ON MARCH 31
  Sen. Norm Coleman will visit the communities of Waseca and Owatonna on Saturday, March 31st during a visit to Southern Minnesota. Coleman, who visited each of Minnesota's 87 counties last year, will attend a lunch meeting with local leaders at Jonnie Beans in Waseca before hosting an economic development roundtable discussion at the Owatonna Country Club.  
   "The only way to be a truly effective senator is to hear directly from constituents from all over the state," said Coleman. "I have made doing exactly that my top priority since taking office and those discussions have guided my work on important issues such as rural healthcare, renewable energy and economic development. Saturday's meetings will be a continuation of that effort, and I am eager to hear from folks in Waseca and Owatonna about the things that matter most to them."
