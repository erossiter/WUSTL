SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TODAY'S FORD ANNOUNCEMENT
  "I am encouraged by Ford's announcement today that the St.  
 Paul Ford plant will not be eliminated during the current restructuring. Despite the many challenges currently facing the domestic auto market, I believe the exceptional workforce at the St. Paul plant could play a key role in helping lead Ford into the future - a future that will be tied to the continued development of innovative vehicles, such as flex-fuel automobiles - and I hope they are given that opportunity as we move forward. 
   I will continue to work with Ford, Governor Pawlenty and the City of St. Paul to examine potential long-term opportunities for the plant. I am optimistic the current efforts I am undertaking in the Senate - such as my bill to reduce dependence on foreign oil by increasing the amount of renewable fuels required in our nation's fuel supply and encouraging the use of flex-fuel vehicles - will present an opportunity for both Ford and the entire domestic auto industry in the future."
