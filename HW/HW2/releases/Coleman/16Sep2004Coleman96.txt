SEN. COLEMAN LEADS BIPARTISAN SENATE EFFORTS URGING MEXICO TO KEEP BORDERS OPEN TO U.S. PORK
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today led bipartisan Senate efforts in urging top Mexico officials to keep borders open to U.S. pork by terminating a baseless anti dumping investigation of ham initiated by the Mexican government, and by restoring livestock inspections on the U.S. side of the border to avoid interruption of U.S. exports to that country. Nearly half the U.S. Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, joined Sen. Coleman who led the effort with the Senate Agriculture Committee's Ranking Democrat, Tom Harkin (D-IA).  
   In a communication with Mexico's Secretary of the Economy, Fernando Canales, and Secretary of Agriculture Javier Usabiaga, Coleman and 43 Senate colleagues, 26 Republicans and 17 Democrats, urged immediate termination of the anti dumping investigation and prompt restoration of inspections on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico in order to protect and maintain the access to Mexican markets gained by U.S. pork producers under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
   "Mexico is a critically important market for U.S. agriculture, and Minnesota pork producers in particular, with Minnesota ranking third nationally in pork production and Mexico ranking second in U.S. pork exports," said Coleman. "The access to Mexico that U.S. pork producers gained under NAFTA is part of a contract between our nations and we need to ensure that this contract is upheld to the letter and spirit of the law. Our two nations can do much better in an increasingly competitive world if we operate more as partners than competitors," Coleman added. "Mexico should drop its antidumping investigation because there is nothing there to investigate, and inspections should resume on the U.S. side of the border where the infrastructure is there to ensure U.S. pork exports are not interrupted." 
   In 2001, the U.S. exported 191,000 metric tons of pork to Mexico valued at $270 million.
