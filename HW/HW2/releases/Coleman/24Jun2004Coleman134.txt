SEN. COLEMAN HERALDS PASSAGE OF DOD REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION; BILL GOOD FOR TROOPS, MINNESOTA
  Late last night, Sen. Coleman joined a majority of his colleagues in passing the Senate Defense Department Reauthorization legislation.  
 The bill passed by a unanimous vote of 97-0. 
   "We ask a lot of our armed forces during these turbulent times, and this bill represents the support our troops deserve," Coleman said. "I was proud to support it." 
   This bill ensures that the defense of our nation and well-being of our troops. It includes provisions to give service men and women a 3.5 percent pay raise and increases in family separation allowance and danger pay. It authorizes the weapons programs that our troops rely upon, including important increases for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), missile defense, and up-armored Humvees. And it provides increased armors to keep our troops safe. 
   "I also worked hard to ensure that this bill benefits Minnesota and our own sons and daughters in uniform," Coleman continued. "This legislation includes my amendment that calls for a feasibility study that gets the ball rolling toward designating Camp Ripley as a mobilization station, allowing Minnesota troops training for duty to be closer to family and friends." 
   This bill also authorizes improvements to the Air National Guard base in Duluth and a joint security initiative that will benefit all of the services located at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport area. It boosts funding for several defense projects in which Minnesota companies have a stake, such as Polaris ATVs, Cray supercomputers and Honeywell's missile guidance technologies to reduce collateral damage from tomahawk missiles.
