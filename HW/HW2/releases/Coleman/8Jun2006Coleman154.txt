SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on the death of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi: 
   I applaud the magnificent efforts of our troops in Iraq in hunting down and killing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. His death is a major blow to Al Qaeda and sends the clear message that terrorism will not prevail. We must anticipate that insurgents will continue with their campaign of violence, death and destruction. But the final result is clearer today - those who follow Zarqawi will suffer from the same fate, and terror will not triumph in Iraq.
