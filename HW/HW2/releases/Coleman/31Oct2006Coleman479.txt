SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1,675,800 GRANT FOR NATIONAL HANDICAP HOUSING INSTITUTE
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the National Handicap Housing Institute, Inc. in Sartell, Minnesota has been awarded $1,675,800 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of a grant program to support housing development for persons with disabilities. The grant will be used to construct 12 one-bedroom and 4 two-bedroom units, of which one will be for a resident manager. The grant also includes a $165,000 three-year rental subsidy to make the new units affordable for low income residents.  
   "This funding will provide low income people with disabilities access to available and affordable housing," said Coleman. "I applaud HUD and the National Handicap Housing Institute for their combined vision and efforts to ensure that our state's residents with disabilities are given access to the basic necessities that they deserve." 
   "We are absolutely delighted to get this project funded," said Michael Bjerkesett, President of the National Handicap Housing Institute. "There is a very high demand in Sartell for accessible and affordable housing. We already have a huge waiting list of people ready to move in and we can't wait to get started."
