SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF AMBASSADOR BOLTON
STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON RESIGNATION OF AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON: 
 Today's announcement that Ambassador John Bolton will not seek to remain in his position as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations represents a tremendous blow to the effectiveness of U.S. leadership at the UN, as it disrupts the continuity of our diplomacy at a critical moment. Ambassador Bolton proved himself to be a strong advocate for U.S. interests, as well as a skillful diplomat who was able to work with our partners and reach compromises on important international issues. 
 Ambassador Bolton's tireless diplomatic efforts yielded considerable results, including Security Council resolutions condemning North Korea's nuclear activities and a call for UN Peacekeepers in Darfur. He also built consensus among our allies on the need to constrain Iran's nuclear program and work towards reform of the U.N., efforts that I deeply regret he will not be able to continue. 
 I am disappointed that partisan politics and the obstructionism of a few Senators stood in the way of Ambassador Bolton's nomination and ultimately led to his resignation. With the myriad of dangers that we face today, failing to act on his nomination has diminished our voice at this institution. We are losing a strong, experienced leader for the American people in the international community.
