SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON UPCOMING JUDGE ALITO VOTE
  "After careful consideration I have decided to support the confirmation of Samuel Alito as associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.  
 I closely followed Judge Alitio's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He consistently demonstrated the quality of intellect, character and integrity that will serve him well on the nation's highest court. Judge Alito understands the role of a judge is not to make law, but to apply law. In his 15 years on the Court of Appeals he has shown the ability to be fair and impartial, to put aside personal ideology, and to make decisions based solely on the Constitution, the law, and the record. I am proud to support his confirmation."
