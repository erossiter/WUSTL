SEN. COLEMAN'S AGRICULTURE REPRESENTATIVE KETELSEN TO VISIT MARSHALL, PENNINGTON, RED LAKE, POLK, CLEARWATER COUNTIES TO DISCUSS DROUGHT, CROP CONDITIONS
  In light of this summer's dry weather that is posing serious challenges for Minnesota farmers, Sen. Norm Coleman will be sending his Agriculture Representative Matt Ketelsen, to visit the counties of Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, Polk, and Clearwater during a visit to Northwest Minnesota on Thursday, July 27th. With some area counties already meeting the drought threshold, Coleman is sending Ketelsen to get an updated assessment of the crop situation and to hear specifics problems and concerns from local farmers and representatives of Farm Service Agencies (FSA) in the area.  
   Last week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with Coleman's encouragement, announced it would allow emergency grazing and haying on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land due to the extreme drought conditions that continue to plague the area. Opening this land for haying and grazing, typically prohibited under CRP regulations, will provide supplemental forage to producers whose pastures have been adversely affected by drought. The counties USDA reported authorizing for emergency grazing include: Marshall, Pennington, Clearwater, eastern Polk and Red Lake. Coleman is also currently working to open additional CRP land to haying and grazing where possible. 
   Thursday's meetings are open to the public and the media. Details on the day's schedule are as follows:
