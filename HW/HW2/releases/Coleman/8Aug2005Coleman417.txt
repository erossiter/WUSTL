SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ARREST OF ALEXANDER YAKOVLEV
  The fact that within hours of Mr. Volcker's report on the role of Benan Sevan, and others, in receiving bribes and kickbacks from the U.N. Oil for Food Program that Alexander Yakovlev was not only arrested, but plead guilty to his role in the scandal underscores the outrageous decision by Kofi Anan to preserve diplomatic immunity for Sevan.  
 No reasonable person should believe that Sevan, safely ensconced in Cyprus, is going to voluntarily submit to facing prosecution for his actions. Kofi Annan could have done the right thing months ago and lifted Sevan's diplomatic immunity. It was an outrage for Annan to protect his friend then, it's an outrage now that his decision virtually leaves Sevan above the law.
