SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF MUKASEY TO SERVE AS U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement in response to President Bush's nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to serve as the United State's 81st Attorney General.  
   "The credentials of Judge Michael Mukasey appear to be nothing short of impeccable - serving over 18 years on the federal bench with distinction. I am particularly impressed with his extensive experience in adjudicating terrorism related cases. It is my expectation that we in Congress can effectively work together and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his qualifications. However, comprehensive does not mean a lengthy or drawn out process for political purposes. Given the importance of filling this critical position, it is my hope we can put politics aside and proceed in an expeditious manner."
