SEN. COLEMAN VOICES CONCERNS TO AGRICULTURE SECRETARY AT SENATE FARM BILL HEARING
 Sen. Norm Coleman today raised questions to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns about the ability of the Administration's farm bill proposal to provide a strong safety-net for our farmers at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. During the hearing, Coleman acknowledged his appreciation that the Administration's proposal would maintain the safety net programs, but issued serious concern that the proposal would cut those same programs by more than $12 billion over 10 years, making policy changes that, in some cases, could leave Minnesota farmers without adequate protection.  
   "I let Secretary Johanns know that cutting the farm bill safety-net by billions of dollars is a pretty big ax to swing at programs essential to farmers," said Coleman. "Aside from the large cuts being proposed, I'm concerned the proposal won't protect Minnesota farmers in certain low yield situations, and about how a revenue-triggered counter-cyclical program will perform in times of low prices. By proposing to convert the counter-cyclical program into a revenue program that uses national averages, wheat farmers in the Red River Valley could still be wiped out and receive nothing under the proposal if prices are high and other wheat farmers around the country produce a good crop. Moreover, if we are hit with unanticipated, persistently low commodity prices like we were in the late 1990s, we'll be faced with similar multi-billion dollar emergency farm aid packages."
