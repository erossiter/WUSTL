SEN. COLEMAN: SOLID JOB GROWTH CONTINUES IN MINNESOTA
  In light of the latest jobs report released by the Department of Labor today, Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman praised the overall health and continued growth of Minnesota's economy. According to the latest government figures, Minnesota added over 47,000 jobs from May 2005 through May 2006. Moreover, the state's unemployment level fell to 3.7 percent - the lowest rate since March 2001.  
   "As the number of jobs created increases with each passing month, so should the optimism of Minnesotans and Americans regarding the state of the economy," said Coleman. "It is clear that pro-growth policies that we have implemented have served as an important catalyst for economic growth." 
   According to recently revised GDP report, the economy grew at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter, exceeding the initial estimate of 4.8 percent. The first quarter figure is the best since the third quarter of 2003. The economy has now grown for 18 consecutive quarters. 
   Additionally, job growth at the national level remains vibrant. According to the jobs report released by the Department of Labor, 75,000 jobs were created in the month of May, and the economy has now added more than 5.2 million jobs since the enactment of the President's pro-growth agenda in May 2003. Moreover, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7 to 4.6 percent in May - the lowest rate since July 2001. The U.S. economy has now experienced 33 consecutive months of job growth. During the past 12 months, the economy has created nearly 1.9 million jobs. 
   "There are more people working today then at any time in history. While this is a wonderful accomplishment, it is important that we continue to have in place polices that encourage strong future job growth," Coleman added.
