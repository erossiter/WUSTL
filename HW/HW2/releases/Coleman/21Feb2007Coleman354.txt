SEN. COLEMAN NAMED RANKING MEMBER OF SENATE AGRICULTURE SUBCOMMITTEE ON NUTRITION AND FOOD ASSISTANCE
 Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman has been selected to be the Ranking Member on the Senate Agriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Nutrition and Food Assistance, Sustainable and Organic Agriculture, and General Legislation. The subcommittee exercises oversight over domestic and international nutrition; food assistance; hunger prevention; farm viability; sustainable and organic food production; trading of futures, options and financial derivatives; and pesticides.  
   "Today, an estimated 150,000 households in Minnesota live with hunger or the threat of hunger. As Ranking Member, I look forward to working to strengthen our programs designed to help Americans having a difficult time affording food," said Coleman. "The Subcommittee will also play a critical role in developing the farm bill's nutrition title. The farm bill couples farm programs with nutrition programs to provide a safety-net for farmers to feed the nation, and at the same time a nutritional safety-net for families struggling to put a square meal on the table."
