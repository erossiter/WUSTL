SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES OVER $9 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR LEAD REDUCTION IN MINNESOTA HOMES
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is awarding over $9 million in grants to eliminate and reduce lead-based paint in Minnesota homes. The grants will come from three different programs aimed at reducing exposure to lead-based paint in homes, particularly those of low-income families, and will be distributed to Hennepin County, the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest and the State of Minnesota.  
   "The serious health risks of lead-based paint, particularly to children and low-income families who are most often the victims of its toxicity, should not be taken lightly," Coleman said. "It has been estimated that there are over 300,000 children who have been affected by lead poisoning nationwide, and in order to meet our national goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning by 2010, the starting point must be in individual homes. This is a major challenge that comes at great cost to many low-income families, and these grants will go a long way toward helping these families shoulder the financial burden of reducing the risk of lead poisoning in their places of residence." 
   Senator Coleman has been a leading Senate advocate of reducing lead-based paint in homes and rental units - particularly for low-income families and children. He previously sent a letter to HUD asking them to establish a plan to eliminate childhood lead poisoning by 2010. 
   Specific grants announced today are as follows: 
   $3 million for Hennepin County through the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control in Privately owned housing program 
   $4 million for Hennepin County through the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant Program 
   $999,769 for the American Lung Association in the Upper Midwest through the Healthy Homes Demonstration Grant 
   $1,413,100 for the State of Minnesota through the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control in Privately owned housing program
