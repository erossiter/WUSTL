SEN. COLEMAN COMMETS ON DISMISSAL OF U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AFFAIRS DIVISION HEAD STEPHANIDES
  Reaction from Sen. Coleman to the Dismissal of Joseph Stephanides 
   "Today's announcement that the Secretary General has dismissed Joseph Stephanides, head of the U.N. Security Council Affairs Division, should come as no surprise. Last February, the U.N.'s own Independent Inquiry Committee found that he had 'prejudiced and pre-empted' the competitive bidding process for the awarding of inspection contracts and violated U.N. rules. The appropriate dismissal of Mr. Stephanides is a small but nevertheless necessary step in holding accountable all those who abused the UN OFF program. Another necessary step is for the Secretary General to withdraw the diplomatic immunity that Mr. Benon Sevon holds pursuant to his current employment with the UN and make him available to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and Congress."
