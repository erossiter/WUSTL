SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING ANWR, SENATE BUDGET
  "When I ran for the Senate, I pledged to oppose drilling in ANWR. Today I kept that commitment. I was proud to vote again this year to strip ANWR drilling out of the budget because it is a distraction from where our focus should be. We need to do more to reduce America's increasing dependence on foreign sources of oil and reduce energy costs. But whether we can do that by drilling in ANWR is uncertain. What we do know - especially in Minnesota - is that we can achieve this goal by expanding the use of renewable fuels like ethanol, biodiesel, and wind energy."
