SEN. COLEMAN TO HOLD FORUM WITH MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE TROOPS, LEADERS IN ROCHESTER, TWIN CITIES
 Joined by the commander of the Minnesota National Guard, the commanders of the Minnesota Army, Air Force and Naval Reserves, and a top Pentagon official in the Department of Reserve Affairs, Sen. Norm Coleman will lead a forum in Rochester and at Fort Snelling on Monday, May 2nd to thank Minnesota's National Guardsmen and Reservists for their service and to solicit their input on the challenges facing our citizen soldiers and their families.  
   "I am looking forward to meeting face-to-face with Minnesota's Guard and Reserve troops and their leaders to hear what's on their minds and how my actions in Washington can make a real difference as they strive to best serve our nation," Coleman said. "Since 9/11 our nation has asked and received unprecedented sacrifice from our citizen soldiers in the Reserve and Guard. I want to do all I can to help assist them and their families and make sure their voice is heard in Washington." 
   Both sessions will be open to the public and attended by Minnesota National Guard and Reserve troops, who will have an opportunity to tell top military and civilian officials about their most pressing challenges and concerns resulting from their military duties and commitments. Local guardsmen and reservists will also join in the panel discussions. 
   In Rochester the panel will include Teri Wermager and Linda Howton, volunteers with the Family Readiness Group in Austin, Minnesota. The FRG serves the soldiers and families of Bravo Company, 434th Main Support Battalion, Minnesota National Guard. Presently, the soldiers have been deployed to Iraq to join coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom, including Teri Wermager's and Linda Howton's husbands. FRG has raised more than $10,000 to assist local military families through the sales of 3,000 yellow ribbon shirts and other items. The FRG has encouraged the community of Austin to set aside the 11th of each month to recognize and support their soldiers and families.
