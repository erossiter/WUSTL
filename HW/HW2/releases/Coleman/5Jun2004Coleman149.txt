SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  "Ronald Reagan represented for the world the principles of freedom, liberty and democracy. His leadership during the Cold War began the unraveling of the dark power of Communism, and ensured that the Iron Curtain would fall throughout Eastern Europe.
   His infectious optimism and belief in the power of America provided all of our citizens with the undeniable belief that our best days would always remain ahead of us. All people who cherish freedom and liberty should give special thanks to God for the gift of the leadership, vision and faith of President Ronald Reagan."
