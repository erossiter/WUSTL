SEN. COLEMAN TOUTS JOBS, JOBS, JOBS FOR MINNESOTA, U.S.
  Sen. Norm Coleman today acknowledged that recent economic and jobs data released today by the Labor Department shows strong and sustained economic growth across the country as a result of strong economic policies.  
 According to the latest government figures, 207,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs were created in July, signaling the 26th consecutive month for job growth. In addition, the economy has created 2.2 million jobs over the past 12 months and the unemployment rate is at 5.0 percent, well below the average rate of the last three decades. 
   "We've won some important victories during the past seven months," said Coleman. "We've passed a highway and an energy bill, two key pieces of legislation with job creation at the core. Thousands of jobs will be created in Minnesota alone because of these bills. I believe that today's numbers reflect the work we've been doing in Washington and shows that the President's and Congress's pro-jobs policies are working." 
   Job creation is not only taking place nationwide, but in Minnesota as well. Almost 35,000 jobs have been created over the past year in Minnesota, while the unemployment rate stands at 3.7 percent-down from 4.6 percent one year ago.
