SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF BOLTON
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON:  
  Simply put, John Bolton deserves to be confirmed as Ambassador to the United Nations. He's done an extraordinary job, particularly in regards to the security counsel resolution sanctioning North Korea - a masterful diplomatic effort that brought them back to the six-party talks. Time and again, Ambassador Bolton has been a strong voice, making certain that U.S. concerns are addressed at the UN, while at the same time also reaching out to the international community for compromise and consensus. With so much at stake, I hope that recent talk of bipartisan cooperation rings true and that we will be able to have an up or down vote on Ambassador Bolton before the end of this legislative session.
