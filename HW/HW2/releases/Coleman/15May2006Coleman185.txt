SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL GUARD PROPOSAL
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S NATIONAL GUARD PROPOSAL: 
   Sadly, our immigration system is broken. As a nation, if we are to enact comprehensive reform, Americans must feel confident that our borders are being properly protected. To that end, I am encouraged by the President's bold and aggressive initiative to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. Employing the National Guard to assist Border Patrol officials is a practical and commonsense solution, as they possess the equipment, man power, and the logistical know-how to assist in sealing our borders in the short-term. Simply put: our borders should not be a revolving door for the illegal crossing of people and dangerous materials. As the Senate takes up comprehensive immigration legislation this week to bring the more than 11 million illegal immigrants from out of the shadows, I am confident this proposal will strengthen America's security by taking the most important first step towards real reform.
