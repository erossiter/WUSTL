SEN. COLEMAN, REP. RAMSTAD PROPOSE BILL TO FOSTER USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN HEALTHCARE FOR BABY BOOMERS, SENIORS
  In an effort to better prepare the nation for the unprecedented demographic changes that will occur as more baby boomers begin to reach retirement age, Sen. Norm Coleman and Rep. Jim Ramstad will be holding a press conference on Wednesday July 26, 2006 at 3:00 p.m. to unveil their legislation to establish the Consortium on the Impact of Technology in Aging Services. The consortium will be charged with studying how technological advances can be used to support elders, families and communities as the demand for healthcare and aging services increases exponentially. The efficiency gains and preventative capacity of health technology could also help to control rising healthcare costs.  
   "As the needs of the baby boomer generation increase over the next 10 years, I am concerned that we have not yet developed solutions to foster continued independence, mobility and quality of life for older adults" said Coleman. "Current and emerging technology may be the key to ensuring that baby boomers are able to maintain their quality of life by staying active, living in their own homes and engaging in the workforce as long as they please, well into their senior years. The appropriate use of this technology will also help us control spiraling healthcare costs. I am pleased to be working with Congressman Ramstad to find a solution that brings the public and private sectors together to build a national infrastructure to support the health of older adults, their families and communities." 
   "With the Baby Boomers retiring and health care costs increasing, Congress must look at how technology can improve the health care system for our nation's seniors. By convening this consortium, we can bring public and private interests together to provide better care, reduce costs, and enable seniors to live independently." said Ramstad. 
   "Our aim is nothing short of re-inventing healthcare as we know it today," said Kathy Bakkenist, VP of Strategy and Operations for Ecumen and chair of the public policy committee of the Center for Aging Services Technology (CAST). "We know consumers don't want an institutional, medical model of care - they want a model focused on prevention, wellness and autonomy. This bill provides the impetus for innovation and technology advances across the public and private sectors in ways that will create meaningful change." 
   "Sen. Coleman and Rep. Ramstad are providing the leadership we need to transform our broken long-term care system into one that supports families and caregivers," said Larry Minnix, President and CEO of American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. "The commission created in this legislation, which has been the central policy focus of our Center for Aging Services Technologies (CAST), will help accelerate to the marketplace technologies that are key to creating a hopeful future where both clinical quality and quality of life are improved." 
   The legislation would task the Consortium with identifying: 
   * Methods for identifying technology that can be adapted to meet the needs of seniors, individuals with disabilities, and the caregivers of such seniors and individuals across all aging services settings; 
   * Fostering scientific innovation with respect to aging services technology within the business and academic communities; 
   * Strategies for addressing issues, such as liability, reimbursement, and privacy and security concerns, with respect to innovation in aging services technology; 
   * Developments in aging services technology in other countries that may be applied in the United States; and 
   * Methods for ensuring that businesses in the United States have a leadership role in the rapidly expanding global market of aging services technology.
