SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES CONGRESS TO CONVENE SPECIAL SESSION TO PROVIDE RELIEF FUNDING FOR HURRICANE VICTIMS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Congress will convene a special session this evening to pass an emergency supplemental providing funding to the Hurricane-hit region of the Gulf Coast. This funding will provide relief for the victims, businesses, and cities that have been devastated as a result of Hurricane Katrina, provide aid for reconstruction of the region, and help address the wide-ranging impact this storm has had nationally.  
   "It is crucial that we move swiftly in getting the appropriate funds to the region," said Coleman. "The areas affected are in desperate need of aid and resources. In its wake, Hurricane Katrina has left entire cites in ruin and families displaced from their home. My heart and prayers goes out to those who were killed, as well as to the families and loved ones of the victims." 
   In response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush has created a Cabinet-level task force, chaired by Secretary of Homeland Security Mike Chertoff, to develop a comprehensive plan to meet the urgent needs in the region. According to the Pentagon, by next week 24,000 troops would be on the ground to assist in recovery efforts, including 8,600 National Guard members by Friday. 
   "My colleagues in the Senate recognize the urgency of this matter and are ready to take immediate action to provide FEMA with the resources they need in order to provide vital services at a time of great distress," said Coleman. "It is estimated that Katrina could cost as much as $25 billion, and it is important that we act now in order to help address the impact this storm has had across the nation. Energy, agriculture, and transportation have all been disrupted-we need to get the nation back on course as soon as possible."
