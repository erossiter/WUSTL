SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON OPENING OF STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman:
   "It is important that we tap into part of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve as soon as possible to help offset the disruption to oil refiners and oil production on the Gulf Coast as Hurricane Katrina devastates the region," said Sen.  
 Norm Coleman. "Opening our emergency reserve would promote stability in the production and preservation of our essential energy supplies during this critical time of high gas prices. In the past, I have not supported such measures as opening the Reserve merely as an effort to lower prices. Emergency circumstances and the natural disaster on the Gulf Coast, coupled with Americans already paying high gas prices, demand this strong course of action, and I believe it is an appropriate use of the Reserve to offset temporary production shortages."
