HAPPY THANKSGIVING FROM SEN. COLEMAN
  "Nearly four centuries ago, the Pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving.  
 In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln revived that tradition and signed the first Thanksgiving Day presidential proclamation. Although America was fighting the bloodiest battle of her history, our greatest president paused and brought a nation together to give thanks to God. Since then, our nation has gathered each year to gaze upwards in gratitude and celebrated America's bounty with family and friends. 
   This year, America has much to be thankful for. We remain a country of unprecedented prosperity, a land of liberty unlike any in human history. We are a nation where the freedoms granted by the Almighty can be practiced freely. America is blessed indeed. 
   At this time of year, we also give thanks to the brave men and women who defend the freedoms we so cherish. We salute those in uniform and offer our prayers for their safe return home, as well as for the military families that have lost loved ones serving so bravely overseas. That is an unbearable sacrifice, but I hope some comfort can be found this Thanksgiving in knowing how grateful their nation remains. 
   My fellow Minnesotans, I wish you a happy Thanksgiving. May God bless you and continue to bless the United States of America."
