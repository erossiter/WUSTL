SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $163,000 COMMUNITY FACILITY GRANT FOR CITY OF OGEMA
  Sen. Coleman announced today the City of Ogema has received a $163,000 Community Facility grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The grant will supplement previous funding for the construction of a comprehensive municipal water system for Ogema.  
   "I am pleased to announce the City of Ogema has received this grant," said Coleman. "Through my outreach across that state, I have heard time and time again about the need for update water systems in our rural communities. This grant will support the city's important water safety improvements, and I thank USDA Rural Development for recognizing the importance of these grants to our rural communities." 
   "Without this funding, we wouldn't have been able to continue with this project due to the rising cost of energy and asphalt," said Ogema City Clerk Mary Vasecka. "The city, which is part of the White Earth Indian Reservation, has never had a municipal water system before. Now we'll have fire hydrants and city water. All of the old wells will be capped due to a higher than federally mandated arsenic content." 
   USDA Rural Development Community Facility Grants provide funds to assist in the construction, enlargement, or improvement of essential community facilities for health care, public safety, and community and public services. Typically, grants are awarded to low population, low income communities that are identified in special federal initiatives, such as Native American community development projects. 
   Previously, the City of Ogema was awarded a loan of $372,000 and a grant of $619,000 in FY 2004 for this project.
