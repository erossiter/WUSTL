SEN. COLEMAN SECURES $40 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA PROJECTS IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman applauded today's Senate passage of the FY2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which will provide almost $40 million in new military construction projects in Minnesota. The legislation, which passed unanimously, also included an amendment co-sponsored by Coleman to extend the term of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) which was scheduled to expire on past October 1, 2007.  
   "Our men and women in uniform deserve the best military and training facilities that we can offer, which is why I am glad this appropriations bill will jump start numerous projects in Minnesota and across the country," said Coleman. "The legislation also addresses an issue that is a top priority for me - the healthcare of our nation's veterans. This legislation will provide $28.7 billion for medical services, which is $4.51 billion more than fiscal year 2006." 
   "I am also pleased that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle demonstrated their overwhelming support to continue the work of the SIGIR office," Coleman added. "Without question, the SIGIR's oversight during this process has been essential to ensuring that the taxpayers' dollars are being used effectively and efficiently." 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill provides $94.32 billion in new budget authority. It provides $16.26 billion for military construction for the active and reserve component accounts. In addition, $77.91 billion is provided for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Of this funding, $36.49 billion is discretionary funding and $28.7 billion is for medical services. Medical and Prosthetic Research will receive $412.0 million, which is $13.0 million above the Administration's request and equal to fiscal year 2006. 
   Minnesota projects contained within the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Spending include: 
   * $3.8 million to construct an Infantry Squad Battle Course (ISBC) at Camp Ripley in Little Falls, MN. The ISBC is a range where dismounted infantry soldiers and squads can conduct training exercises in offense, defense and retrograde. The tasks conducted on this range are critical to the survival and success of soldiers in today's contemporary operating environment. 
   * $1.7 million to construct a standard Urban Assault Course (UAC) at Camp Ripley in Little Falls, MN. The UAC is used to train-up individual soldiers, squads, and platoons on the tasks necessary to operate within an urban area. The UAC provides squad or platoon-size units with a facility to train and evaluate urban operations tasks prior to an Active Duty Deployment. 
   * $34.453 million to construct an Army Aviation Support Facility for the Minnesota Army Guard's Aviation Brigade. The existing aviation facility, located in St. Paul, was constructed in 1931 and is critically short in many functional areas. The proposed 126,351 square-foot facility will provide adequate functional space for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the facility's location in St. Cloud, MN will provide easier access to the Brigade's primary training area at Camp Ripley.
