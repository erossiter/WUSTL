SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $225,000 FOR CITY OF KEEWATIN
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Keewatin, Minnesota has received a $175,000 loan and a $50,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to purchase a fire tanker/pump truck for the community.  
   "I am excited to announce that Keewatin will receive this funding," said Coleman. "In rural communities, the fire department is often comprised of local residents volunteering their time and efforts to protect their neighbors, and it is important they have the resources they need. I am pleased the USDA Rural Development program awarded this funding to Keewatin, and I applaud their continued support for Minnesota's rural communities." 
   "The Keewatin Fire Department would like to thank Sen. Coleman for his help in obtaining this truck," said Paul Clusiau of the Keewatin Fire Department. "It not only helps the citizens of Keewatin but also improves the fire and EMS capabilities at Keewatin Taconite, which is a major economic hub for the entire Iron Range." 
   Keewatin has a population of approximately 1,100 people, and is located just west of Hibbing in Itasca County. The Keewatin Fire Department is a member of the Arrowhead Region Firefighters Association, Minnesota Fire Chiefs Association, Arrowhead Emergency Medical Services Association, as well as other organizations. The Keewatin Fire Department also provides fire and EMS services to Keewatin Taconite, which employs nearly 400 people. 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
