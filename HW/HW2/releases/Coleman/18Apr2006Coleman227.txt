SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING IRAN'S PARTICIPATION ON U.N. DISARMAMENT COMMISSION
  "Iran's election to a leadership role on the U.N. Disarmament Commission is another outrageous and saddening reflection of the lack of credibility of the United Nations. Iran's participation in the U.N. Disarmament Commission is a farce. Its disregard of international efforts to stop it from developing a nuclear bomb, and its bellicose calls for the destruction of another member state, namely Israel, should result in Iran's forfeiting its right to participate in U.N. functions."
