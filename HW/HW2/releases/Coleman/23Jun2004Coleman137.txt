SEN. COLEMAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HHS TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL $10 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR HMONG REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman said today that the information provided by the Department of Health and Human Services as to where previously appropriated dollars for Hmong refugee resettlement in Minnesota is just the beginning of a longer term resolution of substantial financial support for the resettling of approximately 15,000 Hmong refugees, a third of whom are expected to make Minnesota their home. 
   "I have communicated directly to the Secretary, as well as with my colleagues, that far more resources need to be forthcoming to address this critical issue," said Coleman. "Today's informational release by HHS as to where money will be directed at this time, is helpful to understanding the scope of the challenge we face. This announcement doesn't impact the need for the federal government to do more. In fact, my request for a minimum of an additional $10 million in federal funds is becoming even more urgent as the influx of refugees begins. Local officials need to be aware that this isn't the end of the support of the federal government - this is really just a down payment on what has to be done for the federal government to fulfill its obligation to local communities who are assisting in the relocation of thousands of Hmong refugees."
   "I commend Senator Coleman for his leadership in working to ensure that the Hmong receive all the assistance they need so that their arrival in Minnesota and other states is as easy and efficient as possible," HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said. "We at the Department of Health and Human Services will be working with Senator Coleman and the state of Minnesota to help the state resettle the refugees. We will provide financial and technical assistance to Minnesota, as well as assist with health care and social services for the refugees."
