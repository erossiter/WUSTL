SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE BUDGET
  "I believe the government needs a budget to enforce fiscal discipline.  
 I'm pleased the budget we passed last night keeps non defense, non homeland security spending in check and well below the rate of inflation. While this budget is by no means perfect, it is better than where we started this process over a month ago and even earlier this week. 
   "I objected to cuts to CDBG, Medicaid, education, the Farm Bill, and fees and co-payments imposed on veterans' health care. Today, CDBG, Medicaid, and education are fully funded, cuts to Agriculture were reduced by more than two-thirds and progress is still being made to ensure no changes to the Farm Bill, while the budget totally dropped the nickeling and diming of our veterans. And I again lived up to my commitment to oppose ANWR drilling." 
   "The Senate version of the budget is not everything I hoped for but in some ways more than I asked. It sometimes cuts where it shouldn't and doesn't where it should. But Minnesota did enjoy some big victories this week and that's why I voted to move this process to the next step. While keeping a lid on spending, preventing tax increases on working moms and dads, and fully funding homeland security and the support of our troops, we preserved some key Minnesota priorities."
