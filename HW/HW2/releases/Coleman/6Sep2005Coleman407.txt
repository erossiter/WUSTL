SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IIC REPORT
  "The report confirms waste, inefficiency and corruption within the operation of the program by the United Nations.  
 It documents manipulation of Oil for Food by Saddam Hussein, administrative bungling and failings, lax oversight and an absence of strong leadership. The report also details further misconduct by the son of the Secretary General including abuse of his father's diplomatic status for financial gain - and the Secretary General's failure to address this abuse. 
   I agree wholeheartedly with the reports "inescapable conclusion" that the UN needs reform - and "it needs it urgently." I applaud the efforts of the ICC and its staff to expose the misconduct and mismanagement of UN officials. 
   The test of commitment to UN reform will be the willingness of top UN officials including the Secretary General, to accept responsibility for the fraud, abuse and mismanagement identified in the report. Now is the time to clean house at the U.N. Kofi Annan should resign and allow a new team to implement a new commitment to accountability and transparency."
