SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MIERS WITHDRAWAL
  Early this morning, Harriett Miers withdrew her nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  
 I respect her principled decision and the integrity she has shown during this nomination process. She has served the President well in her role as White House Counsel and has had a long, distinguished career in public service. She has truly been a trailblazer, rising to the highest positions throughout the legal profession. I admire Ms. Miers for her courage in making this very difficult decision. 
   As we recognize the challenges of the nomination process, I look forward to the President's next nominee, and to fulfilling our historical and constitutional role in the Senate to advise and consent as we move toward a full review, fair debate, and finally, an up or down vote on the Senate floor regarding this very important position.
