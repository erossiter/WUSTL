SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY RUMSFELD
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON RESIGNATION OF DONALD RUMSFELD: 
   The resounding message of yesterday's election was change, and change in the leadership at the Department of Defense is a good thing. In fact, I believe this change should have occurred before the election. 
   We now have an opportunity to gain a fresh perspective on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, something the American people clearly want. We need to succeed in Iraq and I am hopeful this change will help us toward that goal. The confirmation hearings for Bob Gates will present an important opportunity to have an open discussion on the path to achieving greater stability in the Middle East and winning the War on Terror.
