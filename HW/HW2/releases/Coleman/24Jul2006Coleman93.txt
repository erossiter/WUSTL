SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES COMBINED $600,000 FOR ALBANY, EDEN VALLEY
  Sen. Coleman today announced the cities of Albany and Eden Valley will each receive $300,000 loans from Stearns Electric Association as part of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Economic Development Grants program. The funding will be awarded to Stearns Electric as part of a revolving loan fund, enabling the cooperative to provide the loans to each city with little or no interest.  
   Specifically, the City of Albany Well and Water Treatment Plant will receive $300,000 to help develop a new arsenic removal water treatment plant and replace three wells abandoned due to arsenic contamination. The City of Eden Valley will receive $300,000 to be used in the construction of a new fire and rescue hall. 
   "I am pleased this funding will be awarded to these communities in Central Minnesota," Coleman said. "This funding will help Albany improve their city's water treatment, while allowing Eden Valley to expand and upgrade their fire department facilities and equipment. Both endeavors are vital to these communities, and I applaud the USDA and Stearns Electric Association for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of Albany and Eden Valley have the resources they need for these important projects." 
   Stearns Electric Association is a member-owned electric cooperative that serves residents in six central Minnesota counties including Stearns, Todd, Morrison, Kandiyohi, Pope and Douglas. 
   The USDA Rural Economic Development Grant Program provides grant funds to electric and telephone utilities financed by the Utilities Programs, an agency of the USDA, to promote sustainable rural economic development and job creation projects through the operation of a revolving loan fund program.
