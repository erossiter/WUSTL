SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING FILIBUSTERS, JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
  "The history and the rules of the Senate never anticipated that a minority of the Senate would abuse the privilege of the filibuster to prevent an up or down vote on judicial nominees.  
 I support the filibuster. I believe it is a necessary and vital tool in the Senate - and will resist any effort to undermine that tool for use in the legislative process. However, until last year, there has never before in the history of the Senate, been a filibuster of a judicial nominee who could have been confirmed - nor a precedent in which nominees were routinely filibustered in order to leverage the nomination process and prevent the Senate from voting. The President has a right to nominate judges. The Senate has the right to advise and consent. However, those who continue to obstruct both of those rights abuse the power of the filibuster to deprive Senators of their right to vote "yes" or "no" on judges. And that has to end. It must either end with compromise, or it must end with a constitutionally permissible change in Senate rules to prohibit the flagrant abuse of the filibuster."
