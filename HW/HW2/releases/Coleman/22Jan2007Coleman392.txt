SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $25,555 FOR DODGE CENTER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Dodge Center Fire Department has been awarded a $25,555 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase equipment for the department's firefighters, specifically extrication tools used to free people trapped in vehicles.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for providing this grant to the Dodge Center Fire Department, "said Coleman. "This grant will provide critical equipment to local firefighters who put their own safety on the line to help their neighbors. With the help of this grant, firefighters in Dodge Center will be better equipped to protect local residents, and I am pleased they have received this important grant." 
   "The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is a great tool for our smaller fire department," said Paul Olson of the Dodge Center Fire Department. "We are able to get important lifesaving equipment that we otherwise would not be able to afford." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
