SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL AIMED AT HARSHER PUNISHMENT FOR TERRORISM HOAXES
  Recognizing the need to prevent the perpetuation of future terrorist hoaxes, Sens. Norm Coleman (R-MN), Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today introduced legislation that would impose stricter penalties on those who commit fraudulent acts of terrorism as well as expand the definition of prosecutable offenses. 
   "Terrorizing the public through false threats is not a joke. We need to send a clear message to those thinking about hoaxes that they will pay dearly," said Coleman. "The threats may be fake but the consequences are very real in terms of costs to first responders, lost revenues and sometimes even injury or the loss of human life. By diverting resources and attention, such acts make it that much harder to protect our nation from real acts of terror. We need to make certain that the punishment fits this crime and deters any future attempts to falsely terrorize the citizens of Minnesota and across the country."  
   "It's unconscionable in this post-9/11 world, for anyone to be perpetrating hoaxes that cause panic and drain already limited public safety resources," said Kennedy. "Hopefully, this bill will fulfill its purpose of preventing the false alarms that can be so disruptive of our families and our communities in these difficult and dangerous times." 
   "U.S. law enforcement and authorities already have the monumental responsibility of protecting the United States from the real threat of terrorism," said Kyl. "It is completely unacceptable to have people, groups, and companies perpetrating fraudulent threats for personal gain and entertainment. I am pleased to join with Senator Coleman to help ensure that our law enforcement officials are able to focus on the very real terrorist threats we face today." 
   Current federal statute broadly defines the list of punishable terrorist hoaxes and does not include fraudulent terrorist acts such as hoaxes to blow up energy facilities, attacks on military bases or attacks on railways and mass transportation facilities. This legislation seeks to fill these gaps by expanding the hoax statute to punish hoaxes involving any offense included on the U.S. Code's official list of federal terrorist offenses. Specifically, the bill: 
   * Expands on the current terrorism hoax statute so this punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense on the U.S. Code's official list of terrorist offenses; 
   * Increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes about the death or injury of a U.S. soldier during wartime; 
   * Expands current law's civil liability provisions to allow first responders and others to seek reimbursement from a party who perpetrates a hoax and becomes aware that first responders believe that a terrorist offense is taking place but fails to inform authorities that no such event has occurred; and 
   * Clarifies that threatening communications are punishable under federal law even if they are directed at an organization rather than a natural person. 
   The bill increases the penalties for perpetrating a hoax about the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during wartime. Under the bill, the maximum penalty for such hoax would be 10 years' imprisonment, and a hoax resulting in serious bodily injury could be punished by up to 25 years' imprisonment. 
   "Events like the September 2001 bomb threat at the Mall of America are no laughing matter. As we in Minnesota get ready to host the Republican convention next year, now is the time to do all we can to deter terrorist threats, both real and hoaxes. This amendment will help protect our citizens from the fear and costs associated with these terrorism hoaxes," Coleman added.
