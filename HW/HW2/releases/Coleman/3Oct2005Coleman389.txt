SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO SERVE ON U.S. SUPREME COURT
  "I am pleased that President Bush has moved quickly to nominate White House Counsel Harriet Miers to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The President's decision to nominate a woman to the court is praiseworthy and sends a very important message to all of America. It is my intention to withhold judgment on this nominee as we continue to get a better sense of her qualifications as the confirmation process moves forward."
