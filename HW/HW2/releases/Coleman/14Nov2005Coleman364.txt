SEN. COLEMAN SECURES $129 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR IMPORTANT MINNESOTA PROJECTS INCLUDED IN ENERGY AND WATER CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today joined with a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate to pass the FY2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill which provides $129,168,000 in funding for 33 key Minnesota projects by a vote of 84-4. The Conference Report provides a total of $31 billion in funding for important agencies including the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy. Included in the overall funding, the report provides $24.29 billion for the Department of Energy to support important energy initiatives, including clean coal technology, and $5.38 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to help address issues in water infrastructure created by Hurricane Katrina.  
   "I am pleased to have secured these funds for Minnesota energy and flood control projects," said Coleman. "This funding will have an impact in all regions of Minnesota and will address quality of life and economic issues that affect the daily lives of our residents. It also addresses energy needs and projects important to Minnesota as we move toward a future of energy independence in this country. Today's funding helps explore the impact clean coal technology can have as we look at other sources of fuel. Additionally, after having witnessed the devastating impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we must do all we can to help address the aftermath of the storm, as well as ensure that we are prepared--in all regions of the country.
