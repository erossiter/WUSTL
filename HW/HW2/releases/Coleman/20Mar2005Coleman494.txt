SEN. COLEMAN COMMENDS BIPARTISAN SENATE EFFORT TO SAVE TERRI SCHIAVO
  Sen. Norm Coleman praised Senate passage of legislation (S. 868) that would provide the opportunity for federal court review of the Terri Schiavo case.  
 By order of Florida courts, Schiavo - who is mentally disabled but not on life support and can breathe on her own - cannot be given food or water. S. 868 has broad bipartisan support and passed the Senate by voice vote. The House of Representatives will likely vote on this measure sometime just after midnight tonight so that President Bush can sign it into law and Ms. Schiavo's feeding tube can be reinserted as soon as possible. 
   "There is nothing just, nothing natural, nothing compassionate about forbidding a family from feeding their disabled daughter," Coleman said. "Terri Schiavo has been given what amounts to an unjust and undeserved court ordered death, and the Senate's position is we cannot stand by and watch it happen. I'm profoundly moved that senators from both sides of the aisle were able to come together to protect an innocent life today. Ms. Schiavo has already gone days without food or water and it was imperative that we act as quickly as we did." 
   The bill passed by the Senate this afternoon is "for the benefit of the parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo" and gives a federal court in Florida jurisdiction over a claim "relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life."
