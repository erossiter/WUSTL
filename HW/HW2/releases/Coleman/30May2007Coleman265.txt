SEN. COLEMAN URGES SBA TO SUPPORT THOSE AFFECTED BY GUNFLINT TRAIL FIRE
  As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today joined Gov. Tim Pawlenty's call for the Small Business Administration (SBA) to address the destruction caused by the wildfire on the Gunflint Trail by making financial assistance available for businesses and residents.  
   "The Gunflint Trail fire has had a devastating effect on the both the residents and businesses in Cook County. It is my hope the SBA will recognize the hardships this fire has caused our communities and will take the necessary action," said Coleman. "I will continue working to ensure the families affected by this tragedy have the resources they need to rebuild their communities." 
   Under an SBA Disaster Declaration, home and business owners would be eligible for two different kinds of low-interest loans. Homeowners and renters would be eligible for Home Physical Disaster Loans that cover the repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed real estate not fully covered by insurance or other assistance. Business Physical Disaster Loans would be available for small and large business owners to replace or repair real estate and inventories. In order for the SBA to issue a Disaster Declaration the damage threshold of at least 25 homes and/or businesses with 40 percent or more uninsured must be reached. 
   The wildfire was ignited on Ham Lake south of the Gunflint Trail on May 5, 2007 and has burned over 74,000 acres in the United States and Canada. The American portion of the fire was contained on May 19 and Gunflint Trail has reopened; but not before over 130 residences, businesses and other structures valued at $3.7 million were lost.
