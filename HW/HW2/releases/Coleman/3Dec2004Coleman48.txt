SEN. COLEMAN, GOV. PAWLENTY ISSUE JOINT STATEMENT REGARDING FY 2005 FUNDING
  The following is a statement from Sen. Norm Coleman and Gov. Tim Pawlenty regarding the FY05 funding decisions made by the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Domestic Preparedness: 
   "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's recent decision to reduce funding for homeland security initiatives in Minnesota is surprising and disappointing. This adjustment will present challenges in the execution of some of the state's homeland security initiatives, but it will not directly affect the safety of our state. Minnesota is recognized as one of the most well-prepared states in the nation, and that status will not be diminished."
