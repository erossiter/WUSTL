SEN. COLEMAN SAYS STRONG JOBS REPORT SHOWS MORE MINNESOTANS BENEFITING FROM ECONOMIC BOOM
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the latest jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, attributing pro-growth economic policies as the source of Minnesota's continued job growth and low unemployment level. According to the most recent government figures, 15,800 jobs were created in the month of April, while the state's unemployment level remained at 4.1 percent - better than the national average of 4.7 percent. Over the past two years, more than 80,000 jobs have been created statewide.  
   "With almost 16,000 positions created last month, we nearly doubled the amount jobs created in Minnesota compared to the previous month," Coleman. "Simply put: the proof is in the pudding. Republican pro-growth policies have been the catalyst for our surging economy, and I am pleased the President recently signed the Tax Reconciliation bill which will prevent the over-taxation of middle-income taxpayers through AMT relief and help Minnesota companies innovate and grow jobs through the extension of expensing and investment tax relief." 
   According to recent government figures, 138,000 jobs were created in the month of April and the economy has now added more than 5.2 million jobs since the President's pro-growth tax policies were enacted in May 2003. The unemployment rate of 4.7 percent is the lowest rate since July 2001. The U.S. economy has now experienced 32 consecutive months of job growth. Additionally, the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2006, making it the 18th consecutive quarter of growth. 
   Coleman was also encouraged by recent figures that revealed wages in America increased by 0.5 percent - the highest wage increase since October 2005. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings increased by 3.8 percent (the best rate since August 2001) and average weekly earnings increased by 4.1 percent. Productivity continued to grow at a rate of 3.2 percent in first quarter 2006 and real compensation per hour increased at a 3.6 percent rate - 8.5 percent higher than the peak of the business cycle in early 2001.
