SEN. COLEMAN REACTS TO BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE
  "Tonight, we members of Congress from both Houses and both parties came together to hear from our commander in chief about the state of the great American Union.  
 My fellow Minnesotans, I am pleased to report that the strength of this Republic has never been stronger. 
   The President has been very bold in laying out an aggressive agenda for his second term, and tonight he presented us with a blueprint. 
   In his address tonight, required each year by our Constitution, President Bush reaffirmed his already proven steadfast commitment to fighting a relentless war on terror in the newly democratized Iraq and anywhere else terrorists lurk around the globe. He also reminded us that our work in Iraq is far from over. 
   The Coalition made a commitment to establish a peaceful and secure democracy in Iraq, and it is a commitment we will honor. 
   The President committed to working with us in Congress to pursue an aggressive domestic agenda. He promised to do his part, and we in Congress must commit to doing ours as well. 
   We must work hard to protect and preserve Social Security for current and future generations to come. We also need to make the President's tax cuts for working families permanent and stop frivolous lawsuits that clog our legal system and hurt American health care. 
   I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to deliver real and meaningful reform for the people of Minnesota. 
   May God bless you and continue to bless the United States of America."
