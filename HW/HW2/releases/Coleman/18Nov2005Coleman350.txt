SEN. COLEMAN SAYS PASSAGE OF RURAL RENAISSANCE A MAJOR VICTORY FOR GREATER MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the inclusion of his Rural Renaissance II Act in the final version of the Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S.2020) that passed the Senate early this morning. The Rural Renaissance provision authored by Coleman along with Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), was included as an amendment to the final bill and will provide $200 million worth of rural renaissance bonds to finance rural development projects. In turn, proceeds from these bonds will pay for an estimated $150 million in rural development grants. The funding will be made available to communities of less than 50,000 people and will be aimed at providing funding for critical infrastructure projects.  
   "The Rural Renaissance Act is about bringing jobs and economic growth to America's rural communities," said Coleman. "Since taking office, my staff and I have traveled across Minnesota to visit our rural communities and nearly all of them have discussed the challenge of aging and inadequate infrastructure. The Rural Renaissance Act will empower these communities to upgrade outdated, inadequate, or nonexistent basic infrastructure in order to attract new investment and jobs. I want to thank Sen. Pryor for his commitment and strong leadership on this issue. The inclusion of Rural Renaissance in the Tax reconciliation bill is a huge victory for Minnesota and Main Street America." 
   "In Arkansas and throughout the country, families are leaving rural communities for cities with infrastructure already in place and a better standard of living," Sen. Pryor said. "This bill will help reverse the trend by infusing small rural communities with the resources necessary to meet basic infrastructure needs and attract new businesses. I'm glad that Senator Coleman and I were able to convince our colleagues of the importance of this legislation." 
   "If we truly want to ensure that rural America can create the kinds of jobs that will keep people living, raising families, and working in our rural communities, investing in basic infrastructure is a must," said Mark Glaess, Manager of the Minnesota Rural Electric Association. "The Rural Renaissance Act makes the down payment on the future of rural America. We are proud to support it and we commend Senator Coleman on the Senate's adoption of this critical piece of legislation." 
   "Minnesota Rural Water Association is pleased to support the passage of the Rural Renaissance Act," said Luther Johnson, Chairman, Minnesota Rural Water Association. "There is an extreme shortfall of infrastructure funding within rural Minnesota. "This passage of this Act will bring additional subsidized funding to small and rural water suppliers that are greatly in need, in addition to a much needed investment in rural Minnesota's infrastructure, economy, and the protection of our greatest resource: safe, affordable drinking water." 
   Senator Coleman originally introduced the Rural Renaissance II Act in March of 2005 in an effort to improve economic development in rural communities. Under the legislation, bonds and grants will fund rural utility infrastructure; water and waste facilities; affordable housing; renewable farmer-owned energy projects; broadband technology; distance learning and telemedicine; and community facilities, including hospitals, fire and police stations, and nursing and assisted living facilities. 
   Since its introduction, the measure has received overwhelming support from national organizations, as well as Minnesota cities and towns. Among them include: 
   * Telecommunications Industry Association 
   * National Council of Farmer Cooperatives 
   * Renewable Fuels Association 
   * American Sugarbeet Growers Association 
   * Red River Valley Sugarbeet Growers Association 
   * National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges 
   * League of Minnesota Cities 
   * Minnesota Corn Growers Association 
   As a whole, the Tax Reconciliation Act will provide $60 billion in tax relief over 5 years for small businesses, teachers, college students, and middle-income families. This bill includes two additional proposals authored by Sen. Coleman that are aimed at providing students resources to compete globally in math and science, and protecting honest taxpayers from abusive and sham tax shelters which have allowed dishonest taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share. The bill, which was approved by a vote of 64-33.
