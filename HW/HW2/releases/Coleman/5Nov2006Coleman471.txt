SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SADDAM HUSSEIN VERDICT
  Today's verdict is the culmination of a process that will serve as a milestone for the Iraqi judicial system. More importantly, justice has been served for the families whose loved ones were murdered and tortured under Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. I am hopeful that with this verdict the healing process can begin and help to pave the way for the rule of law and democracy to take hold.
