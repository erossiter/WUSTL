SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON COAST GUARD'S EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD
  I am pleased the Coast Guard was responsive to calls for an extension to the public comment period. With an additional 60 days for public comment, Minnesotans will have the opportunity to learn more and comment about the specifics of the proposed exercises. It is also my understanding that the Coast Guard will be holding public hearings to address the concerns of communities near the proposed exercise areas. I have urged them to hold one of these hearings in Minnesota.
