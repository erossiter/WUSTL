SEN. NORM COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAN
  "Iran is thumbing its nose at the world. Its recent decision to resume nuclear research is a direct challenge to the international community.  
 The civilized world cannot allow Iran to continue its quest for a nuclear weapon and must take immediate action. Let's be perfectly clear: Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and the recent comments of Iranian President Ahmadinejad advocating for the destruction of Israel expose the malicious intent of a nuclear-armed Iran. I strongly support the efforts of the Administration to refer Iran to the U.N. Security Council. 
   I am also pleased to see the EU countries of France, Germany, and Great Britain advocate for U.N. Security Council action. It is critical that the international community speak with one collective voice and work together to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. In addition, in order for the IAEA to remain a key component of global security, it is critical that the international community heed the call of the IAEA and refer Iran to the Security Council for action. The time to act is not the day after Iran creates its first nuclear weapon. It is important to emphasize that what we know about Iran's nuclear program is dramatically overshadowed by what we do not know."
