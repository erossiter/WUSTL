SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMPORTED ETHANOL TARIFF
  STATEMENT FROM SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON THE IMPORTED ETHANOL TARIFF: 
   Suspending the tariff on imported ethanol won't solve Americans' high gas price problems in the near term, but it would undercut the development of a strong renewable fuels industry in the United States - making us more reliant of foreign fuel. Administrator Caruso, with the Department of Energy, recently indicated that lifting the tariff would provide negligible benefits at best. Moreover, the U.S. currently has a 24 day supply of ethanol in storage and ethanol production is projected to increase by 2.3 billion gallons in the next year. 
   What lifting the tariff would do is undermine the growth of our domestic renewable fuels production, while subsidizing Brazilian sugar growers in the process. Lifting the tariff would give Brazilian ethanol producers the benefit of the U.S. ethanol tax credit, providing foreign producers an incentive to import ethanol to the U.S. This tax credit is designed to build a strong renewable fuels industry at home, we shouldn't trade one form of foreign fuel dependence for another - we don't need to start a Brazilian ethanol addiction.
