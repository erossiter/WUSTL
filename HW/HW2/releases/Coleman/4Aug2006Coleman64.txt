SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES CONSISTENT JOB GROWTH FOR JULY
  Sen. Norm Coleman praised today's government jobs report showing continued solid job growth and strong wage gains in July. For the month of July, 113,000 new jobs were created. Since the enactment of pro-growth tax policies in May 2003, the economy has generated 5.5 million new jobs. The July unemployment rate of 4.8 is below the unemployment average rate of each of the past three decades. Wage gains were strong again with average hourly earnings increasing by 3.8 percent and average weekly earnings by 4.1 over the year.  
   "The strength of the American economy continues to be strikingly evident, as evidenced by 35 month straight months of job growth and 19 straight quarters of economic expansion," Coleman. "I am optimistic that despite the current challenges of rising inflation, a housing slowdown and heightened geopolitical tensions, our economy will remain fundamentally sound in the months ahead." 
   According to the latest state figures, Minnesota created over 15,000 jobs in June and the state's unemployment level fell to 3.6 percent- the lowest rate since March 2001. Nearly 33,000 jobs were created in the state during the second quarter, equaling 10 percent of the nation's growth - the best job growth since 1984.
