SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON DEATH OF BENAZIR BHUTTO
  "I strongly condemn the murder of Benazir Bhutto, which was committed by forces in Pakistan who are working to subvert the process of political reconciliation and democratization. As an advocate for democracy in Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto put her love of country above her own safety and paid the ultimate price for her principles. The best way to honor her memory is to continue advancing the democratic process for which she gave her life. The perpetrators of this murder must be brought to justice, and Pakistan must continue a path back to the rule of law and democratic rule."
