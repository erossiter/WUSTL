SEN. COLEMAN ENCOURAGED BY STEADY GROWTH IN NEW JOBS, WAGES
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today praised today's June jobs report, which shows continued solid job growth and impressive wage gains. According to the Labor Department, 121,000 jobs were created in June while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent- the lowest rate since July 2001 and below the averages of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. More impressively, the report also showed that average hourly wages increased by nearly 4 percent in the past year and average weekly earnings by 4.5 percent. The jobs reports follows a recent government report revising first quarter GDP to 5.6 percent from the previous estimate of 5.3 percent.  
   "Despite heightened risks to the economy such as higher energy prices and greater geopolitical uncertainty, the economy remains fundamentally sound," said Coleman. "The economy is better now for Minnesotans and all Americans then it was when we first implemented the pro-growth agenda in 2003. We are seeing the fruits of Republican pro-growth policies pay-off with 18 straight quarters of economic growth, 34 straight months of job growth, higher wages, and record federal revenues. The strength and vitality of our economy is by no accident, but is in part the result of pro-growth policies that have enabled the great American entrepreneurial spirit to flourish." 
   "Although I am proud of the strong economic progress, I will continue to work hard to support policies that encourage the creation of good high paying jobs for folks in Minnesota and across the country, while at the same time working to address the Americans' everyday concerns such as ever higher health care costs and energy prices," Coleman added.
