SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES SELECTION OF UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA BASED NETWORK FOR HIV/AIDS RESEARCH AWARD
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the University of Minnesota-based International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT) has been selected as one of just six networks to help lead the newly restructured HIV/AIDS clinical trials networks by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The selection will position the network as a national leader in spearheading the next generation of HIV/AIDS research forward through a direct focus on clinical research and innovation into prevention and treatment. The network is expected to receive $13 million in grant funding during the first year of this award.  
   "The selection of the INSIGHT, which is based at the University of Minnesota, is both a tribute to their world-class research abilities and a signal of the importance of taking on this disease," said Coleman. "I have seen the heartbreaking effects of this disease on individuals and their loved ones, and as a result have pushed for greater focus on preventing and fighting HIV and AIDS during my time in office. Finding a way to prevent and treat this terrible disease is truly one of the greatest health care challenges in the world today, and by taking the lead in this effort, the University of Minnesota, INSIGHT, and the NIAID deserve our utmost appreciation and support." 
   "This award is very important for the University of Minnesota and for advancing knowledge about HIV," said James Neaton, Ph.D, who will be heading the INSIGHT research. "INSIGHT involves about 400 different sites in 37 countries. Our research will be focused on optimizing HIV therapies over the long-term and the prevention of complications of HIV treatment." 
   The awards, established with the support of Congress, are the first part in a two-step process that will establish six new networks of investigators and institutions. Each of the networks have developed plans to research safe, effective treatments and prevention strategies for HIV/AIDS including vaccines, new drugs, clinical management, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. 
   Other networks selected are as follows: 
   * AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) based at the University of California, San Diego 
  * HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville 
  * HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle 
  * International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinic Trials (IMPAACT) based at the John Hopkings University School of Medicine in Baltimore 
  * Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) based at the Magee-Womens Research institute in Pittsburgh.
