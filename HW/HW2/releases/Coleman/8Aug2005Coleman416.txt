SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON VOLKER'S INDEPENDENT INQUIRY COMMITTEE REPORT
  The report today proves what my Subcommittee learned in February: Benon Sevan was taking kickbacks from the former Hussein regime. The fact that the head of the Oil-for-Food Program received illicit, under-the-table payments from Saddam Hussein and that he successfully blocked an audit of his own office highlights the need for reform and new management at the UN.
