SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF PLAYWRIGHT AUGUST WILSON
  August Wilson was a gifted and celebrated playwright, capturing two Pulitzer Prizes throughout the course of his career.  
 I am pleased that St. Paul played a large role in his life and served as an inspiration to many of his early works. Wilson embodied the best of our rich literary and artistic history, and at the same time, served the best interests of a nation that was divided among racial lines. Staging his first play at St. Paul's Penumbra Theater, his artistic vision has helped them to become a world class venue for future playwrights. Wilson's legacy is indelibly printed in the fabric of our community and he will be remembered among the greats of American theater.
