SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD HEARING ON HURICANE KATRINA RESPONSE
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs (HSGAC) will hold its fourth hearing on the initial government response to Hurricane Katrina, tomorrow, October 20th at 9:30 a.m. in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.  
 Coleman and other members of the committee will hear testimony from Marty Bahamonde, who was the first Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) official on the ground in Louisiana for Hurricane Katrina and is FEMA's Regional Director for the area. 
   "I am looking forward to tomorrow's hearing as we continue the investigation into the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina," said Coleman. "There is no question that mistakes were made in the initial response and it is crucial that we do not repeat these mistakes in the future. As one of the first officials on the ground, Mr. Bahamonde's testimony will help shed light on the facts surrounding FEMA's response and his experiences will play a large role in helping us ensure that we are adequately prepared for future disasters." 
   Bahamonde was originally sent to Louisiana on August 27th, before the Hurricane, and communicated with FEMA regarding what was happening on the ground before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina. His testimony is expected to focus on both the preparations and response of FEMA and the federal government as a whole.
