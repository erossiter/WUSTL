APPROPRIATIONS BILL CONTAINS FUNDING FOR KEY MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD PROJECTS
  Senator Norm Coleman today applauded the inclusion of two key Minnesota National Guard projects he worked to secure in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill. Coleman's first measure will provide $17,450,000 for phases I and II of the Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF) at Camp Ripley in Minnesota. When completed, this landmark facility will consist of structures and mock utilities that simulate an urban setting and, most importantly, the facility will have the potential to allow Minnesota National Guard troops to train closer to home in advance of any future deployments.  
   Coleman was also successful in including $1,500,000 for a wing storage facility for the 148th Fighter Wing in Duluth, Minnesota in the bill. The 148th Fighter Wing currently has four separate storage facilities that are poorly configured, have failing structural systems and are currently situated along the Wing's new base entry road. Failing floor slabs are subject to water infiltration, thus putting them in danger of significant damage. This project will properly locate wing storage to eliminate safety hazards, avoid interference with the current wing master plan, as well as provide the storage and supply space required to efficiently accomplish the mission. 
   "This funding is great news for Minnesota National Guard troops and their families as it will significantly cut down on their time away from home," said Coleman. "Building a top notch National Guard urban training center right here in Minnesota will not only significantly improve our troops' urban warfare skills, it will improve their overall quality of life by allowing them to stay close to their family and friends during training. I am thrilled to see these provisions included in this bill, as it will greatly benefit our troops and their families."
