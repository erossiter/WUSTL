SEN. COLEMAN CONFIDENT IN CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the latest strong job numbers and economic growth reported by the U.S. Department of Labor. According to the most recent figures, the U.S. added 108,000 jobs during the month of December, and unemployment fell to 4.9 percent--lower than the average of the previous three decades. Recent estimates also show that the economy created roughly two million jobs in 2005, and since May of 2003, the economy has created more than 4.6 million jobs. The U.S. economy continues to grow faster than many other industrialized nations, and the latest figures show that GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth has exceeded 3 percent for 10 consecutive quarters.  
   "A glance at last year's job numbers will lead you to only one conclusion: the state of our economy is strong," said Coleman. "Overall, I am not surprised at the rapid pace by which our economy has grown. 2005 was a year of pro-growth policies, from Deficit Reduction Act to the Energy bill. It was a year that, despite many sizable challenges, demonstrated the incredible resiliency of our economy, the steadfast resolve of Congress to get things done, and confidence by the American public. Moreover, our economic outlook for 2006 looks promising, and as we move forward I will work hard to continue this trend of expansion and prosperity." 
   Minnesota also continues to show steady job growth. Throughout the past year, nearly 34,000 jobs have been created in Minnesota, while the unemployment rate stands at 3.9 percent--down from 4.4 percent one year ago. 
   "Almost all of our job sectors have seen growth during 2005," said Coleman. "Over the last two and half years we have created over four million, however, there is still more to done. I look forward to passage of the Tax Reconciliation Bill that will help small businesses reinvest and grow jobs."
