SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA
 STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA:  
   In light of North Korea's reckless disregard for the safety and stability of the international community, it is encouraging to see the Security Council reach common ground and impose stiff sanctions. The resolution is an important step towards holding North Korea accountable for its weapons program. Today the world spoke with one voice, and now the onus is on North Korea to act accordingly. As we move forward, it is important to recognize Ambassador Bolton for working swiftly to craft a tough resolution that could be agreed upon by this international body.
