SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS EDUCATION PROVISIONS IN TAX RELIEF BILL
In an effort to address the rising cost of college tuition and the financial burden assumed by teachers as part of their efforts to provide a quality education, Sen. Norm Coleman last week joined his Senate colleagues in voting to pass the Tax Relief and Health Care Act by a vote of 79 to 9. The measure, which includes a wide-range of tax provisions, extends a $250 deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket school related expenses and a deduction of up to $4,000 for higher education expenses through 2007. Having passed both the Senate and House, the bill will now head to the President's desk for his signature.  
 "Today, Minnesota's educational system is facing major challenges - too often our teachers are picking up the slack for tight school budgets, while many hard working middle class families are facing ever rising college costs," said Coleman. "Ensuring that all Americans have access to a quality education, regardless of financial status, is one of my top priorities. And by passing this bill, we are taking an important step towards making that a reality, and at the same time providing the necessary assistance for our teachers with their classroom expenses." 
 Since taking office, Senator Coleman has been leading the charge to make college more affordable. Recently, Coleman sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman calling for an increase to the maximum Pell grant award in the President's fiscal year 2008 budget. Additionally, Coleman sent a letter to Senate Leadership asking for an additional $2 billion in funding for health and education in the FY07 budget.
