ON EVE OF ROSH HASHANAH, SEN. COLEMAN SPEAKS ON SENATE FLOOR ON DISTURBING RISE IN INCIDENTS OF ANTI-SEMITISM
  Sen. Norm Coleman took the Senate floor this morning to speak out against the recent rise in incidents of anti-Semitism here in the United States and around the world.  
 Coleman, who is Jewish, spoke out against defaming any minority or religious group and reminded the American people that we must be vigilant in promoting human rights and fighting defamation here at home and across the globe.
   "One of the ironies of this subject lies in the word "anti-Semitic," Coleman said in his remarks this morning. "In common usage it means prejudice or bigotry against Jews. But when you look up the word "Semite", you see it refers to members of the Jewish and Arab peoples. Strictly speaking to be "anti-Semitic" could mean expressing hatred of Arabs. That illustrates an important point. A statement of hatred against any group of people should be abhorred by freedom loving people from every group. Because hatred has a way of spreading and hurting people all around its intended target."
   "Six million Jews were killed in Europe during the Holocaust. We vowed we would never let it happen again," Coleman continued. "But the new millennium has brought to Europe a wave of anti-Semitism unlike anything we have seen since the 1930s. In France, which is home to Europe's largest Jewish community (with about 600,000), there have been and continue to be more anti-Semitic attacks than elsewhere in Europe. Just last month the Jewish cemetery in Lyon was spray-painted with swastikas, and other anti-Semitic symbols. In Paris this spring, a 12-year-old girl coming out of a Jewish school was attacked by two men who carved a swastika into her face."
