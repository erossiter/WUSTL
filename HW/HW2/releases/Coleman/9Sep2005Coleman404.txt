SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECALLING OF FEMA LEADERSHIP TO WASHINGTON
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on the Recalling of FEMA Leadership to Washington 
   With the relief effort in full swing, I support Secretary Chertoff's decision to replace the FEMA leadership on the ground. It is important that we eliminate any potential distractions from the ongoing ground recovery and relief to ensure that our focus remains solely on the victims and their families. 
   Coast Guard Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen has led the relief and rescue efforts in New Orleans and it is my hope that progress will continue to be made as we work towards providing essentials such as water, food, shelter, and most importantly, connecting families with their loved ones.
