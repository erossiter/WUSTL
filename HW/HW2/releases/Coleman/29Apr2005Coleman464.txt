SEN. COLEMAN RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Reaction from Sen. Coleman to the President's remarks yesterday on social security: 
  "These are the facts: the Social Security program of today cannot guarantee the retirement security of generations tomorrow. Back in the 1950s, Social Security had 16 workers paying in for every one retiree drawing out, but today that ratio has fallen to just three to one. And by the time our kids retire, it will be two to one. In 13 short years, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. You don't have to be an accountant to realize there is a serious problem looming. 
   No one in today's debate on the future of Social Security advocates changing the program whatsoever for those born before 1950. But, as the President stated, action needs to be taken to ensure the retirement security of future generations and guarantee that they too have a nest egg equal to or greater than today's seniors. And we absolutely must construct a system so that not a single American senior collects benefits that leaves him or her below the poverty line, where 2 million seniors sadly remain today. Personal accounts are certainly an option worth looking at, but they alone cannot fix the system, and I am committed to exploring all proposals on the table."
