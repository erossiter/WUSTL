SEN. COLEMAN TO HOST HEALTHCARE TOWN HALLS IN ROCHESTER, ST. CLOUD, MINNEAPOLIS ON OCT. 10TH
  Senator Norm Coleman will be hosting three town hall listening sessions in Rochester, St. Cloud and Minneapolis on Wednesday, October 10th to discuss the issue of healthcare reform. Coleman will host the public forums to present an overview of his vision for healthcare security and reform, while also seeking input from Minnesotans on their ideas and concerns.  
   "As I travel around Minnesota, there is no single domestic issue that I hear more concern about than healthcare," Coleman said. "I am in the process of putting forth a plan that will ensure every American has access to affordable health insurance that they, not the government, control. As this plan comes together, I want to ensure I am addressing the needs of Minnesotans and I invite everyone who is interested in this issue to come to these listening sessions to relay their concerns and ideas."
