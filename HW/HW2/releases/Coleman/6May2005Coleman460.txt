SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING VOLCKER'S REMARKS
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman regarding remarks today by Mr.  
 Paul Volcker:
   "I appreciate Mr. Volcker's efforts to clear the air regarding the recent resignation of Robert Parton from the Independent Inquiry Commission (IIC). I have spoken with Mr. Volcker, and he put forward a very constructive way for Mr. Parton to cooperate with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation's inquiry while still addressing relevant confidentiality concerns. This is the kind of transparency that I and other Congressional investigators feel is vital to preserving the integrity of the IIC's important investigation. I believe today's positive development allows the IIC to move forward knowing it has the confidence of Congressional investigators and the American people."
