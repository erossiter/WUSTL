SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE FARM BILL PACKAGE
  Senator Norm Coleman Statement Re: House Farm Bill Package:
   "With unanimous approval in committee of Chairman Peterson's farm bill package, Minnesota's chairman has proven it's possible to pass a strong, bipartisan farm bill. Minnesota is well-served by Chairman Peterson's proposal which preserves the farm safety net, strengthens our nutrition, rural development and conservation programs, and promotes the growth of renewable fuels, while including responsible reforms. I will continue working to pass an equally effective farm bill in the Senate."
