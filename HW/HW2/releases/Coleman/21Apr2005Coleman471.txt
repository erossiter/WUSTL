SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  "I'm pleased to announce that today the Senate unanimously approved a supplemental appropriations bill to support our troops on the front lines of the War on Terror.  
 I want to make certain that our servicemen and women have all the equipment and support they need to successfully carry out the mission so they can come home safely. I was also pleased that we were able to increase survivor benefits to our servicemen and women who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. By increasing benefits from $12,000 to $100,000 we can at least provide some meaningful financial support to help families who have suffered a loss. The increase in humanitarian aid that I coauthored will help meet critical food nutrition needs around the globe, particularly in Tsunami-hit regions."
