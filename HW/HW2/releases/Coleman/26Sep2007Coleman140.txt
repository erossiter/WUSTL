SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $300,000 GRANT FOR EAST OTTER TAIL TELEPHONE COOPERATIVE
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced East Otter Tail Telephone Cooperative in Perham has been awarded a $300,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development agency. The grant will allow the cooperative to loan the grant funds to the City of Parkers Prairie to help pay for the city's new community center. Along with the $300,000 loan, East Otter Tail County Telephone will provide an additional 20 percent, or $60,0000, to the city.  
   "This funding from USDA will allow Parkers Prairie to finance the new community center for their town without straining their limited tax base," Coleman said. "This project will have a positive impact on this community and I thank USDA and East Otter Tail Telephone for working together to provide these resources to the folks in Parkers Prairie." 
   "We're honored to be able to receive this on behalf of the Parkers Prairie," said David Schornack, Director of Business Development of East Otter Tail Telephone Cooperative. "This will provide a big boost for the Parkers Prairie community, allowing them pay back the loan for their community center." 
   The grant funding is being awarded through Rural Development's Rural Economic Development Grant program, which awards grants to rural utilities borrowers who in turn loan the funds to area economic development ventures. Nationally, 30 recipients will receive $16.6 million in loans and grants to spur economic development with the objective to create or save nearly 2,200 jobs in 18 states. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion throughout Minnesota for equity and technical assistance to finance and foster growth in homeownership, business development, and critical community and technology infrastructure.
