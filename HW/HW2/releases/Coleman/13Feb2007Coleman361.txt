SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON REP. NORWOOD
  I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Rep. Charlie Norwood. The state of Georgia - and in fact the whole country - lost a great Congressman and tireless advocate for the healthcare community today. I was proud to work with Rep. Norwood on several healthcare initiatives and it is my hope that Congress can continue his legacy of healthcare advocacy and pass his concurrent resolution recognizing the need to pursue research into the causes and treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
