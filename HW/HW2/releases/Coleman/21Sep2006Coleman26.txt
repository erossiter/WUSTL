SEN. COLEMAN SELECTED AS CONFEREE TO PORT SECURITY BILL
 Sen. Norm Coleman yesterday was selected by Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) to serve as a conferee on the House-Senate Port Security Conference Committee. As a conferee, Coleman will work towards finding common ground on this legislation to bolster the security of our nation's ports.  
   Additionally, Coleman will work to ensure that his amendment to create a pilot project in three foreign seaports to test an integrated scanning system using non-intrusive inspection and radiation detection equipment remains in the final bill. Specifically, the Coleman amendment requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to fully deploy the integrated scanning system once it has been fully tested through the pilot program and can be done in a way that is effective and does not significantly disrupt international trade. To help ensure the transition to full implementation, the amendment also instructs the Secretary to issue progress reports on the screening system every six months. The system will mirror a similar one Coleman examined in Hong Kong, where each maritime container passing through port is scanned for dangerous materials without impeding the flow of commerce.
