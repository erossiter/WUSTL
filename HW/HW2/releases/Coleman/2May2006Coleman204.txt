SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON APPOINTMENT OF ACHIM STEINER AS HEAD OF U.N. ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on the appointment of Achim Steiner: 
   I was disappointed to learn that Kofi Annan has hired Achim Steiner to head the U.N. Environmental Program, shortly after he helped steer a $500,000 award to Mr. Annan. Questions about Mr. Annan's ethical judgment are once again being raised; further diverting focus away from a floundering U.N. reform effort. My hope is that Mr. Annan will quickly place the $500,000 in the hands of an independent third-party, who will then distribute the funds to an appropriate charity or organization.
