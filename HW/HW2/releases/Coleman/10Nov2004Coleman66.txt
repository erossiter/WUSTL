SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT HONORING AMERICAN VETERANS
  " 'Freedom,' it was once written, 'is never free.' This Veterans Day, we honor the American heroes who paid with their service and sacrifice to make the liberties we cherish safe and secure.  
 Thanks to them, the lamp of liberty shines upon more peoples of the world than ever before. On this day, a grateful nation pauses to remember that those blessings of freedom our country enjoys today came at a cost paid valiantly by brave men and women in the uniform.
   As our courageous veterans have given much to us, so we too owe much to them. As a proud son of a World War II veteran, I understand that we have a covenant to keep and remain committed to fighting for the benefits and quality health care American veterans more than deserve.
   On this day of remembrance, we also honor the brave men and women who wear the uniform today. We salute them for heeding the call to defend freedom and offer our prayers for their safe return home.
   May God bless America."
