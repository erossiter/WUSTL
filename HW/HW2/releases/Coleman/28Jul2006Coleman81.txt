SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESUMPTION OF BEEF TRADE WITH JAPAN
  Statement From Sen. Norm Coleman On Japan Beef: 
   Japan's announcement that it will resume imports of U.S. beef is good news for ranchers across Minnesota and the nation. I have fought for our cattlemen from the very beginning, and urged President Bush to address this critical issue in his recent meeting with Prime Minister Koizumi. While I'm glad the message was received, I am concerned that the agreement includes a restriction on beef over 20 months of age. Nevertheless, I am confident this agreement will provide us with the momentum we need to move to full resumption of the beef trade with Japan in the near future.
