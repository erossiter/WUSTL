SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $106,971 GRANT FOR THE CONFEDERATION OF SOMALI COMMUNITY IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Coleman announced today the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota (CSCM) will receive a $106,971 Ethnic Community Self-Help grant from the United States Office of Refugee Resettlement. The grant will support the work of the East African Women's Center in contextual language learning, school readiness and parenting in America, the Woman to Woman Connection (a support network to bridge cultures), navigation of the social service and healthcare systems, and a textile cooperative.  
   "I am pleased to announce CSCM will receive this grant," said Coleman. "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the country, and I have pledged to offer my support for them in Congress. CSCM does fantastic work on behalf of the local Somali community. I was pleased to assist them in obtaining this grant and I applaud the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement for recognizing the importance of CSCM." 
   "I feel great. We are happy to receive the grant," said Saeed Fahia, Executive Director of the CSCM. "It will help the Somali women to integrate into the state of Minnesota. Senator Coleman helped secure this grant for us and we appreciate it." 
   Senator Coleman has worked closely with the Somali community while in the Senate, having most recently secured the extension of Temporary Protected Status for certain Somalis living in the United States. Coleman also has a Somali immigrant, Mahamoud Wardere, on his staff to help facilitate and increase his outreach to the Somali community.
