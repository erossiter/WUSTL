SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $23,500 FOR WARROAD POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Warroad Police Department has been awarded a $23,500 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program. The funding will allow the Police Department to implement the G.R.E.A.T. program, which focuses on preventing juvenile delinquency and youth violence, in Warroad's public school system.  
   "Delinquency and youth violence are problems that need to be addressed early in our children's lives," said Coleman. "The G.R.E.A.T. program has proven successful across the country, and I'm pleased kids in and around Warroad will benefit from these funds. The Warroad Police Department, Warroad school system and the entire community can be proud of this effort, and I applaud their commitment to fighting violence - beginning in their schools." 
   "This program provides life skills to kids for avoiding delinquency and problems associated with violence," said Warroad Police Chief Robert Cudaback "This grant will allow us to place an officer into the school for seven hours a day, five days a week. We will provide education to every 4th-8th grade student in Warroad and also do work for students in grades 9-12. It will also allow officers to interact with kids in the schools, build trust with them and get more familiar with the problems they face." 
   The G.R.E.A.T program coordinates with federal, regional, state and local agencies, as well as individuals from community and civic groups, to train law enforcement officers in providing instruction to school-aged children on avoiding gang pressure and youth violence. Since its inception in 1991, over 8,000 law enforcement officers have been certified as G.R.E.A.T. instructors and more than four million students have graduated from the program.
