SEN. COLEMAN SECURES $123 MILLION IN MILITARY, DEFENSE FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that he was successful in securing more than $123 million for Minnesota as part of the 2005 Defense Appropriations Bill.  
 The bill is currently under consideration in the U.S. Senate. 
   "This funding not only benefits our communities but it allows us to move forward with important projects meant to keep our country safe," Coleman said. "Minnesota is the home for some pretty advanced and important technology and this funding will help that technology see the light of day."
   Several defense projects in the Twin Cities and in greater Minnesota will benefit from this funding, including:
   * $16 million for Honeywell's military aircraft and missile navigation systems.
   * $15 million for Cray's super computers.
   * $13 million for Lockheed Martin to update communications equipment in submarines.
   * $12 million for Goodrich's surveillance system that provides additional security for military ships sitting
  in port.
   * $10 million for Polaris' work on light-weight, tactical all-terrain vehicles used by U.S. Special Operations.
   * $8.8 million to help 3M's development of medical records technology for military hospitals and $6 million for the company's equipment to detect biological contamination.
   * $4 million for Aeromet to develop military aircraft components.
   * $4 million for SAGE to continue research on electrochromic windows technology.
   * $2 million to help the University of Minnesota establish the National Hypersonic Research Center and $1 million for the university's work on muscle and motor nerve research.
   "Once we are able to pass this appropriations bill through the Senate, I will work to ensure these appropriations remain part of the final version agreed to by both the House and Senate," said Coleman.
