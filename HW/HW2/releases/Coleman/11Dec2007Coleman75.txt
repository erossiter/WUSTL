SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES GUATEMALAN PROGRESS ON PROTECTING PENDING ADOPTIONS
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement today in response to the Guatemalan legislature's preliminary approval of new adoption law that includes a provision addressing the concerns over pending adoptions between Guatemala and the United States:  
   "While we are still receiving the exact details of the legislation, I am encouraged by preliminary reports that the bill contains a grandfather clause that will allow adoptions that are already in the pipeline under the current system to be completed after January 1st. After hearing serious concerns from so many Minnesota families in the process of adopting children from Guatemala, I traveled to the country a few weeks ago to stress how vital it was for the Guatemalan Congress to pass an adoption law that would ensure these families were protected in the transition to a new adoption system. I was assured during my visit that these families would be protected, and I applaud Guatemala's legislators for taking the important step of passing legislation today on this matter. I pledge to continue working on behalf of Minnesota families whose adoptions are underway to better define where in the process they must be by January 1st in order to be grandfathered under this new law."
