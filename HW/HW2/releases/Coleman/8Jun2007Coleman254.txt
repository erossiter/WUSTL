SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $425,521 GRANT FOR REDWOOD FALLS MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a $425, 521 federal grant for upgrades to Redwood Falls Municipal Airport in Redwood Falls. The grant will be used to make multiple improvements to the airport, including runway vertical and visual guidance improvements, airport drainage, and conducting environmental assessments.  
   "I am excited for the folks in and about Redwood Falls that will benefit from this grant," said Coleman. "I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. This grant will help in the planning for forthcoming development at Redwood Falls Municipal, while improving the overall safety of the airport. I am thankful that the FAA recognizes the importance of this, and I applaud them awarding this funding." 
   "We are going to use the money for land acquisition, environmental studies, storm drainage, and apron repair," stated City Engineer Ronald Mannz. "We are appreciative of getting this money so we can move our airport projects further." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
