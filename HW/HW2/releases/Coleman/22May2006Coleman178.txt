SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $3,136,000 FOR CITY OF BIRD ISLAND
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Bird Island has received a $2,806,000 loan and a $330,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. This combined funding will be used to complete work on the city's water, sewer, and storm sewer systems.  
   "Across Minnesota, rural communities are suffering from an aging and inadequate infrastructure, with water treatment systems often posing the greatest challenges," said Coleman. "This funding from USDA will allow the folks in Bird Island a chance to meet the needs of their community, both now and in the future, and I am pleased they have received these monies. USDA Rural Development continues to provide critical dollars for projects across Minnesota, and I applaud their commitment to the City of Bird Island." 
   "Right now we have a combined storm sewer and sanitary system," said Paul Heyl, Mayor of Bird Island. "This grant will be used to separate our storm sewer from our sanitary sewer, helping us meet Minnesota's pollution standards while also helping reduce pollution in the Minnesota River. The amount of money we were granted will help put us over the top in paying for this project. We want to thank USDA and their local representatives for helping us secure the funding to complete this project." 
   Across Minnesota, USDA Rural Development has now awarded over $2.5 billion for rural economic development improvements since 2001.
