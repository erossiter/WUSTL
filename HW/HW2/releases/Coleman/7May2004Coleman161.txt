SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RUMSFELD TESTIMONY
  "I made it very clear earlier this week that those at the highest levels at the Department of Defense owed the American and Iraqi peoples an explanation and an apology.  
 At today's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary Rumsfeld did exactly that. 
   The Secretary's testimony was contrite, candid and thorough. While I believe these are discussions that should have taken place months ago, I am hopeful that these hearings, as well as the naming of the special commission to investigate the abuses, will be part of a much-needed process to make amends for the great damage that has been done by a few men and women."
