SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF FY06 AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL WITH FUNDING FOR KEY MINNESOTA PROJECTS
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that he was able to secure $400,000 to create a new soybean genomics research position at the University of Minnesota in the FY06 Agriculture appropriation bill. Coleman also worked to include a provision to hold down electricity rates for thousands of Minnesota consumers, along with funding for some high priority rural wastewater projects in Minnesota communities and other key state projects. Having now passed the Senate by a vote of 97-2, this bill will now head to a House-Senate Conference to finalize funding levels.  
   "I'm pleased to have secured nearly a half million dollars for a new soybean genomics research position at the U of M, and to have included a provision in the bill to prevent electricity rate hikes for more than a half million homes," said Coleman. "Among other important Minnesota funding priorities, I was also pleased to secure funding for wastewater projects in several rural Minnesota communities where the need is especially pressing, as well as to fight Johne's Disease particularly in dairy cattle." 
   The FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which funds key agricultural programs, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and the Food Stamp program, will provide $100.72 billion in funding for these various departments and agencies. 
   "This bill funds some of our nation's most important federal agencies and programs," added Coleman. "Minnesota farmers play a prominent role in feeding our world and I believe this bill will help to continue that proud tradition." 
   Key provisions in the legislation that will benefit Minnesota are listed below. 
   * $400,000 for Soybean Genomics Research at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul campus. 
   "Senator Coleman has really come through for Minnesota\'s soybean farmers," said Minnesota Soybean Growers Association President Bob Worth. "He and his office made our soybean genomics proposal their top priority, and as a result we\'re a big step closer to getting started on research that could eventually raise farm income in our state by $25 million." 
   * This bill will make a statutory change allowing Great River Energy (GRE) to refinance with the Rural Utilities Service, preventing increases for an estimated 550,000 rural electric cooperative rate payers and 1.5 million GRE customers. 
   "The Senator fashioned a provision that was adopted in the Senate Agriculture Appropriation bill to extend an existing loan for Great River Energy.The extension allows the generation and transmission cooperative to meet its depreciation obligation without raising rates to do so. Since it\'s an existing loan, the extension doesn\'t cost the Treasury any money. Few legislators could save rural Minnesotans upwards to $150 million without costing the Treasury any money. Senator Coleman did and we are exceptionally appreciative." Mark Glaess, MN Rural Electric Association Manager. 
   * A directive to fund wastewater facilities for: (1) the Red Rock Rural Water; (2) the City of Nelson; (3) the City of Askov; (4) the City of Walters; and the City of Mentor. Basic infrastructure funding is critical to jobs creation and the economic viability of rural communities, so people can continue to live, work, and raise their families in these communities. 
   "We are pleased to receive these funds as they will help us grow our industrial and residential sector," said Mayor of Askov David Weulander. "The City of Askov appreciates all of the work Senator Coleman has done to help us acquire these funds." 
   * $18.6 million for the National Johne's Disease Management and Testing Initiative for Cattle. Senators Coleman and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) led bipartisan Senate efforts to increase funding to combat this disease, which is a top concern of Minnesota dairy farm families. 
   "America's dairy and beef producers have to fight each year on Capitol Hill to obtain funding for the national Johne's disease program," said Jerry Kozak, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation. "Our farmers appreciate Senator Coleman going to bat for us on this critical animal health issue." 
   * Uniform Farm Management Project at the University of Minnesota, assisting farm and ranch families in the financial management of their operations 
   * Cereal Disease Lab at the U of M, to control diseases in wheat, barley, and oats, important to producers of these crops principally in the Red River Valley but also in other areas of the state, including southeastern Minnesota 
   * Minnesota Wild Rice Breeding and Germplasm Program, to increase yields and effectively combat plant diseases, important to production on and near the Red Lake Band of Ojibwe Indian Reservation and the area's economy 
   * National Sclerotinia Initiative, important to combating plant diseases including in soybeans. 
   * National Wheat & Barley Scab Initiative, important to combating scab (or fusarium head blight) that devastated the wheat and barley crop in the Red River Valley particularly during the 1990s, adversely affecting both yield and quality. 
   * Agriculture Product Market Development Grant for Agriculture Utilization Research Institute (AURI). 
   The measure also contains an amendment to prevent the U.S. Department of Agriculture from spending any funds to implement a proposed rule that would allow some Japanese beef imports into the U.S. until American beef is also allowed back into Japan. 
   "I was proud to support this measure that not only protect our beef producers, but to send Japan a strong message that they must reopen their border to U.S. beef," said Coleman. "It simply does not make sense to import Japanese beef if they are unwilling to accept ours." 
   Coleman also supported an amendment to prohibit the use of funds to close local Farm Service Agency offices unless the Secretary of Agriculture has determined the cost effectiveness and affect on program delivery of such a closure and an amendment to allow the dairy check-off to use their funding on a one-time basis to pay for EPA-mandated air emissions research, as other commodity check-off programs are allowed to do. Both amendments were agreed to by voice vote.
