SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IMMIGRATION
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on immigration 
   I deeply regret the Senate's failure to act today on the important issue of immigration reform. Although a broad bipartisan agreement had been reached that would have secured our borders and provided for a common-sense temporary worker program, procedural maneuvering by the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, stopped us from moving forward. 
   By refusing to allow votes on amendments by my colleagues, procedural trickery blocked substantive reform. We leave here today with our borders still not secure, and more than 11 million people living in the shadows - we don't know who they are and what they are doing. That is not acceptable. We need to bring them into the sunlight- for their sake and ours. We need a comprehensive, permanent solution to our broken immigration system. I will continue to work for a solution that reaffirms the American ideal of welcoming immigrants - and respecting our law.
