SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $13,300 GRANT FOR CITY OF MEADOWLANDS
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today the City of Meadowlands has been selected to receive a $25,000 loan and $13,300 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding, awarded under Rural Development's Community Facility Loan and Grant Program, will be used to help purchase an ambulance for the city.  
   "This grant is great news for the folks in and around Meadowlands," said Coleman. "Across the state, and especially in small towns, local first responders save lives and protect their neighbors each and every day, and they deserve the best resources possible. I applaud USDA Rural Development for recognizing this need in Meadowlands and for contributing to the safety of local residents." 
   Rural Development provides loans and grants in several categories to individuals, communities and businesses in rural American towns in order to improve the economy and quality of life. Since 2001, Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion in Minnesota for a variety of rural improvement projects.
