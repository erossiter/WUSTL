SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $110,709 FOR WABASSO AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Wabasso Ambulance Association has received a $110,709 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used in the purchase of a new ambulance to replace the current ambulance that has been in service for the past 12 years.  
   "I am pleased residents in and around Wabasso will receive the benefit of a new ambulance," Coleman said. "Throughout Greater Minnesota, first responders are the first line of safety and they can literall be the difference between life and death for local residents. I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is helping strengthen the resources for first responders in the Wabasso area, and I applaud them for awarding this grant." 
   "We are very grateful to the Department of Homeland Security for awarding us the Assistance to Firefighters Grant for the much-needed replacement ambulance," said Mary K. Smith of the Wabasso Ambulance Association. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local entities to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
