SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION SELECTION OF TWIN CITIES
  STATEMENT FROM SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON RNC SELECTION OF TWIN CITIES 
  I am thrilled that after more than a century Minnesota is once again going to be the epicenter of the nation and the Republican Party in 2008. This was a team effort all the way, with both parties and both sides of the river working tirelessly to make this a reality. This is a huge win for all Minnesotans. The 2008 Republican National Convention will showcase Minnesota to a worldwide audience, generating enormous economic activity and opportunity. As a former Mayor of St. Paul, this holds special significance for me. When we built the Xcel Energy Center, we dreamed of bringing hockey back to Minnesota, but never the Superbowl of politics.
