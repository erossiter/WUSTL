SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON OPPOSITION TO RICHARD HOAGLAND NOMINATION
 Today, I cast my vote in opposition to the nomination of Richard Hoagland to be Ambassador to Armenia. While I do not doubt Mr. Hoagland's abilities, the State Department's continued refusal to acknowledge the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 as "genocide" gave me no choice but to vote against this nominee. Although Mr. Hoagland is not the author of this policy that has spanned numerous Administrations, I felt it necessary to use my vote today to push for a long overdue change of policy. History must be remembered for what it was, not for what we would like it to be.
