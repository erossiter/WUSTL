SEN. COLEMAN: 'THE HIGHWAY BILL IS A MINNESOTA JOBS BILL'
  Statement from Sen. Coleman on Presidential signing of national highway bill into law 
   One of my top priorities as the United States Senator from Minnesota is to make sure that we grow jobs and grow our economy. I'm pleased to report that after two years of hard work, the President has signed into law a comprehensive highway bill that does just that. This bill will inject more than $286 billion into our nation's highway and transit infrastructure, helping to address critical roadway concerns. As a former mayor of St. Paul, I know how critical transit projects are to Minnesota. I applaud our own Minnesota delegation for the perseverance and dedication they showed in bringing critical funding home to communities across the state. Minnesota will receive $3 billion dollars in federal funding through 2009, a 46 percent increase and the second highest percentage increase in the country. This legislation will prove to be significant as we grow within the state and as goods and commerce are transported throughout Minnesota. 
   Moreover, thousands of jobs will be created in Minnesota alone as a result of this highway bill. For every $1 billion invested, well over 47,000 jobs are created. Improved transportation translates into an improved economy. As a whole, this bill delivers key elements across the nation and across Minnesota: jobs, economic competitiveness, and healthier, safer, and less congested highways and roadways. Today's signing of a long-awaited highway bill is a big victory for Minnesota.
