SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $265,218 FOR NORTH-CENTRAL MINNESOTA FROM SCENIC BYWAYS PROGRAM
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that north-central Minnesota has received a combined $265,218 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways Program. Specifically, the grants will be used to repair Babe the Blue Ox in Bemidji, while also providing funding to create wayfinding signs, tour brochures, and implement corridor management throughout a number of scenic byways running through the region.  
   "I am pleased the resources of the Scenic Byways program will promote some of northwest Minnesota's great tourist attractions," said Coleman. "In Minnesota, Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox are part of our legend and by funding improvements to keep this great attraction afloat, we are continuing to honor Minnesota's unique folklore and culture. Along similar lines, the various improvements along these byways will allow more people to enjoy the beautiful scenic roads throughout our state and bring greater attention to the abundant resources Minnesota has to offer. I applaud the Federal Highway Administration for recognizing the importance of these grants in Minnesota." 
   Specific funding for the individual projects is as follows: 
   * $68,000 for repairs and improvements to Babe the Blue Ox statue located in downtown Bemidji. 
   * $40,560 for the reintroduction of the storyteller for the Paul Bunyan byway. The storyteller * a mail boat driver * will retell the local lore on scheduled stops through the Whitefish Chain of Lakes. 
   * $80,000 to install interactive displays at a new safety rest stop and welcome center located near the Gateway to Minnesota's central lakes region on Highway 371. The project also benefits the close-by Paul Bunyan Scenic Byway. 
   * $25,000 for the implementation of the Edge of the Wilderness Corridor Management Plan used to plan activities, goals, and strategies for the community. This project will cover the 47-mile stretch between Grand Rapids and Effie along Minnesota Highway 38. 
   * $25,000 for Minnesota Mississippi River Parkway Commission's plan to build community financial partnerships to inform travelers along the byways. The project will cover the complete scenic byway from Lake Itasca to the Iowa border along Highway 61. 
   * $20,158 for a project to develop a byway tour brochure to help travelers identify sites along the Paul Bunyan scenic highway. 
   * $6,500 for a logo signing project to guide travelers along the scenic byway on County Highway 10/39 - covering the area from Cass Lake to Black Duck.
