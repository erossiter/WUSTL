SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQI ELECTIONS
  For the third time this year, Iraqis have gone to the polls to do what they never had the chance to do during decades of tyranny: vote for a freedom and democracy.  
 As we stand at this momentous turning point, witnessing the historical establishment of a constitutional government in Iraq, we have a chance to reflect on the tremendous progress that has been made in the region since Saddam was removed as dictator. In two and a half years, Iraqis have assumed sovereignty of their country, held free elections, drafted a democratic constitution, approved that constitution in a nationwide referendum, and today, have chosen the officials they want to represent them. I applaud their bravery and courage, as I salute our American servicemen and women who have sacrificed greatly and whose efforts have made this day possible. The millions of Iraqis who went to the polls today demonstrated that freedom will be the foundation of the rule of law under their new government. Challenges remain, but our troops and the Iraqi people have shown that defeat is not an option. By supplanting tyranny in Iraq with freedom, we have helped make America safer and more secure.
