SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN RESOLUTION TO INCREASE U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN SOMALIA
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) praised the passage today by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of his bipartisan resolution directing the United States to increase its support to the people of Somalia in their efforts to establish a peaceful and stable democracy. The resolution outlines U.S. priorities in Somalia and urges the federal government to adopt a comprehensive strategy to help Somalia overcome decades of violence, neglect and civil strife.  
   "The resurgence of violence in Mogadishu underscores the need for urgent action, once again focusing international attention on the plight of the Somali people," Coleman said. "Currently, there is a great reason to believe that the United States involvement in Somalia has been too narrowly focused, though the situation on the ground is very complex. My resolution clarifies that the U.S. should have a broader strategy that works to support our objectives, which includes consolidating democratic governance, addressing humanitarian needs, and preventing Somalia from becoming a safe haven for terrorists." 
   As senator from the state with the largest Somali community in the country, Coleman has become personally involved in dealing with Somali issues. Specifically, Coleman's resolution: 
   * Expresses support for a democratic system in Somalia; 
   * Calls on the U.S. government to develop a comprehensive stabilization and reconstruction strategy that aligns humanitarian, development, economic, political, counterterrorism and regional strategies, which must be presented to Congress within 90 days; 
   * Urges the U.S. to provide training and support to the Transitional National Government to fight terrorism and extremism in addition to strengthening civil society; 
   * Calls on the U.S. to send a special envoy to Somalia to help guide and inform U.S. policy on Somalia. 
   There has been an outbreak in violence recently in Somalia, raising concerns about escalation into a civil war. Since U.S. forces withdrew from Somalia in 1994, the country has struggled with political strife and violence and has failed to establish a permanent government. While a transitional government was assembled in August 2004, escalating tensions between competing groups have undermined its ability to function or even establish itself in the capital city. The State Department's 2005 Counter Terrorism report states that, "parts of Somalia, which has no functioning central government, have become havens for terrorist and other illicit activities, threatening the security of the whole region.
