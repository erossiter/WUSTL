SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SEN. LOTT'S RETIREMENT
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement in response to Senator Trent Lott's (R-MS) announcement that he will retire from the United States Senate:  
   "Through his leadership roles in the United States Senate and the House, Senator Lott has consistently served the people of Mississippi and America as a whole with great passion and distinction. To me, he is a true master of the Senate, embodying a wealth of legislative knowledge and a unique ability to find common ground to get things done. He has always been a statesman throughout his tenure and his conviction and ability to unite our party will truly be missed. I wish my distinguished colleague nothing but success, health and happiness in his future personal and professional endeavors."
