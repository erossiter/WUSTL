SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON AGRICULTURE DISASTER ASSISTANCE VOTE
Sen. Norm Coleman made the following statement regarding today's Senate vote on whether to allow agriculture disaster assistance to move forward as part of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill.  
 "I am deeply disappointed that emergency disaster assistance for our farmers failed to move forward today in the Senate, despite the support of a majority of my colleagues. Withholding disaster assistance continues to compound the hardships already faced by our state's farmers. It is incomprehensible that Congress has approved disaster assistance to Gulf state farmers, while Midwest farmers continue to get the cold shoulder. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the region until we approve this critical assistance."
