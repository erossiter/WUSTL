SEN. COLEMAN SECURES OVER $4 MILLION FOR FIVE MINNESOTA FOREST, WATER, HISTORICAL PRESERVATION PROJECTS
  Continuing his efforts to maintain Minnesota's precious natural resources while making critical investments in rural water infrastructure, Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that he was successful in securing over $4 million in funding for key Minnesota projects in the Senate's fiscal year 2008 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The bill is expected to be approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday and will then proceed to the Senate floor. 
   The bill allocates $300,000 for the City of New Auburn's drinking water plant that is being built to battle high arsenic levels in the city's water supply. This costly but necessary upgrade has presented difficult financial circumstances for the rural community.  
   "In my tour of Minnesota's 87 counties last year, I met with Mayor Becker and officials from the City of New Auburn who told me about the burden that upgrading their water infrastructure would have on their community," said Coleman. "Rural infrastructure needs like those of New Auburn are the foundation of economic growth in our smaller communities. I believe that the federal government has a responsibility to provide the resources needed to help build this foundation and the funding included in this bill will make a significant impact on this deserving rural community." 
   Coleman also delivered $1,750,000 for the Koochiching Forest Legacy Project to protect a 38,300-acre portion of forestland in northern Minnesota. This important project will protect vast wildlife habitat and ensure public access for recreation while maintaining the practice of sustainable forestry that supports the local economy. Coleman was also able to secure $1,250,000 for the Superior National Forest to maintain Long Island in Burntside Lake. Located at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the 43-acre Long Island is the largest undeveloped island at the lake site. Burntside Lake's waters support a natural cold water fishery and are home to one of the state's largest common loon populations. 
   "Minnesota's forests are among the state's greatest treasures and both the Koochiching Forest Legacy Project and Superior National Forest are deserving recipients of this necessary funding," said Coleman. "Similarly, families throughout Minnesota cherish times spent on the lakes of Minnesota and Burntside Lake is no exception. Conserving this beloved destination is important to the people of Minnesota and I applaud the Senate Appropriations Committee for protecting this important project." 
   Other Minnesota projects secured by Senator Coleman include: 
   * $750,000 for the Northern Tallgrass Prairie Wildlife Refuge, one of the rarest and most fragmented ecosystems in America and also one the most important waterfowl production areas of North America. Senator Coleman has secured appropriations for this crucial refuge for the last four years. 
   * $300,000 for the Ripley Gardens Save America's Treasures Project for preservation and adaptive re-use of an historic maternity hospital. The Ripley Maternity Hospital, which was founded by medical and social reformer Dr. Martha Ripley, operated on the site from 1896 to 1956. The re-use of the hospital will allow for community revitalization and construction of affordable housing for homeless households. 
   * $11,000,000 for the National Rural Water Association small water system technical assistance program. This program provides on-site, hands-on assistance to rural and small community water and wastewater systems. 
   * $3,500,000 for the Rural Community Assistance Partnership to fund rural and small water system technical assistance. The Rural Community Assistance Partnerships work in every state, providing services to rural communities with an average population of less than 3,000 people.
