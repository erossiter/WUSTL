SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF CONDOLEZZA RICE
  "I enthusiastically support the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. There are many words that can describe Dr. Rice and her steadfast character: knowledgeable, grounded, experienced. But there is one word that describes her better than any other, and that is "qualified." It is a high moment for the president to appoint her, an honor for the Senate to confirm her, and I believe it will be a blessing for the nation and the world for her to serve."
