SEN. COLEMAN TOURS FLOOD AREAS IN SOUTHEAST MINNESOTA
  U.S. Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman, along with Amy Klobuchar, and Congressman Tim Walz yesterday visited communities in Southeast Minnesota that suffered severe flooding damage over the weekend. Coleman received briefings from state and local officials at the Winona Law Enforcement Center, followed by a survey of the flood damage in Goodview, Minnesota City, and Stockton.  
   "Our prayers are with each of those Minnesotans who have lost their loved ones in this terrible natural disaster," said Coleman. "The devastation these floods have caused in Southeastern Minnesota is unprecedented, resulting in damage on an enormous scale. I traveled to the region yesterday to asses this damage firsthand and begin looking at ways we can offer support to the region. As Minnesotans always do, we will all come together to recover from this disaster, and I am committed to working with all parties involved to ensure we provide whatever resources are needed going forward."
