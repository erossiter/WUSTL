SEN. COLEMAN: MINNESOTA WINS IN SENATE TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman announced today he was able to secure Senate passage of key Minnesota projects in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill, including $195 million for the 35W bridge, $65 million for the Northstar Corridor Rail Project and $1 million for flood recovery in Browns Valley. The bill, which provides funding for the Federal Transit Administration, mass transit, highways, housing and development, and aviation projects throughout the state of Minnesota, was approved by the full Senate today on a vote of 88-7 and now awaits conference committee with the House.  
   "Minnesota is state that is heavily dependent on its transportation infrastructure - whether you live in the metro area or Greater Minnesota," Coleman said. "Along with providing the vital funding we need to rebuild the 35W bridge, this bill also delivers needed dollars for a number of critical projects across the state. From transit projects like Northstar and the Central Corridor to major highway projects like Highway 14 and a number of projects in between, Minnesota transportation will benefit greatly from this legislation. Additionally, the bill provides a much-need $1 million to Browns Valley as they continue to recover from devastating flooding earlier this year. I fought long and hard for each of the Minnesota projects in this bill, and I thank my colleagues for approving this funding today." 
   Specifically, Sen. Coleman was able to secure funding for each of the following projects as part of the bill: 
   * $195 million for 35W bridge reconstruction 
   * $65 million for the Northstar Corridor Rail Project 
   * $35 million for the Central Corridor project in Minneapolis-St. Paul 
   * $1 million for the City of Browns Valley to help in rebuilding after a major flood earlier this year 
   * $4 million for Greater Minnesota Transit bus and bus facilities 
   * $1 million for the St. Cloud Metrobus project in St. Cloud 
   * $1.5 million for land acquisition for the St. Cloud Airport 
   * $500,000 for Trunk Highway 14 between Waseca and Owatonna 
   * $2,000,000 for the interchange of CSAH 12 and TH 14 in Blue Earth County near Mankato.
