SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIGNING OF ENERGY BILL
  After a long journey through Congress, I'm pleased that today President Bush signed into law the most sweeping energy legislation in decades.  
 The Energy bill, which will ensure the continued growth of our economy by providing more affordable and more reliable sources of energy, also promotes greater energy conservation and efficiency. Here at home, this bill will provide a boost to Minnesota's already booming renewable fuels and clean coal technology industries. For Minnesota, that means the creation of thousands of good paying jobs. 
   From addressing the nation's dependency on foreign oil to extending wind energy tax credits, the provisions included in this bill are far reaching and represent our Government's serious commitment to diversifying the nation's energy supply. For too long, high energy prices have strained our economy and cost America jobs. Today's good news will help the factory and the farmer put more of their resources into expanding, and at the same time help working moms and dads who fill up at the pump each day.
