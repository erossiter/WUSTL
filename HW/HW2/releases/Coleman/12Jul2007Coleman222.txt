SEN. COLEMAN SECURES $65 MILLION FOR NORTHSTAR
  Senator Norm Coleman announced today he was able to secure $65 million for the Northstar Corridor Rail Project in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill. The bill, which provides funding for the Federal Transit Administration, mass transit, highways, housing and development, and aviation projects throughout the state of Minnesota, was approved in committee today and now awaits consideration by the full Senate.  
   "The Northstar project is one that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil, relieve congestion and contribute to the quality of life for thousands of north metro commuters," said Coleman. "Making this funding available in the coming fiscal year moves us toward completion of this important project on time and on budget. I have fought long and hard for Northstar, and I am thrilled I was able to deliver this funding in the Senate bill today." 
   "This is tremendous," said Dan Erhart, chair of the Northstar Corridor Development Authority. "These funds, coupled with the recent encouragement of U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and Federal Transit Administrator James Simpson, will enable Minnesotans to ride the line in 2009." 
   Senator Coleman has been a longtime supporter of Northstar, recently helping move the project to its final stage of federal approval in May by requesting the Federal Transit Administration to formally invite Northstar to submit its official application for federal funding. Additionally, Coleman secured language in the Department of Defense Authorization bill last year to ensure that the project would not be penalized by a Federal Transit Administration rule change that altered the final standard applied to federal transit projects midway through Northstar's federal approval process. 
   In addition to the funding for Northstar, Sen. Coleman was able to secure the following projects as part of the bill:
   * $35 million for the Central Corridor project in Minneapolis-St. Paul. 
   * $1 million for the City of Browns Valley to help in rebuilding after a major flood earlier this year. 
   * $4 million for Greater Minnesota Transit bus and bus facilities. 
   * $1 million for the St. Cloud Metrobus project in St. Cloud. 
   * $1.5 million for land acquisition for the St. Cloud Airport 
   * $500,000 for Trunk Highway 14 between Waseca and Owatonna. 
   * $1,000,000 for the interchange of CSAH 12 and TH 14 in Blue Earth County near Mankato.
