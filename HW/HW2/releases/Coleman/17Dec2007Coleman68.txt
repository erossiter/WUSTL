SEN. COLEMAN: SEVERAL OF MINNESOTA'S BIGGEST TRANSPORTATION NEEDS ADDRESSED IN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman announced today he was able to secure several key Minnesota projects in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill, including $53.9 million for the Northstar Corridor Rail Project, $490,000 for Highway 14 between Waseca and Owatonna, and $10.1 million for the Central Corridor project in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The bill is expected to be taken up in the House and Senate this week before being sent to the President.  
   "Improvements to our transportation infrastructure are critical for safe travel and development in the metro area as well as in Greater Minnesota," said Coleman. "From commuters stuck in metro-area gridlock to drivers navigating the congested stretches of Highway 14, this funding will benefit folks in every corner of the state. I applaud my colleagues for recognizing the transportation and safety needs of Minnesota by including these projects in this bill." 
   Recently, the Northstar Corridor Rail Project was approved for a Full Funding Grant Agreement, which assured the project federal appropriations of nearly $160 million. The $53.9 million included in this bill will be applied towards that total. Northstar will run from downtown Minneapolis up through the northwest suburbs to Big Lake. The 40-mile commuter rail system will serve six stations in Hennepin, Anoka and Sherburne counties and will have the capacity to carry 10,000 passengers a day. 
   The Central Corridor Light Rail Line, which is in the preliminary engineering phase, will link the downtowns of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Construction is expected to begin in 2010. 
   Additional projects secured by Sen. Coleman projects as part of the bill are as follows: 
   * $2,940,000 for Greater Minnesota Transit bus and bus facilities. 
   * $803,600 for the St. Cloud Metrobus project in St. Cloud. 
   * $1,102,500 for land acquisition for the St. Cloud Airport. 
   * $1,313,200 for the interchange of CSAH 12 and TH 14 in Blue Earth County near Mankato. 
   * $490,000 for TH 610 Corridor from TH 169 in Brooklyn Park to I-94 in Maple Grove, MN. 
   * $490,000 for improvements to Minnesota State Highway 241 in St. Michael, MN. 
   * $656,000 for U.S. Highway 212 Expansion, Norwood, MN.
