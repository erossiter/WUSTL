SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $5.1 MILLION FOR 25 MINNESOTA RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS
  Today Sen. Norm Coleman announced that the State of Minnesota has received $5,186,899 from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program. The program was created as part of the Farm Bill to assist farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses develop renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements to their operations. A large portion of this year's grants will support anaerobic digesters and wind power ventures.  
   "Today's funding is significant for Minnesota and for the future of renewable energy," said Coleman. "Minnesota is a leader in developing renewable energy, and these projects will continue to further our ability to produce and promote renewable energy systems, as well as make improvements to existing technology. I commend President Bush, the USDA, and the Administration for continuing to fund these projects that explore alternative energy and fuel sources, while at the same time, invest in Minnesota's rural communities. Last year, Minnesota received over $4.5 million from this program, more than any other state in the country. These projects are an investment in our future, and are great for Minnesota's economy and for rural development." 
   "The Bush Administration is committed to advancing renewable energy ventures in rural America," said USDA Secretary Veneman. "We have the natural resources and the ingenuity to create new forms of energy and to use it more efficiently." 
   Secretary Veneman announced that Minnesota was one of 26 states to receive part of the $22.8 million in grants to develop renewable energy systems and promote energy efficiency improvements.
