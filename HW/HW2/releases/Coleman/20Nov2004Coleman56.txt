CONGRESS PASSES INDIVIDUAL WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION
  The United States Senate voted unanimously late last night to reauthorize the bipartisan Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Sen.  
 Norm Coleman announced today. Coleman said the legislation helps ensure school safety and reasonable discipline, gives local schools more flexibility and greater control, moves away from burdensome regulations and costly litigation, reduces paperwork for teachers, and expands choices and gives parents more control over their children's education.
   "The number one goal of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is to ensure that all our children have the opportunity learn," said Coleman. "The legislation we passed last night helps to accomplish this by empowering schools, teachers, and parents. The bill helps to ensure school safety and reasonable discipline, gives schools and parents flexibility and greater control, while cutting red tape, paperwork and costly frivolous litigation so teachers can focus on teaching and students can focus on learning."
   IDEA's reauthorization comes a night before Congress approves an appropriations bill containing a $607 million increase in funding for IDEA, advancing toward the federal government's commitment to fully fund its share of IDEA's costs.
   "While I had offered an amendment earlier this year to more substantially step up the pace of the federal government's efforts to fully fund IDEA, I am pleased that we are at least making meaningful progress toward that goal each year," said Coleman.
