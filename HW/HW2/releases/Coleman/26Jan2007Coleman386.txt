SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $33,250 FOR CROOKSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Crookston Fire Department has received a $33,250 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase a new air compressor and upgrade the department's air packs, which provide breathable air to firefighters, so they will last 45 minutes instead of the current 20 minutes.  
   "As a former mayor, I know that local firefighters who put their own safety on the line to protect their neighbors deserve the best resources available," said Coleman. "This funding will help improve a critical tool for firefighters in Crookston, which will in turn benefit the local residents they serve. I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program for awarding this grant." 
   "I want to thank the Department of Homeland Security," said Captain Brian Halos of the Crookston Fire Department. "This grant will help us very much with improving the functions of our equipment." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
