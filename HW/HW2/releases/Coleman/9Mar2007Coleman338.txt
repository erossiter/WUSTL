SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES CONTINUED U.S. JOB GROWTH
  In light of the Labor Department's February jobs report showing 97,000 new jobs created last month, Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the pro-growth polices implemented in 2003 that continue to spur solid economic and job growth. February marks the 42nd straight month of job growth with 7.5 million new jobs being created during that time. The unemployment rate fell from 4.6 percent to 4.5 percent in February, while wage gains remained strong with hourly earnings up to 4.1 percent and weekly earnings up to 3.8 percent.  
   "This sustained job growth is proof that the pro-growth tax policies are continuing to bring positive results," said Coleman. "As we move forward in the coming months, I will continue to work hard to ensure that these policies remain in place while at the same time keeping in mind the challenges facing our hardworking Minnesota families. While my first priority is job creation so that Minnesota's moms and dads have good paying jobs for their families, my other priority is to help improve the average Minnesotans' quality of life by raising the minimum wage, increasing the quality and accessibility of Minnesota's rural healthcare services, making college more affordable for Minnesota's future workers, and promoting renewable energy." 
   Minnesota's latest jobs numbers also showed increases during the month of January. The most recent report showed 13, 100 new jobs were created while the unemployment rate came in at 4.4 percent.
