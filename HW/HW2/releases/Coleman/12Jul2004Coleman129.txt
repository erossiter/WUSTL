SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES VETERANS BENEFITS OUTREACH LEGISLATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) today introduced the Veterans Benefit Outreach Act of 2004, legislation designed to help ensure that disabled veterans receive the benefits they deserve. It's estimated that 572,000 veterans nationwide are not receiving the benefits they are entitled to due to lack of communication from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In other words, they simply don't know these benefits are available to them. Coleman's legislation would require the VA to conduct annual outreach efforts to educate all veterans about the benefits they have at their disposal. 
   "When we ask men and women in uniform to fight for freedom, our nation promises in return to take care of them when they return," Coleman said. "Providing basic health care is the least a grateful nation can do, and we do it gladly for our veterans. Tragically, there are veterans suffering from injuries inflicted on the battlefield that are not receiving the assistance they need and deserve because they simply don't know about the benefits available to them. This legislation is an important first step forward in solving this very serious problem."
   Coleman's legislation would also allow for the appeal of veterans benefits claims that were denied by the VA due to the loss of records resulting from a 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in Missouri.
   "The VA needs to continue to work to ensure that men and women disabled by battle are receiving the benefits they deserve," Coleman concluded. "The 1973 fire was not the VA's fault, but in order to keep credibility with veterans, the VA needs to establish a process that allows veterans whose records were lost in the fire to receive the benefits they're entitled to. I know this problem firsthand, as my own father, a proud veteran of World War II, lost his files in that fire."
