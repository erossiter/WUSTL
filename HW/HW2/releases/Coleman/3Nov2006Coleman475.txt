SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $86,800 FOR WOODBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Woodbury Fire Department has been awarded a grant of $86,800 under the federal Assistance to Firefighter Grants program (AFG). The funding is aimed at financing improvements and upgrades for the department's operations and safety.  
   "This grant will help ensure the safety of both the citizens and firefighters of Woodbury," said Coleman. "First responders are the first line of safety for community residents, and this grant will help ensure the folks in Woodbury continue to be well-served by their local fire department. I am pleased the AFG program has awarded this funding for the community, and I applaud their ongoing commitment to citizen safety." 
   The AFG program provides financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
