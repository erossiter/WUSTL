SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST ATTACKS IN LONDON
  "This morning, London was cruelly and senselessly attacked by terrorists, killing innocent victims and devastating a city and a nation.  
 My heart goes out to those who were killed, as well as to the families and loved ones of the victims. May those harmed by today's attack soon find some comfort and healing in God's grace. I commend Prime Minister Blair for his strong and compassionate leadership during this trying time. The people of London should know we stand in vigilant solidarity with you - you are in our thoughts and prayers as you find the strength and courage to rise from this dark hour."
