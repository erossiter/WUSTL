SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF YASSER ARAFAT
  "The United States had a long history of dealing with Mr.  
 Arafat and we regret that he was never able to make the choices required to achieve peace and a homeland for his people. It is tragic that his unyielding support for terrorism brought the peace process to standstill and caused greater suffering among the Palestinian people. Hopefully the Palestinians can look forward to the future and choose a leader opposed to terrorism and committed to a two-state solution.
   Along with President Bush, I remain absolutely committed to working towards the formation of a Palestinian state that will be free of corruption, that is willing fight terrorism instead of supporting it, and that will respect Israel's sovereign right to keep its people secure. This is a historic and important time for the Palestinian people. Now is an opportunity for them to move forward and choose a new kind of leadership that is genuinely committed to peace and respects Israel's right to exist side by side with a Palestinian state."
