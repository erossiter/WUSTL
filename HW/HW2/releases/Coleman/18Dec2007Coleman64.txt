SEN. COLEMAN SECURES FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA YOUTH, LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS IN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced he was successful in securing funding for a number of key Minnesota projects, including $1,222,000 in funding for the National Child Protection Training Center, a partnership between Winona State University and the National District Attorneys Association. The Center provides training, technical assistance and publications to child protection professionals throughout the country, and assists states in developing courses to teach investigators how to interview child abuse victims. Senator Coleman also helped secure $547,000 in the 2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act and $200,000 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005.  
   "Abused children face a wide range of challenges that can hinder their ability to grow into healthy adulthood," said Coleman. "The services NCPTC offers can greatly improve a victim's chances at succeeding in life and breaking the vicious cycle of domestic abuse. I cannot think of a more deserving recipient and I look forward to watching this funding turn into tangible results as hundreds of children receive the care they need." 
   Minnesota's Senators also were able to secure $430,050 for Bolder Options, an innovative non-profit agency in Minnesota that has improved the lives of more than 350 youth in the last five years. Last year, Bolder Options was named one of the top five charities in the Today Show Lend a Hand Series for its work coupling one-on-one mentoring programs with academic goal-setting and athletic activities. 
   "Some children need a little extra support in order to develop into healthy, successful adults in today's world," said Coleman. "Bolder Options is a program that has provided that needed push to hundreds of Minnesota's at-risk youth. I am excited to see this funding authorized as it will allow many more children to benefit from its services."
