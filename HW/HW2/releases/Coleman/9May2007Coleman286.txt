SEN. COLEMAN TO VISIT WADENA, PARK RAPIDS, GRAND RAPIDS, WALKER
  Sen. Norm Coleman will visit Wadena, Park Rapids, Grand Rapids, and Walker on Friday, May 11th and Saturday, May 12th during a two-day visit across northern Minnesota. Coleman, who visited all 87 Minnesota counties last year, will continue his ongoing efforts to meet with local officials and residents and will fish Leech Lake as part of the Governor's Fishing Opener festivities in Walker.  
   "Traveling across Minnesota to meet with residents in every part of the state is my favorite part of the job," said Coleman. "From renewable energy to rural healthcare to growing jobs, the meetings I've had with folks across the state have guided my work in Washington since taking office. I look forward to continuing those meetings this weekend - and I am particularly excited about getting back on the water and hopefully landing a walleye or two while I'm at it." 
   Coleman will begin Friday's visit at a lunch meeting with community leaders in Wadena to discuss issues of local concern in the area. The senator will then travel to Park Rapids, where he will attend a reception with the Park Rapids Chamber of Commerce and other local residents. Coleman will follow this visit with a stop in Grand Rapids for the annual fishing opener community barbeque, before arriving in Walker for events surrounding the Governor's Fishing Opener.
