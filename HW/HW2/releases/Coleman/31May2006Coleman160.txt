SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH IRAN:
   I cautiously endorse the Administration's efforts to engage in discussions with Iran to stop their development of a nuclear weapon. Iran must immediately cease enrichment efforts as a precondition to any talks. Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. All options must be on the table if they fail to respond to the Administration's overture.
