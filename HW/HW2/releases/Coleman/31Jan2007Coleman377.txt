SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $86,195 GRANT FOR JASPER VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Jasper Volunteer Fire Department has been awarded an $86,195 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase equipment for the department, specifically a new Jaws of Life used to free people trapped in vehicles, and lightweight fire gear for firefighters fighting brush and wild fires.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program awarded this funding for the Jasper Volunteer Fire Department to improve their emergency capabilities," said Coleman. "Across Greater Minnesota, firefighters are on the frontlines of Minnesota's public safety and their presence can often be the difference between life and death. This new equipment will increase safety for both local residents and firefighters, and I applaud the awarding of this grant." 
   "This is an excellent program and we really appreciate the help it provides our department," said Kristine Rodman of the Jasper Volunteer Fire Department. "I hope this program continues because there is no way our department would be able to afford these upgrades without this help." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
