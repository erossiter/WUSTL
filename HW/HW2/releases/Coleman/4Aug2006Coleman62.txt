SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $10,000 FOR CITY OF HADLEY
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today the City of Hadley will receive a $10,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will allow the city to determine if an individual septic treatment system and mound system will work within the community as an option to meet Hadley's wastewater needs.  
   "I am pleased the City of Hadley has received this funding," said Coleman. "Small towns across Minnesota are struggling to upgrade outdated water treatment systems, and this grant will help Hadley move forward with this process. I am pushing for Rural Renaissance legislation that would help fund these types of rural infrastructure problems in the Senate, and I am thankful USDA Rural Development continues to address these problems through grants such as this one." 
   USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural development projects.
