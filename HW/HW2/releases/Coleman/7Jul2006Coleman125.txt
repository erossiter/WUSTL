SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL RESOLUTION ON ISRAEL
  Statement of Sen. Coleman regarding human rights council resolution on Israel: 
   "The new U.N. Human Rights Council's actions, which unfairly criticize Israel while blatantly ignoring grievous human rights violations in any other country in the world, are a textbook example of why I have been critical of this 'new' body since its inception. The Council is suffering from the same fundamental problems and biases as the Commission it was created to replace. Not only is the Council continuing the U.N.'s castigation of Israel and Israel alone, but its members also include many of the worst human rights violators who had made a mockery of the previous commission - Cuba, Iran and Syria. In the end, this flawed Council is simply more of the same at the U.N., and we cannot allow this irresponsible status quo to simply go forward unchallenged."
