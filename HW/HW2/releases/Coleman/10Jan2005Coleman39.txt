SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE OF AUDITS BY U.N. INDEPENDENT INQUIRY COMMISSION
  "While I am pleased that Paul Volcker and his team have released these internal audits, and with the Bush Administration's insistence they be released sooner rather than later, I want to emphasize these audits are simply another piece of the puzzle.  
   PSI investigators' preliminary reviews show an ongoing pattern that demonstrates our justified concerns about the management of the Oil for Food Program. 
   In the coming days, my investigators and I will thoroughly review this newly released information. 
   Our preliminary review of these audits only underscores my long held concern about the fraud, mismanagement and lack of adequate oversight at the U.N.'s oil for food program. 
   I also continue to have concerns with the ability of the IIC's investigation to be thorough and conclusive. 
   These audits do not answer even a fraction of the questions we have been asking or will be continuing to ask as our investigation moves ahead in the months to come."
