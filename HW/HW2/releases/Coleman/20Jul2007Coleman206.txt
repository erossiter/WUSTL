  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that airports in Fergus Falls, Duluth, Fosston, Aitkin and Grand Rapids have been selected to receive federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  
   "Local airports are a source of economic opportunity across Greater Minnesota and are an important part of our state's transportation infrastructure," said Coleman. "These grants will help ensure these airports remain competitive and viable in the future, and I applaud the FAA for awarding these grants." 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   $60,000 for Fergus Falls Municipal-Einar Mickelson Field to be used in the first phase of construction for a new snow removal equipment building 
   $304,000 for Sky Harbor Airport in Duluth to ensure safe plane landings by studying runway alignments as an alternative to the removal of obstructions such as the numerous trees surrounding the airport 
   $229,900 for Fosston Municipal to construct a snow removal equipment building and install perimeter fencing 
   $418,000 for Aitkin Municipal-Steve Kurtz Field to acquire land, construct an apron, rehabilitate the access road, rehabilitate a runway and update the airport master plan study 
   $285,000 for Grand Rapids/Itasca County Airport-Gordon Newstrom Field to upgrade the existing runway and install perimeter fencing 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns. For more information, please visit http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/airports/aip.
