SEN. COLEMAN TOUTS 10 YEAR SUCCESS OF WELFARE REFORM
 Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today made the following statement regarding the 10th Anniversary of the Welfare Reform Law:  
   "I have always believed that the best welfare program is a job. And today marks the 10-year anniversary of the welfare reform law, which has been a proven success for the American taxpayers and a catalyst for self-sufficiency. Passage of this law has brought nearly a million and a half children out of poverty. In fact, between 1996 and 2004, the poverty rate among African-American children declined by 17 percent and 28 percent for Hispanic children. For single mothers, the reforms put into place have increased the employment rate to 63 percent - the highest level ever. In Minnesota, welfare caseloads have declined by 52 percent, dropping from 57,741 in August 1996 to 27,589 by June 2005. 
   "Over the last ten years, we have come a long way toward reducing dependence and poverty. At its core, this law is about self empowerment, and I will continue working hard to ensure that every American has the best opportunity to provide for their family."
