SEN. COLEMAN: AMERICAN ECONOMY STAYS STRONG
  Citing recent economic and jobs data, Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the strong job numbers and economic growth reported by the Department of Labor.  
 According to the latest figures, the U.S. added 215,000 jobs during the month of November, and the United States economy expanded by 4.3 percent in the third quarter, the best showing since the first quarter of last year. Throughout the past twelve months, the economy has created 2 million jobs, and 4.4 million have been created since 2003. 
   "Americans should feel good about the consistent progress of our economy," said Coleman. "Our economy continues to grow at a rapid pace, a sign of its strength and resiliency in spite of the challenges of the past year. The combination of tax relief and pro-growth policies that we have implemented over the past few years continue to help businesses create good jobs for Americans. It is a trend we will continue to work for in Congress as we work to keep America's economy ahead of the curve." 
   Minnesota also continues to show steady job growth. Throughout the past year, nearly 37,000 jobs have been created in Minnesota, while the unemployment rate stands at 3.7 percent--down from 4.5 percent one year ago. 
   In November the U.S. Senate passed the Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S.2020) that will provide $60 billion in tax relief over 5 years. This legislation is designed to protect middle-income families from the alternative minimum tax, keep in place deductions for teachers and college students, and extend both the Research and Development tax credit and Section 179 expensing for small businesses, which helps Minnesota companies innovate and grow jobs.
