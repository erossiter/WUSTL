SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA SIX-PARTY TALKS
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON NORTH KOREA SIX-PARTY TALKS:
   North Korea's decision to return to the six-party talks is encouraging. While this is just a first step, it shows that President Bush's diplomatic efforts are indeed working.
   A nuclear North Korea is not only a threat to the U.S., and countries in the region need to continue to apply pressure to ensure the security of the international community.
