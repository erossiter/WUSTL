SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $409,750 IN USDA CONSERVATION GRANTS FOR MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that Minnesota will receive two grants totaling $409,750 from the United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service.  
 The grants are part of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and will fund the development and adoption of innovative conservation technologies and approaches through pilot projects and field trials.
   Minnesota is one of 29 states that will receive part of the $14.2 million in overall funding for the program. The State of Minnesota will receive $316,000 for its Conservation Drainage Demonstrations project to improve impaired watershed, and the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources will use its grant of $93,750 for its Invasive Species Management for Restored Wetlands and Native Prairie Uplands project.
   "I'm excited by this level of funding from the Bush Administration to develop and adopt the latest in environmental technologies," said Coleman. "Minnesota, our environment, and our natural habitats will benefit from this funding for years to come."
   "These grants provide opportunities for public-private partnerships to accelerate technology transfer and implement promising technologies," said Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman. "These approaches will help farmers and ranchers protect the environment and comply with federal, state, and local regulations."
   Grant recipients include universities, nongovernmental organizations, agribusinesses, state governments, conservation and development councils, conservation districts and individuals.
