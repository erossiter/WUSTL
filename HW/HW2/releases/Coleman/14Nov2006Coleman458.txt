SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES MINNESOTA JOB GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the October Minnesota jobs report, which shows that more than 54,000 jobs have been created in the state during the past year while the unemployment rate came in at 3.9 percent, the sixth straight month of unemployment below four percent. Jobs have now been created in the state in 14 out of the last 16 months. In another sign reflecting the healthy state of the labor market, there was a record 2.97 million Minnesotans participating in the labor market last month, beating the previous record set in April 2005.  
   "Minnesotans continue to reap the benefits of pro-growth policies that have spurred 38 straight months of job growth nationally," said Coleman. "I will continue to work hard to ensure that we keep these successful pro-growth strategies in place while also keeping in mind that fiscal responsibility is also important to keeping our economy strong and prosperous. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues - old and new - in the coming year to addressing the major challenges facing Americans." 
   The latest national job figures also show 92,000 new jobs were created in October with a decline in the unemployment rate from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent - the lowest since April 2001. October marks the 38th straight month of job growth during which time more than 6.8 million new jobs have been created. During the past three months alone, 470,000 new jobs have been created. Wages have also increased impressively, with weekly earnings increasing by 4.2 percent during the past year.
