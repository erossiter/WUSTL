SEN. COLEMAN CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO BROADBAND PROGRAM TO MAXIMIZE RURAL ACCESS TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
  Citing the technological gap that exists in America's rural and urban communities, Sen. Norm Coleman today expressed the need to maximize the Rural Utility Service (RUS) Broadband Program. In his questions to the panelists, Sen. Coleman called for RUS to refocus the Broadband Program to rural areas that currently have no access to broadband services and to improve the loan application process. The hearing, to review the USDA Rural Utility Service (RUS) Broadband Program, focused on expanding high-speed internet service to rural cities and towns across Minnesota and America. In addition to affecting quality of life issues, Coleman stated that lack of access to broadband communications puts rural businesses and communities at a disadvantage that limits economic development opportunities.  
   "From each far reaching corner of Minnesota, I have heard the need to bridge the technological gap our rural communities are experiencing," said Coleman. "With each passing day the digital divide gets wider. We owe it to our schools and the vitality of our rural communities to bring them up to 'high-speed.' The RUS Broadband Program has proven to be a valuable tool in eliminating the 'digital divide' in Rural America, but I believe RUS must refocus the loan application process on rural communities that do not have any broadband service and should identify what it needs to improve the access and transparency of the application process. I will continue to pursue improvements to the Broadband Program to ensure the program's limited resources are maximized." 
   Since taking office, Coleman has been a champion of rural development. He authored the Rural Renaissance Act, which contains specific provisions for increasing broadband in rural areas.
