SEN. COLEMAN SAYS NEW GAO REPORT UNDERSCORES NEED TO ENHANCE EFFORTS TO ENFORCE PROHIBITIONS ON ILLEGAL DRUG IMPORTATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and Rep. John Dingell, the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, today released a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report detailing weaknesses in the government's efforts to enforce the prohibitions on drugs ordered through rogue Internet pharmacies, particularly those containing potentially addictive and dangerous controlled substances. The report was requested as part of the Subcommittee's continuing investigation into the online drug trade. The Subcommittee has already held two hearings on this topic and plans further investigation and oversight to address the GAO's findings and recommendations.  
   "The Internet has become a virtual black market for controlled prescription drugs and bootleg pharmaceuticals. Although law enforcement has recently improved its processes to deal with the enormous amounts of these drugs that are seized at our borders everyday, efforts to work cooperatively between the various agencies and to engage the private sector have been lacking," said Coleman. 
   The abuse of prescription controlled drugs in America is growing at an alarming rate. A recent study estimates the growth in prescription controlled drug abuse at over 200% among teens during a ten-year period. These drugs, which can be easily obtained through online pharmacies, are perceived by many to be safe. The reality, however, is that these drugs, often adulterated or counterfeit, can be dangerous and even deadly. The magnitude of this form of drug abuse is such that, according to that same study, it now eclipses the abuse of all illicit drugs combined except marijuana. 
   The specific problems GAO uncovered regarding law enforcement's response in this area include: 
   * The agencies charged with enforcing the prohibited importation of these drugs have yet to produce reliable data showing the volume of pills entering the United States on a daily basis. Such data is essential for the agencies to gauge the size, scope, and source of the problem so they can address online and imported drug trade in a strategic fashion. The agencies are also unsure of the safety of imported drugs because testing has been extremely limited. Even lacking such testing, however, there is little doubt that these drugs pose serious health and safety risks. 
   * Some packages containing drugs occasionally bypass government inspection because of gaps in the inspection process. For example, the lack of coordination of resources and priorities between Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created an ineffective inspection process. CBP is unable to function effectively without relying on FDA's assistance and expertise, but FDA does not have adequate staffing on hand at most inspection facilities. In fact, at some shipping facilities, FDA has no permanent staff at all. 
   * GAO also identified several factors that affected the agencies' efforts to enforce the prohibition on prescription drug importation. Aside from the overwhelming volume being imported every day, Internet pharmacies that peddle these drugs, particularly those that are foreign based, have proved extremely elusive by operating outside the reach of U.S. regulators. The ability of online pharmacies to quickly and easily change their names and locations has complicated the efforts of federal law enforcement. 
   * The various federal agencies that work in this area have divided responsibilities and areas of jurisdiction. Their roles are divided along different enforcement, inspection and interdiction lines, which has resulted in a piecemeal government response to the problem. Accordingly, absent a firm commitment to interagency strategic coordination, the jurisdictional divisions among these agencies will continue to pose an obstacle to the federal government's response. 
   "This GAO report highlights the very problems that the Subcommittee has raised repeatedly with the agencies over the past two years," Coleman said. "If the federal government hopes to be successful in combating this problem, the agencies must work cooperatively with one another and must better leverage the capabilities of the private sector, including the shipping, credit card and internet companies, to attack the internet drug trade in dangerous controlled substances from all directions."
