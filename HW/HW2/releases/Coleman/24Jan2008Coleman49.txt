SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF ED SCHAFER
  Following today's Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on the nomination of Ed Schafer for the position of U.S. Agriculture Secretary, Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement: 
   "We're engaged in farm bill negotiations right now that require a good listener, a good negotiator, and someone who cares deeply about those who depend on this farm bill. In Ed Schafer, I believe we have found an individual who meets all of these qualifications. Not only does he have the personal skills to bring folks together, but as the former governor of North Dakota, he understands the needs of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest and the unique issues our growers and producers face. I have the utmost confidence that Ed Schafer will provide the leadership we need at this critical time, and I am hopeful that this committee will send his nomination to the Senate floor as soon as possible."
