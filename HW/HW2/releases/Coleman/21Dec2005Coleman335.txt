SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CLOTURE VOTE ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  STATEMENT BY SEN. NORM COLEMAN: SENATE CLOTURE VOTE ON DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL  
   "I came to the Senate to get things done. I have never supported a filibuster, no matter how controversial the issue. Our troops, the victims of the hurricanes, and the families who depend on LIHEAP assistance deserved an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor today. Yet the outcome of this vote reveals a deep dissatisfaction among my colleagues. I am angry about the process and at the direction we have forced on these very important issues that now remain unresolved. We will now have to start over from square one. My only hope is that we bring back to the table a bill that excludes ANWR and will offer real choices to our troops and families and sets politics aside to get necessary legislation passed."
