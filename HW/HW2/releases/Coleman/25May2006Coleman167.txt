SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $37,500 FOR CITY OF KELLIHER
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Kelliher, Minnesota has received a $37,500 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will be used to purchase emergency response equipment for the city.  
   "I am pleased the folks in and around Kelliher will benefit from this important funding," said Coleman. "In most rural communities, finding the funds for first responders to purchase updated and important emergency equipment is a very real challenge. Through grants such as these, rural communities can equip their emergency response teams with better equipment and training. I am pleased that the USDA Rural Development program saw fit to issue this grant to Kelliher and I thank them for their continued support of Minnesota's rural communities." 
   "We are excited to receive this funding," said Kelliher City Administrator Tina Rennemo. "We have a very active first responder team that provides a critical service for the surrounding communities. The nearest ambulance can take up to 25 minutes to respond to emergencies, and this grant from USDA Rural Development will provide our local first responder teams with better equipment to react to emergencies when needed." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
