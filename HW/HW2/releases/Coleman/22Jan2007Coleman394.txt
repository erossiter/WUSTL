SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL MARCH FOR LIFE
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON NATIONAL MARCH FOR LIFE: 
  I am proud to raise my voice today with people across America, including people in my home state of Minnesota, to call attention to the noble cause of protecting human life. I don't believe that we as a nation can legitimately claim to fully protect human rights when millions of unborn children have no right to life. A nation that values "choice" over "life" is committing moral suicide. History has taught us the bitter lesson that once a freedom or a right is compromised, it is so much easier to make the next step and then the next. Together we need to use our voices and our influence to first change the hearts and mind of our neighbors and friends. If we do that, the votes, the laws and the court decisions will follow. Issues and elections will come and go, but I will continue to remain in this fight no matter what. Thank you for standing up for Justice for the Unborn.
