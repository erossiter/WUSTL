SEN. COLEMAN PLEASED AT TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY'S VISIT TO ROCHESTER AFTER HIS DEADLINE FOR MITIGATION PLAN
  After sending a letter to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters calling for the Department to develop a mitigation plan to protect Rochester from the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad (DM&E) railroad project by the first of the year, Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman is pleased the Secretary will be personally traveling to Rochester on Monday on a fact-finding mission. Coleman will accompany the Secretary as she meets with community leaders to discuss the potential impact of the proposed DM&E project and to witness firsthand the community's needs. Coleman praised Secretary Peters for making this a high priority during her administration of the Department and for traveling to the city to see the railroad project from Rochester's perspective. Other Congressional Members and Members-elect are anticipated to attend this closed-door session.  
   "I've made it clear that if I don't see a mitigation plan before the end of this year, I will not allow this project to move forward," Coleman. "I appreciate the Secretary's willingness to see firsthand the safety concerns this community is facing. If there is a way to move this project forward without compromising Rochester's safety concerns, then I will support this project. If a plan is not submitted by the end of the year, then I will put all of my efforts into bringing this project to a halt. The Secretary's visit will provide an opportunity to express the needs of the community and push for a mitigation plan."
