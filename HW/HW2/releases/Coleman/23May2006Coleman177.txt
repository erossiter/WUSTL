SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON THEFT OF VETERANS' PERSONAL DATA
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman on veterans personal data: 
   "I am gravely concerned over the 26 million veterans who have had their personal data compromised. How a single employee was able to remove such sensitive personal information without detection, subjecting it to theft, is deeply troubling and I am outraged that veterans were not notified they were at risk for three full weeks. The Secretary of the Veteran's Administration must take immediate action to protect the rights and personal information of the millions of veterans who were victimized by this disturbing security lapse. Additionally, Secretary Nicholson must conduct a thorough investigation to fully explain how this happened. Finally, I intend to ask the Government Accountability Office to conduct a government-wide review of practices to specifically examine whether current policies may have allowed this type of breach. Our brave veterans deserve nothing less."
