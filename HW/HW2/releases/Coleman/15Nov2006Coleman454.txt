SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $48,569 FOR DALTON FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Dalton Fire Department has received a $48,569 grant as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program, which is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The grant is expected to be used for vehicle acquisition for the department.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program has provided funding for the Dalton Fire Department to improve its emergency capabilities," said Coleman. "Across Greater Minnesota local firefighters put their own safety on the line to protect their neighbors, and they deserve the best resources available. This grant will go a long way towards increasing the resources of this fire department, ultimately helping to increase the safety of residents in and around Dalton." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
