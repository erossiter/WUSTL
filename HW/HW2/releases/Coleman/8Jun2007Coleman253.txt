SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR MORA AIRPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman announced today that Mora Municipal Airport will be the recipient of a $3,025,750 grant from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The funds will be used to improve various aspects of the airport such as intersection and extension work on the runway, rehabilitation on the current apron, runway and taxiway, as well as installing a vertical/visual guidance system.  
   "I am excited for the folks in and around Mora to receive this grant," said Coleman. "Local airports are an important part of access and development for Greater Minnesota, and this grant will help ensure the safety and operability of the local airport. I am pleased they have received this funding and applaud the FAA for its role in making sure Mora will continue to benefit from the opportunities afforded by a quality local airport." 
   "This is a long awaited project that will have great economic impacts on the East Central Region," said Joel Dhein, Mora City Administrator. "These are much needed improvements that will allow us to enhance our services at the Mora Municipal Airport." 
   The FAA uses the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to provide grants for the planning and development of qualified public-use airports. The grants are awarded to eligible projects that enhance security, capacity, and environmental concerns.
