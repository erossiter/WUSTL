SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR TEST
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR TEST:   
   The apparent nuclear test conducted by North Korea in defiance of international opinion is a serious threat to the security of the U.S. and international community. This dangerously provocative action on the part of the North Korean regime must not only be met with strong words, but also with strong consequences. I commend Ambassador Bolton for moving swiftly to present a firm and unified response to this provocation. We can ill afford to be a community of words, but must be a community of action. The Security Council must impose sanctions to ensure that the Korean peninsula remains nuclear-free.
