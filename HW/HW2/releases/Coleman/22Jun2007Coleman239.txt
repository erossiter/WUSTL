SENATE PASSES ENERGY BILL CONTAINING KEY ENERGY PROVISIONS OF SEN. COLEMAN
  In a move that will put the U.S. on the path toward energy independence, Sen. Norm Coleman joined his Senate colleagues in passing the Energy bill (HR.6) by a vote of 65 to 27. The measure contained a number of initiatives authored by Coleman. A centerpiece of the energy bill is Sen. Coleman's amendment, which was successfully adopted by a vote of 63 to 30, to require a national oil saving plan and direct the White House to identify within 9 months, and to publish within 18 months, federal requirements that will achieve a 2.5 million barrel-per-day reduction in U.S. oil consumption by 2016, 7 million barrels per day in 2026, and 10 million barrels per day in 2031. This represents the same amount of oil currently imported from the Middle East and, as a result, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 35 percent by 2030.  
   "This country is dangerously dependent on foreign oil and while our prices are increasing, our dependence continues to get worse. With passage of this bill, we can begin to take back control of our pressing energy needs here at home," said Coleman. "This bill will drastically boost our renewable energy production, improve vehicle and building efficiency, and bring new energy technologies to market. I am especially pleased that this bill contains my oil savings plan, as it is an important step toward strengthening our energy security, while also improving our economy and environment." 
   Senator Coleman was pleased that the Energy bill contained a significant portion of the bipartisan Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy (DRIVE) Act, legislation Coleman has co-authored and worked to pass in the last two sessions of Congress. The Senate accepted by voice vote yet another DRIVE Act amendment that Senators Coleman and Salazar offered to decrease our dependence on oil by increasing use of electricity in the transportation sector. Specifically, the amendment expands the near-term vehicle technology deployment program, establishes an Electric Drive Transportation research and development program, and removes barriers for existing and new applications of electric drive and hybrid transportation technologies. 
   In addition to the oil saving plan and electric vehicle amendments, the overall bill also included the following DRIVE Act provisions: 
   * Cellulosic Standard within the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): Starting in 2016, a significant portion of the RFS would have to be met with advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, biobutanol, and other fuels derived from unconventional biomass feedstocks. The Advanced Biofuels requirement starts at 3.0 billion gallons in 2016 and steadily rises by 3 billion gallons a year until it requires 21.0 billion gallons by 2022. 
   * Loan guarantees for cellulosic ethanol plants 
   * E-85 Infrastructure Grant Program: Uses CAFE penalties to fund E-85 infrastructure. 
   * Grants for E-85 infrastructure corridors 
   * Requirement for federal and state automobile fleets to reduce petroleum use 30% by 2016 
   * Increases Department of Energy bioenergy research and development funding 
   * Provides funding for manufacturers to refurbish facilities that produce advanced technology vehicles.
