SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES LATEST MINNESOTA JOBS, UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the latest Minnesota jobs report, which showed that more than 12,300 jobs created were in November while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.9 percent - the seventh straight month that unemployment has been below four percent. Along with a lower unemployment rate than the national average, Minnesota's growth rate of 2.5 percent outpaced the national rate of 1.3 percent.  
   "The best thing we can do for Minnesota's families is to make sure that Mom and Dad have a job," said Coleman. "I am pleased that pro-growth policies have resulted in today's strong job market. While the latest jobs numbers are encouraging, I will continue to work hard to address the everyday concerns of Minnesota's working families." 
   In November, 132,000 jobs were created nationally, with over 400,000 jobs created in the last three months alone. In addition to solid job gains, the unemployment rate for November was 4.5 percent, the lowest rate since June 2001, while wage gains were solid with average weekly earnings increasing 4.4 percent during the past year.
