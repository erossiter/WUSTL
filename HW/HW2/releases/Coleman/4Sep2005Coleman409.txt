SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman:
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist served America on the Supreme Court with distinction for 33 years. His steady leadership and profound respect for the Constitution will be a standard that should continue to be followed by future justices. His vision and passion were seen by all who worked with him, as he devoted so much of his life to public service, even during his struggle with cancer. His courage and dignity will be sorely missed.
