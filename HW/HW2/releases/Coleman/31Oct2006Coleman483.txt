SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $2,334,500 GRANT TO EXPAND SENIOR HOUSING IN ALBERT LEA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Accessible Space, Inc. in Albert Lea, Minnesota has been awarded a grant of $2,334,500 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of a grant program to support housing development for low income elderly residents. The grant will be used to construct 22 one-bedroom units and a two-bedroom unit for a resident manager. The grant also includes a $242,100 three-year rental subsidy to make the new units affordable for low income elderly residents.  
   "This funding will provide low income seniors with access to available and affordable housing," said Coleman. "I applaud HUD and Accessible Space for their combined vision and effort to ensure that our state's seniors are given access to the basic necessities that they deserve." 
   "We were fortunate to receive great support from Senator Coleman and are anxious to get started on a project that has been a long time coming," said Stephen Vander Schaaf of Accessible Space. "The purpose of the project will be two-fold. It provides much needed housing for a growing population of seniors while at the same time giving them a housing option that is affordable." 
   HUD also awarded grants to two other Minnesota companies as part of its program to support housing development for low income elderly residents. Horizon Health in Mora received $2,231,000, while the Ebenezer Society in Wyoming, MN received $3,415,500.
