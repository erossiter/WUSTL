SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $145,350 FOR VADNAIS HEIGHTS FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Vadnais Heights Fire Department has been awarded a $145,350 grant under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to upgrade the department's Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for helping the Vadnais Heights Fire Department improve the safety of its firefighters," said Coleman. "Everyday, firefighters across Minnesota put their personal safety and lives on the line to protect their communities and they deserve the best resources possible. With the help of this grant, firefighters in Vadnais Heights will be better protected, and I am pleased they have been selected for this funding." 
   "We as a fire department and a city are grateful for this grant," said Vadnais Heights Fire Chief Ed Leier. "We have been struggling to get our SCBA equipment in compliance and this grant will go a long way in helping us get the SCBA equipment to the same state as neighboring departments." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
