SENS. COLEMAN, KLOBUCHAR PASS AMENDMENT TO OVERCOME BARRIER FOR CASS COUNTY HOSPITAL
  Sens. Norm Coleman (R-MN) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) today successfully attached a bipartisan amendment to the 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill that will allow Cass County to construct a Critical Access Hospital in the city of Walker. Under current law, Cass County is unable to build a Critical Access Hospital in Walker because it does not meet the federal 35-mile minimum distance rule from the nearest hospital. The amendment, which passed by voice vote, will provide the county an exemption to this requirement. Sen. Coleman introduced similar legislation earlier this year.  
   "By passing this amendment, we are one step closer to making this hospital a reality for the Walker community," said Coleman. "It is unconscionable that residents of Cass County have to travel over an hour to receive emergency medical attention. I have heard firsthand from residents who live with the constant fear that they may not be able to get loved ones to the hospital in time. We cannot allow government red tape and regulations stand in the way of the safety of a community, and I am pleased to have worked with my colleague Senator Klobuchar to find a solution." 
   "The people of Cass County should have access to emergency and critical care close to home, not an hour or more away," said Klobuchar. "This vote paved the way for Walker to build a hospital that will deliver them the care they deserve." 
   Since 1975 Cass County has been one of only three counties in Minnesota without a hospital within its borders. Residents and visitors in north-central Cass County have to travel up to an hour or more to hospitals in Bemidji, Park Rapids, Deer River, Crosby, Staples or Brainerd to seek urgent care in emergency rooms and other hospital-based services.
