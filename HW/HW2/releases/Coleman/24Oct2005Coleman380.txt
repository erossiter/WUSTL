SEN. COLEMAN: GALLOWAY GAVE FALSE, MISLEADING TESTIMONY UNDER OATH TO SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT IN OIL-FOR-FOOD TRANSACTIONS
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN), Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), issued a follow-up report today disclosing evidence that Member of the British Parliament George Galloway gave false and misleading testimony on his involvement with the U.N. Oil-for-Food program at the Subcommittee's May 17, 2005 hearing entitled, "Oil-for-Influence: How Saddam Used Oil to Influence Politicians Under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program."  
   On May 17, 2005, George Galloway appeared before the Subcommittee and testified under oath regarding evidence obtained by the Subcommittee that he solicited and received financial support from Iraq in association with the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. In particular, Mr. Galloway denied being an oil trader, soliciting oil allocations, or instructing anyone to do so on his behalf. 
   "I directed the Subcommittee to continue its investigation into Mr. Galloway because his testimony at the May 17, 2005 hearing so clearly conflicted with the evidence," Coleman said. "False and misleading testimony before the Subcommittee undermines the integrity of the Subcommittee. The additional evidence gathered by the Subcommittee clearly demonstrates that the testimony Mr. Galloway provided to the Subcommittee was false and misleading." 
   Since the May hearing, the Subcommittee has obtained further evidence establishing that the Hussein regime granted oil allocations to Galloway and his political organization, the "Mariam Appeal." The Subcommittee report reveals that British MP George Galloway made false or misleading statements before the Subcommittee on May 17, 2005. Specifically, evidence gathered by the Subcommittee reveals: 
   * Galloway personally solicited and was granted eight oil allocations totaling 23 million barrels from the Hussein government from 1999 through 2003; 
   * Galloway's wife, Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad, received approximately $150,000 in connection with one allocation of oil; 
   * Galloway's political campaign, the Mariam Appeal, received at least $446,000 in connection with several allocations granted under the Oil-for-Food Program; 
   * Illegal "surcharge" payments in excess of $1.6 million were paid to the Hussein regime in connection with the oil allocations granted to Galloway and the Mariam Appeal; and 
   * Galloway knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath before the Subcommittee at its hearing on May 17, 2005. 
   "The additional evidence gathered by the Subcommittee links George Galloway to the Iraqi regime's scheme to manipulate the U.N. Oil-for-Food program," said Coleman. "Records obtained indicate that Dr. Abu-Zayyad, the wife of George Galloway, received a $150,000 payment and Mariam Appeal, the political campaign led by George Galloway, received at least $446,000." 
   The findings revealed in the Subcommittee's report have been substantiated by personal interviews with high-level members of the Hussein regime, oil traders with personal knowledge of Galloway's involvement, and extensive bank records that provide a conclusive paper trail and corroborate Galloway's personal knowledge and involvement in the Oil-for-Food scandal. 
   Sen. Coleman personally sent Galloway a letter requesting an interview, and offered to fly staff to London in order to conduct the interview. Mr. Galloway declined both offers, and instead, offered to respond to written questions. Galloway denied any involvement whatsoever in any Oil-for-Food transaction in his written responses. 
   Under the Federal False Statements Statute, it is unlawful for a witness to give false testimony before Congress on a material matter where that witness does so willfully and under oath, and the Federal Obstruction of Congressional Proceedings Statute prohibits a wide variety of obstructive conduct that influences, obstructs, or impedes a Congressional inquiry. "I am reviewing the evidence with Senator Levin to determine the propriety of referring this matter to the Department of Justice," said Coleman. 
   "As you know, Mr. Galloway has authored an account of his testimony before the Subcommittee, entitled, Mr. Galloway Goes to Washington: The Brit Who Set Congress Straight about Iraq. As the Subcommittee report shows, Galloway was anything but straight with Congress and the American people."
