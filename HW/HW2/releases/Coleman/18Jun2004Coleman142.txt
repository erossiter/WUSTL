SEN. COLEMAN REACTS TO KILLING OF AMERICAN CITIZEN PAUL JOHNSON
  Statement from Sen. Coleman on the killing of Paul Johnson:   
   Paul Johnson's brutal and senseless murder and the killing of Nicholas Berg last month remind us why we fight an aggressive war on terror. Our enemies know no honor. Theirs is a false faith that violates the peaceful tenets of Islam and instead worships hate, merciless violence and destruction against free peoples everywhere. The tragic slaying of Paul Johnson confirms that this is a fight we cannot surrender.
   Although the war on terror is testing and hard, its outcome is clear. We fight for freedom, they fight for fear. We live by the time tested values of justice and human equality, they live by a lie.
