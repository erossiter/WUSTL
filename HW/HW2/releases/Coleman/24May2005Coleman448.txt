SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIAL NOMINEE COMPROMISE
 "I am pleased that the agreement reached to limit the use of the filibuster allows us to proceed with an up or down vote on appellate court nominee Priscilla Owen.  
 It also forestalls the need to vote on a rules change that would have prevented the unprecedented filibustering of judges begun last year and returned the Senate to the over 200 year tradition of up or down votes on judges who get out of committee. I look forward to focusing my energies on taking action on a host of critical concerns, such as our jobs agenda, including an energy bill, completion of a new highway bill, higher education legislation and confirming John Bolton as our new U.N. Ambassador. I applaud the fact that this agreement will allow the work of the Senate to go forward. But, the true test of this agreement will be when the President fills a Supreme Court vacancy-and whether that nominee gets an up or down vote."
