FINAL WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT CONFERENCE REPORT CONTAINS SEN. COLEMAN PROVISIONS FOR CRITICAL MINNESOTA PROJECTS
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that House and Senate Conferees have come to agreement on a final version of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) containing funding he successfully secured for a number of aging wastewater treatment and flood control projects in Minnesota. Specifically, the WRDA conference report authorizes a number of Army Corps of Engineers flood control projects, including specific projects Coleman secured for Roseau, Goodview, Willmar, Grand Rapids and Douglas County, along with navigational improvements and ecosystem restoration of the Upper Mississippi River. 
   "Minnesota depends on a safe and efficient water infrastructure system that is good for our economy, good for our residents, and good for our environment," said Coleman. "Unfortunately, much of this infrastructure - from locks and dams on the Mississippi to drinking water facilities in our rural communities - is falling behind. The Water Resources Development Act authorizes a substantial investment in this critical infrastructure to improve our navigable waterways, assist our cities and towns with water and sewer projects, and expand environmental protection projects throughout our state and nation. I am extremely proud to support this legislation that does so much for so many Minnesotans."  
   Senator Coleman was successful in securing authorizations for the following Minnesota projects in the WRDA conference report: 
   * $25,100,000 for the City of Roseau's flood control project. The Roseau project will include a 150-foot wide diversion channel that will divert floodwaters around the city to the east, providing reliable permanent flood protection to a majority of the city. In addition to flood damage reduction, the plan includes recreational features such as multipurpose trails, motorized trails, and a trailhead. 
   * $3 million for the City of Goodview's radium filtration plant. The authorization, which represents 75 percent of the project cost - the maximum federal match - will make the city eligible for federal assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to help finance and construct the plant. 
   * $15 million to construct a new wastewater treatment facility in the city of Willmar. The authorization will also be used to construct wastewater conveyance facilities between the new wastewater treatment facility and Willmar's existing wastewater treatment facility. The new treatment facility will be less disruptive to the Minnesota River than the current wastewater treatment facility, which is 70 years old. 
   * $5 million to reconstruct and upgrade the existing wastewater treatment facility in the city of Grand Rapids. The funding is necessary in order to accommodate the proposed expansion by UPM/Blandin to their Grand Rapids paper mill. This expansion is known as the "Thunderhawk Project" and will create hundreds of jobs in the region. 
   * $2 million to upgrade wastewater infrastructure in the Douglas County Lakes Area to maintain the pristine quality of Douglas County's lakes. The funding will assist in developing a sewer system in the townships of Le Grande and Moe. 
   * $9 million for the Duluth Harbor navigation project. 
   * Authorizes funding for the Borup flood damage reduction project in the South Branch of the Wild Rice River. 
   * Authorizes funding for the Crow River project in Rockford for flood damage reduction. 
   * Authorizes funding for the Tower navigation project. 
   * The Wild Rice River flood protection project. This provision directs the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the evaluation and construction of the flood protection project and develop alternatives to the Twin Valley lake feature. 
   * Asian Carp dispersal barrier. This provision requires the Army Corps of Engineers to study and construct an Asian carp barrier at lock and dam 11. 
   The legislation also includes upgrades for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Restoration (UMR-IWW), including for critical navigation improvements along the waterway along and $1.5 billion in ecosystem restoration. The UMR-IWW makes commercial navigation possible between Minneapolis and St. Louis on the Mississippi River, and along the Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi River. Five of the nation's top agricultural production states; Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin; have relied on the UMR-IWW system as a principal conduit for export-bound agricultural products, mostly bulk corn and soybeans. 
   "This bill is not only a huge success for our smaller communities, it also translates in to a large-scale victory for our nation as whole," added Coleman. "Projects such as the restoration of the Upper Mississippi River's ecosystem play integral roles in solidifying the United States position as a top competitor in the global market."
