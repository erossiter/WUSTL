SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF OF STAFF
  Sen. Norm Coleman today named Jennifer Mies Lowe, a veteran Capitol Hill staffer, to serve as his new Chief of Staff, heading up his office. Lowe will serve as Coleman's top advisor, guiding the development and implementation of Coleman's issues and priorities.  
   "I am delighted to appoint Jennifer as my Chief of Staff," Coleman said. "Jennifer has an impressive working knowledge of the Senate and brings a wealth of experience to this position. Her energy, experience and talent will be invaluable as we move forward in our work on behalf of the people of Minnesota." 
   Lowe has worked in the U.S. Senate for the past seven years, most recently as Director of Senator Ted Stevens' President Pro Tempore office in the Capitol. She has also directed the functioning of the Joint Committee on the Library, the oldest House-Senate committee in Congress. Additionally, Lowe helped Stevens establish the U.S.-China Interparliamentary Group, the official dialogue mechanism between the U.S. Senate and the National People's Congress. Prior to running Stevens' leadership office, Lowe worked in Senator Stevens' personal office. Lowe previously served on Elizabeth Dole's presidential campaign and worked at the European Institute, a leading Washington, D.C. based think tank devoted to U.S.-E.U. relations. 
   "Senator Coleman is known to be one of the hardest working Members of Congress and I am proud to join his great team," Lowe said. "I look forward to helping him address issues that face Minnesota and the nation." 
   Lowe replaces Erich Mische, who recently left to join the private sector after serving as Senator Coleman's Chief of Staff since January, 2004.
