SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETERANS DAY
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON VETERANS DAY
   "It has been said that liberty is God's greatest gift to mankind.  
 On this Veterans Day, we pay homage to the men and women who have served our nation at home and abroad. As a nation we pause to reflect upon the sacrifices of the soldiers who have fought bravely to protect the liberties we hold dear. They have courageously laid down their lives so that our county would be free of tyranny and oppression. 
   As the son of a World War II veteran, I also stop to recognize the strength and sacrifices of the families and friends who have a loved one currently serving in our armed forces. I encourage all Minnesotans to take the time to personally thank a veteran they know or may meet on the street for their service and selflessness in protecting and preserving the freedoms that unite us as a nation."
