SEN. COLEMAN SUPPORTS AMBASSADOR BOLTON NOMINATION AT SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE HEARING
  As part of his ongoing efforts to bring about reform in the United Nations, Sen. Norm Coleman voiced his support for John Bolton's nomination as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. at today's Senate Foreign Relations Committee Confirmation hearing. Bolton has been serving since last July as the U.S. Ambassador under a temporary recess appointment, which expires at the end of this year.  
   "In light of the significant challenges that are currently being addressed at the U.N, which include the crisis in the Middle East, North Korea's nuclear weapons development and missile tests, Iran's quest for nuclear weapons, and genocide in Darfur, the U.S. simply cannot afford to go without representation at the UN," said Coleman. "Ambassador Bolton has been instrumental in getting the Security Council to take concrete action on critical issues threatening international peace and security, and has been the leading advocate for meaningful U.N. reform. He has done an outstanding job, and we need to ensure that we continue his leadership in the UN by confirming his nomination." 
   Last year, a Democratic filibuster prevented Bolton's confirmation by the Senate, but the Administration gave him a temporary recess appointment. Technically, the Administration could give Bolton another recess appointment, but he would not be able to receive a salary. 
   "We cannot afford to draw out this process," said Coleman. "We need to confirm Ambassador Bolton and send him back to the UN with a strong mandate."
