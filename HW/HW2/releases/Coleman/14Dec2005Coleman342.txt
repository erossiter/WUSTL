WHITE HOUSE NOMINATES UNIVERSITY OF ST. THOMAS LAW PROFESSOR SCHILTZ FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIP
  Sen. Norm Coleman today welcomed President Bush's nomination of Patrick J. Schiltz, a Professor of Law at the University of St. Thomas, to serve as a United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, replacing retiring Judge Richard Kyle.  
   Senator Coleman commended President Bush's selection of Mr. Schiltz, who holds the St. Thomas More Chair in Law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
   "President Bush has named an exceptionally well qualified nominee and highly respected authority on the law to the federal bench," Senator Coleman said. "Mr. Schiltz's experience in the law spanning twenty years as a clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court, an accomplished attorney in private practice, and a nationally acclaimed professor of law make him an excellent choice. I am confident he will serve with honor and distinction." 
   A native of Duluth, Minnesota, Mr. Schiltz has wide legal experience and expertise, graduating summa cum laude from the College of St. Scholastica and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. After serving as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Mr. Schiltz practiced law for eight years with Faegre & Benson, Minnesota's second largest law firm. In 1995 Mr. Schiltz joined the faculty of Notre Dame Law School, where he became a nationally recognized scholar in the areas of legal ethics and appellate procedure. In July 2000, Mr. Schiltz became the founding associate dean and interim dean of the University of St. Thomas School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he played a significant role in many aspects of creating the new law school. Mr. Schiltz is married to Elizabeth Rose Schiltz and has four children.
