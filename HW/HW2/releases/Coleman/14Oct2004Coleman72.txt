SEN. COLEMAN REMINDS MINNESOTANS THAT HIS CAPITOL HILL OFFICE OPEN TO ALL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today reminded all Minnesotans that his Capitol Hill office is open and its services available to all Minnesota constituents.  
 Coleman made it clear that Minnesotans should continue to contact or visit his office at 320 Hart Senate Office building should they be in need of a tour, service or wish to express an opinion.
   "The services of my Capitol Hill office in Washington, D.C. remain very much open and accessible to Minnesotans," Coleman said today. "Citizens should feel free to stop by to visit, or if they need assistance in any way. It's important to know that we are 'Open for Business' throughout October and beyond."
   The Senate Sergeant at Arms, United States Capitol Police, Washington, DC Mayor Anthony Williams and congressional leadership have all conveyed that there is no new intelligence information that necessitates the closing of Washington offices or for constituents to avoid visiting the Capitol.
   "And since I will be traveling back to Washington several times from now until the election to work on the Intelligence Reform conference committee, I hope to greet many Minnesotans in my Washington office personally," Coleman concluded. "We are open and open to all."
