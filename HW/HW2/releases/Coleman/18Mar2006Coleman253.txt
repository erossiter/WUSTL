SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RETIREMENT OF REP. SABO
  "It has been my privilege to know and serve in Washington with Martin Sabo, not only the second longest serving member of our Congressional delegation, but also one of the most effective. As a former mayor who understands that partisan differences should not affect the ability to get things done for folks back home, I admired and learned from Congressman Sabo's skill in delivering on projects, such as light-rail transportation, that have a tangible impact on his constituents' daily lives. While we come from different points on the political spectrum, Congressman Sabo has been a dedicated advocate for his constituents in the Fifth Congressional District for 28 years. I hope all Minnesotans join me in honoring Martin Sabo's lifetime of public service in the Congress, as well as his previous service as the Speaker of the House in the Minnesota legislature."
