NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS AWARDS SEN. COLEMAN GUARDIAN OF SMALL BUSINESS AWARD
  The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the largest small-business advocacy group, awarded Sen.  
 Norm Coleman its Guardian of Small Business Award yesterday. The commendation was made in recognition of NFIB's 100% support of Coleman's voting record.
   "I'm honored to receive this award," Coleman said. Senator Coleman is a member of the Senate's Small Business Committee. "When I came to Washington, I made a commitment to fight for small businesses across Minnesota."
   In the words of NFIB, the Guardian of Small Business Award is presented to members of Congress who "are true and consistent advocate for Main Street small businesses and are a stalwart champion of small businesses across the country."
   In Minnesota, there are 128,881 business with fewer than 500 employees, which employ more than 1.2 million individuals in Minnesota and account for 51 percent of the non-farm sector employees.
