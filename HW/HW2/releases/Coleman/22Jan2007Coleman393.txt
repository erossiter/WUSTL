SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $74,492 FOR COLD SPRING FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Cold Spring Fire and Rescue Department has received a $74,492 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase essential communications equipment for the department's firefighters.  
   "Every day, firefighters across Minnesota risk their personal safety to serve their communities," said Coleman. "Ensuring that local first responders have the best resources available is critical to the safety of area citizens. This grant will improve the safety of both firefighters and residents in and around Cold Spring, and I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for awarding this important grant." 
   "We're happy with all of the help we received in obtaining this grant," said Duane Krueger of the Cold Spring Fire and Rescue Department. "It has been a long process, but this grant will help our fire department upgrade our essential communications equipment." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
