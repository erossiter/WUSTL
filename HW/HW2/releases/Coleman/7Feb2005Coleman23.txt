SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDES $40 MILLION FOR GRAND FORKS, EAST GRAND FORKS FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) today announced $40 million was included in the President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal for the Grand Forks/East Grand Forks flood control project.  
 Coleman has heard from East Grand Forks Mayor Lynn Stauss and other area officials about the importance of this project and wrote the President directly about this matter back in December of 2004. These funds would ultimately go to the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers to construct levees and floodwalls set back from the river, forming three "rings" around both communities. The design level of protection is equivalent to the peak discharge experienced during the 1997 flood. The President's budget proposal will now be considered by the Congress, where Sen. Coleman will work for the inclusion of these funds in the final Fiscal Year 2006 Appropriations bills. 
   "I'm pleased that the President supports providing these funds for flood prevention in Grand Forks / East Grand Forks," Coleman said. "I've witnessed the destruction flooding has done to that region firsthand, and I have long been committed to ensuring that we have the infrastructure in place to prevent that tragedy from ever happening again. As the appropriations process continues, I will work hard to ensure these important flood prevention funds remain in the final appropriations bills we will ultimately pass."
