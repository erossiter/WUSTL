SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $19,000 FOR WELLS VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Volunteer Fire Department in Wells, Minnesota has been awarded a grant of $19,000 from the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grants Program (AFG). The fire department will use the funding to purchase a new air compressor, which is used to provide firefighters with pure air when they are in danger of inhaling smoke or gases during fire rescues.  
   "This funding for fire department improvements will help protect firefighters who put their lives on the line for the citizens of Wells," said Coleman. "I applaud the AFG program and the Wells Volunteer Fire Department for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of Wells have the resources they need to protect their community." 
   "The Wells Fire Department and the City of Wells are very fortunate to receive this grant from the Assistance to Firefighter Grants Program," said Scott Linde, Assistant Fire Chief for the Wells Fire Department. "This grant helps make a great organization as well prepared and equipped as possible. We would like to thank all those who support and make the program possible." 
   The AFG program awards grants directly to fire departments to support the nation's firefighters and the services they deliver. The AFG program provides financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
