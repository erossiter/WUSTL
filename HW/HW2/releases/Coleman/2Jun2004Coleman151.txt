SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE'S RULING ON FEDERAL PBA BAN
  Statement from Senator Norm Coleman on Judge's Ruling on Federal PBA Ban 
   "Sadly, I can't say that yesterday's ruling by Judge Hamilton comes as much of a surprise - that portion of the federal bench is now infamous for issuing decisions that fly in the face of the Constitution, not to mention basic American values.
   I was proud to vote for a federal ban on partial birth abortion last October. Abortion might be a difficult and divisive issue, but putting an end to partial birth abortion is where most of us should be able to find common ground. It's common decency.
   Nevertheless, Judge Hamilton yesterday attempted to deny the will of the American people, doing so by overstepping basic judicial boundaries. Yesterday's decision represents judicial activism at its worst."
