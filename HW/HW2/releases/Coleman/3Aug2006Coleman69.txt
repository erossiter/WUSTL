SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TAX RELIEF BILL
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today made the following statement on the Family Prosperity Act, which failed to move forward in a procedural vote of 56-42:  
   "This evening we missed a rare opportunity to provide tax relief to the American people. I am deeply disappointed with the Senate's failure to advance this bill, which would have provided family-owned small businesses and farmers permanent relief from the death tax, increased the minimum wage, and extended important expiring tax provisions for our businesses, families, and teachers. 
   This would also have been a good opportunity to pass my Rural Renaissance proposal to issue tax credit bonds for rural infrastructure projects. This measure would empower rural communities to upgrade their basic infrastructure in order to attract new investment and jobs. 
   Not only did the Democrats obstruct our ability to extend important tax relief that is essential to our businesses and schools, but they also stymied our chance to raise the living standard of America's hardworking families. The American people sent us to Washington to get things done and are not interested in the politics of obstruction. They are interested in the politics of achievement. To that end, I will continue working with my colleagues to pass Republican pro-growth policies that since 2003 have created over 5.4 million jobs."
