SEN. COLEMAN, SBA ADMINISTRATOR MEET WITH MINNESOTA SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today hosted the new U.S. Small Business Administrator Steven C. Preston as part of his visit to Minnesota at Coleman's invitation. Coleman and Preston began the day by addressing the 11th Annual Minnesota Development Conference: Accelerating Innovation and Entrepreneurship.  
   "Today, Administrator Preston and I had the opportunity to address the people that spur small business development in every corner of this state," Coleman. "I have long said that small businesses are the engine that drives this economy, and I expressed the importance of SBA programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program which provides small business access to government R&D funding. Supporting small businesses to undertake pioneering, but risky technological research and development work is essential to keeping our competitive edge." 
   Following the conference, Senator Coleman and Administrator Preston toured the Global Market in Minneapolis and participated in a townhall meeting with members of Minnesota's diverse small business community to discuss the impact SBA programs have had on the Minnesota economic development climate. 
   "The Global Market is Minnesota's miracle on Lake Street. It provided the ideal backdrop for our discussion on ways to expand SBA's outreach to minority entrepreneurs," said Coleman. "Administrator Preston is one of Washington's most important economic decision makers, and I was impressed by his desire to work with Minnesota's small business community." 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senator Coleman has been a strong proponent of America's small businesses. Recently, Coleman was successful in including a provision to the Senate SBA Reauthorization bill to require SBA to conduct a study on the impact of the elimination of the low-doc program on rural lending. Despite the fact that SBA-supported lending has increased in Minnesota, the rural share of lending has decreased significantly, from 49 percent in 2001 to just 28 percent in 2005. 
   Additionally, Coleman was successful in attaching an amendment that authorizes a $5 million workforce development grant pilot program to encourage leading innovative small businesses to provide short-term opportunities for college students who major in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. The proposal would provide Small Business Innovation Research Program grantees who offer internships for these students with a 10% bonus grant, up to $10,000 per year.
