SEN. COLEMAN MEETS WITH ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE REGARDING U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN SOMALIA
  Sen. Norm Coleman met today with Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Constance Berry Newman to urge greater U.S. involvement in Somalia.  
 Coleman, who is a member of the Africa Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, relayed to Assistant Secretary Newman concerns raised during his April 22 meeting with the Minnesota Somali community. Specifically, Coleman urged greater U.S. involvement in establishing the new government and in providing humanitarian assistance. Newman committed to Coleman that the U.S. would become more engaged and said that new inter-agency meetings are currently underway to develop a more active Somalia policy. 
   "The meeting was productive, and I look forward to working with Secretary Newman in the future to increase U.S. engagement in Somalia both in regards to humanitarian relief and the establishment of a new government," said Coleman. 
   Assistant Secretary Newman also recommended that the Somali people, both in Somalia and the United States, unite behind the transitional government and encourage that government to move from its current location in Kenya into Somalia.
