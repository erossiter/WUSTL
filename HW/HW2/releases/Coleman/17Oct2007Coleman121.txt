SEN. COLEMAN SECURES FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA YOUTH PROGRAMS IN COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate last night passed the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill, which contains funding Senator Norm Coleman secured for several key Minnesota projects. Coleman, along with his Minnesota colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar, was successful in including $600,000 in funding for the National Child Protection Training Center, a partnership between Winona State University and the National District Attorneys Association. The Center provides training, technical assistance and publications to child protection professionals throughout the country, and assists states in developing courses to teach investigators how to interview young child abuse victims. Since taking office, Senator Coleman has worked to secure over $1,500,000 in funding for the Center, and toured the facility with Center staff.  
   "While abused children often have the odds stacked against them, the services the National Child Protection Training Center offers can turn their lives around," said Coleman. "The child protection professionals at NCPTC are great at what they do, but to do their incredible work, they must have the resources they need to help young child abuse victims. I am extremely pleased to see a program that has had such beneficial impacts on Minnesota youth included in this bill, I cannot think of a more deserving recipient." 
   Minnesota's Senators also were able to secure $350,000 for Bolder Options, an innovative non-profit agency in Minnesota that has improved the lives of more than 350 youth in the last five years. Last year, Bolder Options was named one of the top five charities in the Today Show Lend a Hand Series for its work coupling one-on-one mentoring programs with academic goal-setting and athletic activities. 
   "The early years in a child's life are among the most critical as they grow into adults who are able to thrive in today's world," said Coleman. "I have made it a priority to fight for programs that support the education and protection of our nation's youth. For this reason, I am very pleased to see the Senate grant Bolder Options with this critical funding. Equipping a child with a proper education and support system fosters their development into capable and hardworking adults, which not only ensures a bright future their individual life, but also for our nation as a whole."
