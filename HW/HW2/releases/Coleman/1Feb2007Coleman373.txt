SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES BIPARTISAN PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Recognizing the necessity of raising the federal minimum wage for the first time in over nine years, Sen. Norm Coleman today joined his Senate colleagues in voting to approve an increase in the minimum wage by a vote of 94 to 3. The legislation provides critical small business relief measures including an extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Section 179 expensing and 15-year cost recovery for leasehold improvements, new restaurant buildings and retail improvement property.  
   "Today's vote to increase the minimum wage was long overdue," said Coleman. "It has been more than nine years since the minimum wage was last increased. This is simply not right for our minimum wage workers who must deal with the significant increase in the cost of living during all these years. With this minimum wage increase, Congress is finally helping out the 50 percent of workers who come from poor and low income families--including those Minnesotans who work in nearly 230,000 low wage jobs. At the same time, I am pleased that we are providing critical support for our small businesses." 
   Senator Coleman has a long and consistent history of supporting an increase in the minimum wage, voting for increases several times in 2005 and 2006. Most recently, on Aug. 3, 2006, he voted for a motion to proceed to "Trifecta" legislation that would have increased the minimum wage. 
   The legislation passed by the Senate will increase the federal minimum wage by $2.10 over two years to $7.25 and provide small business relief including: 
   * 5-year extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credits: Extends through 2012 a tax credit to encourage employers to hire workers facing significant workplace entry barriers. This credit also has been expanded to cover those veterans disabled since September 11, 2001. 
   * 1-year extension of Section 179 Expensing Relief: Extends through 2010 increased expensing allowance for small businesses. 
   * 3-month extension of 15-year cost recovery for leasehold improvements, new restaurant buildings and retail improvement property: Extends through March 31, 2008, small businesses depreciation relief related to qualified property costs. 
   * Cash-Method of Accounting: Expands small business eligibility for the cash-method of accounting. 
   "As a former mayor and member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I understand the importance of small business to our economy," said Coleman. "These protections will help America's small businesses flourish while at the same time providing a much needed minimum wage increase that will help our minimum wage workers to deal with the ever rising costs of day-to-day living."
