SENS. GRASSLEY, COLEMAN INTRODUCE BILL TO CLOSE ETHANOL IMPORT LOOPHOLE
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced legislation with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) that would close a loophole in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983, intended to help Central American nations, that currently permits Brazilian ethanol to be passed through El Salvador before being imported to the United States duty-free. 
   "This loophole in the law that allows ethanol imports to be merely passed through Central American countries in order to come into the United States without tariffs must be closed," said Coleman. "Trade preferences intended to give Central American countries some duty-free access to help them get on their economic feet is a good thing, but recent reports about ethanol being funneled through Central America simply to be imported to the United States is a non starter. This bill cuts that effort off."
