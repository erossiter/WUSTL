SEN. COLEMAN TO TOUR WEST CENTRAL MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Norm Coleman will visit Wheaton, Breckenridge, Fergus Falls, and Elbow Lake as part of a trip to Traverse, Wilkin, Grant, and Ottertail Counties Tuesday, August 29th. Coleman will tour the Wheaton Hospital and Otter Tail Power, as well as meet with local community leaders in the region.  
   "I am eager to hear what the folks in Traverse, Wilkin, Grant, and Ottertail Counties have to say about renewable energy, rural health care, and other important local issues" said Coleman. "These meetings are an opportunity to see what rural residents are doing in the fight for energy independence and gain a better understanding of the problems and solutions rural health care providers face and employ in their efforts to give the best possible care to rural residents." 
   Coleman's first stop will be in Wheaton, where he will tour the Wheaton Hospital. He will meet with the Mayor of Breckenridge and other local leaders at The Northern Grill followed by lunch with Elbow Lake leaders at Gilly's Prime Time Bar and Grill.
