SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $311,300 FOR RED WING REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Red Wing has been awarded a $311,300 federal grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grant will be aimed at expanding the airport apron to provide an adequate hold area for aircrafts at Red Wing Regional Airport.  
   "Local airports are an extremely valuable resource across the state and I am pleased Red Wing's airport was selected for this funding," said Coleman. "From greater access for residents and visitors, to the potential for future community development, these airports are important to their communities and I applaud the FAA for recognizing Red Wing Regional's value by awarding this grant." 
   The FAA uses the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for the planning and development of qualified public-use airports. The grants are awarded to eligible projects that enhance security, capacity, and environmental concerns.
