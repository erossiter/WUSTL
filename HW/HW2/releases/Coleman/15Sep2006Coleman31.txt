SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES CLEARANCE OF WIND ENERGY PROJECTS IN SOUTHWEST MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) yesterday announced three wind energy development projects in southwest Minnesota will move forward after confirmation from the developers that FAA no longer considers the projects a hazard to the radar station in Tyler, Minnesota. The clearance from the FAA, which was expedited at the request of Sen. Coleman, authorizes construction of the projects and will allow the companies to complete the facilities in time to be eligible for the renewable production tax credit enacted by Congress set to expire in 2007.  
   "Hundreds of millions of dollars in wind development, much-needed jobs in southwestern Minnesota, and abundant renewable energy can now become a reality thanks to the FAA clearing the way for these three Minnesota wind projects," said Coleman. "I have worked for over a month to secure these notices and ensure Minnesota remains the fastest growing wind energy state in the country. I am pleased the FAA heeded calls to examine these projects." 
   Earlier this summer, three Minnesota wind projects by PPM Energy, EnXco Energy, and Wind Energy Developers received "Notices of Presumed Hazard" from the FAA - triggering an assessment of whether they will interfere with a radar station near Tyler, Minnesota. The FAA's decision prevented construction on these projects from going forward and jeopardized their qualification for the renewable production tax credit. 
   On June 21st, Senators Coleman and Cornyn sent a joint letter to the FAA requesting expedited consideration of these projects and continued to press the FAA for resolution through the summer. FAA ruled these Minnesota projects would not constitute a hazard to the operation of the Tyler, Minnesota radar station.
