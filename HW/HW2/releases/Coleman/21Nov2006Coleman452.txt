SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MILITARY DRAFT
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE MILITARY DRAFT: 
   I am in strong opposition to reinstating a military draft. Preserving a volunteer system is essential to the health and vitality of our armed forces. Today, America possesses the finest military in the world, and our top priority should be maintaining that quality. While I understand the concerns regarding the overextension of our forces, we are on course to meet re-enlistment goals. We should continue to provide strong incentives for the men and women who choose to enlist, not only to maintain our fighting strength but just as importantly to express our gratitude for their commitment to our country.
