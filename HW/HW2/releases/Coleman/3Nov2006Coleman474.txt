SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT GRANTS FOR BIWABIK, MAHTOWA
  Sen. Coleman today announced the Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) program has awarded a $15,215 grant to the Biwabik Township First Responders and a $13,718 grant to the Mahtowa Volunteer Fire Department. The federal funding will allow the respective departments to fund improvements to operations and safety.  
   "These grants will help ensure the safety of both the citizens and firefighters in and around the Biwabik and Mahtowa area," said Coleman. "In Greater Minnesota, local first responders are the first line of safety for their neighbors. They need the best resources possible, and I applaud the AFG program and these individual departments for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of these communities are well-protected." 
   The AFG program provides financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
