SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF JUDGE ALITO
  "I am pleased that a majority of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agree that Judge Samuel Alito has demonstrated the quality of intellect, character and integrity to serve on the nation's highest court. Clearly, Judge Alito is immensely qualified. Additionally, he has shown a steadfast commitment to applying the law, rather than making the law, throughout his distinguished career. I am now eagerly looking forward to the full Senate debate on his nomination, and, ultimately, the confirmation of Judge Alito as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court."
