SEN. COLEMAN TOUTS JUMP IN JUNE JOBS REPORT FOR MINNESOTA
  Highlighting the best quarterly job growth in Minnesota in over 20 years, Sen. Norm Coleman today praised Republican pro-growth tax policies and Minnesota entrepreneurs that fueled the expansion. According to the latest government figures, Minnesota created over 15,000 jobs in June and the state's unemployment level fell to 3.6 percent-- the lowest rate since March 2001. Nearly 33,000 jobs were created in the state during the second quarter, equaling 10 percent of the nation's growth - the best job growth since 1984.  
   "We continue to see strong job growth in the state and across this country," Coleman said. "This is a testament to Republican pro-growth policies and the hard work of folks all around the country. Minnesotans and Americans should look toward the future optimistically given these fantastic jobs figures." 
   At the national level, 121,000 jobs were created in June while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent- the lowest rate since July 2001 and below the averages for each of the past four decades. Average hourly wages across the United States have increased by nearly 4 percent in the past year and average weekly earnings by 4.5 percent. 
   "To sustain this remarkable progress, we need to continue to be fiscally disciplined while keeping in place the pro-growth policies that have been essential to our economy's success," Coleman added.
