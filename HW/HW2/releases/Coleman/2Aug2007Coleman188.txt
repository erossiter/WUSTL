SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN
  Statement On Senate Passage Of SCHIP: 
   I am pleased that the Senate has passed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Plan. I have been in close conversation with the Finance Committee throughout the crafting of the bill to preserve and continue the good work Minnesota has already begun when it comes to covering kids. Foremost in my mind was protecting any Minnesotans from losing insurance. Still, I am concerned about the $90 billion House bill, which burdens taxpayers with a hefty price tag and leads the country towards a major expansion of government health. I disagree with those of my colleagues who seem to want the government to take control of the nation's healthcare system and make decisions for you regarding your health. You should own and control your own health insurance, not the government. What government should do is take care of the most vulnerable, which we honored today by reauthorizing SCHIP. I'm working on a plan to continue the process of developing appropriate government interventions to reduce the barriers to every American obtaining and keeping health insurance by simplifying and coordinating the purchase of affordable options for everyone.
