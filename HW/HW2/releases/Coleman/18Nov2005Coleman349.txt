SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES BIPARTISAN TAX RECONCILIATION BILL THAT STOPS TAX HIKE ON HARD-WORKING PARENTS, SMALL BUSINESSES, TEACHERS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the passage of the Tax Relief Act of 2005 (S.2020) that ensures that small businesses, teachers, and middle-income families will not see their federal tax bill rise next year. This bill also includes three significant amendments authored by Sen. Coleman that are aimed at developing infrastructure in rural communities, providing students resources to compete globally in math and science, and protecting honest taxpayers from abusive and sham tax shelters which have allowed dishonest taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 64-33.  
   "We have a responsibly to ensure our nation's hard-working moms and dads and small businesses do not see a massive tax hike next year," said Coleman. "This bill protects middle-income families from the alternative minimum tax, keeps in place deductions for teachers and college students, and extends both the Research and Development tax credit and Section 179 expensing for small businesses, which both helps Minnesota companies innovate and grow jobs." 
   "For those who have reservations about tax relief, I would simply note it has helped our economy to create four million new jobs and pushed the unemployment rate to four-year lows, all while our economy continues to grow faster than many other industrialized nations. These figures are a true reflection of a strong economy, and behind the statistics and percentages are business owners looking to expand and families working to send their kids to college." 
   Sen. Coleman secured inclusion of his Rural Renaissance bill into the Tax Relief Act of 2005. Coleman, along with Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, filed an amendment that was passed as part of Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley's (R-IA) manager's package. The amendment would provide $200 million worth of rural renaissance bonds. In turn, these bond proceeds will pay for an estimated $150 million in rural development grants. 
   "As a former mayor, I know that maintaining basic infrastructure job creation and development are critical components to economic vitality," said Coleman. "The inclusion of Rural Renaissance in the Tax Reconciliation bill is a huge victory for Minnesota and Main Street American. I want to thank Sen. Pryor for his commitment and strong leadership on this issue. The Rural Renaissance II Act will empower rural communities to upgrade outdated, inadequate, or nonexistent basic infrastructure in order to attract new investment and jobs." 
   The Tax Relief Act also includes a provision of Senator Coleman's COMPETE Act (S. 1020). Under current law, businesses can deduct charitable contributions as a business expense, but this deduction is limited to 10 percent of the business's taxable income. Coleman's provision raises the limitation to 15 percent for charitable contributions made by businesses to the Department of Education's Math and Science Partnership (MSP) program. 
   "Increasingly, Americans compete with the world's laborers for jobs," said Coleman. "This amendment will forge stronger relationships between the private sector and our educational institutions, giving our students the resources needed to excel in math and sciences. Armed with these skills, Minnesota students will be better prepared to meet the challenges and competition in the future. I'm pleased that yesterday's passage included this vital provision to help keep America competitive." 
   MSPs are partnerships between high-need public schools and the Science, Math, Engineering and Technological (STEM) departments of colleges and universities. MSPs help to increase the academic achievement of students in mathematics and science by enhancing the content knowledge and teaching skills of classroom teachers. 
   Finally, the Tax Relief Act of 2005 that passed the Senate last night includes an amendment authored by Coleman, who is chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), and Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), the Committee's ranking member, that would increase penalties for the promotion of abusive tax shelters. This amendment is part of the Tax Haven Reform Act (S. 1565) sponsored by Senators Coleman and Levin and is based up PSI's hearings on controversial tax shelters sometimes promoted by major financial consulting firms that annually cost the U.S. Treasury $11-15 billion in lost revenue. 
   "As a result of the PSI hearings on abusive tax shelters, I vowed to work with Senator Levin on legislative solutions," Coleman said. "Today, I am pleased that both sides of the aisle were able to agree that harsher penalties for tax shelter promoters is such a solution. Our amendment's provisions to substantially increase penalties for the promoters who manufacture these sham transactions so that they must give back all of their ill-gotten gains is vital to restoring the integrity of our tax laws and deterring future tax avoidance. Equally, increasing the amount of penalties for aiders and abetters of tax shelters to include entities other than the tax return preparer will address the issue of accountants, lawyers, investment advisors, and bankers who collaborate and facilitate putting together abusive tax scams that rob the Treasury of billions of dollars in revenue." 
   The Levin-Coleman amendment increases the penalties for the promotion of abusive tax shelters from 50 percent of the promoters' gross income from the shelter to 100 percent and also increases the penalties for knowingly aiding and abetting an understatement of tax liability from 50 percent of the gross income from the prohibited activity to 100 percent of the gross income and expands the penalty to apply to all persons who aid and abet. Current law limits the aiding and abetting penalty to tax preparers.
