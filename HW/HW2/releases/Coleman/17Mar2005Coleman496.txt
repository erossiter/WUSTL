SENATE PASSES SENS. SMITH, COLEMAN AMENDMENT TO STOP MEDICAID CUTS
  Today a bipartisan amendment authored by Sens. Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Norm Coleman (R-MN), along with Sens.  
 Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Max Baucus (D-MT), to fully restore $15 billion in Medicaid funding, which was proposed to be cut in the original Senate Budget, passed the Senate by a vote of 52 - 48. This victory comes on the heels of successful efforts by the two senators to pare back the cuts from the original level of $60 billion proposed under the President's budget. The amendment offered by Sens. Smith and Coleman eliminates any cuts to the program in this year's Senate budget and will instead call for the creation of a bipartisan commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the Medicaid program to determine how to improve efficiencies in service delivery and quality of care. 
   "This is a significant victory for Minnesota healthcare," Coleman said. "This is a common sense, look before you leap amendment. Before jumping head long into cuts to Medicaid, it is reasonable to ask a bipartisan commission to fully examine Medicaid with an eye toward achieving efficiencies in a way that minimizes impact on the people who depend on this program for their access to health care. Today, a commission - not cuts - is in order." 
   The Medicaid Commission proposed by Smith and Coleman would be charged with a number of duties, including reviewing and making recommendations with respect to the long-term goals, populations served, financial sustainability, interaction with Medicare and safety-net providers, and the quality of care provided. The Commission would have one year to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public.
