SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS APPROVAL OF MULTI-STATE PURCHASING POOL FOR MEDICAID DRUG PROGRAM
  "I am pleased that Minnesota is going to join six other states in an effort to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for the state Medicaid program.  
 There's certainly strength in numbers. The multi-state purchasing pool brings the buying power of several state Medicaid programs to the table, and enables these states to pool their collective purchasing power to gain deeper discounts on prescription medications for their state programs. This ground-breaking approach to reducing the cost of prescription drugs will help Minnesota preserve essential pharmaceutical coverage for our most vulnerable residents and save taxpayers millions of dollars. I appreciate President Bush and Secretary Thompson's unyielding leadership on the important issue of making prescription drugs more affordable for the Minnesotans that need them."
