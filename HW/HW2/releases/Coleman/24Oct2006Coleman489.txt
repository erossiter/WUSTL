SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $2,813,000 LOAN FOR RENVILLE-SIBLEY COOPERATIVE POWER ASSOCIATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Renville-Sibley Cooperative Power Association, based in Danube, has been awarded a $2,813,000 loan from United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The 35-year loan will be used to build nine miles of new distribution line to serve area residents, while also making additional system improvements in the area.  
   "A strong infrastructure is the basis for growing our rural economy," said Coleman. "I have consistently sought to upgrade and expand our state's infrastructure as a way to encourage growth. Resources such as this loan from USDA Rural Development are key to that effort, and I applaud the awarding of this loan to Renville-Sibley Cooperative Power Association to help expand service to area residents." 
   Renville-Sibley Cooperative is based in Danube, Minnesota and delivers electric service to nearly 2,000 members and owners throughout Renville County, as well as portions of Sibley, Chippewa, Kandiyohi, Redwood, and Nicollet counties. 
   USDA Rural Development provides financial resources for rural development projects across the nation. In Minnesota, USDA Rural Development has invested a total of over $2.5 billion dollars for a variety of rural development projects since 2001.
