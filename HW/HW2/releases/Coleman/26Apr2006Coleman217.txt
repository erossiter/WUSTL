SEN. COLEMAN TO HOLD HEARING ON QUESTIONS SURROUNDING WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL INITIATIVE
  Citing concerns over the practicality of the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) for Minnesota's northern border communities, Sen. Norm Coleman will be holding a hearing on Thursday, April 27, to examine the status of WHTI implementation and the practicality of alternative documents for the passport requirement. In addition to receiving testimony from Departments of State and Homeland Security officials, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs will also hear from Brian Sage of the Northwest Angle and Islands Land Owners Association in Minnesota. Additional witnesses will represent the Buffalo-Niagara area in New York and the Bellingham, Washington area.  
   "I share the concerns of my constituents on Minnesota's northern border--the timetable for the proposed travel requirement is extremely ambitious," said Coleman. "Implementing this program without adequate study and reflection could create a mess at our borders and a hardship for our families. Putting this proposal into practice without fully testing its applicability would be irresponsible, and Thursday's hearing will provide us with an opportunity to step back and catch our breath before moving forward. In particular, I look forward to testimony about the development of new North American travel cards. These cards and other alternatives need to be practical and widely available before any WHTI deadline is imposed." 
   WHTI will require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to and from Canada, the Americas, and the Caribbean, to have a passport or other accepted document that establishes the bearer's identity and nationality to enter or re-enter the United States. This is a change from prior travel requirements. The proposed changes are currently scheduled to go into effect by December 31, 2007. 
   Recently, Coleman offered an amendment that would not allow the passport requirement to take effect until it could be certified that alternative border crossing documents have been distributed to people who want them, that the border patrol is ready to accept them, that sufficient public outreach has been done, and that a pilot program has been conducted to prove effectiveness. The amendment had been pending to the immigration reform bill, which is no longer currently before the Senate. 
   In addition to the certification requirements, the amendment would: 
   * Provide Congressional guidance for the implementation of the program, and mandate the development of a North American travel card 
   * Limit fees for the card to $20 and make it free for children under 16 
   * Require an aggressive public promotion campaign, including the establishment of at least 200 new passport acceptance facilities 
   * Require international coordination with Canada and Mexico 
   * Develop a process to handle situations in which people who don't have cards decide at the last minute they would like to visit Canada. 
   * Study the feasibility of using a drivers' license, under REAL ID, to be used for border crossings if people voluntarily elected to have their citizenship listed on it. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs, Coleman held a hearing on June 10, 2005 on the projected impact of the proposed WHTI travel requirement. Coleman also held listening sessions on August 6, 2005 in the border cities of Warroad, Baudette and International Falls to hear the concerns of local residents over the proposed rule. In February of 2006, Coleman asked Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Josh Bolten, to review the affordability, practicality, and overall cost to the economy of the proposed border crossing identity cards being phased in by 2008, and to consider a pilot program for residents of Angle Inlet, MN.
