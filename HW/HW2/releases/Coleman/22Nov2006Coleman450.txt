SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CELEBRATION OF THANKSGIVING
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN IN CELEBRATION OF THANKSGIVING: 
  Each year, we gather together with family and friends to give thanks for the blessings we all enjoy in this great country. This year, we have many reasons to give thanks. We live in a country of unprecedented prosperity and liberty - where the freedoms bestowed upon us by our Creator can be practiced freely and without oppression. 
   The history of our nation has been marked by both trial and triumph - even today - but at every step of the way the American spirit and dedication to freedom and democracy continues to shine on this country and her people. For this perseverance through both adversity and success, we should all be extremely grateful. 
   As a nation, we should pause to reflect on the sacrifices our men and women in uniform have made to protect these freedoms, and pray for their safe return home. My fellow Minnesotans, I wish all of you a Happy Thanksgiving and may God continue to bless our great nation.
