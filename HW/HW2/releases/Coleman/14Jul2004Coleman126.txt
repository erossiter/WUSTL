MINNESOTA ARMY CHAPLAIN INJURED IN IRAQ RECEIVES PURPLE HEART
  Champlain Major Fr. Tim Vakoc, the first documented U.S. Army chaplain seriously injured during Operation Iraqi Freedom, received the Purple Heart in his room at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., during a private ceremony limited to immediate family members, Army personnel, and Sen.  
 Coleman, who presented the medal to Fr. Vakoc.
   "It was a very moving ceremony," said Coleman. "Father Tim has been in and out of a coma for the past month. It really meant a lot to his family and to me when he opened his eyes and smiled in response to those around him, to our prayers and to the medal he had just been awarded. Words cannot do justice to what happened here today."
   Vakoc, from the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, was injured May 29, 2004, the twelfth anniversary of his ordination, when his humvee struck a roadside bomb as he was returning from presiding at a mass for soldiers out in the field. Due to the seriousness of Vakoc's injuries to his head and his unstable condition, Senator Coleman was able to expedite the granting of this prestigious award.
   "We'll continue to keep Father Vakoc and his family in our thoughts and prayers," said Coleman. "More than anything, we'd like to see him make a full and immediate recovery."
   Vakoc was transported to Walter Reed Army Medical Center on June 2, 2004, where he has been in and out of intensive care. In addition to support by his friends and family, his progress has been monitored by over 27,000 concerned friends, family and well-wishers on a Web site dedicated to following his progress.
