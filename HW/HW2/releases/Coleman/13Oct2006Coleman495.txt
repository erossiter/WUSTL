SEN. COLEMAN ATTENDS WHITE HOUSE PORT SECURITY BILL SIGNING
  Capping his recent work to bolster the security of America's seaports, Sen. Norm Coleman today attended the Presidential signing of the SAFE Port Act at the White House. With President Bush's signature, the bill becomes law and charges the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary with developing a strategy for bringing integrated radiological scanning capabilities to examine all containers entering the U.S. through the busiest 22 seaports. Additionally, DHS will be required to identify and address gaps in the international cargo supply chain. Coleman served as a conferee on the House-Senate Port Security Conference Committee.  
   "I was proud to work on this critical piece of legiislation and I was pleased to witness the President sign this bill into law," said Coleman. "Simply put, this is a comphrensive bill which will better prepare us to address the national security concerns of our ports, while striking the appropriate balance between security and commerce. It is important to also recoginize that while this bill is a huge step forward, we must continue to look for advanced programs and technology to close the gaps in our nation's homeland security." 
   The final bill contains a provision authored by Coleman which passed the Senate on a 95-3 vote, requiring a pilot project in three foreign seaports to test an integrated scanning system using non-intrusive inspection and radiation detection equipment. This system is designed to scan 100 percent of all the cargo containers transiting the port, strengthening port security by helping ensure nuclear materials are detected before they could enter the country. To help ensure the transition to full implementation, the Coleman amendment also instructs the Secretary of DHS to issue progress reports on the screening system every six months. 
   Other provisions in the SAFE Port Act: 
   * Provides Congressional authorization for the Container Security Initiative (CSI) program, empowering Customs and Border Protection to identify, examine or search maritime containers before U.S.-bound cargo is loaded in a foreign port as well as establish standards for the use of scanning and radiation detection equipment at CSI ports. 
   * Authorizes the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) and establishes certain minimum security and other requirements that applicants must meet to be eligible for C-TPAT benefits. 
   * Requires DHS to develop, implement, and update a strategic plan to improve the security of the international cargo supply chain. In particular the plan will identify and address gaps, provide improvements and goals, and establish protocols for the resumption of trade after a critical incident. 
   * Requires DHS to identify and request reliable and essential information about containers moving through the international supply chain. 
   * Requires DHS to promulgate a rule to establish minimum standards and procedures for securing containers in transit to the U.S.
