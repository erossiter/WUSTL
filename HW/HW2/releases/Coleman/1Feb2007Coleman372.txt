  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Wanamingo Fire Department has been awarded a $51,993 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The grant will be used to purchase new Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment for the department.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program has awarded this funding to the Wanamingo Fire Department upgrade their safety equipment," said Coleman. "Across Minnesota, firefighters are on the frontlines of public safety. Strengthening local departments is critical to safety of area residents, and this funding will go along toward increasing safety for the folks in and around Wanamingo." 
   "This grant will go a long way for our department," said Todd Kyllo of the Wanamingo Fire Department. "Thanks to this grant, our department will be able to purchase new SCBA equipment for our firefighters, which will help keep them safe when they're out in the field." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations.
