SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON DOJ PLEA AGREEMENT WITH SAMIR VINCENT
  Statement from Sen. Coleman regarding DOJ Plea Agreement with Samir Vincent 
   I am pleased to hear today that Attorney General Ashcroft has announced the plea agreement entered into between the Department of Justice and Samir Vincent on a four-count criminal information charging him with, among other offenses, acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the former government of Iraq. I applaud the efforts of Attorney General Ashcroft, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury. 
   Saddam Hussein used the Oil for Food Program to curry favor, bribe individuals and to do all he could to stay in power. The plea today demonstrates how this was done through the use of vouchers and manipulation of the Oil for Food program. This case underscores the severity of this scandal and the need for further aggressive and independent investigation into this matter.
