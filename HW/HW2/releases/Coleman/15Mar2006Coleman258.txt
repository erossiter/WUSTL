SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $125,000 FOR EVELETH, MINN. VETERAN'S PARK
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today the City of Eveleth will receive a $125,000 grant from the United States Department of the Interior's Land and Water Conservation Fund. This grant is part of a $250,000 project that will expand and renovate Veteran's Park to include new facilities and recreational projects to enhance the park.  
   "I am excited for the 'Hockey Capital of the United States' to receive this funding," said Coleman. "This grant is truly a win-win for residents of Eveleth. Not only will the upgrades allow more people to enjoy the resources the park has to offer, it will ultimately bring greater, much-deserved attention to the area's heroic veterans. I applaud the Department of Interior for recognizing the importance of this grant for the city." 
   "The City of Eveleth is very excited about receiving this grant for our Veteran's Park," said Eveleth Public Work Director Michael Wiskow. "We have worked several years to develop plans to enhance our park and now, because of this grant, we will see our plans realized. Project plans include construction of a shower/restroom building, expansion of our camping sites, new playground equipment, installation of a sanitary sewer line and underground electric service, and installation of a fishing pier." 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund issues matching funds to state and local governments to develop public outdoor recreation areas and facilities. It is designed to create and maintain a national program of recreation areas and facilities and to organize and promote non-federal investments in the maintenance of recreation resources across the United States. Through 2006, over 40,000 projects have been approved to support space for park lands or the development of outdoor recreation facilities.
