SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1.3 MILLION FOR TRI-COUNTY ELECTRIC CO-OP TO REBUILD FROM AUGUST FLOODING
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Tri-County Electric Cooperative, based in Rushford, Minnesota, has been selected to receive $1,330,965 in grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The funds are being awarded to help finance the rebuilding of the cooperative's headquarters following millions of dollars in damage from the August flooding in Southeast Minnesota.  
   "Tri-County Electric delivers needed electricity to thousands of residents in the area, and this funding will help them recover from the massive damage they suffered," Coleman said. "The August flooding in Southeast Minnesota had a devastating impact on so many folks in the area, from homeowners to businesses to entire communities. We've worked hard at the federal level to deliver assistance to those in need and this grant represents a continuation of that effort." 
   "We're very appreciative to receive the federal assistance and thank Senator Coleman for his help," said Brian Krambeer, President and CEO of Tri-County Electric Cooperative. "We had about $6 million in damage and these dollars are going to be used to rebuild the Tri-County Electric headquarters, including the office and the warehouse." 
   Heavy rains and overland flooding from the August storms inundated and saturated Tri-County's Electric's 8,998 square feet one-story brick building. Water levels reached 3.5 feet on the main floor, completely saturating the HVAC, drywall, electrical system, office furniture and cabinetry. The basement was fully flooded, saturating all cinder block walls, office furniture and the facility's main electrical components.
