SEN. COLEMAN: SENATE FAILS TO PROTECT MARRIAGE FROM ACTIVIST JUDGES
  Sen. Norm Coleman today expressed his disappointment that the Marriage Protection Amendment was prevented from being debated on the Senate floor. Coleman strongly believes that the institution of marriage is intended to be between one man and one woman, and in turn, cast his vote in favor of moving the bill forward in the legislative process to ensure the institution of marriage is protected from activist judges who seek a redefinition. The measure failed by a vote of 49 to 48.  
   "Today we had the opportunity to protect states from activist judges who take it upon themselves to legislate from the bench, and unfortunately the process was not allowed to move forward," said Coleman. "This amendment would have put this issue back in the hands of the voters of each state." 
   The Marriage Protection Amendment resolution would state that marriage shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman, and would clarify that courts cannot require states to define marriage otherwise.
