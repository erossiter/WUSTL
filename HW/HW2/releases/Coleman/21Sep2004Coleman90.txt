SENS. COLEMAN-KOHL BILL TO EXTEND SAFETY NET FOR DAIRY FARM FAMILIES INCLUDED IN APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that his and Sen.  
 Herb Kohl's (D-WI) legislation to extend through 2007 the Milk Income Loss Compensation (MILC) Program for U.S. dairy farm families was included in the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2005. Without the Coleman-Kohl legislation, the MILC program would expire next year leaving Minnesota dairy farm families without a safety net. 
   "I am very pleased that my legislation to extend this critically important safety net for Minnesota dairy farm families was approved by the Appropriations Committee today," said Coleman. 
   "In an election year where no one seems to be willing to agree on anything, it is amazing that we were able to find consensus on dairy legislation of all things," added Coleman. "This legislation, which I introduced along with Senator Kohl, a Democrat of Wisconsin, has the backing of both Democrats and Republicans from the Northeast and the Midwest." 
   To date, the MILC program has provided Minnesota dairy farm families with over $163 million of support when prices collapsed to record levels before rebounding this year, making Minnesota the 4th largest beneficiary of this important program.
