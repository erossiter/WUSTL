SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION
  "This evening, the President laid out a series of challenges for Congress - a challenge to respond to the slowdown in our economy, address wasteful spending by ensuring transparency in the earmark process, reform our healthcare system, and end our dependence on foreign oil. 
   With jobs harder to come by, mortgage payments and healthcare costs soaring, home values falling and gas prices running high, I strongly support the President's call to quickly pass an economic stimulus package to restore public confidence in the economy.
   Sunlight is the best disinfectant, so in order to protect the American taxpayer' dollars I appreciate the President's call to ensure greater transparency into the earmark process. So too must we work to ensure every American has access to an affordable health insurance plan, so that no one has to worry about losing health insurance just because they get sick or lost their job.
   Our troops have bravely served this nation and they continue to do all that we ask of them. During their absence, it is our responsibility to ensure their families are provided for. I have heard directly from spouses of our soldiers regarding the difficulties of making ends meet, and I support the President's call to help our nation's veterans and their families through improved health services, childcare, hiring preferences, and education benefits. I am also encouraged by the security gains our troops have made in Iraq, which are laying the groundwork for Iraqis to step into the leadership role.
   As a nation, the challenges we face are many and significant. Yet despite these challenges, I am confident that by putting our differences aside and working together in a bipartisan fashion - above the partisan divide - much can be accomplished to secure a brighter future for all Minnesotans and Americans alike."
