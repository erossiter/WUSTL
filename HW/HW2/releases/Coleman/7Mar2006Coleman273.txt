SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON KIRBY PUCKETT
  "My family and I were saddened to learn that Kirby Puckett has suddenly and tragically passed away. Kirby was a joy to know, to watch, and to admire for his attitude and accomplishments on the field and his contributions in the community. Number 34 was the inspiration not only for the Twins teams that brought two world series championships to Minnesota but also to countless kids in ballparks across the country. Kirby Puckett was an all-star and Hall of Famer both on and off the baseball field, achieving the pinnacle of his profession after lifting himself out of the projects of Chicago with an unbridled enthusiasm for life and the game. Kirby's entire career was spent with the Minnesota Twins-his talent and his memory will always be in the hearts of his fans. I want to extend our deepest sympathy to the Puckett family."
