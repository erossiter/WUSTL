SEN. COLEMAN: SECURE FENCE ACT IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN SECURING BORDERS
  Citing the need to enhance the security our nation's borders, Sen. Norm Coleman today joined his Senate colleagues in voting to approve the Secure Fence Act by a vote of 80 to 19. The legislation calls for the construction of double-layered fences along 700 miles of the southern border and will also deploy cameras, ground sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor the border.  
   "As it stands, our borders lay vulnerable to not only an influx of illegal immigrants, but also the transportation of dangerous materials," said Coleman. "Without question, it is extremely important that we begin working toward strengthening our nation's borders, and this legislation provides immediate concrete steps toward enhancing our overall border security. I am confident that with passage of this bill we are on the road to a safer, more secure America." 
   "This bill also takes the right approach in terms of northern border security," added Coleman. "This legislation should not be used to justify construction of a wall along the northern border, but to take an inventory of the systems that are working and not working and ensure that we put in place the most effective approach." 
   Provisions of the Secure Fence Act will: 
   * Direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate actions within 18 months of enactment of the bill to achieve operational control over U.S. international land and maritime borders through additional physical barriers and fencing as well as greater use of state-of-the-art technology and surveillance along the southwest border; 
   * Authorize more than 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border with prioritized placement at critical, highly populated areas; 
   * Require DHS to assess vulnerabilities on the northern border; 
   * Mandate that the Department of Homeland Security achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a "virtual fence" that deploys cameras, ground sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and integrated surveillance techonology; 
   * Require DHS to provide all necessary authority to border personnel to disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority held by the United States Coast Guard for maritime vessels; 
   * Require the Secretary of DHS to report annually to Congress on border control progress. 
   While supporting action to secure the southern border, Coleman also stressed the need for Congress to complete action on comprehensive immigration reform to address the more than 11 million legal immigrants in reside in America today.
