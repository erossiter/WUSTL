SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT:  
   I am outraged that agriculture disaster assistance was not included in the Emergency Supplemental bill. Reluctantly, I voted for this legislation only because of my unwavering support for America's troops. 
   As a Senator from Minnesota, I recognize the impact that natural disasters have had on our farms. I recently had the opportunity to visit Lake Bronson, MN where local farmers turned out in full force to express their need for critical assistance, having experienced a flood that devastated crops across the region. I find it incomprehensible, if not irresponsible, to omit assistance for such a vital part of our economy. At its core, this is an issue about equity for all regions that are suffering. And to the thousands of Minnesotans whose very livelihood has been jeopardized and those losing their farms due to last year's disastrous weather, this bill is a cruel slap in the face. 
   Minnesota's agricultural community should know that they have my full support. Until Congress makes the necessary and responsible decision to provide assistance, I will to use every legislative opportunity on the Senate Floor to move agriculture disaster assistance forward. Without question, I am committed to meeting the needs of Minnesota's farm families.
