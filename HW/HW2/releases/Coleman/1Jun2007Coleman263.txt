SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1.3 MILLION GRANT FOR UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA AG RESEARCH
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the University of Minnesota has been selected to receive a $1.3 million research grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program. The grant will help fund the University's Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project, which aims to improve barley crops through genetic research.  
   "The relationship between farm researchers and farmers in the field is essential for the improvement of our crops and farming economy," Coleman said. "As farmers continue feeding the world and grow in fueling the nation, higher yields and stronger crops will only grow in importance. The University of Minnesota has a strong history of agriculture research and this grant will allow them to continue their work to strengthen and improve the important crop of barley." 
   The University of Minnesota leads a conglomerate of 30 scientists at 18 different institutions in a program that works to identify genes that produce higher yielding and higher quality, disease-resistant barley. 
   The project is being used as a model for researchers of many different plant species, and growers are pushing researchers to extend the information they gather to the areas of the country where barley is grown, according to Gary J. Muehlbauer, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and project director. 
   "The grant has allowed us to bring these researchers together," Muehlbauer said. 
   This is the second USDA grant for the four-year, $5 million project.
