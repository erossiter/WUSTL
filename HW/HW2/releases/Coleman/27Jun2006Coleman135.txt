SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CONSTITUTIONAL FLAG BURNING AMENDMENT
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL FLAG BURNING AMENDMENT:   
   I am disappointed with today's vote as it will prevent the American people from protecting the American flag from physical desecration. As a sacred symbol of freedom and democracy, that our brave men and women in uniform have fought and died to defend, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution would ensure that no harm could be brought to its enduring spirit without legal recourse. As a symbol of our highest national ideals and dreams, the flag deserves our greatest level of respect and the maximum level of legal protection.
