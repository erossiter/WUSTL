SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $296,168 FOR NATIONAL CHILD PROTECTION TRAINING CENTER AT WINONA STATE
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the National Child Protection Training Center (NCPTC) at Winona State University has been awarded a $296,168 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. The grant will support continued operation of the center and represents the fourth allocation of federal money it has received. Coleman has helped secured over $1 million for the NCPTC since 2004.  
   "I am very pleased the NCPTC has received this grant and applaud the Department of Justice for recognizing the value of such a remarkable organization," said Coleman. "The work folks at the NCPTC do in the fight to eliminate child abuse is absolutely crucial, and this money will ensure they have the best resources and training possible. My office has had a long and successful relationship with the NCPTC and I look forward to working with them in the future. Together, I believe we can continue to make a difference in the lives of children who need it the most." 
   Specifically, the most recent grant will fund: 
   * The development and implementation of a model college curriculum to train professional personnel for the child protection field; 
   * The maintenance of a training, technical assistance, and resource center for attorneys, social workers, and others who handle the civil side of child protection cases; and 
   * The National Center for the Prosecution of Child Abuse (NCPCA)'s "Half a Nation" program, which is designed to train State forensic interviewing personnel. 
   The NCPTC's purpose is to improve the education of mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect and to upgrade the performance of professionals in the child protection field. The NCPTC is the nation's premier trainer of child abuse investigators and prosecutors and is a partner of Winona State University.
