SEN. COLEMAN FIGHTS TO KEEP DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR MINNESOTA FARMERS IN SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today urged his Senate colleagues to support a provision in the 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill, which would provide $4.2 billion in agriculture disaster assistance. Sen. Coleman has a long history fighting for the agriculture disaster aid for Minnesota. Over the last year, Coleman has made numerous attempts to move agriculture disaster assistance - petitioning his colleagues on the Senate Floor and Congressional leadership in letters. Earlier this year, Coleman coauthored an agriculture disaster assistance bill with Sen. Conrad, and he is eager to push this aid over the finish line.  
   "Our farm families have waited too long. We need to bring this assistance home now to help the thousands of farmers who are struggling to figure out how to make ends meet after several years of disastrous environmental conditions that have devastated crops," said Coleman. "I find it incomprehensible-if not irresponsible-to provide weather-related disaster assistance for one region of the country, while continuously withholding it from another. At its core, this is an issue about equity for all regions that are suffering. It is high time we send aid to Minnesota's farmers inside of giving them the cold shoulder. I will take every opportunity to make certain that this agriculture disaster assistance language is included in the final version of the supplemental bill."
