  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that scenic byways in southern Minnesota have received a combined $61,600 in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways Program. Specifically, the grants will be aimed at improving and expanding use of many of Minnesota's scenic byways and implementing corridor management along specific routes in the region.  
   "I am pleased the resources of the Scenic Byways program will benefit these projects," said Coleman. "In southern Minnesota, the outdoors are a benefit for both tourists and local residents alike. The various improvements for these projects will allow more people to enjoy the area and bring greater attention to the resources the region has to offer. I applaud the Federal Highway Administration for recognizing the importance of these grants in Minnesota." 
   Specific funding for the individual projects is as follows: 
   * $11,600 for interpretive information signs at the Prairie Woods Environmental Learning Center near Lake Florida. 
   * $25,000 for the implementation of the Minnesota River Valley Corridor Management Plan used to plan activities, goals, and strategies for the local communities along SR 7 from Browns Valley to Belle Plaine. 
   * $25,000 for the implementation of the Historic Bluff Country Corridor Management Plan used to plan activities, goals, and strategies for the local communities along SR 16 from Dexter to Le Crescent.
