SEN. COLEMAN INCLUDES KEY FUNDING FOR RETURNING TROOPS, HEALTH SERVICES IN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced he successfully included several important Minnesota programs in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill, including a reemployment program for Minnesota troops and a number of critical health programs. The bill passed the House last night and is expected to be taken up in the Senate today before being sent to the President.
   Specifically, the bill allocates $1,099,452 for a Minnesota State Colleges and Universities program to provide rapid reemployment and education services for returning veterans. The project will help returning troops secure civilian reemployment, with special attention given to younger veterans and those who are medically discharged or disabled. The project will involve Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, and Veterans Affairs representatives and counselors to coordinate closely and serve veterans interested in pursuing education, including programs customized for veterans' needs. 
   "Following long deployments, troops frequently face unexpected obstacles when settling back into life at home," said Coleman. "Many troops put their education on hold while overseas and it is essential they have access to quality education and employment programs upon their return home. The funding included in this bill will provide the necessary support for these heroes to resume their studies and enter the workforce. We must do all we can to support our troops before, during, and after their deployments and I commend my colleagues for including this important provision."
   Coleman also secured $242,684 for the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth. These funds will be used to implement a demonstration project to improve healthcare quality and reduce costs by working to facilitate the transition to health information technologies within rural hospitals and other healthcare organizations. Additionally, the College of St. Scholastica will provide on-site process consultation; develop demonstration capabilities for staff orientation and training; offer workshops promoting leadership and multidisciplinary collaboration; and provide technical assistance in planning, designing, and implementing Electronic Health Records and Personal Health Records that meet the needs of the population.
   "I have always said that the quality of your healthcare should not depend on your zip code," said Coleman. "One key component to ensuring our rural communities are successful is by ensuring their access to affordable, quality healthcare. Often times, rural areas face many challenges when keeping up with the latest technologies and practices and providing the College of St. Scholastica with the funding they need to upgrade their facilities will play a large role in relieving this discrepancy."
   Senator Coleman worked hard to secure $240,719 for Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota to provide pediatric palliative care education and consultation services to clinicians and providers. Palliative care is compassionate care for individuals with life limiting terminal illnesses, focusing on lessening the physical, psychosocial, and emotional suffering often endured in terminal cases. Recognized as the nation's leader in palliative care education, Children's Institute for Palliative Care develops and leads training seminars using recognized curriculum for pediatric palliative care, provides hospital-based consultation to children who are in need of hospice or palliative care while they are hospitalized, offers an around-the-clock telephone consultation program, and serves as a resource center for pediatric palliative care.
   Coleman was also successful in securing $283,951 for the University of Minnesota to construct laboratory facilities for expanded facilities for muscular dystrophy research on the Twin Cities campus.
