SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $16,562 FOR CROOKSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Crookston Police Department has been awarded a $16,562 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program. The funding will be used to continue the G.R.E.A.T. program, which focuses on preventing juvenile delinquency and youth violence, in Crookston's public school system.  
   "Delinquency and youth violence are problems that need to be addressed early in our children's lives," said Coleman. "The G.R.E.A.T. program has proven successful across the country, and I'm pleased kids in and around Crookston will benefit from this award. The Crookston Police Department, Crookston school system and the entire community should be proud of this effort, and I applaud their commitment to fighting violence beginning with their schools." 
   "The G.R.E.A.T. program has proven to be a wonderful program for us," said Crookston Police Chief Tim Motherway. "This program teaches kids to make decisions and it's fair to say there's been some correlation between this program and less problems with gangs and violence in the community. This grant will help us pay the officer that is conducting the training, as well as the materials so we can continue the success of this program." 
   Specifically, the Crookston Police Department is proposing to teach the program to a total of over 350 students ranging from fourth to sixth graders over the course of the grand period. 
   Since its inception in 1991, over 8,000 law enforcement officers have been certified as G.R.E.A.T. instructors and more than four million students have graduated from the program across the country. For more information on the G.R.E.A.T. program, please visit http://www.great-online.org.
