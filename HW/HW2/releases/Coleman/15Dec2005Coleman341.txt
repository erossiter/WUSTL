SEN. COLEMAN JOINS SENATE IN HONORING SEN. PROXMIER
  Sen. Norm Coleman joined his colleagues in the Senate to pass a resolution that honored the life and work of former Wisconsin Sen.  
 William Proxmier. Proxmier, age 90, died today after a ten year battle with Alzheimer's Disease. The former senator was first elected to the Senate from Wisconsin in 1957, filling the remainder of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's term and served until he left the Senate in 1989. In total, Proxmier was elected five times, and leaves behind a strong legacy of battling government waste, best illustrated through the establishment of his "Golden Fleece' award that highlighted reckless government spending. 
   "Sen. Proxmier leaves behind a great legacy of fighting for what he believed in," said Coleman. "As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I greatly appreciate Sen. Proxmier's tireless pursuit of justice for the American people as he rooted out waste, fraud, and abuse wherever he found it. He entered the Senate at a time when Americans were concerned and anxious about our government, but by challenging opposition and resolving to do what was right, he earned our country's respect. Sen. Proxmier leaves behind a legacy of a truly great and noble statesman." 
   In addition to fighting government waste, Proxmier tirelessly worked to pass an anti-genocide treaty in the U.S. Senate, delivering thousands of speeches. The anti-genocide treaty passed in 1986.
