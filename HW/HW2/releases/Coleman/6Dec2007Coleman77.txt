SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF
  "At a time when hard working Minnesotans are struggling with mortgages payments, higher gas prices and rising health care costs, the very last thing we should do is hit middle class Minnesotans with a huge tax bill. It is vital that we act immediately to provide Alternative Minimum Tax relief so that hard working middle class Minnesota families are not hit with a nightmarish tax increase that was never intended for them. I will continue to push for a bill to provide AMT relief this tax year without penalizing other taxpayers with permanent tax increases. It is my hope that Senate leadership will stop playing politics with average Minnesotans' pocketbooks and pass AMT relief in the coming days."
