SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF DR. BEN BERNANKE TO BE CHAIRMAN OF FEDERAL RESERVE
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman:
   I am pleased President Bush announced Dr.  
 Ben Bernanke as his nominee to succeed Alan Greenspan to be the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Currently serving as Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Bernanke brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience. As a member of the Federal Reserve Board from 2002 - 2005, Dr. Bernanke has been in a position to make some of our nation's most important economic decisions; decisions that have great influence over U.S. and world economic growth. In his new role as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he will have an even more influential impact on our economy and its prosperity. I look forward to Dr. Benanke's appearance before the Senate and the American people, to hear his ideas and philosophy on how to best move America's economy forward.
