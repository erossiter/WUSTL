SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPPLEMENTAL BILL VETO
  Statement On the Supplemental Bill Veto: 
   With today's veto of the supplemental funding bill, we will have another opportunity to send a bill to the President's desk that will provide our troops with the funding they desperately need. While I agree we need to continue pressuring the Iraqi government to take over more responsibility of Iraq's security, I am opposed to arbitrary deadlines for surrender. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will stop playing politics with our troops' resources and work together to pass a bill that does not condition critical funding for our forces on a timeline for withdrawal.
