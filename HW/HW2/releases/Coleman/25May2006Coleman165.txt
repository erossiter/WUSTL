SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $300,000 FOR DODGE CENTER AIRPORT IMPROVEMENTS
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today the City of Dodge Center has received a $300,000 grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of their Airport Improvement Program. Specifically, the grant will be aimed at improving and expanding the local airport by constructing a taxiway to connect to the hanger area.  
   "In Greater Minnesota, local airports are an important part of accessibility and opportunity for local communities," said Coleman. "This project is important for Dodge Center, as its local airport will be able to better provide for area businesses and residents. I applaud the FAA for recognizing the importance of these grants for Minnesota's local airports." 
   The Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
