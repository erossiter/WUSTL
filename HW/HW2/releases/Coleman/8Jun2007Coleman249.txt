SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN DULUTH, INTERNATIONAL FALLS AND TOWER
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that three airports in northeast Minnesota have been selected to receive federal funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Specifically, grants were awarded to local airports in Duluth, International Falls and Tower to implement various improvements.  
   "Local airports are an important part of our state's transportation infrastructure and a source of economic opportunity for rural areas," said Coleman. "During my many travels around the state, I often hear about the importance of local airports, as well as a common need to improve and expand them for future use. These grants will help ensure the viability of these airports and I applaud the FAA for awarding them." 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   * $1,058,300 for Duluth International for a passenger board bridge for the passenger terminal building and the rehabilitation and expansion of the general aviation parking apron. 
   * $300,000 for Falls International to improve the runway safety area 
   * $242,250 for Tower Municipal to remove obstructions, acquire snow removal equipment and update the airport master plan study. 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
