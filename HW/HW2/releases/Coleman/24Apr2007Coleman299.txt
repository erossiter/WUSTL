SEN. COLEMAN LISTENS TO DAIRY INDUSTRY GROUPS AT AGRICULTURE HEARING ON DAIRY PROGRAMS IN FARM BILL
  In an effort to ensure the vitality of Minnesota's dairy industry, Sen. Norm Coleman today questioned witnesses representing various dairy producer and processor groups on their recommendations for the 2007 farm bill at a Senate Agriculture hearing on specialty crops, dairy, and organic production. During the hearing, Coleman emphasized the need for dairy groups to work together to strengthen the safety-net for America's dairy industry and asked the panelists where common ground can be found.  
   "Minnesota's dairy industry has a $3 billion economic impact in the state, and I believe the upcoming farm bill is an important opportunity to provide the industry with the tools it needs to succeed in a changing marketplace, to ensure future prosperity," said Coleman. "The nation's dairy groups have put a lot of thought into their recommendations for the 2007 farm bill, and I believe these ideas will help the Senate Agriculture Committee improve the nation's dairy policy." 
   Witnesses for the dairy industry included Jerry Kozak, National Milk Producers Federation; Clint Fall, Midwest Dairy Coalition; and Connie Tipton, International Dairy Foods Association. 
   "This farm bill will provide dairy producers and processors the opportunity to collaborate on some critical reforms to our current dairy policy. For instance, several of the witnesses offered support for modernizing the Price Support Program and Forward Contracting. One thing is certain, I'll continue to work hard for policies that strengthen the safety-net for Minnesota's dairy producers," Coleman added.
