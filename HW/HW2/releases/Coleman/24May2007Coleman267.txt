SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPPLEMENTAL BILL FINAL PASSAGE
  For far too long, we have allowed politics to get in the way of providing our troops with the resources they need. Congress has finally taken the responsible action of passing a supplemental without conditioning funding for our troops on arbitrary withdrawal timelines. In addition to funding our soldiers on the ground, today's supplemental holds the Iraqi government accountable for meeting concrete benchmarks for success, a strategy I strongly support. Our soldiers cannot remain in the crosshairs of sectarian violence if the Iraqi government does not show the will to establish peace.
