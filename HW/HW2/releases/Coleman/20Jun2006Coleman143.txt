SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $5 MILLION FOR BEMIDJI REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Bemidji Regional Airport has been awarded a $5 million grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. The grant will be used to make a number of improvements to an airport runway and provide reimbursement for previous land acquisitions.  
   "I am thrilled to announce that Bemidji Regional Airport will receive this grant," said Coleman. "Regional airports are an important asset to communities in Greater Minnesota, providing local residents with greater opportunities for access and overall economic development transportation service. I am pleased that Bemidji has received this funding, and I commend the FAA for awarding this grant in Bemidji." 
   "It is a significant commitment on the part of the community and the FAA to invest in this airport," said Airport Manager Harold Van Leeuwen, Jr., adding that the grant will help "meet the future growth requirements of this community." Leeuwen also said the grant will enhance the capability of the airfield to serve commercial carriers and enable the airport to provide nearly uninterrupted service by adding a second precision runway. 
   Specifically, the FAA funding is being awarded as part of a multi-year grant to acquire land for runway approaches, improve the runway safety area, and rehabilitate the runway. These funds will ensure the airport meets runway safety area standards, increase the life of the runway pavement, and reimburse the airport for land previously purchased for approach protection. 
   Bemidji Regional Airport is the fourth largest airport in the state, serving 30,000 passengers annually. In addition to its commercial services, the airport is home to Minnesota Department of Natural Resources/Bureau of Indian Affairs fire tanker bombers, which are based there during forest fire season.
