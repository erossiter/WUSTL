SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOUSE'S VOTE TO BLOCK MEDICAID CUTS
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement on the House of Representative's vote to block rules that would have made devastating cuts to Minnesota's case management program: 
   "As the glue that holds Minnesota's Medicaid program together, I have been fighting long and hard to preserve case management services for our most vulnerable populations. I am pleased the House overwhelmingly passed legislation today to delay rules that would jeopardize these critical services. This is vital for Minnesota's most at-risk populations and with $210 million in Medicaid funding at stake, I will continue to actively push my colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation as soon as possible."
