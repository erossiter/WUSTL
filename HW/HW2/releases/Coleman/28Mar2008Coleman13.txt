SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $684,000 TO CITY OF MANCHESTER FOR NEW WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Norm Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program has awarded a $684,000 financing package to the city of Manchester to build a new wastewater collection system.  
   "Small towns across Minnesota are well aware of the financial challenges of paying for needed wastewater treatment upgrades," Coleman said. "I have heard time and time again about the difficulty this poses for our rural communities, and have fought long and hard for increased infrastructure investment to help ease this burden. USDA Rural Development has been a leader in helping communities meet this challenge and I applaud them for awarding this financing for the folks in Manchester." 
   The financing comes in the form of a $635,000 grant and a $49,000 low-interest loan to the city. In addition to wastewater infrastructure improvements, Rural Development also has financing available for housing, health care facilities, emergency response, job creation, economic development, high-speed Internet and childcare. 
   Since 2001, Rural Development has invested nearly $4 billion throughout rural Minnesota. For more information, visit www.rurdev.usda.gov/mn.
