SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES NUMBERS SHOWING LOWER COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR SENIORS
  Recognizing the need to provide low cost prescription drugs to seniors, Senator Norm Coleman applauded the recent announcement by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) showing that the average cost of the Medicare prescription drug plan will remain stable or decline in 2007, while average premiums will stay at $24 or less. CMS Administrator Mark McClellan indicated that the lower prices are a direct result of a more competitive bidding process and beneficiaries increasingly choosing the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which offers lower cost options.  
   "Providing low cost prescription drug coverage for seniors has been one of my top priorities in the Senate, and I am pleased that seniors are already reaping the benefits of the Medicare Part D program," said Coleman. "The outlook for prescription drug prices will only get better from here. As more seniors elect to participate in Part D, increased competition by health plans will result in even more savings for seniors and taxpayers." 
   An estimated 702,000 Minnesotans are eligible for the Medicare Part D program, and at least 547,000 Minnesotans are now being covered by the program. Nationally, 42 million seniors and people with disabilities are eligible. More than 25 million Medicare beneficiaries now have prescription drug coverage. 
   "As we move forward, I will continue to fight for affordable healthcare options for all seniors," Coleman added.
