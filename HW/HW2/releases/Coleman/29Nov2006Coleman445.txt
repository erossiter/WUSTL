SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $106,292 FOR CLEARWATER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the Clearwater Fire Department received $106,292 in funding as part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG), which is a program designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of the fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The grant will be used for operation and safety measures.  
   "I am pleased that the AFG was able to provide additional funding for the Clearwater Fire Department to improve their emergency capabilities," said Coleman. "Firefighters are on the frontlines of Minnesota's public safety. Improving community units through increased funding is necessary to the safety of our state's citizens and this funding will better prepare our state's fire departments." 
   In addition to the funding awarded to Clearwater Fire Department, AFG also awarded $67,481 to Clara City Volunteer Fire Department for operations and safety improvement measures.
