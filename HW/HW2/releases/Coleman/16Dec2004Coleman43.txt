SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON KOFI ANNAN VISIT TO WASHINGTON
  "I join the Administration in welcoming the United Nations' promise of assistance in returning control of Iraq over to its rightful source of sovereignty, the Iraqi people.  
 The United Nations has been asked to assist the Iraqi people in holding their first free and fair democratic election and its certainly good news that the U.N. has recognized the need for it to step up its involvement in this historic process. 
   While clearly the United Nations' decision to recognize its responsibility in Iraq is positive news, I continue to believe that the Secretary General should be held accountable for the fraud and waste that has been established to have occurred on his watch. It is my personal and steadfast belief that Mr. Annan should step down in order to protect the long-term integrity and credibility of the United Nations. My investigation at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into the serious corruption at the UN's Oil for Food program will continue."
