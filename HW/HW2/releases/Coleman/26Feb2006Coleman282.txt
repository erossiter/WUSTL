  Statement Of Sen. Norm Coleman: 
  "I welcome the statement of DP World today and urge the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS) to immediately commence a 45-day investigation. The findings from this review I hope will provide Congress with the requisite information to make an informed decision regarding the national security implications of a Dubai backed company owning and operating terminals at six U.
