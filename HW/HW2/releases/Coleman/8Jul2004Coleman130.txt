SENS. DAYTON, COLEMAN REQUEST $250,000 FOR MINNESOTA SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE HMONG STUDENTS
  Sens. Mark Dayton and Norm Coleman today sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee requesting an additional $250,000 for four Minnesota school districts that will be seriously impacted by the resettlement of Hmong refugee students arriving from Thailand.  
 The funds would be used to purchase an interactive educational technology program for classroom use, which gives guidance to Hmong students in their native language and helps them become rapidly proficient in English.
   "Minnesota communities will need help educating Hmong refugee students arriving in the coming school year," said Dayton. "Securing federal funding will be vital for helping these children grow into productive citizens of their new country."
   "When the children of Hmong refugees arrive in Minnesota, we must make sure they have access to a quality education," said Coleman. "Education is the foundation upon which the promise of equal opportunity rests and is the key to achieving the American dream."
   Dayton and Coleman requested a total of $250,000 for the school districts, including $100,000 for St. Paul, $75,000 for Minneapolis, $37,500 for North St. Paul, and $37,500 for Roseville.
   Fifteen-thousand Hmong refugees are expected to arrive from Thailand in the U.S. this month and into next year. Initial surveys indicate that nearly 63 percent of the Hmong scheduled to arrive in the U.S. are of school age. Based on preliminary estimates, Minnesota could receive as many as 5,000 or more Hmong refugees.
