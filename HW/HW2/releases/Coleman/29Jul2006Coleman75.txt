SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PENSION REFORM BILL
  STATEMENT FROM SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON PENSION REFORM BILL 
   With the inclusion of the airline provisions in the Pension Reform Bill passed by the House last night, we are one step closer to ensuring airline employees receive their promised pension benefits while strengthening the overall pension system and protecting taxpayers. There are 22,000 Northwest Airline retirees who call Minnesota home, making this issue a particularly personal one for me. This is not a subsidy or bail-out but, rather an opportunity for airlines and other companies to deliver the benefits their employees have earned without shifting those obligations to the taxpayers. I am continuing to monitor the developments of this process and urge my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation when it hits the Senate floor next week.
