PRESIDENT'S BUDGET INCLUDES $71.2 MILLION FOR NORTHSTAR COMMUTER RAIL
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that $71.166 million for the Northstar Commuter Rail Line has been included in the President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2009. This funding brings the total federal investment in Northstar to $156.81 million, completing the federal investment in the project. Coleman secured $53.9 million for the project last year, along with $31.7 million in years prior to that. 
   "When completed, Northstar will ease congestion, create jobs and decrease our dependence on foreign oil," said Coleman. "This critical transportation project has been a longtime dream for the people of Minnesota and this funding brings it one step closer to becoming reality. I thank the Department of Transportation on behalf of the people of Minnesota for recognizing the need to get these dollars on the ground sooner rather than later, and I look forward to witnessing the positive effects this project will have on our state for years to come."
   The Northstar rail line is a $320 million project that will run from downtown Minneapolis up through the northwest suburbs to Big Lake. The 40-mile, six station commuter rail line system will serve Hennepin, Anoka and Sherburne Counties and has the capacity to carry 10,000 passengers a day. In addition, it provides a four block extension of the successful Hiawatha LRT, which will connect LRT to Northstar commuter rail at the downtown Minneapolis multi-modal station. This extension will provide for the seamless integration of the two rail projects serving the region.
