SEN. COLEMAN STAFF TO VISIT NINE COMMUNITIES DURING 3-DAY TRIP THROUGH NORTHERN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Bill Huepenbecker, Coleman's State Director, along with regional representatives Melissa Roberts and Carl Kuhl, will be visiting the cities of Duluth, Grand Rapids, Hibbing, Ely, Tower, Nett Lake, Bigfork, Cass Lake and Bemidji during a three-day visit to Northern Minnesota scheduled for Tuesday, June 13th through Thursday, June 15th. The trip will include meetings with local businesses, officials and residents to discuss a number of area projects and concerns. 
   "It will be very valuable to have Bill, Melissa and Carl out in these communities over the next few days," said Coleman. "I am continuing to actively work at extending my outreach even further across Minnesota, and with our office in Grand Rapids now up and running, this trip will only help advance that effort. My recent visit to the region this past weekend was extremely beneficial to me, and I'm excited to have my staff meeting with folks out in the area this week as well."  
   On April 18th, Coleman opened his third Minnesota office in Grand Rapids to foster increased outreach with constituents in northern Minnesota. Additionally, Coleman recently visited the cities of Moose Lake, Duluth, Two Harbors, Grand Marais, Aitkin, Grand Rapids and Walker during a two-day visit on June 9th and 10th. 
   "Senator Coleman has been actively working to stay connected with people across the state and this week's meeting will be a great way for us to continue that effort in Northern Minnesota," said Huepenbecker. "Additionally, this will be a great chance to introduce Melissa, who is running the Senator's Grand Rapids office and will be working closely with many people in the area." 
   "The Senator's office in Grand Rapids is already serving as a great resource for the northern part of the state, and I'm excited to get out and meet with more local residents to find out how we can best work with them going forward," said Roberts. 
   "I love getting up into this part of the state and am looking forward to continuing the dialogue we have with folks about a number of important issues," added Kuhl.
