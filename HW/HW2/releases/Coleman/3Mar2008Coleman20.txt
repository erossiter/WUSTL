SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. VOTE TO SANCTION IRAN FOR THIRD TIME
  "As long as Iran continues its uranium enrichment program, it will continue to advance towards acquiring a nuclear weapon, and therefore increasingly threatens the stability of the Middle East and the rest of the world. I support the decision of the UN Security Council to pass another resolution against Iran, demonstrating that our international partners agree that the Iranian nuclear program is a threat to international peace and security. In fact, this resolution grew out of a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency that indicated Iran has been working on a nuclear weapons design as recently as four years ago - refuting those who have downplayed the Iranian threat because of the recent National Intelligence Estimate. Iran is now in violation of three UN Security Council resolutions that have required it to end its uranium enrichment activities, yet it continues to press forward. If the Iranian government does not respond to this latest action by the Security Council, stronger measures should be invoked to halt the Iranian nuclear program before it obtains a bomb."
