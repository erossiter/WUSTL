SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $5,700 FOR GREANEY RAUCH SILVERDALE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Greaney Rauch Silverdale Volunteer Fire Department has received a $5,700 grant through the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program. The grant will be used to train and certify 10 new firefighters.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grants program has selected the Greaney Rauch Silverdale Volunteer Fire Department for this funding," said Coleman. "Volunteer firefighters across Minnesota are on the frontlines of public safety and it is imperative they have the strongest emergency capabilities possible. This grant will benefit the local fire department, and in turn, ultimately benefit local citizens as well." 
   "As a rural community, we are very grateful for this grant," said James Kochevar of the Greaney Rauch Silverdale Volunteer Fire Department. "It's nice to be remembered and it's important to not forget that rural communities face some of the same problems as large cities." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
