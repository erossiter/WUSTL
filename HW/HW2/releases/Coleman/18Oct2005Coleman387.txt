SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS USDA DECISION TO HALT PLANNED FARM SERVICE AGENCY OFFICE CLOSINGS
  Sen. Norm Coleman applauded the United States Department of Agriculture's decision today to withdraw plans to close 713 Farm Service Agency offices across the United States, including 22 offices in Minnesota.  
 The plan, known as "FSA Tomorrow", was originally announced on September 28th, 2005 and targeted one out of every three local FSA offices in the country for closure. 
   "I am pleased that USDA has withdrawn this plan that could have negatively affected so many of our farmers," said Coleman. "In Minnesota, farmers depend on the services local FSA offices provide, and I was concerned about USDA's proposal because it had not proven service to farmers would not be jeopardized. I certainly share the goal of improving the efficiency of the FSA, but efficiency should not come at the expense of FSA's mission - service to our producers." 
   Following the plan's announcement, Senator Coleman joined Senate colleagues in unanimously passing an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that included a provision to prohibit closing local FSA offices unless it is determined that the closures will be cost effective and will not reduce service to producers. This amendment, which passed on September 20, 2005, was a key factor in USDA's withdrawal of "FSA Tomorrow". 
   "I was proud to support the amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that required closer scrutiny of the proposal," added Coleman. "The concerns I had regarding this proposal were shared by many of my colleagues and I applaud the USDA for recognizing these concerns today. At the same time, I look forward to continuing the dialogue with USDA as we explore ways to improve the overall efficiency of FSA services."
