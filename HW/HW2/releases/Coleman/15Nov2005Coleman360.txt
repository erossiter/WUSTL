SEN. COLEMAN CO-SPONSORS BIPARTISAN CARGO SECURITY LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN SENATE
  Citing the urgent need to protect American ports by improving the security of the millions of cargo containers that enter the U.S. unchecked each year, Senator Norm Coleman announced that he is co-sponsoring the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act introduced today by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Murray. The legislation is aimed at bolstering cargo security while maintaining the efficient flow of commerce.  
   "This legislation addresses one of our nation's most vulnerable sectors," said Coleman. "Since 2003, my Subcommittee has been at the forefront of a bicameral and bipartisan oversight investigation into cargo security. Chairman Collins and Senator Murray are to be applauded for their collective leadership on the GreenLane Maritime Security Act. I believe it will fundamentally strengthen supply chain security while preserving the movement of trade. This is significant legislation that provides our agencies the authority to ensure that their security programs have the teeth they have been lacking." 
   Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), Coleman has led a two year investigation into two critical homeland security programs administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection - the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) - to confront the terrorist threat. These programs were developed by CBP following the attacks of September 11th in early 2002 to secure global maritime trade. In addition to the findings of the Subcommittee, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released two audits outlining several problems and areas for improvement. The Subcommittee's oversight investigation confirmed these problems through oversight trips to seven CSI ports. 
   The nation's current cargo security regime was built pre-9/11, with an emphasis on efficiency but not on security. At present, opportunities for terrorists to tamper with cargo exist at every step along the supply chain. Terrorist organizations could use containers to smuggle weapons or terrorists into the United States, or could turn a container into a weapon by detonating a conventional, chemical, biological or nuclear weapon within a container once it arrives on American shores. 
   "Coming from a state with three international cargo ports, I am keenly aware of the importance of our seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which they are located. In addition to our ports' economic significance, the link between maritime security and our national security is evident," Senator Collins said. "The global maritime industry is crucial to our nation's economy, and our cargo ports are undeniably on the front lines of the war against terrorism. This legislation sets clear goals for improving the security of this vital sector, and it provides the resources to meet those goals." 
   "Right now, there is a gaping hole in our America's when it comes to the cargo entering our ports each day," Murray said. "To protect our nation we have to develop a cargo security system that closes vulnerabilities, provides a way to resume trade after an incident, and maintains the efficient flow of commerce. Our GreenLane bill addresses these issues, taking into account the input of all the key stakeholders and experts, and I want to thank Senator Collins for her hard work and cooperation in helping to write this bill and get it introduced in the Senate." 
   The Collins-Murray bill builds on the lessons from the 9/11 Commission, GAO investigations, and other reports to protect against the human and economic costs of a terrorist attack through our ports. 
   The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act Will: 
   * Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure - mitigating a dangerous vulnerability. 
   * Prevent a lengthy shutdown of America's seaports in the event of an incident - protecting America's economy from severe disruption. 
   * Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient. 
   * Push the borders out and reduce the haystack so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo. 
   The bill improves security at America's ports by establishing: 
   * The GreenLane, comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security, allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures. 
   * Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U.S. and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs. 
   * The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies, procedures & regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies. 
   * Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated, measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level.
  * Port Security Grants, the Container Security Initiative and C-TPAT. 
   "This legislation addresses one of our nation's most vulnerable sectors," Coleman said. "The GreenLane Maritime Security Act strengthens security while preserving the movement of trade. In addition, this legislation will ensure that all containers entering the United States will be screened for radiation. " 
   Coleman, along with Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), is an original cosponsor of the legislation.
