SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL: 
   It was deeply disappointing to learn that today Cuba was elected to the U.N. Human Rights Council. Eight months ago the U.N. committed itself to implementing real reform, including in the fundamental area of human rights. Sadly, eight months later the seeds of true reform have yet to take root at 760 United Nations Plaza. The new Human Rights Council is the perfect example of the UN's failure to reform, as it was established to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission where the worst human rights abusers sat in its membership. As today's elections underscore, the new Council suffers from the same fundamental weakness in its membership structure. It is ludicrous to believe that an entity where the world's serial human rights abusers are included in the membership will actually be able to play a relevant role in protecting and promoting human rights throughout the world.
