SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HANDOVER OF POWER IN IRAQ
  Statement from Sen. Coleman on Handover of Power in Iraq 
   "Today, the American occupation of Iraq ends and a new birth of freedom in the Middle East begins. Iraq has taken another step forward in becoming a nation truly ruled by its own people.
   Our work in Iraq, we must remember, is far from over. The Coalition made a commitment to establish a peaceful, stable and secure democracy in Iraq and it is a commitment we must keep. The war on terror in Iraq has been a tough and trying effort and it will continue to be so for some time. The loss of our men and women in uniform has been a burden almost too great to bear, but a free and democratic Iraq and victory over terrorism are worthy of this sacrifice.
   I applaud the transition from occupation to a sovereign Iraq.
   Today the message is clear to the violent insurgents within Iraq that have tried so hard to keep this day from coming: You have failed. Freedom will always overcome fear, liberty will defeat your violence."
