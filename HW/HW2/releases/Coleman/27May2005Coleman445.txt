SEN. COLEMAN DELIVERS MEMORIAL DAY STATEMENT
 "This Memorial Day weekend we pay tribute to those who have honorably served and have given their lives to defend our great nation. For over 200 years, our nation has been protected by brave men and women who put their country before themselves and I am humbled by this history of selflessness and courage.  
   Those who have fought and defended our country, our liberty and our freedom can be proud of the job they have done, and for this, we owe a tremendous amount of gratitude and respect to our service men, women, and their families for the ultimate sacrifice they have made. 
   This holiday weekend, we all must take time to honor the memory and legacy of those who have served us in the generations which have come before, as well as those who serve us and the mission of democracy here at home and overseas in the War on Terror. I believe Ronald Reagan may have said it best as he stood on Omaha Beach on the 40th Anniversary of D-Day: 'Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in a firm resolve to keep the peace. We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.' 
   We must be diligent in honoring those who share in the sacrifice of service so that we might continue to enjoy the blessings of freedom. Our men and women who served remain a testament to the spirit of our nation and the values we hold dear. It is now our duty to guard vigilantly what they have so bravely secured by honoring and remembering their service and selflessness."
