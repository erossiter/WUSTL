SEN. COLEMAN SECURES FUNDING FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS IN COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) announced today that he was able to secure funding for several key Minnesota projects in the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. The bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday and now awaits consideration by the full Senate.  
   Senator Coleman worked with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) to secure $600,000 in funding for the National Child Protection Training Center, a partnership between Winona State University and the National District Attorneys Association. The Center provides training, technical assistance and publications to child protection professionals throughout the country, and assists states in developing courses to teach investigators how to interview young child abuse victims. Last year, Senator Coleman has worked to secure over $1,500,000 in funding for the Center, and toured the facility with Center staff. 
   "The center is doing a remarkable job in working to eliminate child abuse by ensuring child protection professionals have the best training possible. We need to make sure we are doing our job to provide them with the necessary resources to carry out their important work, which is why I am pleased Senator Klobuchar and I were able to secure this funding," said Coleman. "My office has had a long and successful relationship with the NCPTC and I look forward to working with them in the future. Together, I believe we can continue to make a difference in the lives of children who need it the most." 
   Minnesota's Senators also were able to secure $350,000 for Bolder Options, an innovative non-profit agency in Minnesota that has improved the lives of more than 350 youth in the last five years. Last year, Bolder Options was named one of the top five charities in the Today Show Lend a Hand Series for its work coupling one-on-one mentoring programs with academic goal-setting and athletic activities. 
   "Securing funding for programs that support the education and protection of our nation's youth is one of my top priorities," Coleman added. "Bolder Options is a great example of how mentoring programs can truly benefit our youth. By helping to ensure that our children and the people educating them are properly equipped with the tools and knowledge they need, we help to ensure a bright future our nation."
