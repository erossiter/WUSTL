SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S SPEECH ON PROGRESS IN IRAQ
  "This evening President Bush did what he needed to do.  
 He offered the American people a candid progress report at a turning point on the path to democracy in the Middle East. While hailing historic milestones being made toward self government and freedom in Iraq, the president also acknowledged the setbacks and challenges that have marked this noble mission. The president's address comes days after millions of Iraqis of all segments of society braved the memory of tyranny and the threat of terrorists to vote to elect their own leaders and together chart a course for the future. He communicated a clear strategy for continuing our important mission, based not on an end date but on a successful outcome, reminding us that 'not only can we win the war in Iraq -- we are winning the war in Iraq.' And we are mindful that this success is based on the courage and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform. For their bravery we thank them and pray for their continued safety. I am confident that as progress continues, our priorities will change as we help the Iraqi people take charge of their country."
