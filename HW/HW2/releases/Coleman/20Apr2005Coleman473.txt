SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING MEETING WITH RED LAKE OFFICIALS
  Statement from Sen. Coleman Regarding Today's Meeting with Red Lake Officials   
   "The Red Lake Community suffered a tremendous tragedy and we have to work with them to deal with the short term and long term aspects of that tragedy. I think the first thing we need to do is focus on the immediate needs of youth and make sure that counseling, summer school programs, after-school programs, field trips, the language immersion camp and other hands on activities are in place for this summer. Let's work together to get these things done quickly. At the same time, we need to address the long term concerns of the community such as law enforcement services, hospital and infrastructure improvements, and education system needs. Let's make a long term commitment to meet the needs of Red Lake."
