SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF PATRIOT ACT
  Late tonight, Sen. Norm Coleman applauded an agreement reached by the United States Senate to extend the Patriot Act by six months. Under this agreement, the bill, which until tonight had remained in flux due to a filibuster in the Senate, would be extended for six months, during which time Congress would likely work out a long-term agreement on the bill.  
   "I am pleased we were able to reach an extension of the Patriot Act that is critical to our national security," said Coleman. "Ideally, both legislative bodies would have accepted the original compromise agreement on the Patriot Act, but this extension ensures that we will not have any interruption on this vital tool in the War on Terror." 
   Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Conference Report for Patriot Act Reauthorization by a bipartisan vote of 251-174. However, the bill was then filibustered when it came before the Senate, despite efforts by Sen. Coleman and others to bring the bill forward for an up-or-down vote. Until tonight's agreement, the bill had remained in limbo and was in danger of expiring. Instead, the Senate deal will allow the Patriot Act to continue without interruption, during which it is expected to be reviewed in order to reach a long-term agreement on the bill. 
   "The important thing now is that these important provisions will continue uninterrupted," Coleman added. "Since its passage after the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the Patriot Act has proved essential to fighting the war on terror and preventing our enemies from striking America again. It has accomplished exactly what it was designed to do - it has protected American liberty and saved American lives. I am confident that when Congress returns next year, we will work hard to reach an agreement on reauthorizing the Patriot Act." 
   The agreement will now head to the House of Representatives for approval.
