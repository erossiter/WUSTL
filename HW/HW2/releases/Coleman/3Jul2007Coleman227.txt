SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FOURTH OF JULY
  Statement From Sen. Norm Coleman On The Fourth Of July: 
   Today we celebrate the greatest political experiment in the history of mankind: a government founded of, by, and for the people. It is a celebration not only of those who conceived the principles of our nation, but also of those who protect and defend those ideals today. From Bunker Hill to Basra, brave Americans have sacrificed greatly for our freedom. They defend justice and liberty - the dreams of our founders. So I ask everyone to take some time today to reflect on those who have fallen while protecting our freedom. And as we celebrate the liberties our brave men and women in uniform have secured for us all, let us keep those who continue the fight in our thoughts and prayers.
