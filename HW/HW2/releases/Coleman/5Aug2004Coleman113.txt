SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES BUSH ADMINISTRATION GRANT OF $17.3 MILLION FOR MINNESOTA RURAL DEVELOPMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today joined Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman in announcing $17.3 million in grants and low-interest loans to assist with basic community water and wastewater infrastructure for 11 Minnesota communities. 
   The funds will benefit over 6,300 residents in the communities of: Bird Island; Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe; Hoffman; Ulen; Hill City; Ogema; Alberta; Storden; Urbank; Kettle River; and Conger.
   "President Bush knows that in order for rural communities to share in the current economic recovery, there must be an investment in basic rural infrastructure like water and waste systems." said Coleman. "The announcement today of $17.3 million for basic infrastructure in 11 Minnesota communities is a reflection of this Administration's commitment to rural America and it lays a good foundation for my Rural Renaissance Act."
   "These funds are an investment in rural business development," said Veneman, "and will help communities provide safe, reliable drinking water-the Bush Administration is fulfilling its commitment toward the future of rural Minnesota."
   The funds include $6,643,800 in grants and $9,973,300 in loans and will assist in consolidation of water systems, updating water distribution systems, the drilling of new water wells, construction of sewage treatment facilities and upgrading existing infrastructure and other community health and safety needs in the 11 communities.
   USDA Rural Development has nationally funded $5.4 billion in loans and grants since the beginning of the Bush Administration with a mission to deliver programs to support the increasing economic opportunity and improve the quality of life of rural residents. Secretary Veneman today highlighted that Minnesota has received $141 million in Rural Development funds to help rural Minnesota communities and residents increase their economic opportunity.
   Today's press conference follows on the heels of President Bush's visit to Mankato yesterday as he announced plans for significant expansion of the Conservation and Reserve Program (CRP) as well as other activities to enhance wildlife and wetlands in Minnesota. Secretary Veneman also traveled to Farm Fest in Redwood Falls today to announce further USDA grants to implement a national animal identification system in Minnesota.
