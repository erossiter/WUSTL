SEN. COLEMAN THANKS BUSH FOR DESIGNATING FLOOD-STRICKEN MINNESOTA COUNTIES FEDERAL DISASTER AREA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today thanked President Bush for declaring five flood-stricken southern Minnesota counties a federal disaster area, paving the way for federal funds to help communities, families and businesses to recover from the financial impact of a major storm in the area. 
   Coleman and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty had asked the Administration to consider taking action to declare Dodge, Faribault, Freeborn, Mower and Steele Counties a federal disaster area, due to severe storms and flooding starting on September 14, 2004.
   "I am grateful to President Bush for responding so quickly to the needs of the families and communities suffering from this devastating storm and flood," Coleman said. "While much work and hardship remains, this federal declaration and funding will provide the foundation for widespread recovery."
   A toll-free registration number has been set up for disaster victims: 1-800-462-7585.
   Individuals in the declared counties HAVE to call the 1-800 number in order to register for FEMA and to get money.
