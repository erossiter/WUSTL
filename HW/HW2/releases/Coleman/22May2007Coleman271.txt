SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1,872,900 FOR HOLMAN FIELD IN ST. PAUL
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a $1,872,900 federal grant for upgrades to Holman Field in St. Paul. The grant will be used to make a number of improvements to the airport, including taxiway and runway improvements, along with installation of new guidance systems. Coleman's office notified the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) of the award late yesterday.  
   "As a former mayor of St. Paul, I know firsthand the economic impact that Holman Field brings to the capital city," said Coleman. "This grant will go a long way in helping ensure Holman remains at the forefront of business aviation travel in the Twin Cities and the entire state, and I congratulate the MAC on receiving this grant." 
   "Federal funding enables us to continue moving forward with efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations at St. Paul Downtown Airport," said Metropolitan Airports Commission Executive Director Jeff Hamiel. "Airfield improvements such as relocation of taxiways and runway thresholds as well as installation of new guidance systems for landing aircraft ensure Holman Field will remain the premier airport for business aviation in the Twin Cities. I am grateful to Senator Coleman and Minnesota's Congressional delegation for their leadership in securing federal funds for the region's aviation community." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
