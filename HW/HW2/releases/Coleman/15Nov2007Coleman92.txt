SEN. COLEMAN BILL BANS STATES FROM ISSUING DRIVERS' LICENSES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
  In order to address a loophole in the REAL ID Act passed by Congress in 2005, Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman today introduced legislation to ban states from issuing driver's licenses or other forms of identification to aliens residing in the United States illegally. Specifically, Coleman's bill would amend the Real ID Act, which was aimed at preventing potential terrorists from obtaining identification by strengthening the security of driver's licenses, to strictly prohibit states from issuing any driver's license or identification card to any individual unless they are a citizen of the United States, or otherwise present in the country legally.  
   "Allowing states to issue licenses to illegal immigrants is eroding our national security and undermining our immigration laws," said Coleman. "Providing illegal immigrants with a driver's license affords them access to bank accounts, airline flights and other resources that the 9-11 hijackers used to attack this nation. In addition, a driver's license allows a person to enter a federal building, vote in elections, and apply for government benefits. When you can not verify the materials brought to the DMV to establish the person's identity - which is the case when we're dealing with non-citizens in an illegal status - you open the doors to corruption, multiple identities, and criminality." 
   States that currently issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants are: Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Congressman Peter King (R-NY) has introduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives.
