SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $500,000 FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN LINDSTROM, MILACA
  Sen. Coleman today announced fire departments in the communities of Lindstrom and Milaca will receive a combined $500,000 in low-interest loans through a grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Economic Development Grant Program. The grants will be distributed to East Central Energy (ECE), in Braham, enabling the cooperative to provide low interest loans to the respective fire departments in Lindstrom and Milaca.  
   "I am pleased USDA Rural Development has targeted this funding for fire department improvements in both Lindstrom and Milaca," Coleman said. "Funds to improve community fire departments are necessary for the safety of area residents, and this funding will help improve that safety. I applaud the USDA and East Central Energy for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of Milaca and Lindstrom have the resources they need to protect their communities." 
   Specifically, Milaca Fire Hall will receive a $300,000 loan from East Central Energy to help buy two existing buildings which will be renovated for a new fire hall. Similarly, Lindstrom Fire Department will receive a $200,000 loan that will be used to outfit the city's new fire truck. 
   The USDA Rural Economic Development Grant Program provides grant funds to electric and telephone utilities financed by the Utilities Programs, an agency of the USDA, to promote sustainable rural economic development and job creation projects through the operation of a revolving loan fund program.
