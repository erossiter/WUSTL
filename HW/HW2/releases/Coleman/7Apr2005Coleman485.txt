SEN. COLEMAN TO TOUR VETERANS FACILITIES IN LUVERNE, FERGUS FALLS, ST. CLOUD
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that he will tour three Minnesota Veterans care facilities in Luverne, Fergus Falls, and St. Cloud on Friday, April 8, 2005. On the tour, Sen. Coleman will meet with facility officials and Veterans Affairs staff members to discuss crucial issues facing Minnesota veterans and receive updates on service quality, resource availability, and other concerns facing Minnesota's veterans. While in St. Cloud, Senator Coleman will also meet with Clark Dyrud, the newly appointed Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as members of the Commander's Task Force.  
   "Our soldiers and veterans have made countless sacrifices on behalf of our country to protect our freedoms and liberty," said Coleman. "When we ask these brave men and women in uniform to fight for freedom, our nation promises to take care of them when they return. Making sure our soldiers in the field or those who have returned home have what they need remains one of my top priorities as a United States Senator." 
   In 2003 Sen. Coleman worked to pass legislation ensuring members of the military with disabilities related to service would receive both retirement pay and disability. Coleman also introduced the Veterans Benefits Outreach Act of 2004, legislation designed to help ensure that all veterans get the benefits they have earned but for whatever reason, had not been receiving those benefits.
