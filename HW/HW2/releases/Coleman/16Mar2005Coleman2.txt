SEN. COLEMAN VOTES FOR AMENDMENT TO INCREASE VETERANS MEDICAL CARE FUNDING BY $2.8 BILLION
  Today, Sen. Norm Coleman supported an amendment authored by Sen.  
 Daniel Akaka (D-HI) to add an additional $2.8 billion in funding for veterans medical care as part of the Senate Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2006. The funding provided by this amendment is in addition to the $938 million increase already proposed by the Senate Budget Committee. Unfortunately, the amendment failed by a vote of 47 - 53. 
   "We ask the brave men and women of our armed forces to fight for this country, we should in turn provide then with the best healthcare system possible", said Coleman. "When our troops return home from service they should feel secure in the knowledge that we are doing whatever we can in our power to make sure their medical needs are met. I don't feel that the initial proposal was enough to do this, so I was proud to support an amendment calling for an additional $2.8 billion for veterans to the Senate budget resolution. Unfortunately, our efforts fell short." 
   The increase of $2.8 billion would have brought the total increase in veteran's medical care funding to $3,738,000,000 in FY 2006.
