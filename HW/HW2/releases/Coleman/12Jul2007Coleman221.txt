SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON INTERIM IRAQ ASSESSMENT REPORT
  Senator Norm Coleman Statement On Interim Iraq Assessment Report: 
   "Today's interim report on Iraq on reaffirms my belief that the Iraqi government is failing to unite the country, while our troops continue to make progress. Our mission in Iraq must change. Our battle is against al-Qaeda, not to be caught in the middle of sectarian violence. The path to that changed mission, and the significant drawdown of American forces, which I believe should occur sometime next year, will be made more clear when Gen. Petraeus presents his final report to Congress in September. I am pleased that Secretaries Gates and Rice will be traveling to the region. I hope this represents a redoubling of efforts to meet all benchmarks and to bring moderate Arab states in to the efforts to fight extremism and stabilize Iraq."
