SENS. COLEMAN, SCHUMER WAGER ON TWINS - YANKEES AMERICAN LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES
  With the Twins and Yankees set to begin the American League Division Series Tuesday in New York, Sens.  
 Norm Coleman and Charles Schumer (D-NY) today announced that they have made a bet on the outcome of the series. The winner will receive a supply of delicacies from the loser's home state: Nathan's hot dogs from New York or walleye pike from Minnesota.
   "I rooted against the Yankees when Chuck and I went to high school together and I am still rooting against them now," Coleman said. "It's tough to beat a one dollar Dome dog in the Twin Cities. But I must admit I have always been a fan of Nathan's hotdogs and look forward to savoring one and the Twins' victory soon."
   "I give Norm credit for sticking with his team after last year's drubbing but I can already taste that walleye pike," Schumer said. "When the dust settles next week I am confident that the Yankees will again be victorious."
   Schumer and Coleman grew up just five blocks apart from each other in Brooklyn, where they knew one another and went to the same public schools: PS 197, Cunningham Junior High School, and James Madison High School.
