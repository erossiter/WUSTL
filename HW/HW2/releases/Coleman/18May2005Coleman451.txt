SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN BILL PROVIDING TAX CREDITS ON HEARING AIDS FOR SENIORS, YOUTH
 Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act (S. 1060), legislation that will provide senior citizens and parents of hearing impaired children with a tax credit, once every five years, of up to $500 toward the purchase of any hearing aid device that is considered a qualified hearing aid under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  
   "I am pleased to introduce legislation that will help millions of Americans enjoy something most of us just take for granted," said Coleman. "Hearing loss is one of the most common and widespread health problems affecting Americans today. By providing a $500 tax credit we can help seniors and parents of hearing impaired kids afford a hearing aid." 
   According to the National Council on Aging, as many as 70 percent of our elderly experience hearing loss, and as many as 31.5 million Americans currently suffer from some form of hearing loss. In addition, while 95 percent of individuals with hearing loss can be successfully treated with hearing aids, only 22 percent of Americans suffering from hearing loss can afford to use this technology; which equates to over 24 million Americans who live without hearing because they cannot afford treatment. 
   Sponsors to the Coleman bill include, Senators Gordon Smith (R-OR), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Mark Dayton (D-MN), and John Corzine (D-NJ).
