SEN. COLEMAN SUPPORTS JUDGE ROBERTS AFTER CONFIRMATION HEARINGS
  After careful deliberation, I will vote for Judge John Roberts to be our next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Throughout the nomination process, Judge Roberts has proven he's the kind of Judge America needs: fair, independent, unbiased, and committed to equal justice under the law. Judge Roberts will provide strong leadership, dedication, and legal brilliance to the bench, and as the process continues, I encourage my colleagues to support Roberts's nomination.
