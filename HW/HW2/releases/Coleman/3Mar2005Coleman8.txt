SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON BEEF TRADE RULES
  "When my Minnesota cattlemen asked me to work to fix the flaw in the original rule, I raised their concerns to Secretary Johanns and the rule was fixed.  
 Now, my cattlemen are telling me to support the rule because they are confident it is in their economic interest, it based on sound science protecting human health, and because they believe it will help open our own key export markets like Japan. I will stick with my cattlemen and support the rule. Our cattlemen have given us the safest, most abundant, most affordable beef supply in the world and I trust their judgment. And if you look at consumer confidence in this country, so does the American public."
