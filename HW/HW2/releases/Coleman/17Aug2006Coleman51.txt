SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SIGNING OF PENSION REFORM BILL
  With today's signing of the Pension Reform bill, we finally have a practical solution for protecting and securing the pension plans of hardworking Minnesotans and Americans without shifting the costs onto taxpayers. Providing companies with ways to fully honor their retirement commitments will strengthen the pension system for everyone, especially airline employees who all have made great sacrifices over the past several years due to hardship in their industry. I worked hard to pass this legislation, and I am pleased that Americans now have a guarantee of a secure retirement and the peace of mind to know that their years of hard work will not go unrewarded.
