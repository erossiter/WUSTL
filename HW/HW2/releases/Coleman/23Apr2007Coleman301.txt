SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $4.2 MILLION LOAN FOR LAKE BENTON
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Lake Benton has been selected to receive a $4,285,000 Water and Waste Disposal Direct Loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The federal loan will be used to fund the replacement of existing water and sewer lines in Lake Benton.  
   "In small towns across Minnesota, the need to update wastewater treatment systems is overwhelming," said Coleman. "During my numerous visits around the state, I have repeatedly heard about the challenges of funding these improvements, particularly given the small tax base in our rural communities. USDA Rural Development continues to provide crucial investment in many of these communities, and I applaud them for awarding this important funding to the folks in Lake Benton." 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $4.3 billion into rural Minnesota for a variety of improvements. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
