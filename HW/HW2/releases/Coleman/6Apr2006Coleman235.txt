SEN. COLEMAN WORKS TO ENSURE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL INITIATIVE ARE ADDRESSED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION
  Continuing his effort to minimize the potential negative impact of the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) on border communities in northern Minnesota, Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) today, along with Susan Collins (R-ME), filed an amendment to the immigration bill currently pending in the Senate (S. 2454) that would prohibit implementation of the WHTI program until it has been certified as ready by the Departments of State and Homeland Security, while also ensuring alternative documents to the proposed passport requirement are created and acceptable in terms of cost and practicality. 
   "While I share the goal of national security that was the basis for this proposal, it appears that the timeline for implantation may be too ambitious," Coleman said. "For too many folks living near the northern border, this program will have an enormous impact on their daily lives. For this reason, I think it is important that we measure twice before cutting once by ensuring the ramifications of this proposal have been fully tested and addressed before it goes into effect. This amendment would go a long way towards ensuring that we not only educate and distribute proper documents to those affected most, but that we test the program before finalizing the new requirements."  
   Specifically, the amendment would not allow the passport requirement to take effect until it could be certified that border crossing documents have been distributed to people who want them, that the border patrol is ready to accept them, that sufficient public outreach has been done, and that a pilot program has been conducted to prove effectiveness. 
   In addition to the certification requirements, the amendment would: 
   * Provide Congressional guidance for the implementation of the program, and mandate the development of the North American travel card 
   * Limit fees for the card to $20 and make it free for children under 16 
   * Require an aggressive public promotion campaign, including the establishment of at least 200 new passport acceptance facilities 
   * Require international coordination with Canada and Mexico 
   * Develop a process to handle situations in which people who don't have cards decide at the last minute they would like to visit Canada. 
   * Study the feasibility of using a drivers' license, under REAL ID, to be used for border crossings if people voluntarily elected to have their citizenship listed on it. 
   The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to and from Canada, the Americas, and the Caribbean, to have a passport or other accepted document that establishes the bearer's identity and nationality to enter or re-enter the United States. This is a change from prior travel requirements. The proposed changes are scheduled to go into effect by December 31, 2007. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs, Coleman held a hearing on June 10, 2005 on the projected impact of the proposed WHTI travel requirement. Coleman also held listening sessions on August 6, 2005 in the border cities of Warroad, Baudette and International Falls to hear the concerns of local residents over the proposed rule. In February of 2006, Coleman asked Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Josh Bolten, to review the affordability, practicality, and overall cost to the economy of the proposed border crossing identity cards being phased in by 2008, and to consider a pilot program for residents of Angle Inlet, MN.
