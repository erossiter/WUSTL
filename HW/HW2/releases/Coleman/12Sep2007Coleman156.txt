COMMITTEE APPROVES SEN. COLEMAN PROVISION TO FULLY FUND MINNESOTA TROOP REINTEGRATION
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today passed the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill, containing a provision authored by Minnesota Senators Norm Coleman and Amy Klobuchar to aid the reintegration process of returning Minnesota National Guard soldiers. The amendment provides $4.4 million to fully fund the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program. Created by the Minnesota National Guard, the program provides informational events and activities to assist National Guard soldiers, families, and community members through all phases of their deployment cycle including pre and post deployment. The events and activities created by this legislation include family and marriage counseling, financial planning and education, small business planning, community outreach, and healthcare and veterans benefits education.  
   "It is essential that our soldiers have immediate access to reintegration services upon returning home from combat, and Minnesota's Beyond the Yellow Program has been a model for the nation in helping our troops in adjusting to civilian life," said Coleman. "The members of the 1/34th, who recently returned home, told me about the importance of participating in this program along side their comrades, which is why I am pleased we were able to obtain the funding. I am also pleased that Secretary Gates has recognized the importance of this program and lifted the 60-day rule so Minnesotans will take full advantage of it. After serving this nation, our citizen soldiers deserve access to every available resource to make their reintegration as smooth as possible."
