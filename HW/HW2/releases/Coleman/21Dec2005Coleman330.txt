SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ANWR PROVISION
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman
   "This evening, I once again lived up to my commitment to prohibit drilling in ANWR.  
 By voting to strip the ANWR provision from this legislation, Senators, such as myself, Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe and Gordon Smith, who have adamantly opposed drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge, are now able to vote in favor of final passage of the DOD appropriations bill. 
   Since taking Office, I have now voted against drilling in ANWR four times. I intend to maintain my commitment to Minnesota, and am proud of my colleagues who joined me in rejecting the inclusion of ANWR in the DOD appropriations bill."
