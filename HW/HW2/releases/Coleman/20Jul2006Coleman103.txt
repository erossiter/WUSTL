SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON CHILD PROTECTION ACT
  Statement from Sen. Coleman on Child Protection Act: 
   "I applaud today's Senate passage of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety bill, which creates a national sex offender registry and increases penalties for crimes against children. The bill closes a dangerous loophole that has allowed sex offenders to prey on unsuspecting communities across state lines - something that was tragically evident in November 2003, when Dru Sjodin of Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, was abducted from the parking lot of a shopping mall in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The legislation we passed today contains Dru's law, which will combine all 50 state registries into one national sex offender registry that the public can access online. Dru's family has been through so much, and this is one small step we can take to honor her memory."
