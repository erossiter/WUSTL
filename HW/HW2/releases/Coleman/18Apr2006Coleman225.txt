SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $60,000 FOR CITY OF BOYD
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Boyd has received a $54,000 loan and a $6,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. The funds will be used to help Lincoln Pipestone Rural Water construct a 3.25 mile water line, as well as replace and repair existing lines serving the city.  
   "I am excited the residents in and around Boyd have received this grant," said Coleman. "With smaller populations and the smaller tax base that comes with it, rural communities are struggling to keep basic infrastructure, such as water lines, operating efficiently and effectively. For this reason, I have pushed hard in Congress to address these concerns through my Rural Renaissance bill, which would pump federal dollars into rural infrastructure projects like this one. I am pleased we are making headway on this issue in Washington, and I applaud USDA Rural Development for continuing to recognize the importance of these projects in communities like Boyd." 
   "We are pleased to get this grant and loan from the USDA Rural Development program," said City of Boyd Mayor Vern Lein. "We are now able to replace our old water lines and bring in clean rural water, and we look forward to replacing fourteen more blocks in the coming months. It has been great to receive these funds in a time when they are becoming more difficult to get." 
   USDA Rural Development works to make sure that rural citizens can participate fully in the global economy and has an $86 billion dollar portfolio of loans. Rural Development will administer nearly $16 billion in program loans, loan guarantees, and grants through their various programs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
