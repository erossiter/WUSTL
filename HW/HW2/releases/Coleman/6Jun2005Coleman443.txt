SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON RELOCATION OF ST. PAUL'S POSTAL PROCESSING CENTER
  "I'm pleased that the U.S. Postal Service has decided to relocate their St.  
 Paul Processing and Distribution Center to the City of Eagan. This decision gives the City of St. Paul a great opportunity to reestablish the St. Paul Union Depot as a transportation hub in its place, while bringing jobs and development to Eagan. I have been working with the Postal Service on this plan since my days as mayor of Saint Paul, as this site is crucial to the continued revitalization and transformation of the St. Paul riverfront. 
   Relocating the processing and distribution center to Eagan gives St. Paul the ability to serve as a multi modal transit terminal. For Minnesota, that means the Union Depot will be able to accommodate commuter, high speed, and light rail lines, as well as Amtrak and Metro Transit Bus service. Today's good news is a win for both cities."
