SEN. COLEMAN CO-SPONSORS PLAN TO EXTEND CURRENT FARM BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced he is an original cosponsor of legislation to extend the 2002 Farm Bill beyond its expiration date of 2007 until the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round negotiations are complete. A member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Coleman endorsed a bipartisan bill introduced by Sens. Jim Talent (R-MO) and Blanche Lincoln (D-AK) to postpone changing the Farm Bill until WTO negotiations conclude and the resulting new trade rules go into effect.  
   "Our farmers, as well as our trading partners in the WTO, need to know we will stand by our agricultural producers and not unilaterally disarm," Coleman said. "It would be irresponsible to allow the current Farm Bill's protections and provisions to lapse before receiving assurances that the WTO talks result in meaningful reforms and a level playing field for Minnesota farmers, ranchers, and agricultural exporters." 
   Coleman has been a consistent leader of Senate efforts to maintain the commitment made to American farm families and rural communities under the current Farm Bill. With high energy prices and low commodity prices, Coleman has led Senate efforts to resist cuts in the farm safety net again in this year's budget. 
   The Talent-Lincoln legislation would allow the 2002 Farm Bill to remain in effect while the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations continue. The bill would also keep the current Farm Bill in place for at least one crop year after Congress has approved legislation to implement any eventual Doha agreement. The bipartisan legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Kit Bond (R-MO), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Mark Pryor (D-AK) and David Vitter (R-LA).
