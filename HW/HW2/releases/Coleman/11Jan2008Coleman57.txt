SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON POSSIBLE NORTHWEST MERGER
  "As one of Minnesota's largest employers and our connection to the world, Northwest's operations are vital to our state. I will be keeping a close watch on any merger proceedings and will advocate for the Twin Cities' long term role as a headquarters and major hub."
