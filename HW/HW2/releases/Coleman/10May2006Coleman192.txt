SEN. COLEMAN RESOLUTION DECLARES MONTH OF MAY AS 'NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH'
  Sen. Norm Coleman passed a Senate Resolution last night declaring the month of May 'National Foster Care Month' and urging local, state and national government leaders to rededicate themselves to care for foster children. The resolution, cosponsored by Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Larry Craig (R-ID), also urges government officials to help identify the role that federal, state and local governments should play in ensuring that foster children receive appropriate parenting throughout their entire childhood.  
   "Children in foster care are 'our' collective children." Coleman said. "This resolution recognizes May as a month to pay particular attention towards identifying the roles that government officials should play in monitoring and assisting foster children. Statistics show that only 54 percent of foster kids earn a high school degree. This is just one example of why we need to do everything in our power to examine this system and give these kids a fair chance." 
   There are currently more than 500,000 children in foster care programs throughout the United States with approximately 25 percent of these children available for adoption. Despite this number, only about 50,000 foster children are adopted each year, forcing many of these kids to constantly move between multiple homes and remain in foster care for an extended period of time. Figures also show that approximately 20,000 youth "age out" - as opposed to being adopted - of the foster care system each year. Of these, nearly 30 percent are incarcerated within the first year of leaving the system. Studies also reveal that youth who "age out" of the system face other challenges and within three years: 
   * Only 54% had earned their high school diploma 
   * Only 14% had graduated from a four-year college 
   * Between 25-44% had experienced homelessness. 
   Recent studies have indicated that foster children are more likely than the average child to become a teen parent, rely on public assistance when they become adults and interact with the criminal justice system at some point in their lives. 
   "At every level of government, we can and should do more to help foster children succeed," Coleman said. "Every child deserves a loving family and a fair chance at life. Hopefully this resolution will encourage leadership on the issue and continue laying the foundation for providing foster children with promising and bright futures."
