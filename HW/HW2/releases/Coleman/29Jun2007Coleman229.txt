SEN. COLEMAN SECURES CRITICAL MINNESOTA FLOOD CONTROL, NAVIGATION PROJECTS
  In a continued effort to protect Minnesota cities from floodwaters and improve navigation on the Upper Mississippi River, Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that he was able to secure several key Minnesota projects in the fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday and now awaits consideration by the full Senate. 
   In August 2006, Senator Coleman traveled to the city of Breckenridge to witness firsthand the importance of the city's flood control project. Coleman made a commitment to city officials to work for increased funding for the Breckenridge flood control project. $4,000,000 has been included for the Breckenridge project in this bill.  
   Coleman also worked to expand a flood control study of the Minnesota River Basin to examine the specific needs of Browns Valley, MN. Earlier this spring, the City of Browns Valley was rocked by a sudden flood, damaging city infrastructure and private property. 
   "After meeting with Mayor Barth last summer, I made a commitment to increase federal assistance as soon as possible for the City of Breckenridge's critical flood control project," said Coleman. "With additional flooding already occurring this spring, the need for this funding is all too clear. I've also made a commitment to assist the City of Browns Valley as they work to rebuild after their debilitating flood earlier this spring. By funding a study for that city, we start the process of flood protection that Browns Valley's citizens rightfully deserve." 
   Funding for navigation improvements on the Mississippi River was also included in the bill at Senator Coleman's request. After meeting with officials in Red Wing in August 2006, Senator Coleman set out to increase funding for Mississippi Lock and Dam #3, one of the most accident prone structures on the Upper Mississippi. $2,250,000 has been included for the project in the bill. 
   "Transporting agricultural and industrial goods on our nation's waterways is essential to our economic well-being," said Coleman. "Mayor Dummer of Red Wing conveyed to me last summer how important it is to Red Wing and the entire State of Minnesota that Lock and Dam 3 be improved as a part of our waterway infrastructure. I brought that message to Washington and am pleased we were able to secure this increased funding." 
   Other projects secured by Senator Coleman include: 
   * $80,000 for the Marshall, MN flood control project. Originally authorized in 1986, cost increases have kept the city of Marshall from receiving the final amount of federal assistance for their flood control project. Senator Coleman worked to include the final piece of this important funding. 
   * $28,000,000 for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. When completed, the project will provide safe, reliable drinking water to over 300,000 people in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. 
   * $3,700,000 for the Mississippi Headwaters campgrounds. Due to a funding shortage, these campgrounds nearly closed in 2006. Due to Senator Coleman's efforts, the campgrounds have remained open and this funding will allow them to continue to operate through 2008. 
   * $100,000 for the Blue Earth River Ecosystem Restoration study. 
   * $250,000 for the Fargo-Moorhead Upstream Feasibility Study. 
   * $150,000 for the Minnehaha Creek study. 
   * $135,000 for the Wild Rice, MN Feasibility study. 
   * $100,000 for the Harriet Island dredging project in St. Paul. 
   * A directive to fund the Ada, Montevideo, and Painter's Creek Continuing Authorities projects.
