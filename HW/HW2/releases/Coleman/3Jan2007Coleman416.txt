SEN. COLEMANM ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S CALL TO BALANCE THE BUDGET
  I am pleased to support President Bush's call to balance the budget by 2012. For the sake of our nation's future prosperity, it is our responsibility to meet this goal. Working families across Minnesota make tough choices to live within their budgets and the federal government should be no different. Since coming to Washington, I have upheld the promise I made to the people of Minnesota to be fiscally responsible by voting against $4.636 trillion in Democratic proposed spending, voting for the Deficit Reduction Act and supporting line-item veto authority for the President. As we seek to meet the President's goal, we should make permanent the successful pro-growth tax policies that have resulted in record revenues, 7 million new jobs since August of 2003 and higher incomes for Minnesota's hardworking families. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on meeting the President's goal.
