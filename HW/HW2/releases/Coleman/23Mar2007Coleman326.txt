SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON BUDGET RESOLUTION VOTE
  SEN. NORM COLEMAN STATEMENT ON BUDGET RESOLUTION VOTE: 
   "I could not in good conscience vote for a budget that imposes the largest tax hike in American history and fails to address the sustainability of programs like Medicare and Social Security. Silence on these critical issues will have a negative impact on our children's future. While I worked hard to include amendments to improve this budget, in the end we were unable to fix its serious shortcomings. I could not support a budget that will require Minnesota families struggling to make it from paycheck to paycheck to shoulder this financial burden We must fight to keep in place the successful pro-growth tax policies that have resulted in 42 straight months of job growth and the creation of 7.5 million jobs."
