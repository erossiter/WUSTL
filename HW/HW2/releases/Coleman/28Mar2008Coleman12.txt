CITY OF LEWISVILLE TO UPGRADE SEWER SYSTEM WITH USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCING
  St. Paul - U.S. Senator Norm Coleman today announced that the city of Lewisville has been awarded a $616,000 financing package from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program to rehabilitate its sewer system. A $424,000 grant and $192,000 low-interest loan from Rural Development will help the city replace its current wastewater treatment system and lift station.  
   "Small towns across Minnesota are all too familiar with the financial strain that wastewater treatment upgrades can place on residents and rate-payers," Coleman said. "I have heard time and time again about this challenge, and have in turn fought long and hard for increased infrastructure investment in our rural communities to help ease this burden. USDA Rural Development has been the leader in helping communities meet this challenge and I applaud them for awarding this assistance to Lewisville." 
   Wastewater improvements are only one aspect of Rural Development's overall mission. Other financing available includes for rural areas includes housing, hospitals, emergency response, job creation, high-speed Internet, childcare and law enforcement. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested almost $4 billion throughout rural Minnesota. More information can be found at www.rurdev.usda.gov/mn.
