SEN. COLEMAN: PRO-GROWTH TAX POLICIES CONTINUE TO SPUR JOB GROWTH
  Citing the Labor Department's March jobs report, Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the pro-growth tax policies that have now lead to 43 straight months of job growth and the creation of 7.8 million new jobs during that time. According to the report, 180,000 new jobs were created during the month of March while the unemployment rate fell from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent-among one of the lowest rates in six years. Year-to-date, nearly two million new jobs have been created.  
   "Time and again, we are reminded of the positive economic results brought about by pro-growth tax policies enacted nearly four years ago," said Coleman. "Maintaining these tax policies is key to ensuring continued economic and job growth. That is why I could not in good conscience vote for the budget resolution that imposes the largest tax hike in American history. We should be fighting to maintain these policies, not to eliminate them. Along with fighting for pro-growth tax policies, I will also continue my focus on improving the quality of life for Minnesota's families by raising the minimum wage, increasing the quality and accessibility of Minnesota's healthcare services, making college more affordable for Minnesota's future workers, and promoting renewable energy. The bottom line is that Minnesota's hardworking families deserve economic security, and I am committed to promoting policies that will bring them that security."
