SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $12,350 FOR WATERVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Waterville Fire Department has been awarded a $12,350 grant under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The funding will be used to purchase equipment to fight wildland fires.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for providing this important funding to the Waterville Fire Department," said Coleman. "Local firefighters are on the frontlines of safety for their communities, and this grant will help benefit both the firefighters and residents in and around Waterville." 
   "The reason this program is so great is that it helps fire departments get equipment they generally couldn't afford," said Waterville Fire Chief Chris Meskan. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
