SEN. COLEMAN INTERCEDES TO FIX DISASTER PROGRAM FOR MINNESOTA WHEAT FARMERS
 Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to fix an inequity in the disaster assistance program for farm families who lost their crop last year due to weather.  
 As initially proposed, the quality loss program would not have fully compensated Minnesota wheat farmers for quality losses they sustained, leaving thousands of Minnesota farm families exposed to huge losses. 
   "The way the program was initially proposed to be implemented thousands of Minnesota farm families who grow wheat would not have been fully and fairly compensated for quality losses they experienced on their crops," said Coleman. "I raised this issue in a meeting I had with Deputy Secretary of Agriculture nominee, Chuck Conner, and again at his confirmation hearing, and I was very pleased when Chuck offered right away to roll up his sleeves and help fix this problem. He was true to his word and Minnesota wheat farmers and I are thankful to him." 
   Under the new rule issued today, state Farm Service Agency offices will have the discretion to make adjustments where quality losses calculated by USDA do not reflect the real losses sustained by farm families. 
   "The new rule ensures Minnesota farm families are fully and fairly compensated for quality losses," said Coleman. "Many thanks to Secretary Johanns, Chuck Conner, and the entire USDA Farm Service Agency team for a job well done."
