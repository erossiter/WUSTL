SEN. COLEMAN EXPRESSES CONCERNS TO NORTHWEST OVER POTENTIAL OUTSOURCING OF SOME FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
  Sen. Coleman says 3,000 U.S. jobs could be lost and aviation safety could be jeopardized if Northwest Airlines moves ahead with a proposal to outsource the vast majority of flight attendant positions on international flights with foreign nationals.  
   In a letter to Mr. Doug Steeland, President and CEO of Northwest Airlines, Senator Coleman strongly encouraged Mr. Steeland to reconsider Northwest's proposal, citing that implementation of this program would produce a massive loss in flight attendant jobs, union-negotiated protections and benefits. 
   "While I understand that Northwest must make hard financial decisions to emerge from bankruptcy," Coleman said, "I would strongly urge you to reconsider outsourcing these U.S.-based, safety critical flight attendant jobs to non-U.S. citizens." 
   In addition to the jobs that would be lost by U.S. citizens serving as Northwest flight attendants and the effect those lay-offs would have on families and communities across the country, Senator Coleman also expressed concern for the potential impact that such a move would have on the overall safety and security of the U.S. passenger aviation system. In particular, that replacing U.S. flight attendants with foreign nationals, for whom English is not their native language, could hinder the effective communication and coordination between in flight cabin and cockpit, and with passengers in serious flight emergency. 
   "Moreover, in this post-September 11th era," Coleman continued, "it is of the utmost importance that any foreign nationals hired under this scheme be properly subjected to meaningful security and background checks."
