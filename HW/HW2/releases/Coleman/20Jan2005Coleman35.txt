SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL
  "Today's inauguration is a celebration of the strength of our democracy. It is a tradition over two hundred years old, yet its magnitude and message are ageless. In this country, we elect our leaders and the transfer or continuation of power is a peaceful one. Even after a hard fought election like the last, on January 20 our nation unites behind its commander in chief. This afternoon we saw American freedom in action, and it was magnificent.  
   Today we look toward the heavens in gratitude for the freedom God has given us and also extend a salute overseas to the brave servicemen and women defending it. 
   The American people have given President Bush a second term and the responsibility to do and finish the important national business that lies ahead. On this day I am reminded of a verse from the book of Nehemiah: "And they said, 'Let us rise up and build,' so they strengthened their hands for his good work." With the campaign now behind us, I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to embark on an aggressive agenda of reform. While we must continue to wage an unwavering war on terrorism, we also must tend to the needs here at home. There is much work to be done, some heavy legislative lifting to do. In his speech today, the President promised to do his part, and we in Congress must commit to doing ours as well. 
   I was honored to attend today's inauguration as Minnesota's United States Senator. We are blessed to have such a great president and a leader who has kept the charge of the American people so faithfully. I pray that God may continue to grant him wisdom and strength and that He continues to shower His blessings on the United States America."
