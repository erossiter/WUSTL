SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION LOAN FOR TRAVERSE ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE IN WHEATON
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Traverse Electric Cooperative, based in Wheaton, has been awarded a $2,049,000 loan from United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The 35-year loan, administered through USDA Rural Development's Utilities Program, will be used to finance costs to replace and upgrade three miles of old and damaged line near Wheaton.  
   "Economic development in rural areas will only happen with adequate infrastructure in place, and this loan will help improve that infrastructure for folks near Wheaton," said Coleman. "As a former mayor, I have consistently sought to upgrade and expand basic infrastructure as a way to encourage growth, and resources such as this loan from USDA Rural Development are key to that effort. I applaud the awarding of this loan to Traverse Electric Cooperative to help expand service to area residents." 
   Through USDA Rural Development's Utilities Program, loans and loan guarantees are made to finance the construction or replacement of electric transmission and generation facilities. Since the beginning of the Bush Administration, Rural Development has provided over 900 loans for more than $19 billion through the Electric Loan Program across the nation. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested a total of over $2.5 billion dollars across Minnesota for a variety of rural development projects.
