SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $13,000 GRANT AND $115,000 LOAN FOR HANLEY FALLS
  Sen. Coleman today announced the City of Hanley Falls will receive a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal grant for $13,000 and loan for $115,000. The funding is slated for use in upgrading the city's water treatment facility, which absorbs and removes arsenic from the water supply.  
   "From my travels and discussion with small towns across the state, I understand the widespread need for funding to help improve the water treatment systems in our rural communities," said Coleman" "Inadequate infrastructure can negatively affect jobs and quality of life in our small towns, which is why I've worked hard on Rural Renaissance legislation that would address these needs. USDA Rural Development has been providing this kind of help for years, and I thank them for recognizing the importance of these grants to communities like Hanley Falls." 
   Water and Waste Disposal grants and loans are disbursed by the Rural Utilities Service, a division of USDA Rural Development, and aim to reduce water and waste disposal costs to a reasonable level for consumers by developing effective water and wastewater systems. 
   Hanley Falls previously received a USDA Rural Development loan of $350,000 and a grant of $95,000 in FY2005.
