SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION IN HOUSING ASSISTANCE GRANTS
  Senator Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a combined $1.5 million in grants to 12 Minnesota organizations that assist first-time homeowners during and after their home purchase. The funding is a substantial increase from the $379,342 awarded to Minnesota organizations in 2006.  
   "With the current mortgage and housing problems we are seeing across the country, these types of services are extremely valuable," Coleman said. "These grants will have a direct impact on first-time homebuyers - the folks most in need of these services." 
   The organizations that provide housing counseling services help people become or remain homeowners or find rental housing. Grant recipients help homebuyers and homeowners realistically evaluate their readiness for a home purchase, understand their financing and down payment options, and navigate what can be a confusing and difficult process. 
   Grantees also help combat predatory lending by helping unwary borrowers avoid unreasonably high interest rates, inflated appraisals, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and even foreclosure. HUD-funded housing counseling agencies also assist homeless persons to find the transitional housing they need to move toward a permanent place to live. 
   Specific grants for Minnesota are as follows: 
   * $45,308 for Anoka County Community Action Program Inc. 
   * $38,077 for Arrowhead Opportunity Agency Inc. 
   * $56,154 for Carver County CDA 
   * $50,000 for Catholic Charities Diocese of St. Cloud 
   * $20,000 for Community Action Duluth 
   * $34,462 for Community Action Partnership of Suburban Hennepin 
   * $38,077 for Dakota County Community Development Agency 
   * $1,016,474 for Home Ownership Preservation Foundation
