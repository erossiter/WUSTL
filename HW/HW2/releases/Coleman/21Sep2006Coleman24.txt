SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $6,523 GRANT FOR PROCTOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Proctor Public School District has been awarded a $6,523 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program. The funding will be used by the school to implement the program, which focuses on preventing juvenile delinquency and youth violence.  
   "Youth violence is a serious problem that needs to be addressed early in children's lives," said Coleman. "The G.R.E.A.T. program has proven successful across the country, and I'm pleased the Proctor school system has adopted it. The effort to fight youth violence begins in our schools, and these funds will be a great benefit to the kids of Proctor and the community as a whole." 
   Specifically, the grant will be used by the school to provide Proctor Police Officer Dan Mosher - who is also the school's current Student Resource Officer and D.A.R.E. instructor - with the resources to implement the G.R.E.A.T. program in Proctor's seventh grade classrooms, according to Diane Rauschenfels, Superintendent of Proctor Public Schools. 
   "We've done a lot to combat bullying in our school district and this will provide another opportunity for Dan to work with the kids," said Rauschenfels. "The more he can work directly with the kids the better, so when the opportunity came forward to get him into the classrooms even more, we jumped on it." 
   This is the first award Proctor has received for the G.R.E.A.T. program, and the program is expected to begin during the current school year, most likely during the winter months.
