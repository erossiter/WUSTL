SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AIRPORTS IN ST. CLOUD, BUFFALO, BENSON, WILLMAR, LITCHFIELD
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that five airports across central Minnesota have been selected to receive grants for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Specifically, grants were awarded to the St. Cloud, Buffalo, Benson, Willmar, and Litchfield airports to implement various improvements.  
   "Local airports continue to be an extremely valuable resource across the state and I am pleased these airports were selected for this funding," said Coleman. "From greater access for residents and visitors, to the potential for future community development, airports are important to their communities and I applaud the FAA for recognizing this value by awarding this grant." 
   The FAA's Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns. 
   Specific funding projects are as follows: 
   * $2,457,930 for St. Cloud Regional for aircraft deicing equipment, installing guidance signs, and acquiring other equipment (boarding stairs). 
   * $76,000 for Buffalo Municipal for extending the current runway, enhancing the safety of aircraft operations. 
   * $284,634 for Benson Municipal for constructing a new hangar and fuel farm. 
   * $211,375 for Willmar Municipal-John L Rice Field for widening current taxiways in order to accommodate larger aircraft. 
   * $130,000 for Litchfield Municipal for an environmental assessment for a proposed runway extension.
