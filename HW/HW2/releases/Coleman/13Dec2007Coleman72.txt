SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman today made the following statement in response to Senate passage of the Energy Bill, which increases fuel economy for cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 and the Renewable Fuels Standard to require 36 billion gallons of biofuels to be blended with gasoline by 2022 - requiring a dramatic increase in the use of new biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol.  
   "Passage of this bill marks a major step towards ending our dependence on foreign energy. By increasing the use of renewable fuels and raising long-overdue fuel economy standards, this bill not only makes major strides in reducing our consumption of fossil fuels and lessening our foreign oil dependence, it also protects the environment. This is a bipartisan achievement that offers real solutions to the Nation's energy security challenges, and I urge the President to sign this bill into law."
