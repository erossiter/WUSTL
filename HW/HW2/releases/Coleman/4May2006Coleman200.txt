SEN. COLEMAN TO MEET WITH RURAL MINNESOTA PHARMACY REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS MEDICARE PART D, OTHER ISSUES OF CONCERN
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced he will be hosting a meeting with several rural pharmacy representatives this Friday, May 5th, to discuss the impact of Medicare Part D and other areas of concern currently facing locally owned drug stores on Minnesota's Main Streets. The meeting, which will take place in Coleman's St. Paul office at 9:45 a.m., was organized by the senator following his Rural Health Care Listening Session held in March. During the listening session, Coleman heard from a number of local health care officials, including Leah Seehusen, who owns Leah's Pharmacy of Renville and spoke about the challenges she is facing as small-town pharmacist. Seehusen, along with five additional representatives, will attend Friday's meeting.  
   "After hearing from local pharmacists like Leah during my Rural Health Care listening session in Montevideo, I believed it was important to for me to follow up on some of the issues we discussed with other rural pharmacists throughout the state," said Coleman. "I know that rural pharmacies, an integral part of patient care in rural areas, are facing unique challenges in their communities. On Friday, we plan to discuss the implementation of the Medicare Part D program, the new Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare Act that I am cosponsoring, and other concerns and ideas. I am dedicated to continued work with pharmacists and other health care professionals in rural areas to promote health and support the exemplary health care for which Minnesota is known." 
   Sen. Coleman hosted his Rural Health Care listening session in Montevideo as part of a three-day visit through 12 western Minnesota counties from March 21st - March 23rd, 2006. During the event, Coleman listened to and discussed concerns from a number of residents regarding rural health care in Minnesota, including some of the specific challenges and effects of working with a high number of Medicare beneficiaries, common for rural pharmacists. 
   In order to continue helping address these concerns, last week Coleman co-sponsored the Pharmacist Access and Recognition in Medicare (PhARM) Act of 2006 (S. 2563), which is aimed at helping pharmacists continue to provide the best quality care to seniors and the disabled in their communities. The bill, which has the support of numerous pharmacy organizations, would: 
   * Allow pharmacists to receive prompt payment within fourteen days of submitting their claims to participating Medicare plans; 
   * Require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide guidelines for medication therapy management programs offered by Medicare; 
   * Establish a two-year community-based medication therapy management demonstration program using pharmacists to provide services; and 
   * Provide greater consumer access to pharmacists by eliminating branding on Medicare cards issued after the bill becomes law. 
   Specific attendees for Friday's meeting include: 
   * Leah Seehusen - President, Leah's Pharmacy Inc of Renville 
   * Todd Sorensen - Associate Professor and Director, Pharmaceutical Care Residency Program at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy 
   * Tim Gallagher - VP of Pharmacy Operations, Astrup Drug, Inc. 
   * Julie Johnson - CEO, MN Pharmacists Association 
   * Liz Carpentar - Vice President, Public Affairs - MN Pharmacists Association 
   * Abbie Laugtug - Government Relations Specialist, MN Pharmacists Association
