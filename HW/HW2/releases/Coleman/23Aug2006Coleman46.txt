SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAN RESPONSE
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON IRAN RESPONSE 
   I am disappointed that Iran refuses to agree to a suspension of their nuclear enrichment program. The global community must continue to speak in one, clear unified voice - which states that Iran must suspend of their program, or face further international sanctions. Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. 
   I view their latest response to have further discussions as a calculated effort to stall the imposition of sanctions. It's important that we continue the broad based international pressure on a regime that celebrates its efforts to arm terrorist groups and openly calls for the destruction of Israel. A nuclear Iran would wreck havoc on an already unstable middle east.
