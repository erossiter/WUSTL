SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON LIFTING OF U.N. BUDGET CAP
  STATEMENT FROM SENATOR NORM COLEMAN ON LIFTING OF U.N. BUDGET CAP: 
   It appears that the reform of the United Nations has been left in the dust as the budget cap was lifted without even a reference to reform. I'm disappointed that the effort to link funding and reform has been abandoned. I intend to urge my colleagues in the Senate to use our funding to the UN as leverage for reform, including withholding funds if reform fails to move forward.
