SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL VOTE
  "In its first test to determine if it is capable of real reform, the United Nations has failed. The decision to confirm the creation of a weak, and ineffective, Human Rights Council underscores the inability of the organization to embrace real reform. I am disappointed in the outcome. We must continue to pursue an aggressive reform agenda. The Congress(and US taxpayers) have the absolute right to demand reform and transformation of the UN as a precondition to continued financial support."
