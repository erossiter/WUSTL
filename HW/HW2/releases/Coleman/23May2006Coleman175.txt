SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $159,152 FOR RED LAKE BAND OF CHIPPEWA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians has received a $159,152 grant from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Tribal Wildlife Grant Program. The grant, which is part of nearly $8 million in recently awarded grants across the nation, will specifically be used to study reintroduction of lake sturgeon.  
   "I am pleased the Red Lake Band has been selected for this funding," said Coleman. "Across Minnesota, and specifically on tribal lands, fish and wildlife are important to our way of life. This grant will help the folks in Red Lake study the feasibility of reintroducing sturgeon into area waters, and I am thankful the Fish and Wildlife Service recognized the importance of this grant in Minnesota." 
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently awarded a total of nearly $8 million to help federally recognized tribes conserve fish and wildlife on their lands. The Service's Midwest Region - which includes Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin - received five grants totaling nearly $780,00 for wildlife projects, including two in Minnesota, two in Wisconsin and one in Michigan.
