SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES PENTAGON DECISION TO MAINTAIN COMBAT STATUS FOR TROOPS SERVING IN KOSOVO
  Sen. Norm Coleman today issued the following statement regarding the Pentagon's decision to maintain combat status for U.S. troops serving in Kosovo:  
   "The Pentagon made the right decision by maintaining the combat status designation for our brave men and women serving in Kosovo. With approximately 400 Minnesota National preparing to depart for duty in Kosovo, the possibility of a status change and the resulting loss in compensation was simply unacceptable to me, which is why I joined Senator Klobuchar earlier this month in writing to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to urge him to maintain the current status. I am pleased Secretary Gates heeded this call to reflect the conditions on the ground by maintaining combat status and properly compensating our brave troops who are serving in Kosovo."
