SEN. COLEMAN HONORS OPEN ARMS OF MINNESOTA WITH VICTORY AGAINST HUNGER AWARD
  Senator Norm Coleman today presented Open Arms of Minnesota, an organization focused on providing food and medicine to people living with and affected by chronic illness, with the Congressional Victory Against Hunger Award. Coleman nominated Open Arms of Minnesota to receive the $1,000 unrestricted grant on behalf of the Congressional Hunger Center (CHC). Every member of Congress was given the opportunity to nominate organizations in their own community or state to receive the prize, which is sponsored by Victory Wholesale Group. Awards are given to organizations who offer effective and creative solutions to hunger by promoting nutrition as medicine for people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other life threatening illnesses. 
   "Adequate nutrition goes hand-in-hand with treating HIV/AIDS and many other serious illnesses," Coleman said. "Open Arms has pioneered the effort to meet the unique hunger needs of those suffering from HIV/AIDS. I was honored to nominate them for this award, and I was thrilled to present them with it."
   Established in 1986, Open Arms of Minnesota is the only non-profit in Minnesota that prepares and delivers meals to people living with HIV/AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease and breast cancer. Each of Open Arms' meals are prepared and delivered at no cost to the patient and is tailored to fit individual needs. The organization recently served its one millionth meal in June of 2006. Open Arms also operates internationally as they have started a feeding program in South Africa where they sponsor a daily hot lunch for members of an AIDS support group and their affected family members.
   The Congressional Hunger Center was established in 1993 to fight hunger and recognize organizations and individuals who are committed creating a hung-free world.
