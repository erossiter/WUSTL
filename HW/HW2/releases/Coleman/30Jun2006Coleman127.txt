SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON INDEPENDENCE DAY
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY:  
   We are a nation conceived in liberty and democracy. This July 4th, we will pause to reflect on our struggle for independence. And as this day quickly approaches, people all over Minnesota and across our great nation should recognize the high price that many have paid for our freedom. As Americans, we have been blessed to be born and raised in the land of the free and the home of the brave. While we celebrate with fireworks and a day on the lake for many, I would urge everyone to take a moment to remember all of the service men and women who are defending our freedom here at home and aboard. I am proud to be living in the greatest country in the world, and I wish you all the very best this Fourth of July.
