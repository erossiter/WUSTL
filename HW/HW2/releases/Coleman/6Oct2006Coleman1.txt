SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF FEDERAL YOUTH COORDINATION ACT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the passage of the Federal Youth Coordination Act, which was passed unanimously last week as part of the Older Americans Act of 2006. Coleman had introduced the bipartisan Senate measure in February 2005 together with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and worked with the legislation's House sponsor, Rep. Tom Osborne (R-NE), toward its passage last week as part of the Older Americans Act. The bill will establish the Federal Youth Development Council to coordinate and improve the various federal programs serving youths. The Council will be chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  
   "Facilitating the development of our nation's youth is an important goal that we have been able to accomplish through a variety of different federal programs," said Coleman. "This legislation will ensure that this goal is met by making certain that these federal programs continue to grow and improve to best suit the changing needs of America's young people." 
   "The federal government has a broad array of programs that aim to improve the lives of our young people. Unfortunately, some of these programs have overlapping goals, resulting in duplicative use of limited federal funds to help young Americans. Today, the House has made life better for young people by passing the Federal Youth Coordination Act and maximizing the federal investment in them," said Osborne. 
   "Our children, especially those at risk, should not be lost in bureaucracy," said Stabenow. "America's young people deserve high quality, effective and meaningful youth development programs that have the greatest possible impact on their lives. This legislation will help us better serve America's youth by evaluating, coordinating and improving our federal youth programs." 
   The Federal Youth Coordination Act will: 
   * Create a Federal Youth Development Council comprised of heads of various Federal agencies and Departments as well as representatives from community, faith-based, youth-serving, and other appropriate organizations; 
   * Authorize the Council to provide advice and recommendations to Federal agencies; 
   * Require an interim report after one year, and a final report after two years that includes recommendations on the coordination of federal youth programs and a summary of the Council's actions to date; 
   * Sunset the Council 60 days after its final report; 
   * Authorize appropriate funding for fiscal years 2007 and 2008; and 
   * Ensure that the Council coordinates its efforts with existing Federal, State, and local coordinating entities. 
   The legislation was endorsed by over 250 youth-related organizations. 
   "This bipartisan legislation represents a huge victory for youth, particularly those in disadvantaged situations," said Kelita Bak of Camp Fire USA. "Young people need our positive support. The Federal Youth Coordination Act recognizes their needs, and puts them at the forefront of our national agenda. We appreciate Senator Coleman for his leadership on this bill, and for making children and youth more of a focus on Capitol Hill."
