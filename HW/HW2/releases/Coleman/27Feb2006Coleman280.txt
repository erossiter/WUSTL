SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $2,051,000 FOR KITTSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Kittson Memorial Hospital Association will receive two loans totaling $2,051,000 from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. Kittson Memorial Hospital, located in Hallock, Minnesota, is planning to use the loans to build a new eight unit assisted living facility, as well as to remodel the existing nursing home.  
   "I am excited to announce Kittson Memorial Hospital will receive these loans," said Coleman. "Increasing access and options for local residents is a critical part of strengthening rural healthcare in Minnesota. These loans will help build new and updated units for our senior citizens in Hallock, which is an important step in making healthcare and assisted living more accessible in the area. I am pleased USDA Rural Development has awarded these loans, and I am anxiously looking forward to the completion of the project. " 
   "We look forward to working with the USDA Rural Development program," said Kittson Memorial Hospital CEO Rick Failing. "This is our third project in the last ten years with USDA Rural Development and we truly appreciate the availability of affordably priced loans. It is definitely a beneficial program for small rural healthcare programs." 
   USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Rural Development works to make sure that rural citizens can participate fully in the global economy and has an $86 billion dollar portfolio of loans. Rural Development will administer nearly $16 billion in program loans, loan guarantees, and grants through their various programs.
