SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES MINNESOTA JOB CREATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the latest Minnesota jobs report, which showed that 3,000 news jobs were created in the month of March, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent-below the national average of 4.4 percent. More than 18,000 new jobs have been created in Minnesota during the past year.  
   "Minnesota, like the rest of the nation, is continuing to reap the benefits of pro-growth tax policies that have kept our economy robust and growing," Coleman said. "That is why it is imperative that we maintain these policies so that we can continue to create jobs and keep unemployment rates low. I will continue to fight to maintain these successful pro-growth policies and other policies that help produce a higher standard of living for hardworking families. Whether it's economic, healthcare, or education related concerns, all of us have those issues that weigh heavily on our minds when we go to bed at night, and it is my job to pursue policies to help lighten the load of Minnesota's hardworking families." 
   Nationally, pro-growth tax policies have now lead to 43 straight months of job growth and the creation of 7.8 million new jobs during that time. According to the latest Labor Department report, 180,000 new jobs were created during the month of March while the unemployment rate fell from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent-among one of the lowest rates in six years. Year-to-date, nearly two million new jobs have been created.
