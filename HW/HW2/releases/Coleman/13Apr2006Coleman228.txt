SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON ST. PAUL FORD PLANT CLOSURE
  "I am greatly disappointed by the announcement that the St. Paul Ford plant will be closing in 2008. For the past few months, we have been working extensively with Ford, the Governor, and the City of St. Paul to reach a solution that would allow the plant to remain open - preferably with a focus on renewable fuels. 
   Since 1925, this plant has provided Minnesotans with thousands of good paying jobs. Ideally, there would still be some kind of partnership or other option we could arrange with Ford to retain members of its exemplary workforce in St. Paul, but ultimately, the company has final say. Regardless of the final outcome, my main concern is for the workers and their families, and I will do whatever I can to help provide the assistance needed for their future prosperity."
