SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES U.S. JOB GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the Labor Department's January jobs report, which shows that the labor market continues to remain healthy with solid job and wage gains. According to the report, 111,000 jobs were created for the month of January marking the 41st straight month of job growth. Also according to the report, both hourly and weekly earnings increased by 4 percent during the past year. For the past three months, more than 500,000 new jobs have been created and since August 2003 more than 7.4 million new jobs have been created. Just as impressively, this is the second longest period of consecutive monthly job growth since 1980. The longest was 48 months from 1986-1990.  
   "Our nation's job market continues to be strong thanks in great part to pro-growth policies," said Coleman. "To help ensure the economy's continued strong performance, I will continue to work hard to keep in place these successful pro-growth policies. At the same time, however, I recognize that even with the strong economy, some of the gains are being offset by higher health care, energy and education costs. I take seriously my job of helping improve the quality of life for all Minnesotans. Just this week, I worked with my Senate colleagues to pass bipartisan legislation to increase the minimum wage--legislation that will help out the nearly 230,000 Minnesotans who work in low-wage jobs. The minimum wage increase was long overdue for our state's hardworking families and I will continue to address the financial concerns of the folks back home." 
   Today's jobs report follows this week's release of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report for the fourth quarter, which shows the economy expanding for 21 straight quarters and growing at a 3.5 percent annual rate during the last three months of 2006. For 2006, the report shows that the economy grew by 3.4 percent compared to 3.2 percent in 2005 and 3.9 percent in 2004.
