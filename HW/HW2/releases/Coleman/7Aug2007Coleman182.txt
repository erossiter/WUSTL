USDA MAKES PROGRESS TOWARD SEN. COLEMAN'S REQUEST FOR MINNESOTA DROUGHT ASSISTANCE
  Responding to a letter Senator Norm Coleman sent to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns last week requesting emergency assistance for farmers in 25 drought-stricken Minnesota counties, the Secretary announced today at Farm Fest the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will approve emergency loans in disaster counties. Coleman's letter outlined the alarming drought conditions in Minnesota and requested USDA to expedite its consideration of emergency haying and grazing of CRP land for farmers affected by this summer's drought conditions, while also calling on the Secretary to work for additional emergency disaster assistance should drought conditions continue.  
   "This unrelenting drought continues to adversely affect over three-fourths of our great state," said Coleman. "This financial assistance comes as a relief to the entire state as the rural communities that have been affected play a large role in sustaining Minnesota's economy, food supply and overall way of life. I thank Secretary Johanns for acting, but our farmers need emergency haying and grazing - I hope the Secretary will follow up with this needed assistance as well." 
   Currently, three-fourths of Minnesota is in either a moderate or severe drought category. For the first time in many years, the numbers of poor or very poor corn fields outnumber fields in good or excellent condition, diminishing potential yields for Minnesota farmers. Of those counties, most seeking aid are between the Twin Cities and Brainerd as well as the northeastern corner of the state to the tip of the Arrowhead. 
   Coleman spent today visiting with farmers at Farm Fest and traveling southwestern Minnesota to assess the damage from this summer's drought firsthand.
