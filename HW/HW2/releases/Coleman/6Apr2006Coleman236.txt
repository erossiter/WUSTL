SEN. COLEMAN ADVOCATES FOR COMPREHENSIVE CARGO SECURITY LEGISLATION AT SENATE HEARING
  Sen. Norm Coleman participated in a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing yesterday to examine his legislation aimed at bolstering cargo security while maintaining the efficient flow of commerce. The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act, coauthored by Senators Coleman, Susan Collins (R-ME) and Patty Murray (D-WA), develops a strategic plan to enhance international security for all modes of transportation by which containers arrive in, depart from, or move through seaports of the United States; establishes an office of cargo security policy and container security standards; ensures containers are screened for radiation; and strengthens our voluntary security programs.  
   "There are obvious security blindspots in our current cargo security systems and processes, and this hearing outlined how the GreenLane Act will fill in these critical gaps," said Coleman. "More importantly, this legislation strengthens our global supply chain security while maintaining an efficient flow of commerce. As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation (PSI), I have led a three-year bicameral and bipartisan oversight investigation into cargo security. Last week, our PSI hearings highlighted the need to secure our containers, ports, and borders. Yesterday's full committee hearing addressed some of these key concerns and determined that we must focus our limited resources on all suspect cargo. I am privileged to work alongside Senators Collins, Murray, and Lieberman, as we push forward the legislative solution to this critical issue." 
   Specifically, the Greenlane Act will establish: 
   * The GreenLane, created as the third tier of Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), will allow our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provide real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures. 
   * Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U.S. and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs. 
   * The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies, procedures & regulations at the DHS and with other agencies. 
   * Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated, measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level. 
   * Authorizes Port Security Grants, the Container Security Initiative and C-TPAT. 
   The GreenLane Maritime Act builds on the work from the 9/11 Commission, Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigations, and other reports to protect against the human and economic costs of a terrorist attack through our ports. As Chairman of PSI, Senator Coleman recently held a two-part hearing to examine the threat of nuclear terrorism and assess various programs to secure, detect and interdict nuclear and radiological materials domestically and abroad, titled "Neutralizing the Nuclear and Radiological Threat: Securing the Global Supply Chain." In conjunction with the hearings, the Subcommittee released an extensive report, "An Assessment of U.S. Efforts to Secure the Global Supply Chain", which highlighted key findings and issues with U.S. Government programs. 
   To further highlight the severity of this potential threat, Senator Coleman requested that Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initiate a study of the economic consequences of an attack on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. This study found that the United States' gross domestic product (GDP) would decline by about $150 million per day for each day that the ports were closed and that the annual cost would be approximately $70 billion. 
   Throughout the course of its three-year investigation, the Subcommittee has identified numerous weaknesses in America's programs that secure the global supply chain: 
   * Less than 40 percent of cargo containers entering U.S. ports are screened for nuclear or radiological materials. 
   * The deployment of radiation detection equipment is woefully behind schedule. 
   * As of March 2006, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed only 30.8 percent of the necessary radiation monitors. 
   * Under C-TPAT, the Subcommittee found that an overwhelming proportion of participating companies receive benefits prior to having their security profile validated. Only 27 percent of the participating companies have been subjected to a validation. Therefore, 73 percent of companies have not been subjected to any legitimate, on-site review to ensure that their security practices pass muster. 
   * The Automated Targeting System used by the U.S. Government to target high-risk shipments has not been proven to be an effective system nor has it been tested or validated. 
   The GreenLane bill complements separate legislation Coleman recently introduced (S.2410) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide a plan within 90 days on how to install a system that will screen 100 percent of all inbound maritime containers. The comprehensive legislation also prohibits foreign government controlled entities from managing a national security related facility or investment. Instead, the legislation will permit foreign governments to own and invest in such facilities provided that the foreign government establishes a U.S. general business corporation. Much like the concept of a blind trust, the foreign government can own and benefit economically from its investment, but cannot control or manage day-to-day operations in the U.S.
