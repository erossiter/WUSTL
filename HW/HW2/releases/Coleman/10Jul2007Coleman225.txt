SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE CONSIDERATION OF IRAQ POLICY
  Sen. Coleman's statement on senate consideration of Iraq policy:  
   "Congress mandated a report from the President by July 15th on the course of the Iraq War and the Iraqi government's progress in meeting specific benchmarks and I intend to review it carefully. While understanding the urgent need to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq, I remain deeply concerned about the President's strategy and for American troops caught in sectarian violence. Looking to the future, I believe we need a mission in Iraq that puts Iraqis in the forefront and focuses U.S. military involvement in a supportive role. To that end, I will continue to work with a bipartisan group of my colleagues as we consider Iraq policy this week in the Senate."
