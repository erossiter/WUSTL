SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $63,000 FOR CITY OF NIELSVILLE
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Nielsville has received a $63,000 loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The rural development funds will be used to update and replace the city's existing wastewater sewer system.  
   "I am excited to announce that Nielsville will receive this funding," said Coleman. "Funding basic infrastructure upgrades, such as wastewater systems, is a primary challenge in Minnesota's rural communities, and USDA Rural Development continues to provide critical financing for these projects. I applaud their continued efforts on behalf of rural Minnesota, and am thankful they have awarded this loan to Nielsville." 
   "The City of Nielsville greatly appreciates the supplemental funding we have received for our wastewater system," said Nielsville City Clerk Stephanie Abentroth. "This funding will now help the city complete the necessary improvement needed for the system. On behalf of the Nielsville City Council, I wish to say thank you." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
