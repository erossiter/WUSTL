SEN. COLEMAN SECURES FUNDING FOR KEY MINNESOTA ENERGY, WATER PROJECTS
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced he was successful in securing funding for a number of Minnesota flood control, water system and energy projects in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill, including flood control projects in Breckenridge, Stillwater, Ada and Montevideo. Coleman also included funding for Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, Lock and Dam #3 near Red Wing and a host of additional projects.  
   "The strength of our economy and local communities is tied directly to the strength of our energy and water infrastructure," Coleman said. "From needed flood control projects to improving Lock and Dam #3 to improving water treatment systems, I worked hard to include these projects to ensure we are not faced with the consequences of not doing so in the future." 
   Recognizing the work the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute (AURI) has done to advance renewable fuels in Minnesota, Senator Coleman worked to secure $984,000 for the AURI Center for Producer-Owned Energy. The Center supports the creation and development of producer-owned enterprises related to the production of renewable energy and the utilization of related coproducts and byproducts. 
   "For years AURI has been an invaluable resource to virtually every producer-owned renewable fuel plant in the state and works to promote local and producer ownership. This critical funding will empower AURI to continue making local and producer ownership a reality in Minnesota," said Coleman "With the price of crude oil reaching record highs this year, America continues to import more oil from the Middle East today than we did before the September 11th attacks. Both our economic and national security are increasingly vulnerable to oil-rich nations run by governments hostile to American interests. This funding will complement the increased 36 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard Congress is about to pass to lessen our dependence on foreign oil through renewables."
