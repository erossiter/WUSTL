SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT IN CELEBRATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN IN CELEBRATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY: 
  "One of the greatest tenets of our country's founding was the principle that "All men are created equal - words which too often rang hollow during the first part of our nation's history. Today we celebrate a great man who had the strength and courage to give those words depth and meaning. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had a vision for America where everyone, regardless of race, sex or creed, would have a chance at living their own American dream. Through tremendous obstacles and painful trials, Dr. King courageously led and inspired a generation of African Americans to break through oppressive societal structures and stand with all Americans as equals. We celebrate Dr. King's life and legacy not only because of the great work that he accomplished on this earth, but also for the legacy of inspiration that he instilled in a generation to continually strive toward equality and fairness - and ensure that the words of our founding fathers continue to ring true."
