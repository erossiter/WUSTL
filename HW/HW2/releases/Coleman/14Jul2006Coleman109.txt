SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $12,000 WATER, WASTE DISPOSAL GRANT FOR CITY OF SEAFORTH
  Sen. Coleman announced today that the City of Seaforth has been awarded a $12,000 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal Grant. The grant will be used to diagnose problems with the current sewer system as well as complete a preliminary engineering report for future sewer system construction.  
   "I am excited the City of Seaforth has received this USDA grant," said Coleman. "As a member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and Rural Revitalization, I understand the significance of grants like this one to the vitality of this rural community and the protection of its abundant natural resources. I applaud the City of Seaforth for working hard with limited resources to provide essential services that will improve the quality of life for its residents and thank the USDA for recognizing the importance of grants like this one to our rural communities." 
   "This grant will definitely help health and pollution control-wise," said City Clerk Pam Sheeran. "We will pursue more funding through the Rural Development program in the future so that we can get a working sewer system in town as soon as possible." 
   The USDA Rural Development Utilities Program helps rural utilities expand and keep their technology up-to-date. The Water and Environmental Program provides loans, grants, and loan guarantees for drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and storm drainage facilities in rural areas, cities, and town of 10,000 or less.
