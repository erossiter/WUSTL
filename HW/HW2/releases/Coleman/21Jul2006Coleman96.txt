USDA RESPONDS TO SEN. COLEMAN CALL TO ALLOW EMERGENCY HAYING IN DROUGHT-STRICKEN MINNESOTA COUNTIES
  Sen. Norm Coleman today thanked the United States Department of Agriculture for deciding to open up Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land in selected Minnesota counties severally impacted by drought, something he had encouraged USDA to consider. The decision will allow emergency grazing and haying due to the extreme drought conditions that continue to plague the area, providing supplemental forage to producers whose pastures have been adversely affected by drought. The counties authorized for emergency grazing include: Marshall, Pennington, Clearwater, East Polk and Red Lake Counties.  
   "As farm fields grow more parched by the day, I've asked USDA to take strong action to alleviate the pressure this drought is causing farmers struggling to feed their herds, and I commend the Department's response. As Minnesota's drought intensifies, I will continue to press for strong action and quick response as the situation develops - the federal government must stand behind America's farmers facing this emergency," said Coleman. "I have and continue to work for passage of disaster assistance for flooding that occurred in 2005, and should our farmers and ranchers require emergency federal financial assistance for this drought, I will fight equally hard for those needs in Congress." 
   CRP is a voluntary program that establishes long-term resource conservation on eligible land. The USDA's expansion will make hay available to livestock producers in the eligible counties.
