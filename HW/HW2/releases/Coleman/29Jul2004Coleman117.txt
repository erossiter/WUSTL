SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES OVER $186,000 GRANT FOR SHELTER HOUSE IN WILLMAR
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded the Shelter House in Willmar, Minnesota a grant of $186,394.  
 These funds were included in this year's VA/HUD Appropriations legislation at Coleman's request. Shelter House is a center for victims of domestic abuse.
   "The mission of Shelter House is public service at its purest," Coleman said. "Domestic abuse is a terrible crime and tragedy, and Shelter House is doing great and noble work in helping the affected women and children recover from these horrible crimes."
   "I am very ecstatic about moving ahead with our construction project," said Connie Schmoll, executive director of Shelter House, "Shelter House has been in existence for 26 years and this building will be the first building that Shelter House has actually owned and that exists solely for the women and children who reside here."
   Shelter House is a non-profit organization that provides emergency shelter for battered women and children. The program also provides advocacy for survivors of domestic violence in a six county area that need assistance to end violence but do not need emergency shelter. Outreach services are available in the six counties of Kandiyohi, Renville, Swift, Meeker, Chippewa, and Lac qui Parle.
