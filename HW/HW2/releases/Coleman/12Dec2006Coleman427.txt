SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DENNIS PRAGER'S OUSTER FROM HOLOCAUST BOARD
  "One of the great things about our country is that we are able to fully exercise our freedom of religion and freedom of speech. Dennis Prager has long been a thoughtful and articulate voice for both of these fundamental freedoms. I fully support Keith Ellison's right to use the Koran for the ceremonial swearing-in. I disagree with Dennis' stance on this issue. However, I support his right to express his beliefs. Dennis has been a long-time friend and dedicated member of the Holocaust Board and its mission, and this issue in no way should result in removal. It is unjust and unfair to characterize Mr. Prager's position as bigoted. The Holocaust Museum stands as a testament to tolerance. That tolerance, both religious and political, would be undermined by Prager's ouster."
