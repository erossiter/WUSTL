SEN. COLEMAN INTRODUCES NEW FUEL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP NEEDY CONSUMERS PAY SKYROCKETING GAS PRICES
  In an effort to address the significant impact of escalating fuel costs on low and middle income Americans, Sen. Norm Coleman today introduced legislation, the Fuel Emergency Relief Act, to provide states with annual grants to operate fuel cost assistance programs for those families struggling to afford the high costs of gasoline. Eligibility standards would be determined by income criteria and these block grants would only be issued to need-based families. Funding for the assistance programs would be provided by requiring large integrated oil companies to adjust their accounting method used in valuing their inventories. 
   "The high cost of gasoline is greatly affecting hardworking families throughout the country and it's important that Congress step in and provide targeted assistance," Coleman said. "This bill is not an open-ended money giveaway. Rather, it creates a needs-based block grant program that gives States the resources they need to help families make it through economic hardship caused by high fuel prices."  
   The bill would require oil companies to undertake a revaluation of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting method for inventory. It is estimated that this inventory revaluation would generate about $4.3 billion in additional tax revenues over two years. The Department of Energy would distribute these block grants to the states based on the size of a state's population and the number of eligible households living in that state. 
   "States will have a lot of latitude within these eligibility limits to meet the unique needs of their communities, and I believe it will prove an important tool to address short-term crisis of families who are having to make tough decision because of these gas prices." Coleman said. "This two year program will help in the short-term, but Congress must implement the long-term policies to reduce prices for all Americans in the future by encouraging energy conservation and the growth of a strong renewable fuels industry." 
   The legislation is the latest effort by Coleman to address the issue of rising gasoline prices. Coleman joined Senator Bingaman in introducing the Energy Efficiency Act of 2006 which will reduce foreign oil dependence by establishing specific national goals for replacing oil imports through a significant expansion of renewable fuel infrastructure, increased use of vehicle technologies such as hybrids, and increased conservation measures. As a complement to this bill, Coleman also worked with Senator Bingaman to introduce of the Enhanced Energy Security Act, which will expand incentives for the purchase and production of advanced vehicles such as hybrids and fuel cell, along with containing key incentives to help save natural gas. 
     FUEL ASSISTANCE BLOCK GRANT ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS: 
   *Limits the benefit to households with incomes up to 250% (about $50,000 for a family of four) of the federal poverty income guidelines (or, if greater, 70% of the state median income, which is about $54,000 for a family of four in Minnesota). 
   *Allows states to adopt lower income limits, but no household with income below 110% of the poverty guidelines may be considered ineligible (pending successful eligibility of the vehicle requirement). 
   *States may separately choose to make eligible for the benefit any household of which at least one member is a recipient of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Food Stamps, or certain needs-tested veterans' programs. 
   *Limits the benefit to households who can prove ownership/long-term lease of a vehicle. 
   *Within these limits, the states decide which, if any, assistance categories to include, what income limits to use, and whether to impose other eligibility tests. The states must also decide the mix and dollar range of benefits, choose how benefits are provided, and decide what agencies will administer the program. 
   *Priority should be given to households with the greatest cost burdens, especially those that include individuals without a viable alternative to gasoline-vehicle transportation. 
   *This assistance is not to reduce eligibility or benefits under other aid programs.
