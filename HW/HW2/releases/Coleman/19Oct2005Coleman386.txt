SENS. COLEMAN, DAYTON SUPPORT NOMINATION OF MINNESOTA'S BEN WHITNEY FOR U.S AMBASSADOR TO NORWAY
 Minnesota Sens. Norm Coleman and Mark Dayton announced today that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations will hold a hearing tomorrow on the nomination of Benson K. Whitney to be the United States Ambassador to Norway.  
 Once confirmed, Whitney's duties will include overseeing the Embassy and managing economic, consular and immigration issues, as well as political and military relations with Norway. 
   Hailing from Minnesota, Whitney has distinguished himself as a successful entrepreneur and businessman. Currently, Whitney is President of Argus Management, a venture capital management firm, and was previously the CEO of Whitney Management Company, a private investment advisory firm. Whitney has also served on the St. Paul Riverfront Finance Committee, helping to transform and modernize St. Paul's riverfront. 
   "Throughout his career, Ben has demonstrated himself to be a man of intelligence and leadership, whose vision for Minnesota has helped inspire my own," said Coleman "I proudly support his nomination because I believe he will represent the United States with class and distinction. Ben's nomination to this position is also great source of pride for the state of Minnesota." 
   "I am proud to support President Bush's nomination of Mr. Benson Whitney as the United States Ambassador to Norway," said Dayton. "I have known Mr. Whitney and his family for many years, and they represent Minnesota's finest traditions of dedicated public service. I also commend the President for nominating a Minnesotan to this important diplomatic post, given our state's great Norwegian heritage and our continuing close relationships."
