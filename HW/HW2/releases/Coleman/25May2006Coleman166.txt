SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $285,000 FOR HUTCHINSON AIRPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today the City of Hutchinson has received a $285,000 grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. Specifically, the grant will be used to construct a new storage building for airport snow removal equipment at Hutchinson Municipal Airport.  
   "In Greater Minnesota, local airports are an important part of accessibility and opportunity for local communities," said Coleman. "Hutchinson will now have resources to help improve services during the winter months, helping increase access to the airport for area businesses and residents. I applaud the FAA for recognizing the importance of these grants for rural Minnesota airports." 
   The Airport Improvement Program provides grants to public and private airports to promote the development and modernization of local airports. Funds for these projects generally go toward airport safety, capacity, security, and environmental concerns.
