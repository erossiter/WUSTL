SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION FOR ST. LUKE'S LUTHERAN CARE CENTER IN BLUE EARTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that St. Luke's Lutheran Care Center will receive a $3 million loan from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help pay for renovation of the center's facilities. 
   The USDA Rural Development funds will be used to update components of the facility's infrastructure as well as refinance approximately $900,000 of existing debt. The center will replace the air handling system, install new air conditioning and heating units, install energy-efficient lighting, and remodel parts of the kitchen, common rooms, and ceilings.
   "My number one priority is to focus on economic development for Minnesota," said Coleman. "These USDA funds help ensure strong economic growth in rural Minnesota by assisting in the restoration of vital community facilities, and I am quite pleased that the Blue Earth area will benefit from this important USDA funding."
   "This money will literally breathe fresh air into our facility," said Gene Nelson, CEO of St. Luke's Lutheran Care Center. "The facility is over forty years old. We haven't had enough to keep up with the infrastructure. We're excited to bring it up to date."
   St. Luke's Lutheran Care Center, which sits on fifteen acres within Blue Earth's city limits, houses 137 skilled nursing home beds, adult and child daycare centers, and assisted-living apartments.
   USDA Rural Development recently administered over $4 million in grants and loans to four Minnesota towns and community projects. This funding is part of President Bush's efforts to spur economic development in rural areas of America.
