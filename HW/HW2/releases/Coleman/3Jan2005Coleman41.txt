SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON TSUNAMI DISASTER
  "On December 26, a terrible earthquake triggered tsunamis in the Indian Ocean, shattering lives in countries such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, reeking havoc from the Malay Peninsula to East Africa and countless islands in between.  
 It has been reported that more than 100,000 people have been killed by this terrible disaster and my sympathies and prayers go out to the victims and their grieving families. We also pray for the safe return of those still missing. The American flag will fly at half staff this week to honor the victims of this terrible disaster. 
   I am pleased that America has responded quickly and generously to help those afflicted. The United States has pledged $350 million in relief assistance and $15 million has already been distributed to relief organizations in affected countries. 
   My heart is broken, along with the hearts of my fellow Minnesotans, but my resolve to help quickly and effectively is steadfast. That is why I will be traveling with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to India to assess the situation firsthand. I believe American lawmakers need to get to the affected region right away to find ways America can come to the rescue. The suffering in Southern Asia is deep and widespread and so too must be America's response. 
   Those countries hit by the tsunamis in Southern Asia have a long road to recovery, and America will be there to help every step of the way."
