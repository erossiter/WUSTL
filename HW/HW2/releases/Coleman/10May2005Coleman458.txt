SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES UNANIMOUS PASSAGE OF $82 BILLION EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman announced today that the U.S. Senate has unanimously passed an $82 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill to support American troops in the War on Terror, as well as provide relief to Tsunami-hit regions of Southeast Asia.  
   "I'm pleased that senators on both sides of the aisle recognize the importance of passing today's emergency supplemental bill," said Coleman. "It remains our priority to fully fund our men and women in the armed forces as they work to protect the U.S. in the War on Terror. Our goal is to make sure that our soldiers can successfully carry out their mission and return home safely. It was also essential that we do what we can to extend humanitarian aid where it is needed, especially to those regions hardest hit by the Tsunami. I am also pleased with the inclusion of increased funding for food assistance, and aid for the Darfur region of Sudan. Today's unanimous passage reflects the commitment the U.S. has towards funding our troops and to providing humanitarian aid to those who need it most." 
   In addition to providing resources to troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and providing $900 million for Tsunami relief, today's emergency supplemental also increases the survivor benefit to servicemen and women killed in combat zones from 12,000 to 100,000 to help families better cope financially."
