SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $549,000 FOR CITY OF KENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Kent has received a combined $549,000 in funding from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to improve the city's water treatment by constructing wastewater collection treatment lines and a force main to connect to the wastewater treatment facility in Abercrombie, North Dakota. Specifically, Kent will receive a grant of $354,000 and a loan of $195,000 for the project.  
   "Across rural Minnesota, numerous wastewater treatment systems are in dire need of improvement," said Coleman. "With a small tax base common to most rural communities, funding improvements for these systems is difficult - which is why programs like this are so important. The USDA Rural Development funding for Kent will go a long way towards helping local residents, and I am pleased this funding has been awarded to this community." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
