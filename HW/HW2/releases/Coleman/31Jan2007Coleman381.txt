SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FARM BILL
  STATEMENT FROM NORM COLEMAN ON THE FARM BILL: 
  "Today, the Administration declared in its Farm Bill proposal that it supports maintaining marketing loans, countercyclical support, and direct payments as part of a comprehensive safety net. Support was also issued for current U.S. sugar policy, an extension of the MILC program, and greater funding for conservation, rural development, and renewable fuels. The Administration also declared its support for an increased budget to accomplish many of these important objectives. While I support these overarching policy goals, that is where my support for the Administration proposal ends. Unfortunately, there are deep cuts and harmful changes to every commodity under the Farm Bill safety-net, as well as to the Federal Crop Insurance Program, that would hurt Minnesota's rural communities and cost our state jobs. 
   While I appreciate the gestures made toward conservation, rural development, and renewable fuels, overall they too fall well short of the mark in meeting objectives set by members of Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee in effectively meeting the needs of U.S. farmers and ranchers, rural communities, the nutrition needs of children and low income Americans, conservation, and the energy needs of a nation too long and much too dependent on foreign oil."
