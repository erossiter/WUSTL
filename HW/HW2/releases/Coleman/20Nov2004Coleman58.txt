SEN. COLEMAN SECURES FUNDING IN FY 2005 OMNIBUS TO FIGHT METHAMPHETAMINE IN MINNESOTA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that he was successful in securing $200,000 for the State of Minnesota's Methamphetamine Hot Spots Initiative in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill that Congress will pass later today.  
 Coleman hosted listening sessions regarding methamphetamine use on May 14 of this year in both Fergus Falls and St. Paul.
   "The methamphetamine epidemic affecting our state and nation is serious and I know firsthand how great the need is to battle this dangerous drug aggressively," Coleman said. "Minnesota's Hot Spot Initiative is an invaluable weapon and I was proud to fight to fund this worthy program."
   The Hot Spot program concentrates on a variety of law enforcement initiatives pertaining to the investigation of methamphetamine trafficking and addresses such challenges as the discovery, interdiction, and dismantling of drug laboratories. In 2001, Minnesota state agencies created the Minnesota Multi-Agencies Methamphetamine Taskforce in conjunction with the state's Bureau of Criminal Activity (BCA) and Department of Public Safety in order to respond to the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine in Minnesota. The taskforce focuses on five areas: 1) law enforcement, 2) education and awareness, 3) child protection, 4) cleanup, removal, and remediation, and 5) prevention and treatment.
   These funds Coleman secured will enhance the lab response staff capacity, increase law enforcement staff, purchase and maintain necessary equipment, provide for medical surveillance, fund BCA education and awareness materials, and fund the Minnesota Department of Health's local staff training and public awareness program.
