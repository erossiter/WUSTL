SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ANDREW CARD
  Andy Card has been a steady and trusted advisor who has served President Bush and our nation with honor and distinction through some of the most trying and turbulent days in the White House. Public service is a demanding job even during the best of times and I greatly admire Mr. Card's selfless dedication and service as our nation's longest serving Chief of Staff. His successor, Josh Bolten, has served honorably at some of the highest levels of government, and my hope is that he will help provide the fresh ideas and leadership to help the President serve the best interests of the American people.
