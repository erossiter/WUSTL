SEN. COLEMAN: PRO-GROWTH POLICIES FUELING BOOMING ECONOMY, ADDING JOBS
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the recent economic and jobs numbers released by the Department of Labor, calling it proof that pro-growth policies are working as they continue to expand the economy and create jobs for the American people. According to the most recent government figures, 211,000 jobs were created in the month of March, and the economy has now added 5.1 million jobs since the President's pro-growth tax policies were implemented in May 2003. The unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 percent to 4.7 percent - a 4 ? year low - and the U.S. economy has now experienced 31 consecutive months of job growth.  
   "It is great to see the numbers add up," said Coleman. "More Americans and college grads are finding their way into the workforce, showing an increased confidence by employers in our economy. Economic numbers haven't looked this good in decades, and it's important that we continue working hard until every American has economic security and the opportunity for a good-paying job." 
   Prior to the release of today's report economists had forecasted a gain of 190,000 jobs and believed the unemployment rate would remain at February's level of 4.8 percent. Experts believe these stronger-than-expected numbers reflect employers' willingness to add to their payroll with the confidence of sustained economic growth. 
   "These latest numbers are all the more proof that the President's pro-growth tax policies are working and need to be extended," Coleman said. "In addition to growing jobs, they are ensuring that Americans continue to have their own money to spend, save and invest. It is this idea of letting Americans decide how to spend their own money that has fueled two-and-a-half years of job creation and economic growth."
