SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE FROM THIEF RIVER FALLS TO MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL WILL CONTINUE
  After committing to help address the need for essential air service between Thief River Falls and Minneapolis-St. Paul that he heard about during a visit to Thief River Falls last fall, Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the U.S. Department of Transportation for their decision today to extend service between the cities. As a result of the decision, Mesaba Aviation will continue essential air service by providing 12 one-stop round trips per week to Minneapolis-St. Paul from Thief River Falls from now through June 1, 2009.  
   "From Arctic Cat to DigiKey, Thief River Falls is one of our great regional hubs in terms of economic development," said Coleman. "During my most recent visit to Thief River Falls, I heard firsthand about the critical need for continued essential air service to the Twin Cities. I committed to working on this issue at that meeting, and I am very excited that the Department of Transportation recognized the need for this continued service today." 
   Last week, Sen. Coleman sent a letter to Mr. Dennis J. DeVany, Chief of Essential Air Service Division, U.S. Department of Transportation, requesting that the City of Thief River Falls receive "Essential Air Service" designation. Citing the dynamic community and businesses in Thief River Falls, Coleman wrote in support of Mayor Steve Nordhagen's request for additional air service between Thief River Falls Regional Airport and Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. 
   Service will be provided with 34-seat Saab 340 aircraft. Mesaba Aviation has been providing service to the community of Thief River Falls since the 1980's. Mesaba has an agreement with Northwest Airlines that allows passengers from Thief River Falls to make on-line connections to the national air transportation system.
