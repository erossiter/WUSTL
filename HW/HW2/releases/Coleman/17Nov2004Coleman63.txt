SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT RESPONDING TO RECEIPT OF LETTER FROM PAUL VOLCKER
  "In my phone conversation with Paul Volcker on Tuesday, I was assured that any efforts to thwart our investigation, or prevent my staff from interviewing witnesses, would come to an end. The letter I received from Mr. Volcker, while not directly acknowledging those assurances, offers a positive step forward to ensuring that we get to the bottom of the OFF quagmire that threatens the integrity of the UN. My subcommittee will continue to aggressively pursue this investigation, and I anticipate any effort to create obstacles to this investigation will cease to exist."
