SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEMORIAL DAY
  "As we celebrate another Memorial Day, it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to pause and reflect on the freedoms we share thanks to generations of American veterans and servicemembers. From the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, our brave men and women of the armed forces have always stood up when their nation has called. It is important that we never forget the sacrifices that have been and continue to be made by each of our servicemembers and their families. As we look ahead to the return of thousands of Minnesotans in the next few months, it will be critical that we show them our sincere appreciation by doing all we can to ensure a smooth transition to life back at home."
