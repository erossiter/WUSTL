SEN. COLEMAN REACTS TO DECISION BY DISTRICT JUDGE ON PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
  Sen. Coleman reacts to decision by U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton on Pledge of Allegiance:
   "I completely reject U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton's recent decision declaring the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools as unconstitutional. For generations, Americans have proudly recited The Pledge of Allegiance, and we should continue to embrace that strong tradition. Americans from across a very broad spectrum will join me and my colleagues in rejecting this decision. It is out of the mainstream of thinking and the culture and values that we hold as Americans."
