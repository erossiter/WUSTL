SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES HIRING OF NEW MINNESOTA PRESS SECRETARY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the hiring of Luke Friedrich to the position of Minnesota Press Secretary in Coleman's St. Paul Office, effective immediately. Friedrich previously served in Coleman's office in 2004 as a caseworker, where he handled a variety of constituent service duties. He was recently rehired after working in the Media Department for the Minnesota Senate Republican Caucus. He replaces Andrea Wuebker, who now serves as Press Secretary in Senator Coleman's Washington office.  
   "I am pleased to have Luke rejoin my Senate Office" said Coleman. "In his previous role as a caseworker, Luke got a good sense of the needs, concerns and key issues affecting my constituents. That experience will help Luke pick up where he left off in serving Minnesotans and the media they depend on for information on what we're doing to help improve their communities, economic opportunities and quality of life." 
   In his new position, Friedrich will handle a number of press-related duties, serve as a contact liaison for Minnesota media outlets and will be responsible for expanding Coleman's media outreach throughout the state. He will work under the direction of Communications Director Tom Steward. 
   "Luke knows this state and Senator Coleman's priorities and we are pleased to have him back on staff," Steward said. "Luke grew up in Greater Minnesota and will spend much of his time making sure local media outside the Twin Cities receive the information and attention they need and deserve in a timely fashion." 
   "I am honored to have the opportunity to work for Senator Coleman again," Friedrich said. "Through my previous work with the Senator's office, I have seen firsthand the commitment Senator Coleman has to his constituents and the state of Minnesota. I am excited to work with our local media to help address the specific concerns of constituents across the state."
