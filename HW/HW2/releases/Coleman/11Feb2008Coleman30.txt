SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF REP. LANTOS
  "Congress and the entire nation lost a great public servant and an inspiring symbol of the American dream with the passing of Representative Tom Lantos. As a Holocaust survivor and one of the loudest voices in Congress for human rights, Representative Lantos dedicated his life to protecting the cherished freedoms we as Americans enjoy - freedoms he knew from his own life experience must never be taken for granted. As a member of the Jewish faith, his extraordinary life story has served as an inspiration to me, and I extend my sympathies and prayers to his wife and family."
