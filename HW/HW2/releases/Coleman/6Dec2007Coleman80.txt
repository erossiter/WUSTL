SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE'S PASSAGE OF ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF BILL
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement on the Senate's passage of the Alternative Minimum Tax bill, which passed tonight by a vote of 88-5:  
   "I proudly supported tonight's passage of AMT relief legislation to protect hard-working Minnesota families from a tax never intended for them. Failing to pass AMT relief was simply not an option, as 25 million taxpayers would have been hit with an average tax increase of $2,000 without this relief. I applaud the Senate for coming together to pass this bill to protect Minnesota's middle class."
