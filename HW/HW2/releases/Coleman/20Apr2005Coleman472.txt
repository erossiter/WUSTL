SENATE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN COAUTHORED AMENDMENT TO INCREASE NUMBER OF TEMPORARY WORKER VISAS CRUCIAL TO NORTHERN MINNESOTA ECONOMY
  Yesterday, the United States Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen.  
 Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and coauthored by Sen. Coleman (R-MN), to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for military funding that would improve the H2-B visa program. The amendment passed by a vote of 94-6 and would split up the allocation of visas throughout the fiscal year so that employers in northern states who need seasonal workers during the latter months of the fiscal year are no longer put at a disadvantage. The bill also makes it so that temporary workers who received visas during the last three years are not counted against the annual numerical limit. The measure is limited to two years, however, so a more permanent approach will need to be explored at a later time. 
   "In my travels throughout northern Minnesota, I hear time and time again from folks like Marvin Windows about the need for an increase in H-2B temporary worker visas," Coleman said. "This amendment would provide a temporary fix for this problem which has been stifling Minnesota's northern economy. I am committed to working on a long-term solution to this problem." 
   Last year, Minnesota employers who relied on the H-2B visas for summertime seasonal workers were shut out of the application process because the limit available nationwide was reached by other states in the spring. The amendment would provide much-needed relief to Minnesota's manufacturing, tourism, construction, and forestry industries. In 2004, Coleman also proposed legislation to help northern Minnesota have better access to H-2B visas.
