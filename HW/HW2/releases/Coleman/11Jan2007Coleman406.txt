SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MINNESOTA GUARD EXTENSION
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON MINNESOTA GUARD EXTENSION: 
   I disagree with the President's decision to provide a troop surge in Baghdad. My concern about a troop surge is compounded by the impact it will have on Minnesota National Guard troops in Iraq and their families here at home. I am extremely disappointed by the news that our National Guard soldiers in Iraq will have their tour of duty extended. When I visited them a few weeks ago in Iraq, they were excited about coming home in March. At a time when our National Guard troops and families are making the ultimate commitment to serve our country and defend our freedom, they deserve better than to be told only a short time before their scheduled return that their service is being extended.
