SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS IN ANBAR PROVINCE
  "The announcement that U.S forces could turn over security of Anbar Province within the next four months to Iraqi forces as the situation on the ground improves is a testament to the effectiveness of the surge. Since its implementation, al-Qaeda has lost its stranglehold on the region and influence with the local Sunni leaders and residents. The security gains we are making are laying the groundwork for Iraqis to step into the leadership role they need to be in to control their country's future. Most importantly, this news brings us closer to the goal of a change in mission for our troops by the end of this year, into a supporting role as Iraqis take the lead in security."
