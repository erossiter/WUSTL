SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $26,030 FOR WATERTOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Watertown Fire Department has been awarded a $26,030 grant under the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The funding will be used to purchase a thermal imaging camera, air rescue bags, stabilization bars and two portable radios for the department.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for providing this important funding to help protect the folks in and around Watertown," said Coleman. "Local firefighters are often the first line of safety for their communities, and it is critical they have the best resources available. With the help of this new equipment, Watertown's firefighters will be better suited to protect their neighbors, and I am pleased they have received this important grant." 
   "It's great when the federal government is able to help us on the local level with programs like this," said Watertown Fire Chief Hubie Widmer. "Our fire department covers areas in three counties, and the new equipment we are able to buy with this money will be a big plus for firefighter and citizen safety." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
