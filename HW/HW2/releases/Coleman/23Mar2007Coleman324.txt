SEN. COLEMAN SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING AMENDMENT TO HELP VETERANS BUY HOMES
  Sen. Norm Coleman today successfully attached his amendment to the Senate FY 2008 budget resolution, which would extend a provision that allows veterans to qualify for a program that provides low-income individuals with access to mortgages with lower interest costs. States operate these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond programs only for first-time homebuyers. However, a provision in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006-which is set to expire on January 1, 2008 - allows veterans to qualify for this program even if they are not first-time homebuyers. Coleman's amendment would extend that provision to December 31, 2012.  
   "Given the sacrifices that our veterans have made in the service of this country, it is imperative that we help them and their families get back on their feet when they come back home," said Coleman. "Even if they are not first-time home owners, many veterans may be starting over after their tour of duty. We should give them the opportunities they deserve, and it is extremely important to extend this provision to make veterans eligible for this financial assistance." 
   As part of his commitment our nation's troops, Senator Coleman hosted listening sessions on March 17, in Moorhead and Hibbing with veterans, returning servicemembers and their families to ensure they are receiving the support and health care they deserve when returning home.
