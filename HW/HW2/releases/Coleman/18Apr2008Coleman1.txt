SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES SOUTH KOREA'S DECISION TO RESUME AMERICAN BEEF IMPORTS
  Senator Norm Coleman made the following statement regarding South Korea reopening their market to U.S. beef, which had been suspended since 2003: 
   "I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen South Korea to American beef, and finally, today we have news to celebrate. South Korea has the potential to be the one of the largest export markets for our cattlemen - this is a real victory for Minnesota's cattlemen. As a premier provider of safe, affordable and abundant beef, Minnesota's cattle industry plays a key role in maintaining Minnesota's economy and feeding the world, and I will continue to fight to expand access for Minnesota's hard working farmers to the global marketplace."
   Previously, Coleman joined 30 of his Senate colleagues in sending a letter to President Roh requesting his personal attention in resolving the prolonged embargo on American beef. The letter stressed that further delays could potentially endanger a future Free Trade Agreements between the Untied States and Korea. While the Koreans resumed the importation of boneless beef on September 7, 2008, recent rejections of three separate shipments of US beef due to the inclusion of miniscule amounts of bone and cartilage clearly indicates the Koreans have no intention of giving our producers and processors commercially meaningful access to their market.
