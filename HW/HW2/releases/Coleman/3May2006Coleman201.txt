SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $1,893,000 FOR CITY OF BARRETT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Barrett has received a $1,642,000 loan and a $251,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to update existing wastewater and storm sewer systems in the city.  
   "I am excited to announce Barrett will receive this funding," said Coleman. "Barrett, like other cities in Grant County and across the state, faces significant challenges in updating infrastructure such as wastewater treatment systems without having the benefit of a large tax base to help cover the costs. To help address these types of challenges, I am continuing to push my Rural Renaissance Act through Congress. This bill would infuse dollars into rural infrastructure projects, and is modeled closely after the success of the USDA Rural Development program, which deserves praise for continuing to award these grants in communities such as Barrett." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $3 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
