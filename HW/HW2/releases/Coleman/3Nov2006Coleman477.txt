OCTOBER JOBS REPORT SHOWS CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman applauded today's Labor Department October jobs' report showing 92,000 new jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent - the lowest since April 2001. October marks the 38 straight month of job growth during which time more than 6.8 million new jobs have been created. During the past three months alone, 470,000 new jobs have been created. Wages have also increased impressively, with weekly earnings increasing by 4.2 percent during the past year.  
   "The fact that our nation's unemployment rate has reached a five-year low is by no accident. These figures are further proof that Republican pro-growth policies are working and that our economy is in good shape," Coleman said. "Looking forward, it will be critical that we do not reverse the economic policies that have helped to produce today's strong job and wage growth. My Democratic colleagues have intentions of undoing what we have worked so hard for - helping to create good paying jobs for Americans. Keeping in place pro-growth economic policies means continued success for the American future." 
   Also announced in the report were major upward revisions to the previously recorded September and August jobs figures. According to the report, 148,000 jobs were created in September and 230,000 in August as opposed to the initial report of 51,000 and 188,000 respectively.
