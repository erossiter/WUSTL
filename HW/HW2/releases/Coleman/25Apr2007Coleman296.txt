JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PASSES SENS. COLEMAN-KENNEDY-KYL TERRORISM HOAX BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the Senate Judiciary Committee's passage of legislation aimed at preventing the perpetration of terrorism hoaxes. The legislation, which Coleman introduced with Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ), would impose stricter penalties on those who make terrorist threats or commit stunts intended to resemble terror plots, as well as expand the definition of prosecutable offenses. The bill now heads to the Senate floor for consideration.  
   "We need to send a clear message to those planning a terrorism hoax that they will pay for it dearly by spending a number of years in prison," said Coleman. "Terrorizing the public through false threats is not a joke and should be treated as criminal conduct. The threats may be fake but the consequences are very real in costs to first responders, lost revenues and sometimes the loss of human life." 
   Current federal statute broadly defines the list of punishable terrorist hoaxes and does not include fraudulent terrorist acts such as hoaxes to blow up energy facilities, attacks on military bases or attacks on railways and mass transportation facilities. This legislation seeks to fill these gaps by expanding the hoax statute to punish hoaxes involving any offense included on the U.S. Code's official list of federal terrorist offenses. Specifically, the bill: 
   * Expands on the current terrorism hoax statute so it punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense on the U.S. Code's official list of terrorist offenses; 
   * Increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes about the death or injury of a U.S. soldier during wartime; 
   * Expands current law's civil liability provisions to allow first responders and others to seek reimbursement from a party who perpetrates a hoax and becomes aware that first responders believe that a terrorist offense is taking place but fails to inform authorities that no such event has occurred; and 
   * Clarifies that threatening communications are punishable under federal law even if they are directed at an organization rather than a natural person. 
   The bill also increases the penalties for perpetrating a hoax about the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during wartime. Under the bill, the maximum penalty for such hoax would be 10 years' imprisonment, and a hoax resulting in serious bodily injury could be punished by up to 25 years' imprisonment. 
   "Given the September 2001 bomb threat to the Mall of America and the upcoming 2008 Republican Convention in St. Paul, this is a very important piece of legislation for the folks back home in Minnesota," said Coleman. "I will work hard for final passage of this bill to make certain that the resources of our state's first responders are not wasted on terrorist hoaxes."
