SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $864,000 FOR CITY OF GARY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Gary has received a $772,000 loan and a $92,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to construct a new wastewater collection and treatment system for the city.  
   "Gary, like other rural communities across the state, faces significant challenges in updating infrastructure such as wastewater treatment systems without a large tax base to cover the costs," said Coleman. "To help address these types of challenges, I am continuing to push my Rural Renaissance Act through Congress. This bill would infuse dollars into rural infrastructure projects, and is modeled closely after the success of the USDA Rural Development program, which deserves praise for continuing to support rural development projects across rural Minnesota." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $3 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
