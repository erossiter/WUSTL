  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman Regarding Indictments of Bayoil Officials
   "The indictments announced today by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York represent a significant step forward in exposing the abuses and criminal misconduct that occurred in the U.N. Oil-for-Food program. This is a significant step forward in bringing all of those to justice who helped prop up Saddam Hussein at a terrible cost to the Iraqi people, our allied forces, and the integrity of the U.N."
