SEN. COLEMAN APPLAUDS APPOINTMENT OF NEBRASKA GOV. JOHANNS AS NEW AGRICULTURE SECRETARY
  Sen. Norm Coleman, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and founder and co-chair of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, today applauded President Bush's appointment of Nebraska Gov.  
 Mike Johanns to be the next United States Secretary of Agriculture. Johanns will replace outgoing Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman. 
   "I'm very pleased with this appointment," Coleman said. "Mike Johanns is a good friend, and I'm looking forward to working closely with him to advance agriculture policy that is good for Minnesota farmers and ranchers. He brings with him conviction, competence, integrity, and a strong record of achievement to the job. The President made a fine pick." 
   The State of Minnesota is the 7th largest agricultural producer in the United States. Agriculture represents the second largest economic sector and employer in the state.
