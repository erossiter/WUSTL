SEN. COLEMAN ON ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING NOMINATION OF AMBASSADOR BOLTON
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON THE NOMINATION OF JOHN BOLTON: 
   "Blocking the nomination of Ambassador Bolton is a case study in partisan excess. To undermine the United States' representation at the United Nations at this critical moment in history is misguided and unfortunate. John Bolton provides us a strong, vigorous voice at the United Nations, making sure that our nation's concerns are not only being heard, but that legitimate issues of U.N. reform are being addressed with more than just lip service. In a world that needs a vibrant and credible United Nations, we need a strong and credible voice speaking for the United States and the UN: John Bolton is that voice. I urge my Democratic colleagues to reconsider actions that may well lead to diminishing America's voice at the U.N. at a crucial time in our history. We must have an up or down vote on Ambassador Bolton in the Senate."
