SENATE PASSES IDEA REAUTHORIZATION, ENSURING QUALITY EDUCATION FOR DISABLED CHILDREN
 The Senate voted 95-3 to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Sen.  
 Norm Coleman announced Thursday. Coleman said the legislation not only ensures that children with disabilities have access to a quality education, but also makes much-needed reforms. 
   "I am proud of the Senate for working in a bipartisan manner to craft this important legislation," Coleman said. "The new law makes important reforms which allow teachers to focus on teaching children, and also helps schools properly identify children with learning disabilities." 
   Despite his pleasure with the reauthorization, Coleman was disappointed with the Senate's failure to pass an amendment he cosponsored Wednesday which would have ensured that the program reached full federal funding by 2011. 
   "Congress' failure to fully fund IDEA unfairly burdens school districts - particularly those in rural areas," Coleman said. "I will continue to fight for full funding, and will not be discouraged by this temporary setback." 
   The Senate narrowly rejected the amendment in a 56-41 vote Wednesday - just four votes shy of the 3/5 majority needed. The amendment would have increased IDEA funding by $2.2 billion per year, ensuring full federal funding by 2011. Currently, the government funds only 19 percent of program costs, which Coleman said places an unfair burden on tight school budgets. 
   Coleman was pleased with the bill's passage, but a family funeral in Minnesota kept him from casting his vote.
