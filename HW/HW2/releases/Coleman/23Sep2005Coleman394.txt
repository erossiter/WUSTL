  "I am proud to support Ben Whitney to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Norway. I have never been hesitant to express my support for Mr. Whitney to the Administration and I am pleased that he has been officially nominated for this post. I have known Ben for a long time and over the years, he has shown remarkable success in a number of endeavors. I am confident he will be equally successful as Ambassador. His intelligence, experience and integrity will serve Americans well and I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to support his nomination."
