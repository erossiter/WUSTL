SEN. COLEMAN REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON KATRINA
  Sen. Norm Coleman's statement:
   Hurricane Katrina is the most devastating natural disaster ever to strike the United States and more than anything else, tonight the President offered what the residents on the Gulf Coast needed most: hope.  
 While the government fumbled in its emergency response during the immediate aftermath of the hurricane's destruction, the President has picked up the ball to construct a vision for the region and its residents that is positive and promising. What is needed now is strong leadership, and although the President outlined great revitalization efforts such as disaster zone and tax incentives, worker recovery accounts that allow for education, child care, and workforce training, and urban homesteading, my only disappointment is that a key leadership position to coordinate, oversee, and implement a well-planned approach for rebuilding the Gulf Coast is missing. The fact remains, however, that one of the most noble and admirable characteristics of the American spirit is the will to emerge from crises and tragedies better than ever, and I look forward to working with President Bush and his administration to help the build a stronger Gulf region and a stronger America.
