SENATE PASSES SEN. COLEMAN'S AMENDMENT TO PREVENT U.S. FUNDING TO U.N. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM UNTIL IMPLEMENTATION OF WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION
  The United States Senate this evening unanimously passed an amendment authored by Senator Norm Coleman to the FY08 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to prevent the disbursement of funding to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) until it adopts a whistleblower protection policy. Up to this point, the UNDP has refused to grant employees this protection through the U.N. Ethics Office and declared that the Ethics Office has no jurisdiction over its activities. Recently, two UNDP employees have been denied whistleblower protection, both claiming they have been fired after bringing to light allegations of fraud.  
   "I am deeply troubled with the lack of whistleblower protection regulations at the UNDP," said Coleman. "As it stands, the UNDP has unilaterally decided that the U.N. Ethics Office has no jurisdiction over UNDP, and with passage of my amendment, we are one step closer to bringing protection to UNDP employees who are vulnerable to retaliation for conscientiously reporting misconduct. Without question, the lack of a whistleblower protection policy has a chilling effect on UNDP's employees and their willingness to expose wrongdoing in the organization. This greatly undermines transparency at UNDP, which is sorely needed in light of recent scandals. The UNDP manages extensive resources, and my amendment will require the UNDP to institute a whistleblower protection policy before funding to the UNDP can be disbursed in order to promote accountability." 
   In 2006, the U.S. contributed nearly $245 million to the UNDP. The U.S. is the third highest contributor after Spain and England. Senator Coleman currently serves as one of two official Congressional Delegates to the United Nations.
