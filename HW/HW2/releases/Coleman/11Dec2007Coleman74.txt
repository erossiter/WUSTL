SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON NORTHSTAR RAIL PROJECT
  "Today's remarkable event once again proves the power of dreaming new dreams and working together as partners. A decade ago, Northstar was just a dream and a line on a map. But over the course of time, this project brought business, government, non-profits and citizens together under a shared vision for a better transportation future. Today our dream of a new commuter rail line in the Twin Cities becomes a reality, and I look forward to riding the rails in the near future."
