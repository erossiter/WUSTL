SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GAY MARRIAGE
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. COLEMAN ON GAY MARRIAGE  
  "I support the principle, and existing federal law, that marriage is meant to be between a man and a woman.  
 I do so with the hope that this debate does not serve to generate intolerance or discrimination. 
   The Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996 by huge bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Clinton, states that, as far as the federal government is concerned, "the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and that no state shall be forced to recognize the meaning of marriage determined by another. I support the spirit of this legislation because it seeks both to protect the institution of marriage while at the same time respecting the sovereignty of the states. This is a good law. 
   Nevertheless, as President Bush stated in January, activist judges have begun to chisel away at the legal definition of this cultural institution. If a state's legislature defines marriage as between a man and a woman, the citizens of that state should not be forced to accept the dictates of a Massachusetts judiciary that believes otherwise. 
   That is why I believe that the time has come for the Defense of Marriage Act to be officially ground into the impenetrable legal foundation that is the United States Constitution. I believe the Constitution will be amended on the question of marriage: the real question before us is whether it will be amended by unelected judges insistent upon overstepping their constitutional authority or by the true source of sovereignty in the United States, the American people."
