SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $5.9 MILLION FOR CITY OF WATKINS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Watkins has received a $4,771,000 loan and a $1,172,500 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. These rural development funds will be used to replace the city's existing wastewater collection system, storm water collection system, and water distribution system.  
   "Thanks to the USDA's Rural Development program, rural communities like Watkins are now able to replace basic infrastructure such as wastewater collection and water distribution systems," said Coleman. "With a small tax base common to most rural communities, funding improvements for these systems is difficult - which is why programs like this are so important. The USDA Rural Development funding for Watkins will go a long way towards helping local residents, and I am pleased this funding has been awarded to this community." 
   "In speaking for the citizens of Watkins, I would like to express our profound thanks to the federal government for putting forth the funds for this project," said Watkins City Administrator Lynn Hokanson. "These funds will allow us to replace our city water and sewer infrastructure. It will also help to clean up some of the city's pollution and keep our city running effectively." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $3 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
