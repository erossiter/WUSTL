SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR FLOOD RECOVERY IN SOUTHEASTERN MINNESOTA
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Labor has awarded the final $2 million of a National Emergency Grant to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) for flood recovery efforts in Southeast Minnesota following last summer's devastating flooding. The first $1 million of the $3 million grant was awarded last September, and today's award will be used to continue funding temporary jobs for eligible dislocated workers to assist in clean-up, restoration and recovery efforts in the region. 
   "The flood waters have long since receded, but the recovery efforts are far from over for the residents and communities of Southeast Minnesota," said Coleman. "I have fought long and hard for a strong federal response to this terrible disaster, and this grant from the Department of Labor has played an important role in assisting with the recovery effort. I am pleased to see the final $2 million on its way to the folks in the region as we continue working to recover from the effects of the floods."
   The National Emergency Grant application is available for the counties of Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Steele, Wabasha and Winona. The emergency funds were targeted for temporary employment on projects for the clean-up, demolition, repair, renovation and/or reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities, and lands within the affected communities. Funds can also be used to provide core, intensive and retraining services upon completion of the temporary jobs component for participants who cannot return to work.
