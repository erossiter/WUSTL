SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FIRE DEPARTMENT GRANTS FOR CENTER CITY, HOLDINGFORD
  Sen. Coleman today announced the awarding of a $26,599 grant for the Center City Fire Department and a $62,538 grant for the Holdingford Volunteer Fire Department. The grants, administered under the federal Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) program, will be used to help the respective fire departments improve local fire operations and safety  
   "These grants will help ensure the safety of both the citizens and firefighters of Center City and Holdingford," said Coleman. "Across Greater Minnesota, local fire departments are comprised of volunteers who risk their lives to protect their neighbors. It is critical that they have the best resources possible, and I applaud the AFG program and these individual fire departments for their combined efforts in making sure the residents of these communities are well-protected." 
   The AFG program provides financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of firefighting operations, firefighter health and safety programs, and to establish or expand fire prevention programs throughout the United States. The program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
