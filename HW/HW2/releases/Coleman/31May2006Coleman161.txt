SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING: 
   Today's announcement that Minnesota's Homeland Security Grant Program funding had been cut by over $18 million to a total of only $13.39 million is very troubling. Minnesota has a wide range of Homeland Security interests given that we share an international border, we have two major cities, we have two nuclear reactors, and a major port. These funding cuts are unacceptable and irresponsible. It is simply unrealistic to expect states to effectively plan ahead without providing some certainty on the funding they can expect to receive. As a remedy, I have supported legislation that would ensure continuity and accountability in terms of how money is distributed to both cities and states. We need long term solutions to ensure money is consistently distributed where it is need most - for the sake of Minnesota's and the nation's security.
