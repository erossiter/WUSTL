SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $830,000 FOR CITY OF QUAMBA
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Quamba has received a $615,000 grant and a $215,000 loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The combined Rural Development funds will be used to construct a new regionalized wastewater collection and transmission system for the community, with final wastewater treatment and disposal to be completed by the city of Mora.  
   "I am excited to announce that the City of Quamba has received this funding," said Coleman. "These USDA Rural Development funds will help to improve Quamba's wastewater needs by constructing and updating the city's collection, transmission, and treatment systems. I am pleased the USDA Rural Development program recognized the need for improved wastewater treatment in Quamba and for their continued support of Minnesota's rural communities." 
   Under the expansion plans, the City of Quamba will use a portion of the excess capacity in Mora's treatment plant to help meet Quamba's wastewater treatment needs. Quamba has a contract to pay Mora an annual fee for this usage. 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2.5 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
