SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES SENATE PASSAGE OF LABOR, HHS, AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced Senate passage of the FY 2006 Labor, Health and Human Service, and Education Appropriations conference report (HR 3010) that provides $601.6 billion in funding for over 300 programs, spanning three federal departments. The conference report passed the Senate last night and currently awaits the President's signature.  
   "The Senate worked hard to provide a balanced version of this bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in October," said Coleman. "Though the final conference report does not reflect some of the victories that the original Senate bill provided, it provides sufficient funding for basic education, job skills training, health care, and early childhood development programs." 
   Coleman expressed concerns that a failure to pass the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations conference report would have forced these critically important departments to be funded through a Continuing Resolution. Such a resolution would have extended funding at much lower levels than the conference report provides. 
   "This bill allows some of our nation's most important federal agencies and programs to continue providing services that are vital to the American people," added Coleman. "Without passage of this conference report, agencies and programs from Head Start to the National Institutes of Health would receive as much as $3 billion less, a decrease that I found unacceptable." 
   This measure also contains $161.68 million in funding for rural health initiatives such as the rural health flexibility grant program, rural health outreach grants, small hospital improvement program, telehealth and rural access to emergency devices program. Additionally, this bill will provide $61.7 million, an increase of $40.4 million from FY05, to develop health care technology. New technologies improve the healthcare system by reducing the length of hospital stay and rehabilitation, making procedures less invasive, and allowing procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis. 
   "It is important that we continue to improve the quality and productivity of our nation's health care system," said Coleman. "This bill meets the needs of our rural communities by increasing the funding for rural health initiatives by nearly $17 million. As chairman of the Senate Medical Technology Caucus, I will continue to encourage the development of health care technology. Innovation in this sector will help to reduce medical errors, improve quality of care, as well as reduce rising health care costs." 
   To assist our nation's college students, this bill also contains $13.18 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program. The Pell Grant program is the foundation for federal student aid and the nation's largest source of grant aid for post-secondary education, serving 5.1 millions students in 2003 alone. 
   "The subject of college education affordability resonates deeply in minds of Minnesota's working moms and dads, which is why I have fought hard to ease the burden on current students and increase access for prospective students," Coleman continued. "The funding in this bill, which is $812 million above last year, will go a long way toward helping Minnesota's 76,525 Pell Grant recipients."
