SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $26,938 FOR SOLWAY RURAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Solway Rural Volunteer Fire Department has been awarded a $26,938 grant under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program to fund operation and safety improvements.  
   "I applaud the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program for providing this important funding," said Coleman. "Across Greater Minnesota, local firefighters are on the frontlines of safety for their communities, and this grant will help benefit both the firefighters and residents in and around Solway." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
