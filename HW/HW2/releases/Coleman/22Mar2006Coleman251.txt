  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that two state run veterans facilities in the cities of Hastings and Silver Bay have been awarded a total of $12,501,786 by United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to aid building improvements. The Minnesota Veterans Home in Hastings has been awarded two grants in the amounts of $5,400,498 and $5,266,355 to complete Phases II and II of their ongoing renovations, while the facility in Silver Bay will receive a $1,834,933 grant to replace an existing roof.  
   "I am pleased that the Veterans Homes in Hastings and Silver Bay will receive this funding to make the necessary improvements to their facilities," said Coleman. "Our veterans have made countless sacrifices to protect our freedoms, and it is our duty to provide them with the best resources available. I applaud the Administration for recognizing the needs of these vital Minnesota facilities, and I anxiously look forward to the completion of these projects." 
   "From our standpoint, this partnership between state and federal governments has allowed us to serve the needs of our veterans. This funding will be used to improve the local environment as well as the quality of life for our vets," said Stephan Musser, Executive Director, Minnesota Veteran Homes. 
   These VA grants represent 65% of the anticipated cost of construction. The State of Minnesota has guaranteed to fund the remaining balance.
