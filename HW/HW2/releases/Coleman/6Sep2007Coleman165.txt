SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL GRANT FOR DISPLACED WORKER PROGRAM, FLOOD RECOVERY IN SOUTHEASTERN MINNESOTA
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Labor has authorized a $3 million National Emergency Grant to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) for a displaced worker program in Southeast Minnesota following last month's devastating flooding. Specifically, the grant will fund approximately 300 temporary jobs for eligible dislocated workers to assist in clean-up and recovery efforts in the region. The first $1 million of the funding will be awarded to DEED, who will operate the program, in the next few days.  
   "A silver lining within the terrible devastation caused by the flooding in Southeast Minnesota is the strong response we have had at every level of government," said Coleman. "This grant from the Department of Labor will not only provide a major boost to ongoing recovery and clean-up efforts, it will also provide much-needed employment opportunities for affected workers- a true win-win for the region. I spoke with Secretary of Labor Chao about this grant earlier today and I thank her for the ongoing commitment of the federal government as we continue to recover from this disaster." 
   The National Emergency Grant application, approved by the Secretary of Labor, was originally submitted by the MN DEED on August 28th. Eligible counties include Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Steele, Wabasha and Winona. The emergency funds will be used for temporary employment on projects for the clean-up, demolition, repair, renovation and/or reconstruction of damaged and destroyed structures, facilities, and lands within the affected communities. Funds may also be used to provide core, intensive and retraining services upon completion of the temporary jobs component for participants who cannot return to work.
