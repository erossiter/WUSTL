SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS FOR CHIEF JUSTICE
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman:
   I am pleased that President Bush has nominated Judge John Roberts, Jr. as our 17th Chief Justice to the Supreme Court, filling the vacancy left by the passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  
 I cannot think of a better qualified person to fill the void of Chief Justice Rehnquist's strong service and dedication. Judge Roberts is a man of character, strong leadership, and jurisprudence. And above all, his nomination should be treated with the fairness, dignity and respect, which are the hallmarks of the nominee himself. While it is important for the country to pause and reflect upon the life and service of Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Senate must proceed swiftly on Roberts' confirmation before the Supreme Court opens its fall term on October 3rd. It is imperative that the country has a fully functioning third branch of government.
