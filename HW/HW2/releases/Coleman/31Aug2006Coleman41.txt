SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAN'S REJECTION OF U.N. DEADLINE
  Today marked the U.N. Security Council's deadline for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment activities under its nuclear program, and we have yet to see cooperation on the part of the Iranian government. Iran continues to defy the international community and has confirmed suspicions of their nuclear intentions by the recent unveiling of a heavy-water nuclear plant, which will complement their efforts to acquire fissile materials for bombs through uranium enrichment. The Security Council must now move forward by imposing sanctions. If Iran is to take us seriously and comply with its nuclear obligations, the threats from the Security Council must be backed by action. The urgency of the situation requires that we act immediately. If Iran is allowed to become a nuclear weapons state, stability in the region will be greatly compromised.
