SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES TENTATIVE SOLUTION FOR HMONG AFFECTED BY TERRORIST CLASSIFICATION
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that the Senate version of the 2007 Supplemental Appropriations bill contains a provision he has championed to address the negative unintended consequences of the "material support" bar. The material support language, which was enacted as part of the Real ID Act of 2004, broadened the definition of who is a terrorist based on "material support," making the Hmong and other ethnic groups ineligible for refugee status and other immigration-related adjustments. The language in the Supplemental Appropriations bill makes clear that Hmong and other groups should not be classified as terrorists, and therefore removes the penalties that had been in place. The Supplemental Appropriations bill is expected to be considered by the Senate this week. The House version, which passed last week, does not contain language on material support.  
   "Let me be perfectly clear: the Hmong should never be treated as terrorists," said Coleman. "Hmong refugees, who dedicated their service to America during the Vietnam War, have looked to the U.S. as a place of hope and a sanctuary from persecution. I have been fighting to change this law ever since I learned about its unintended consequences, and I am pleased that the Administration and my colleagues now agree that this matter needs to be resolved. As the Supplemental Appropriations bill advances, I will be working to ensure that this important provision ultimately becomes law." 
   Coleman was a principal author of an amendment last year with a similar intent. Senate Amendment 4117 was offered to last year's immigration bill (S. 2611), but was opposed by the Administration and defeated on the floor. In January 2007, however, the Administration publicly endorsed the need for a solution.
