SEN. COLEMAN UNVEILS COMPREHENSIVE RURAL HEALTH INITIATIVES
  Continuing his effort to enhance the quality and accessibility of Minnesota's rural healthcare services, Sen. Norm Coleman today unveiled a comprehensive rural health legislative agenda. His plan addresses the numerous challenges facing rural communities through a series of bills aimed at the shortage of rural health care personnel, the need for improved mental health services in rural communities, and the expansion of remote monitoring to make the most advanced healthcare more accessible. His agenda also focuses on the long-term sustainability of Critical Access Hospitals (CAH), rehabilitating dilapidated CAH buildings, and enabling those rural hospitals to better compete for funding to modernize their health information technology systems. 
   "With over a million Minnesotans in rural communities utilizing Critical Access Hospitals each year, we need a comprehensive approach to address the significant and unique challenges our rural hospitals face. The quality of your healthcare should not be a reflection your zipcode, and my rural healthcare agenda seeks to efficiently enhance the quality, affordability, and accessibility of healthcare in rural Minnesota," said Coleman. "Having traveled across this state, I know that our rural health system is one of the strongest in the country, and our critical access hospitals form the backbone of many Minnesota communities. This is a multi-faceted issue that merits a comprehensive strategy."  
   "This set of proposals reflects the deep understanding Senator Coleman has gained on his many visits to hospitals all over Minnesota. By learning first hand the health care needs of Minnesotans and the challenges providers face in meeting them, Senator Coleman has crafted policies that will benefit the entire nation," said Bruce J. Rueben, President, Minnesota Hospital Association. 
   "Senator Coleman's legislative package is an exceptional response to the most urgent needs of Minnesota's rural health care system," said Mark Schoenbaum, Director, Office of Rural Health and Primary Care, Minnesota Department of Health 
   "Patients in rural areas who suffer from chronic conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias often have to travel many miles to receive care. This bill helps physicians monitor and treat their patients outside the traditional office setting giving them a better picture of their health status in the real-world setting. It also provides better information that can lead to earlier, more accurate diagnoses and prevent costly hospital admissions," said Stephen J. Ubl, President and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed). 
   "The Minnesota Board on Aging recognizes the special needs and challenges in providing health and long-term care in rural communities - many of which have disproportionately high numbers of older residents. We are strong advocates for expanding the use of new telehealth technologies that allow remote patient monitoring and improve the quality of care, especially for older persons who are likely to have one or more chronic conditions. We also strongly support efforts to increase the supply of critical health care personnel in rural communities, particularly in the areas of nursing, physical therapy and mental health. These three services areas are essential components of long-term care needed by an older population," said Jeanette Metz, Chair of the Minnesota Board on Aging. 
   Critical Access Hospitals provide healthcare to more than 1.6 million Minnesotans in rural communities each year. Currently, there are 80 Critical Access Hospitals spread across Minnesota - the third largest number in the nation. On Friday, Senator Coleman will be traveling to Critical Access Hospitals in the cities of Pipestone, New Ulm, Sauk Centre, and Crookston to present his plan to local residents. Details of the schedule are forthcoming. 
   Senator Coleman's rural health agenda is comprised of the seven following bills: 
   *Rural Health Services Preservation Act: Given a growing disparity in access to health care in Greater Minnesota, this bill will ensure that Critical Access Hospitals are reimbursed at a rate that allows them to cover the costs of the important services they offer. 
   *Critical Access to Health Information Technology Act: Many rural hospitals in Minnesota and across the country lack the high numbers of personnel, patients, or money needed to compete with larger hospitals for federal funding. This legislation will help rural hospitals compete for federal health technology grants. 
   *Remote Monitoring Access Act: An estimated 40 percent of our rural population lives in a medically underserved area, with access to care an average of 30 miles or more away. Fortunately, promising new technologies that collect, analyze, and transmit clinical health information are coming on line. This bill would create a new benefit category for remote patient management services in the Medicare physician fee schedule. Initially, Medicare would cover treatment of congestive heart failure, diabetes, and cardiac arrhythmia with the option of covering additional conditions in the future. 
   *Rural Critical Access Hospital Reconstruction and Rehabilitation: To ensure the construction and maintenance of Critical Access Hospitals in vital areas of the state, this legislation will provide $1.6 billion allocated over five years for rural Critical Access Hospitals across the country. 
   *Cass County Critical Access Hospital: Currently, many Cass County residents are an hour's drive or more from the nearest hospital. This legislation will enable the City of Walker to build a CAH by cutting through the red tape requiring it to be a minimum of 35 miles from the nearest hospital. 
   *Rural Access to Mental Health and Wellness for Children and Seniors Act: Providing adequate mental healthcare in rural communities has become a national challenge. This legislation will establish federal grants to provide assistance to rural schools, hospitals, and communities to conduct collaborative efforts to secure a system to improve access to mental healthcare for youth, seniors, and families; and to increase access of elementary and secondary students to mental health services in rural areas by operating a mobile health services program and enhancing tele-mental health initiatives. 
   *Rural Nursing Promotion Act: One of the greatest challenges rural hospitals face is healthcare personnel shortages. This bill will create the Nurse Distance Education Pilot Program, an online program giving students in rural areas access to a nursing education. This program will also encourage institutions of higher learning to expand their current nursing programs or create new programs. It will also require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress possible solutions to the nursing and physical therapy shortage. Finally, this bill will add flexibility to allow more foreign nurses and physical therapists to help fill the current shortage in rural America.
