SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $437,000 FOR BECKER COUNTY DEVELOPMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT CENTER
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the Becker County Developmental Achievement Center has received a $437,000 loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Program. The loan is slated to be used to construct a 4,100 square foot addition to the center's existing facility. The new space will include four offices, as well as a work area, sensory area, conference and mechanical room. Sen. Coleman's office notified the organization of the award today.  
   "I am pleased the Becker County Developmental Achievement Center has been selected for this funding," said Coleman. "This low-interest loan will help them expand and improve their facilities, which will help them continue the great work they do for people with developmental disabilities. USDA Rural Development continues to help finance important projects throughout Greater Minnesota, and I applaud them for awarding this loan for folks in the Detroit Lakes area." 
   "Our 2007 building project will focus on growth in both the vocational and sensory integration areas," said Executive Director Dave Peterson. "Vocational aspects of day training and habilitation are not new, but are very beneficial in many areas. Vocational training can create opportunities to earn an income, and build and maintain skills to increase the ability to integrate into a community." 
   The purpose of the Becker County Developmental Achievement Center is to assist all people with differing abilities to reach their highest potential. The center offers a number of individualized programs for people with developmental disabilities including vocational training, community integration, sensory integration, and basic life skill preparation. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $4.3 billion into rural Minnesota for a number of improvements. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
