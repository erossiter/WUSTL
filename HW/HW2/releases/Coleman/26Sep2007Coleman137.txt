SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $27.8 MILLION COMBINED LOAN FOR MINNESOTA VALLEY ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE
  Senator Coleman today announced Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative, based in Jordan, Minnesota, has been awarded a guaranteed loan of $24,153,000 from USDA Rural Development, along with a U.S. Treasury loan for $3,728,000. The combined funding is slated to be used to finance the construction of nearly 200 miles of new electrical line, repair old line and provide electric power to over 7,000 new customers in Blue Earth, Waseca, Le Sueur, Carver, Rice, Scott, Dakota, Hennepin and Sibley counties.  
   "Economic development, whether you live in the metro area or in Greater Minnesota, hinges on infrastructure," Coleman said. "One of the most basic elements of infrastructure is electrical power, but the costs for major expansions like this are great. By providing these loans to help finance this major project, USDA Rural Development and the U.S. Treasury are doing a great service to the people of Minnesota who will benefit from this service - and I applaud them for awarding this funding." 
   USDA Rural Development's Electric Programs, which awarded the funding, provides resources to upgrade, expand, maintain, and replace America's vast rural electric infrastructure by making direct loans and loan guarantees to electric utilities to serve customers in rural areas. Loans are made to corporations, states, territories and subdivisions and agencies such as municipalities, people's utility districts, and cooperative, nonprofit, limited-dividend, or mutual associations that provide retail electric service needs to rural areas or supply the power needs of distribution borrowers in rural areas.
