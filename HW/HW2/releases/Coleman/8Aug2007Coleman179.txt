SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $64 MILLION IN DRUG PREVENTION FUNDING FOR MINNESOTA CITIES
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that ten Minnesota cities have been awarded a total of $64,174,725 in federal grants from the Drug Free Communities Support Program (DFC), which is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
