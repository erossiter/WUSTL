SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $210,425 FOR ELLSWORTH FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the Ellsworth Fire Department has received a $210,425 grant from the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program. The funding will be used in the purchase of a new fire truck for the department.  
   "I am pleased the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program has provided funding for the Ellsworth Fire Department to improve its emergency capabilities," said Coleman. "Local first responders are the first line of safety for community residents, and this grant will go a long way towards helping increase the safety of residents in and around Ellsworth." 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, administered within the Department of Homeland Security, is designed to provide resources for the firefighting and emergency response needs of fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical services organizations. The AFG program awards grants directly to local fire departments to support firefighters, first responders, and the services they deliver.
