SEN. COLEMAN HEARING REVEALS SADDAM BILKED BILLIONS MORE FROM U.N. SANCTIONS PROGRAMS THAN PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED
  In the first hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) on abuse of the U.N. Oil for Food (OFF) Program, Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) revealed that Saddam Hussein siphoned off far more illegal revenue by contravening the U.N. sanctions regime between 1991-2003 than previously reported, an estimated total of $21.3 billion. This estimate includes $6.7 billion of illicit income directly arising from abuses of the OFF Program, such as illegal kickbacks, surcharges, and substandard goods purchased under the OFF Program. An additional $13.7 billion came from a variety of oil smuggling schemes, while $800 million stemmed from sources left out of previous estimates by GAO and the Iraq Survey Group. 
   "The extent to which member states were motivated by Saddam's influence peddling to ignore the fraud and lack of oversight has still not been fully explored," Coleman said in his opening statement. "The question that hangs out there is, how high up does the corruption go? The extent to which U.N. officials personally benefited from Saddam's influence peddling has not been fully explored. We need substantially greater cooperation from the United Nations to answer these and other questions."
   The hearing, entitled How Saddam Hussein Abused the United Nations Oil for Food Program, laid out a paper trail exposing how Saddam turned oil into influence in an increasingly successful global scheme, generating billions of dollars to undermine U.N. sanctions and rebuild the regime's military capacity.
   Charles Duelfer, author of the Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraqi's WMD (the Duelfer Report), offered his first comprehensive testimony before Congress on the vast corruption and corrosive effect of the OFF Program. Mr. Deulfer testified that Saddam's primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have U.N. sanctions lifted and that the introduction of the OFF Program in late 1996 was a key turning point for the regime, bringing in hard currency that allowed influence peddling with the intention of undermining U.N. sanctions. The regime channeled much of these illicit funds to rebuild Iraq's military capabilities through the Military Industrialization Commission, or MIC procurement.
   Compiling evidence from more than one million pages of documents, the Subcommittee presented evidence showing the wide array of schemes designed to generate income free from the U.N.'s restrictions - from smuggling oil, to extracting kickbacks, to creating front companies.
   * Oil Vouchers-Saddam Hussein would personally distribute allocations of oil, which were in general terms an option to buy oil at a discounted price. The recipient of the allocation or voucher would negotiate with oil traders who would ultimately purchase the oil. In selling the allocation, the recipient would receive a healthy commission from the oil traders, ranging from 5 cents to 30 cents per barrel. Hussein would dole out these oil allocations to peddle influence and reward supporters throughout the world.
   * Surcharges on oil purchases-The Hussein regime would contract with a buyer for the purchase of oil at below-market prices. The regime, however, would require the purchaser to pay a surcharge directly to the Iraqi government through a bank account, a flagrant violation of the OFF Program.
   * Kickbacks-The most common kickbacks were called "after sales service fees," while lesser-known kickbacks were disguised as bogus charges for "transportation," "storage," or "spare parts." Hussein would demand that sellers of humanitarian goods pay these fees directly to the regime, outside the confines and in clear violation of the OFF Program. The typical kickback ranged from 10-20% of the value of the associated contract. After 2000, all humanitarian contractors were required to pay kickbacks on each deal.
   * Substandard Goods-Hussein would pay market prices for impotent medicines, expired food products, and tainted blood products and either (i) demand a kickback of the excess price, or (ii) let the seller keep the excess price as a reward for supporting his regime.
   Juan Carlos Zarate, Deputy Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of Treasury, testified on the urgent effort to identify and repatriate Iraqi assets in order to prevent the funds from reaching terrorists in Iraq. While Mr. Zarate said that any illicit assets that have not been frozen could conceivably be used to fuel the insurgency or the terrorist attacks in Iraq, he could not specifically state that OFF funds are being directly used to fund the current insurgency. Mr. Zarate has assembled an Insurgency Task Force comprised of the IRS, FBI and DOD to hunt for funds that may be inside Iraq. To date, Treasury and other U.S. agencies have identified and frozen almost $6 billion in Iraqi assets worldwide, mostly from the bank accounts of State Oil Marketing Organization.
   Coleman said his staff will continue to investigate the OFF Program during the course of the next several months.
