SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $6,100 GRANT FOR CITY OF FAIRFAX
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Fairfax has been awarded a $6,100 grant from United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will be used to help purchase a defibrillator machine.  
   "I am pleased the City of Fairfax was chosen to receive this funding," Coleman said. "With continuing advances in medical technology, much of which is taking place right here in Minnesota, communities now have access to life-saving medical care regardless of where you live. This grant will help finance important medical technology for folks in and around Fairfax, and I applaud USDA Rural Development for awarding this grant." 
   "We appreciate the assistance we received from the USDA," said Fairfax City Clerk Marcia Seibert-Volz. "The grant funding we were awarded will go towards a new defibrillator machine to put in our ambulance. Recently, CPR standards have changed that require us to update our equipment. Thanks to the USDA, we will now be able to comply with these standards." 
   USDA Rural Development provides funding to rural communities for housing, clean water, hospitals, community centers, first responder needs, business and economic development. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion in rural Minnesota for a variety of economic development and infrastructure projects.
