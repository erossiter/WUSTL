$38,000 LOAN AWARDED TO ANGORA TOWNSHIP
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Angora Township has received a $38,000 Community Facility Direct Loan from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development Program. The loan is slated to be used for a number of improvements for the community's town hall, including well digging, paving, new handicap-accessible restrooms, sidewalk improvements, new flooring and other various finishing items.  
   "I am pleased the folks in and around Angora will benefit from this funding," said Coleman. "In small towns across Minnesota, the local town hall is a key gathering place for community events, local government and general fellowship, and this loan will help make significant upgrades to the town hall in Angora. USDA Rural Development continues to provide resources for communities that often don't have the tax base to fund needed improvements, and I applaud them for awarding this funding to Angora Township." 
   Senator Coleman's office notified Township officials of the award today. 
   "The rural development loan will enable the Angora Township Board of Supervisors to apply the finishing touches to the new town hall and, thus, to provide an attractive center for area civic, cultural, and social life," said Angora Township Supervisor Joanne Bergman.
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested nearly $4.3 billion into rural Minnesota for a number of improvements. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
