SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $964,000 FOR LAKE BRONSON
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Lake Bronson has received a $708,000 loan and a $256,000 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. The rural development funds will be used to help replace and repair existing city water lines.  
   "I am excited to announce that Lake Bronson will receive this critical funding," said Coleman. "Across Minnesota, small towns are struggling with an aging and inadequate infrastructure, and they lack the tax base to fund necessary upgrades. I have introduced a Rural Renaissance bill to address these concerns, and while it is making headway in Congress, the need for improvements today is significant. USDA Rural Development continues to address the needs of our rural communities and I applaud them for awarding this grant in Lake Bronson." 
   "We are very glad to get this grant and loan from the USDA Rural Development program," said Lake Bronson City Clerk Megan Hanson. "Our existing lines date back to 1954, and we are now able to replace all of our city water lines. Since most of our citizens are on Social Security, it is hard to raise rates or borrow money, so loans and grants such as these play a large role in our city upkeep. 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
