AS AMERICAN AS HER APPLE PIE
  Mary Jane Johnson of Thief River Falls, Minnesota has had a year of unexpected twists. When her husband of 57 years, Mr. Norman Johnson, recently passed away this winter, Mrs. Johnson was devastated. But when she went in to apply for her Social Security widow's benefits so that she might continue to support herself financially, officials dealt her another blow-she was ineligible to receive the payments. The reason: she was not an American citizen. 
   "After my husband died, I went in to get his benefits," said Mrs. Johnson, "but they didn't want to give them to me because I was born in Canada. My mother married an American, and I was two and half when we moved from Canada. Nobody ever told me I would need to apply to become an American. I've been paying taxes and voting all these years."
   Mrs. Johnson applied for the benefits in December, 2003, but due to common delays in the application procedure, contacted Senator Norm Coleman's office in May, 2004, to receive immediate assistance with her application. On August 24, 2004 Mrs. Johnson finally received her papers for citizenship at an Immigration appointment in Bloomington, MN.
   "When Mrs. Johnson contacted our office, we went to work with Immigration services right away," said Senator Coleman. "We didn't want Mary to have to wade through more red-tape to get money she greatly needed -she had already experienced enough tragedy this year. Mrs. Johnson has been an outstanding citizen her entire life, and I am happy that we were able to help her get the papers she needs."
   Mrs. Johnson grew up in Roseau County and later moved to Thief River Falls when she married. She has been in northern Minnesota for the past 80 years where she has taught, raised a family, and been an active participant in her church and community, including routinely winning blue ribbons at the county fair for her apple pies and other baked goods.
