SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAIRNESS DOCTRINE
  Statement From Senator Norm Coleman On Fairness Doctrine: 
   Last night, Senator Norm Coleman offered an amendment to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from reinstating the Fairness Doctrine, which from 1949-1987 had required the government to monitor political discourse on American's airwaves and regulate the expression of ideas. The amendment, which required 60 votes, was defeated by a nearly party-line vote of 49 to 48. 
   "While I am disappointed with the outcome of last night's vote, the real disappointment for me is the complete failure of my Democratic colleagues to defend the First Amendment and the free speech of the people whose rights they were elected to protect. The failure of this amendment leaves the door open for individuals to muzzle political ideas by resurrecting regulation from a bygone era that no longer has a place in today's media world. Despite last night's vote, I will continue to fight for all Americans' right to free speech."
