SEN. COLEMAN TO CHAIR HEARING ON CHINA'S INCREASING INVOLVMENT IN LATIN AMERICA
  Sen. Norm Coleman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics Affairs, will today host at a hearing at 2:30 p.m. EDT on China's increasing presence in Latin America, entitled, "Challenge or Opportunity? China's Role in Latin America." The hearing will focus on China's influence in the region, taking into account China's rising imports of natural resources, particularly oil, from Latin America, the Chinese role in counterfeit goods production and ephedra trafficking, and its increasing economic activity and trade with South American countries. Chairman Coleman will explore how the U.S. maintains its historical influence in this region in the face of an increasingly active China.  
   Between 1999 and 2004, China's imports from Latin America increased six-fold, and its exports more than tripled. In 2003 Latin America was the destination of 1/3 of Chinese foreign investment. China's growing need for natural resources, particularly oil, will be a primary focus in the Subcommittee's hearing. In 2004, Latin America supplied only 2% of the 2.9 million barrels China imported. However, Chinese officials have recently traversed the region to secure major oil commitments, including 300,000 barrels per day from Venezuela by 2012. 
   "America's history, values, and geography bind the U.S. to Latin America in a way that China cannot," said Coleman. "However, China's rapid economic growth and its insatiable need for natural resources, particularly energy, is a global phenomenon that will have an effect in the United States. It is a presence that certainly merits our attention. At a minimum, we must find ways to ensure that American influence in the Western Hemisphere is not diminished by an increasingly active China." 
   The hearing will also focus on the criminal impacts of China's increased activities in Latin America in the Western Hemisphere. It is estimated that 2/3 of Brazil's pirated goods originate in China. Additionally, China is the principal producer of ephedra, a key component in the manufacture of methamphetamine. 
   "We need to look at how ephedra gets smuggled from China," said Coleman. "Eighty to ninety percent of the meth used in Minnesota comes from outside of our state. Like many states across the U.S., we are facing a serious drug epidemic, and this hearing may shed light on what we can do to stop the illegal distribution of this devastating drug. At same time, violations on intellectual property rights must stop. During my recent visit in Brazil, I was struck not only by the fact that Brazil seems to be finally coming around on IPR, but also by the fact that most of Brazil's pirated goods are made in China." 
   The hearing is scheduled for Senate Dirksen room 419 from 2:30-4:45 p.m. EDT. A live web cast will be shown on Sen. Coleman's Web site: www.coleman.senate.gov
