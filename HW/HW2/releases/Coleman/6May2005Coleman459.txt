SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF ST. PAUL POLICE OFFICER
  "The loss of Officer Vick this morning in a fatal shooting in the line of duty reminds us again of the valor and sacrifice of police officers.  
 Officer Vick wasn't a police officer because it was the safest job - or because it paid the most - or because it was the least stressful. He was a police officer because he loved his own family enough to put his life on the line for thousands of other families in Saint Paul. The prayers of Laurie and I go out to Officer Vick and his family and all of the people of Saint Paul. And, in particular, we want to give thanks to God for the bravery of the men and women of the Saint Paul Police Department for the work they do every day on behalf of all of us citizens of Saint Paul."
