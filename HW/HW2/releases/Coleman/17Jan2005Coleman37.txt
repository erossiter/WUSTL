SEN. COLEMAN COMMEMORATES MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DAY
  On Monday, January 17, 2005, Sen. Coleman proudly participated in Dr.  
 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations, to honor the memory and work of Dr. King. Coleman attended the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday breakfast and march from Central High School to Concordia University in St. Paul. 
   "On January 17th, we as a nation pause to reflect and honor the life of Dr. King," said Coleman. "He was a man who fought for the freedom, equality, and dignity of all races and people. He once said, 'Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable...Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.' His vision was for a better future for everyone as he challenged all people to work toward that goal of equality. Many people from Minnesota communities marched side-by-side on Monday in remembrance of this tremendous legacy to celebrate his life and words that have moved us closer to making his dream real for every American." 
   The theme of this year's MLK breakfast, which was sponsored by the United Negro College Fund and General Mill at the Minneapolis Convention Center, was, "Strong Minds, Great Hearts, Ready Hands and Truth and Faith... Remember the Dream." Juan Williams, National Political Correspondent and author, was the key note speaker at this event. Coleman was then joined by several other elected Minnesota officials for the march which was been organized by Governor Pawlenty's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Commission.
