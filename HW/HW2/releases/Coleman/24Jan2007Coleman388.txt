SEN. COLEMAN SELECTED TO BE TOP REPUBLICAN ON MIDDLE EAST SUBCOMMITTEE
  Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman today was selected to be the Ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs. Coleman will hold the top Republican position on the Subcommittee, which had previously been occupied by former Sen. Lincoln Chafee (D-RI). Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) will become the panel's Chairman.  
   "Ensuring strong and stable foreign policy in this part of the world is important to both the state of Minnesota and our entire nation," said Coleman. "I intend to use this Subcommittee to bolster the full Committee's oversight of our Iraq policy. I also want to focus attention on the destabilizing effect of Iran and its nuclear program and support for terrorism. Additionally, I will use this position to continue to articulate my strong support for our allies as well as the need for an even-handed approach to Middle East peace and an end to terror." 
   During 2003-2006, Coleman chaired the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs. "I intend to use the experience I gained while serving as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere as I assume this new role of Ranking Member, where I will have the responsibility to exercise oversight of U.S. policy toward the Middle East," said Coleman.
