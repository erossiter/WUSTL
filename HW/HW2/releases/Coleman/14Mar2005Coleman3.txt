SENS. SMITH, COLEMAN TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENT TO STOP MEDICAID CUTS
  Today, Sens. Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Norm Coleman (R-MN) announced they will offer an amendment to restore Medicaid funding proposed to be cut as part of the Senate Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2006. This comes on the heels of successful efforts by the two senators to pare back the cuts from their original level of $60 billion proposed under the President's budget. The amendment to be offered by Sens. Smith and Coleman would instead call for the creation of a bipartisan commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the Medicaid program to determine how to improve efficiencies in service delivery and quality of care.  
   "This is a look before you leap amendment," said Coleman. "Before jumping head long into cuts to Medicaid, it is reasonable to ask a bipartisan commission to fully examine Medicaid with an eye toward achieving efficiencies in a way that minimizes impact on the people who depend on this program for their access to health care. I am pleased we were able to pare back cuts from $60 billion to $15 billion already. But my state is currently looking at cuts to health care without anticipating any cuts at the federal level and I don't want anything we do in Washington to exacerbate the current problem. A commission is in order." 
   The Medicaid Commission proposed by Smith and Coleman will be charged with a number of duties, including reviewing and making recommendations with respect to the long-term goals, populations served, financial sustainability, interaction with Medicare and safety-net providers, and the quality of care provided. The Commission will have one year to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public. 
   The amendment is based on legislation introduced by Senator Smith and coauthored by Senator Coleman.
