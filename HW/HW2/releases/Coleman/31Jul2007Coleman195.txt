SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $50,000 GRANT FOR LAKE LILLIAN
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of Lake Lillian has been awarded a grant of $50,000 from United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The funding will be used to finance medical equipment upgrades for the city.  
   "I applaud USDA Rural Development for providing this important funding to the City of Lake Lillian," Coleman said. "First responders are critical for the safety and health of their communities, particularly in rural Minnesota where distance to medical facilities can be great, and it is critical they have the best resources available. This funding will increase safety for local residents and I am pleased Lake Lillian was chosen to receive this funding." 
   "It was very easy to work with the local USDA office to procure this grant," said Lake Lillian City Clerk Susan Jungclaus. "We have a list of medical equipment that needs updating, including an ambulance, which is why we applied to the USDA. Our service area covers 150 square miles which includes the City of Lake Lillian and all or part of the six surrounding townships. We would not be able to afford the needed updates, which will allow us to effectively serve our community, without this grant funding. The funding will allows us to continue providing quality healthcare to local residents." 
   USDA Rural Development provides funding to rural communities for housing, clean water, hospitals, community centers, first responder needs, business and economic development. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion in rural Minnesota for a variety of economic development and infrastructure projects.
