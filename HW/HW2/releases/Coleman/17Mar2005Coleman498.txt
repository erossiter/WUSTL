SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOUSE HEARINGS ON MLB, STEROID USE
  "As a senator and lifelong baseball fan, I certainly believe my colleagues in the House have a right to look into alleged steroid abuse in Major League Baseball.  
 Baseball is America's pastime and this great game has a special place in this country's history and heart. We also should remember that Major League Baseball enjoys special antitrust law exemptions, and thus also has special responsibilities, the foremost being to ensure that its players are setting a solid example for the millions of American children that look up to them each and everyday. MLB needs to take allegations of widespread steroid use amongst its players very seriously and take action to stop it now."
