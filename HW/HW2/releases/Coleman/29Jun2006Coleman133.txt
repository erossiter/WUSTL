SEN. COLEMAN SCORES KEY PROJECTS FOR MINNESOTA IN ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. Norm Coleman today was successful in including 18 Minnesota renewable energy and flood control projects in the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee today and now awaits consideration by the full Senate. As the chairman of the Senate Biofuels Caucus, Coleman lauded the bill's inclusion of two important renewable energy research projects at the Minnesota Center for Renewable Energy and the Center for Applied Biofuel Research at Minnesota State University, Mankato. 
   "With 16 ethanol plants, 3 biodiesel plants, boundless wind energy, and a coal gasification plant on the way, Minnesota can play a leading role in ending our dependence on foreign energy," said Coleman. "Research centers like Minnesota State University, Mankato are the foundation of that effort, and I am pleased that their innovation is recognized in this bill."  
   "As one of the nation's early biofuels innovators, Minnesota State University, Mankato has helped to make renewable energy a real alternative to alleviate our society's fossil fuel dependence," said Dr. Richard Davenport, President of Minnesota State University, Mankato. "I'm delighted that we are being considered for these important new renewable energy projects and we are most appreciative of Senator Coleman's efforts to extend renewable energy projects in Minnesota." 
   The bill also provides much-needed funding to continue flood control projects in Minnesota. $12,018,000 is allocated for the Grand Forks/East Grand Forks flood control project, $1,500,000 for the Breckenridge, MN flood control project and $326,000 for Preconstruction Engineering and Design for the City of Roseau's flood control project. 
   "I am pleased to have obtained these funds for flood prevention in Minnesota," said Coleman. "I've witnessed the destruction that flooding brings firsthand and I have always been committed to ensuring that we have the infrastructure in place to prevent a tragedy from occurring. I will continue working for Minnesota to ensure these projects receive the funding they need and deserve." 
   "This is fantastic news for the City of Roseau," said Jeff Pelowski, Mayor or Roseau. "The project will remove the City from the 100-year floodplain and it can't come soon enough as far as we are concerned. I want to thank Senator Coleman for making this funding possible and for his continued support of our flood recovery efforts."
