SEN. COLEMAN HAILS U.N. WORLD SUMMIT DECISION TO DROP CHALLENGE TO U.S. OVERSIGHT OF INTERNET
  After weeks of leading the opposition to the proposal by the United Nations to control and politicize governance of the world wide web, Senator Norm Coleman called the decision today by the U.N. World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis to retain U.S. oversight of the Internet a significant victory for the Internet, innovation, and the free exchange of information worldwide.  
   "I am thrilled that the delegates clearly recognized and reaffirmed the historic role of the United States in developing and maintaining the most dynamic communications and informational tool we have ever known," Coleman said. "This is a world wide win that assures the world wide web will continue to operate freely and effectively. This result means that privatization, not politicization, will increasingly shape the future of the Internet." 
   Negotiators at the WSIS conference agreed that the United States will retain oversight of the domain-name system, a key issue in the weeks leading up to the controversial Tunis conference. The consensus reached at the WSIS leaves the fundamental infrastructure of the Internet in place, free from intergovernmental oversight or control. 
   The consensus reached by the WSIS is consistent with the principles of Internet governance articulated by the Administration in June and supported in Senator Coleman's Sense of the Senate Resolution. These are: 
   * Preservation of the security and stability of the Internet domain name and addressing system (DNS). 
   * Recognition of the legitimate interest of governments in managing their own country code top-level domains. 
   * Support for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as the appropriate technical manager of the Internet DNS. 
   * Participation in continuing dialogue on Internet governance in multiple existing for a, with continued support for market-based approaches toward, and private sector leadership of, its further evolution. 
   According to U.S. representatives in Tunis, the WSIS did not call for new oversight of the Internet or make references to a new cooperation model. Additionally, there were no restrictions on the technical management of the Domain Name System. 
   The Internet has flourished under U.S. supervision, oversight, and private sector involvement. Coleman has consistently maintained that this growth happened not because of increased government involvement, but rather, from the opening on the Internet to commerce and private sector innovation. In July, Coleman warned in the Senate against the risks of allowing the U.N. bureaucracy to assume a role in supervising the Internet. "Inserting the United Nations into Internet governance would be a dangerous detour likely to hinder, if not cripple, the fulfillment of the full promise of the most dynamic and important communications infrastructure in all of human history. We simply cannot afford the delay and diversion that would result from such an unfortunate deviation from the path that has brought the Internet to its present and almost miraculous state of success." 
   WSIS delegates will hold a follow-up forum next year in Greece that will focus on a variety of public policy issues related to the Internet. The forum will be open to full participation of stakeholders in the Internet. "Even with this victory, it is important that we remain vigilant in making sure that the Internet is protected from the U.N. or some other unaccountable international body that would greatly compromise the benefits we enjoy from the Internet today," Coleman said.
