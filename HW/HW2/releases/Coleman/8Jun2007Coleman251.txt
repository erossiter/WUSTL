SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES A $1,960,200 GRANT FOR THE CENTRAL CORRIDOR LIGHT RAIL PROJECT
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced that the Federal Transit Administration has awarded $1,960,200 in funding for the preliminary engineering activities of the Central Corridor Light Rail Project (CCLRP). The CCLRP, which will run from downtown Minneapolis to downtown St. Paul, is an 11 mile-long light rail line with service to 16 stations, in addition to the five on the downtown Minneapolis Hiawatha line.  
   "This light rail project will not only reduce traffic congestion, but will also provide an environmentally friendly transportation option for Minnesotans," said Senator Coleman. "As a former mayor of St. Paul, I am especially pleased the Central Corridor Project has been awarded this funding, as it will help to meet transportation needs of the Twin Cities, as well as provide economic opportunities." 
   "The grant is something we were counting on to assist with the cost of preliminary engineering, and we are profoundly grateful to the Federal Transit Administration for their continued support of our project," Metropolitan Council Chair Peter Bell said. 
   The Central Corridor Light Rail Transit project will link downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis via Washington and University avenues And be the third in a planned network of rail and bus ``transitways'' in the Twin Cities. Construction will begin in 2010 on the rail line, with service beginning in 2014. The Metropolitan Council will be charged with leading the design and building of the line in partnership with the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
