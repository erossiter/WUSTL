SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. BEEF EXPORTS TO KOREA
 After petitioning Korean President Roh Moo-hyun for a quick end to Korea's embargo on American beef, I am pleased by Korea's announcement that it will resume imports of U.S. beef. This decision will further open a critical international market to farmers across Minnesota and the nation. While the resumption of trade only applies to boneless beef from cattle less than 30 months of age, it is an important step toward normalizing the trade of beef and beef products with Korea. I am confident that with further cooperation between our two nations, we will be able to expand our access to the Korean marketplace and increase our international trade efforts, and I will continue fighting for complete resumption of trade.
