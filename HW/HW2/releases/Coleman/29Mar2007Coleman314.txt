SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON SUPPLEMENTAL EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  "The safety of our troops - and providing them with the tools they need for success - remains my number one concern. Setting an arbitrary timeline for withdrawal does not protect our troops-but does embolden our enemies.  
   While I embrace, and have led the fight, for many of the important individual projects in this legislation - I will not support efforts that I believe place our troops in great danger in exchange for funding for important domestic programs. 
   The President will likely veto this bill, and we will have the opportunity to support funding for these important programs without them being tied to a disastrous arbitrary timeline for troop withdrawal."
