WRDA BILL CONTAINING SEN. COLEMAN PROVISIONS FOR MINNESOTA BECOMES LAW
  Senator Norm Coleman today joined his Senate colleagues in voting for final passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which contains authorization for key projects to upgrade and improve Minnesota's water infrastructure. The bill, which was passed by Congress in September before being vetoed by President Bush late last week, authorizes water infrastructure projects Coleman secured for Roseau, Goodview, Willmar, Grand Rapids and Douglas County among others, along with navigational improvements and ecosystem restoration of the Upper Mississippi River, including the construction an Asian carp barrier at Lock and Dam #11 in Iowa. After passing the House 361-54 earlier this week, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 79-14 and now becomes law.  
   "Passage of the Water Resources Development Act was a must-do for the future of Minnesota's infrastructure, and I am glad that an overwhelming majority of my colleagues joined me to override the President's veto of this critical legislation," Coleman said. "While I appreciate the President's call for fiscal responsibility, short-changing our infrastructure is penny-wise and pound-foolish. From needed lock and dam upgrades on the Mississippi to a number of local wastewater treatments projects, this bill will mean a stronger economy, a cleaner environment and a better quality of life for Minnesotans." 
   Specifically, Senator Coleman was successful in securing authorizations for the following Minnesota projects in the final bill: 
   * $25,100,000 for the City of Roseau's flood control project. The Roseau project will include a 150-foot wide diversion channel that will divert floodwaters around the city to the east, providing reliable permanent flood protection to a majority of the city. In addition to flood damage reduction, the plan includes recreational features such as multipurpose trails, motorized trails, and a trailhead. 
   * $3 million for the City of Goodview's radium filtration plant. The authorization will make the city eligible for federal assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to help finance and construct the plant. 
   * $15 million to construct a new wastewater treatment facility in the city of Willmar. The authorization will also be used to construct wastewater conveyance facilities between the new wastewater treatment facility and Willmar's existing wastewater treatment facility. The new treatment facility will be less disruptive to the Minnesota River than the current wastewater treatment facility, which is 70 years old. 
   * $5 million to reconstruct and upgrade the existing wastewater treatment facility in the city of Grand Rapids. The funding is necessary in order to accommodate the proposed expansion by UPM/Blandin to their Grand Rapids paper mill. This expansion is known as the "Thunderhawk Project" and will create hundreds of jobs in the region. 
   * $2 million to upgrade wastewater infrastructure in the Douglas County Lakes Area to maintain the pristine quality of Douglas County's lakes. The funding will assist in developing a sewer system in the townships of Le Grande and Moe. 
   * $9 million for the Duluth Harbor navigation project. 
   * Asian carp dispersal barrier. This provision requires the Army Corps of Engineers to study and construct an Asian carp barrier at lock and dam 11. 
   * Authorizes funding for the Borup flood damage reduction project in the South Branch of the Wild Rice River 
   - Authorizes funding for the Crow River project in Rockford for flood damage reduction. 
   - Authorizes funding for the Tower navigation project. 
   - The Wild Rice River flood protection project. This provision directs the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the evaluation and construction of the flood protection project and develop alternatives to the Twin Valley lake feature. 
   The legislation also includes upgrades for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway Restoration (UMR-IWW), including critical navigation improvements along the waterway, the construction of new locks and $1.5 billion in ecosystem restoration. The UMR-IWW makes commercial navigation possible between Minneapolis and St. Louis on the Mississippi River, and along the Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi River. 
   Five of the nation's top agricultural production states; Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin; have relied on the UMR-IWW system as a principal conduit for export-bound agricultural products, mostly bulk corn and soybeans.
