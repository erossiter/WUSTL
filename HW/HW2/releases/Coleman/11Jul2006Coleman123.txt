SENS. COLEMAN, SCHUMER INTRODUCE AMENDMENT TO ENHANCE PORT SECURITY
  Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN), along with Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), today introduced an amendment aimed at strengthening port security to the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill. The amendment will create a pilot program to outfit three foreign seaports with an integrated scanning system to cover 100 percent of containers bound for the United States from these ports within one year. The integrated scanning system will combine nonintrusive inspection equipment with radiation detection equipment to ensure the free flow of commerce and enhanced security.  
   "We need a system in place that will detect 100 percent of the radiological material entering the U.S.," said Coleman. "An appropriate first step is to conduct this pilot program to be sure the system works and does not hinder the flow of commerce. For more than two years, I have led a bicameral and bipartisan oversight investigation to identify the vulnerabilities of U.S. ports and our global supply chain. This amendment will bring us another step closer to filling in these gaps." 
   Approximately 95 percent of our nation's overseas trade, worth nearly $1 trillion, enters or leaves through our seaports. Foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approximately 800 million tons of goods that come into our country. In fiscal year 2005 alone, more than eleven million containers arrived on American soil by sea and this number is growing at a rate of over 10 percent a year.
