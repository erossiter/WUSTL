SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $274,075 FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS IN DULUTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today applauded the awarding of a $274,075 grant for the American Indian Community Housing Organization in Duluth from the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence against Woman. The grant, administered under the Transitional Housing Grant Program, will be used to provide transitional housing to victims of domestic violence and their children.  
   "Domestic violence is a horrible crime that impacts families profoundly," said Coleman. "This funding goes to crucial programs that provide stability and practical help for families in crisis. Groups like the American Indian Community Housing Organization do truly valuable work, and I am thankful they have provided resources for women and children in Duluth that have suffered from domestic violence." 
   The Office on Violence Against Women, a component of the U.S. Department of Justice, was created in 1995 to administer financial and technical assistance to communities across the country that are developing programs aimed at ending domestic violence. Currently, OVW administers one formula grant program and eleven discretionary grant programs. Since its inception, OVW has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants and cooperative agreements.
