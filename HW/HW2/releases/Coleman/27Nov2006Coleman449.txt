SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF COLE COMMISSION REPORT
  "I applaud the efforts of the Cole commission, which examined the facts in a thorough and comprehensive manner. My Subcommittee will review the Cole report with a fine-tooth comb to determine whether U.S. interests were hurt by AWB's gross misconduct. One paramount concern is whether U.S. farmers were harmed by AWB's actions and I will do whatever I can to make our farmers whole. Another major concern is whether Australian officials were less than honest in their dealings with the Subcommittee. We will examine the report to ensure that no one lied to this Subcommittee. I also reiterate my call for other nations to follow the example of the Australians and investigate all evidence of misconduct associated with the Oil-for-Food Program."
