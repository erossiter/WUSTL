SEN. COLEMAN COMMENTS ON MOROCCAN AUTONOMY PLAN FOR WESTERN SAHARA
  STATEMENT ON THE MOROCCAN AUTONOMY PLAN FOR THE WESTERN SAHARA  
   As the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South and Central Asian Affairs, I take a particular interest in issues that affect the stability of the region. For this reason, I am pleased that Morocco has demonstrated its willingness to work towards the resolution of the Western Sahara dispute by crafting a proposal for autonomy for the region. I believe that the presentation of this proposal to the U.N. represents a good faith effort to initiate a dialogue with the Polisario. Ultimately, such a dialogue would have the potential to lead to a negotiated agreement between Morocco and the Polisario that satisfies the concerns of both sides, and leads to peace and stability in the region. I am a strong supporter of constructive efforts to resolve the dispute in the Western Sahara, and hope that the Moroccan government's autonomy plan will spur a fruitful discussion with the Polisario.
