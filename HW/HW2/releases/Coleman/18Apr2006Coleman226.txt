SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $170,000 FOR CITY OF ASHBY
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Ashby has received a combined $170,000 in federal funding from the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. These rural development funds, comprised of a $120,000 loan and a $50,000 grant, will be used to purchase a 2006 pumper fire truck for the city.  
   "This important funding will go a long way towards helping protect the residents in and around Ashby," said Coleman. "In rural communities, the fire department is often comprised of local residents volunteering their time and efforts to protect their neighbors, and it is important they have the resources they need. I am pleased USDA Rural Development recognizes the immeasurable contributions these folks make and I applaud their decision to award this funding in Ashby." 
   "The City of Ashby appreciates the needed grant and low interest loan from the federal government," said Ashby Mayor Tom Grover. "The idea for the project started when repairs amounting to over $10,000 were needed for the '79 and '83 pumper trucks, the only two that the fire department has. It became a joint effort between the townships that the fire department serves and the city. Money was needed for replacement of this equipment, but the fire department's operating budget was only large enough to pay for day to day operations." 
   The USDA Rural Development's mission is to help rural individuals, communities and businesses obtain the financial and technical assistance needed to address their diverse and unique needs. Rural Development works to make sure that rural citizens can participate fully in the global economy and has an $86 billion dollar portfolio of loans. Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $2 billion throughout Minnesota for a variety of rural economic development projects.
