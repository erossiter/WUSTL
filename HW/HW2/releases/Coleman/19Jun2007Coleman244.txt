SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS RETURNING HOME
  Sen. Norm Coleman made the following statement today regarding the return of the first of many Companies of the Minnesota National Guard's 1/34th Brigade Combat Team from Iraq:  
   "It is with great anticipation and relief that we welcome home the first of many Minnesota National Guard troops that have been away from home for almost two years. When I met with some of our brave National Guard soldiers in Iraq a few months ago, I remember the excitement and anticipation they expressed about coming home this summer. I am extremely thankful that these soldiers and their families will be reunited after such a long time apart, and I want to offer my most sincere appreciation for the enormous sacrifices they have made on behalf of each and every one of us. As we welcome these brave servicemembers home in the coming weeks and months, it is crucial that each of us - from families to legislators to schools to employers - do all we can to help ensure a smooth reintegration process for each of them who have given so much."
