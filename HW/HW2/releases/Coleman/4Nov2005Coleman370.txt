SEN. COLEMAN HIGHLIGHTS CONTINUED JOB GROWTH
  Sen. Norm Coleman today acknowledged that recent economic and jobs data released today by the Labor Department show that the economy continues to create jobs, even in the wake of the hurricanes that devastated the Gulf Coast region.  
 According to the latest government figures, 56,000 jobs were created during the month of October, and the economy has created roughly 1.9 million jobs throughout the past 12 months and more than 4.2 million since May 2003. In addition, the unemployment dipped from 5.1 percent to 5.0 percent, which is lower than the averages of the three decades. 
   The Commerce Department recently reported that the economy grew 3.8 percent in the third quarter, which outruns the second-quarter's 3.3 percent pace. 
   "It is striking that more than four million jobs have been created during the past two years," said Coleman. "The U.S. economy continues to grow faster than many other industrialized nations, and in the wake of these devastating natural disasters, has shown tremendous resiliency. Our pro-growth policies are working. As our robust economy continues to absorb the impact of Hurricane Katrina, I remain committed to fiscal discipline and growing jobs. I will continue to work to help businesses to create good jobs for Americans." 
   Minnesota has also shown steady job growth and creation as well. Nearly 34,000 jobs have been created throughout the past year in Minnesota, while the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent--down from 4.5 percent one year ago.
