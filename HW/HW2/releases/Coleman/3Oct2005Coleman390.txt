SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
  Hispanic Heritage Month is a wonderful opportunity to reflect on and celebrate the many contributions Hispanic Americans have made to this country. America has been built on strong cultural diversity, and Minnesota is fortunate to have a vibrant and thriving Hispanic community that plays a central role in our state's culture and successes. During this month, I encourage Minnesotans to learn as much as they can about the Hispanic culture and history, to pay tribute to the wonderful diversity of American society.
