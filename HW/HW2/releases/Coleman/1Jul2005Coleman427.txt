SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S ANNOUNCED RETIREMENT
  Statement by Sen. Norm Coleman on Justice O'connor's announced retirement: 
   "During her 24 years on the high court bench, Justice O'Connor has served with great distinction, ability, and courage. She leaves behind a great legacy, not only as the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, but with a reputation as a brilliant jurist and strong defender of the Constitution. Her presence will be missed. This is the first opening on the Court that we've had in eleven years, and it is imperative that we fill this vacancy by the time the next session begins in October to assure that the serious work of the high Court goes forward. I anticipate that this summer, we, in the Senate, will consult with the President about possible candidates and go on to enjoy a thorough review, fair debate, and finally, an up or down vote on the Senate floor in regards to this very important position."
