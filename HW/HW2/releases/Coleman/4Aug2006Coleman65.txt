SEN. COLEMAN CO-AUTHORS BILL TO FIGHT INTERNATIONAL METH TRAFFICKING
  Concerned that meth smuggled in from abroad threatens to undermine the significant recent gains against local meth labs, Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN) yesterday joined with several of his colleagues in introducing the Methamphetamine Trafficking Prevention Act of 2006 (S.3825). This legislation, introduced by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT), is aimed at ending the flow of meth and its precursor chemicals from across the border. The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   "At my last hearing on this topic, I heard loud and clear that while we are making solid progress against the meth being produced domestically, we're seeing more and more meth labs move south, where the drug is then smuggled into the country," said Coleman. "Clearly, this is very much an international problem with devastating local repercussions. We need to take a more proactive approach to keep meth from crossing the border, and this bill provides our law enforcement and government officials with the tools needed to stop the influx of meth."  
   Recently, Coleman co-chaired a joint subcommittee hearing to examine the options available to impede the flow of meth into communities throughout the country. During the hearing, Coleman expressed the need to focus America's efforts and resources on the Mexican border, as a majority of the meth entering the U.S. - close to 90 percent of the total amount consumed by Americans - comes from Mexican international drug trafficking organizations, made in superlabs along our southern border. 
   According to the Administration's Synthetic Drug Control Strategy, border seizures of methamphetamine have almost doubled between 2000 and 2004 and as much as 75-85% of methamphetamine used in the United States is made from precursors from the international stream of commerce. 
   The Methamphetamine Trafficking Prevention Act will improve technology to interdict meth at the border, increase coordination of anti-meth activities with other countries, and require a report to Congress on meth efforts on Indian Reservations. Specifically, the bill will: 
   * Make an additional $15 million available within the Department of Justice's Meth Hot Spots Program for the "Border Technology Grants" - successful applicants must demonstrate viable technology to detect methamphetamine and its precursors on the border or through aerial surveillance and consideration is also given to technologies that can detect active meth lab sites on or near the border through the use of hyperspectral sensors. 
   * Provide an additional $5 million to deploy trace chemical detectors along the U.S. borders - the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) identifies ports of entry in need of trace chemical detectors, for use in detecting primarily narcotics, but also explosive devices. 
   * Require the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to discuss methamphetamine with each trading partner in any multilateral or bilateral negotiations and encourage USTR to consider ways to curb illicit use and shipment of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar chemicals. 
   * Require the DEA to train foreign law enforcement officers, police, prosecutors, or other law enforcement officers from countries that traffic methamphetamine or its precursors into the United States - these officers are selected by the DEA in order to maximize U.S. education and training efforts. 
   * The Department of Justice is also required to issue a report to Congress on problems faced by Indian reservations located at or near U.S. borders with respect to methamphetamine trafficking and abuse. 
   Also signing on to the legislation as original cosponsors are Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senators Wayne Allard (R-CO), George Allen (R-VA), Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Gordon Smith (R-OR). 
   To combat the spread of meth, Coleman also coauthored the Combat Meth Act, which was signed into law earlier this year as part of the Patriot Act. The legislation limits access to cold medicines containing psuedoephedrine, the primary ingredient used to make methamphetamine. This January, Coleman held a National Town Hall on Meth to examine the rising growth of meth abuse and the effect it has had on communities across the U.S. Coleman also created the Coleman Meth Task Force comprised of Minnesota law enforcement officials, hospital administrators, school nurses and recovery professionals to address needed legislation and initiatives to help combat meth use.
