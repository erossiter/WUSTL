SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES CONGRESS PROVIDES FURTHER RELIEF FUNDING FOR HURRICANE VICTIMS
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced that Congress approved an additional $51.8 billion in emergency funding submitted yesterday by the President to support the immediate relief and recovery missions being conducted on the Gulf Coast.  
 Funding will support the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to ensure all necessary resources are available to save lives. 
   "Congress has taken swift and immediate action to aid in the relief efforts in the region," said Coleman. "Our first priority should be to put people on the ground to provide relief and protection for our friends and families in the Gulf Coast. Right now, the victims desperately need restoration of basic services such as water, food, shelter, and most importantly, to be connected with their loved ones. I believe this funding will bring us where we need to be." 
   This funding comes on the heels of the 10.5 billion in emergency supplemental funding signed into law early this week. In addition to providing funding, President Bush created a Cabinet-level task force, chaired by Secretary of Homeland Security Mike Chertoff, to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to meet the urgent needs in the region. 
   "Our next step should be thinking of ways we can revitalize the region. We ought to target government support to areas of tax credits, job training, and a relaxing of specific government regulations to stimulate job growth and economic recovery." 
   Funding will be allocated to federal agencies as follows: 
   $50 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
   $1.4 billion for the Department of Defense 
   $400 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
