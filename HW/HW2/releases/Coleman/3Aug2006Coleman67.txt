SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MINIMUM WAGE TIP CREDIT PROVISION
  Statement from Sen. Norm Coleman On The Minimum Wage Tip Credit Provision: 
   It has been far too long since the last increase in the minimum wage, which is why I strongly support an increase to help raise the living standard of America's hardworking families. However, I find it regrettable that members on the opposite side of the aisle are arguing that the tip credit provision would actually lead to a reduction in the minimum wage for those workers in non-tip credit states - like Minnesota. The facts of the tip credit are clear. The tip credit would only apply to future increases in the minimum wage, not the current minimum wage. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs the minimum wage, would ensure that everyday Minnesotans will not be harmed upon passage of this bill, and the Department of Labor has stated that this is exactly how they would interpret the legislation under consideration in the Senate. Minnesota's tipped employees will not see a reduction in their base wages - end of story.
