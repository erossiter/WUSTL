SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $5.6 MILLION FOR NORTHSTAR COMMUTER RAIL
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the Minnesota Department of Transportation Transit office a $5,659,028 grant for the Northstar Corridor Rail Project. Specifically, the grant will be used to fund scheduled easement payments to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, whose existing railroad tracks will be used for the commuter line.  
   "The completion of the Northstar project is extremely important to the people of Minnesota as it will have a major impact on the state's economy, provide new jobs, decrease our reliance on foreign oil and alleviate traffic congestion," said Coleman. "This grant is another important step towards the final completion of this critical project and I thank the Dept. of Transportation for their continued commitment to Northstar and the people of Minnesota." 
   The Northstar rail line is a $280 million project that will run from downtown Minneapolis up through the northwest suburbs to Big Lake (largely in Anoka County). The 40-mile, six station commuter rail line system will serve Hennepin, Anoka and Sherburne Counties and has the capacity to carry 10,000 passengers a day. In addition, it provides a four block extension of the successful Hiawatha LRT, which will connect LRT to Northstar commuter rail at the downtown Minneapolis multi-modal station. This extension will provide for the seamless integration of the two rail projects serving the region. 
   Sen. Coleman and Senator Amy Klobuchar recently sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Administrator, James Simpson urging them to continue their efforts to help Minnesota recover from the collapse of the I-35W bridge by immediately recommending the Northstar Commuter Rail Corridor for a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA).
