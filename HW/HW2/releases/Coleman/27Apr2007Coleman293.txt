SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FOR MERIDEN TOWNSHIP
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced Meriden Township, located in Steele County, has been selected to receive a grant of $815,000 and a loan of $231,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The federal funding will be used to improve wastewater collection and treatment through two cell stabilization ponds.  
   "The need for improvements in wastewater treatment is widespread throughout rural Minnesota," said Coleman. "Unfortunately, the cost of these improvements is great, leaving many areas without the financial resources to pay for them. Thankfully, USDA Rural Development continues to fund these critical projects and I applaud them for awarding this funding to Meriden Township." 
   USDA Rural Development uses the Water and Waste Disposal Grant/Loan program to develop water and waste disposal systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and non-profit entities. 
   Since 2001, USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion into rural Minnesota for a variety of improvements. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
