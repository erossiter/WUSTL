SEN. COLEMAN INTENDS TO VOTE FOR CLOTURE ON IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Coleman intends to vote for cloture in order to allow one last effort to significantly improve the enforcement measures in the immigration reform bill. He fully believes that the current immigration system in this country is totally broken. It remains to be seen whether this bill will be the answer to this serious problem, which is why he is reserving judgment on how he will vote on final passage. Among the pending amendments is Sen. Coleman's provision to end the practice of sanctuary cities, where certain local police officers are forbidden from sharing information with federal authorities about illegal immigrants. We need to lift this gag order in order to show that we are serious about enforcing immigration law.  
   The bottom line is if the border and workplace enforcement mechanisms are not improved, Senator Coleman will oppose the bill. It's important to remember that there will be another parliamentary vote on the amended bill at the end of this debate, which will also require 60 votes in order to then move to vote on final passage. If Senator Coleman is not satisfied with the progress of the amended bill, he will use this opportunity to vote to kill this bill.
