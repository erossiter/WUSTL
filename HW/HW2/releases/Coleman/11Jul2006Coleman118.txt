SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $152,000 FOR CAMBRIDGE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today announced the City of Cambridge has been awarded a $152,000 federal grant from the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The grant will be aimed at constructing a taxiway and improving a drainage system at Cambridge Municipal Airport.  
   "Local airports continue to be an extremely valuable resource across the state and I am pleased Cambridge's airport was selected for this funding," said Coleman. "From greater access for residents and visitors, to the potential for future community development, airports are important to their communities and I applaud the FAA for recognizing Cambridge Municipal's value by awarding this grant." 
   The FAA uses the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for the planning and development of qualified public-use airports. The grants are awarded to eligible projects that enhance security, capacity, and environmental concerns.
