SEN. COLEMAN PRAISES 33 PERCENT DECREASE IN YEAR-TO-DATE BUDGET DEFICIT
  Sen. Norm Coleman today praised the latest Treasury Department figures showing year-to-date a 33 percent decrease in the deficit with revenues expanding by 8 percent. In December, there were record revenues of $260 billion and a record surplus of $45 billion. These figures come on the heels of the Labor Department's strong December jobs report showing 167,000 new jobs for December and a historically low unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. Meanwhile, Minnesota's labor market remains healthy with an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent and more than 54,000 new jobs created during the past year - the best job growth since 1999.  
   "The national deficit continues to fall largely as a result of pro-growth policies," said Coleman. "While I am pleased with the latest deficit figures, I realize that we need to build upon this progress by meeting the President's goal of balancing the budget by 2012. While doing so, I will also continue to work hard with both sides of the aisle to improve the average Minnesotan's economic well-being."
