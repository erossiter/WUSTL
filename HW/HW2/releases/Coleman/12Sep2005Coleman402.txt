SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF FEMA DIRECTOR BROWN
  Statement of Sen. Norm Coleman on the Resignation of FEMA Director Michael Brown 
   I am completely confident that Coast Guard Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen will lead the recovery and relief efforts proficiently and productively as we continue the work of providing essentials such as water, food, shelter, and most importantly, connecting families with their loved ones. Now more than ever, our focus must remain solely on the victims and their families to ensure their continued safety and security, and move ahead to rebuild the region. For this reason, I believe that the resignation of FEMA Director Michael Brown is not only in the best interest of the agency, but also the relief efforts in the Gulf Region. Congress has taken the appropriate action by providing over $60 billion in emergency funding, and we must continue to build on these efforts so that help reaches the entire region and every family affected.
