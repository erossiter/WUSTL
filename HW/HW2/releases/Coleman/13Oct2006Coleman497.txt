SEN. COLEMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.N. ELECTION OF BAN KI-MOON
  STATEMENT FROM SEN. NORM COLEMAN ON UN ELECTION OF BAN KI-MOON:  
   With today's election, I am hopeful that a new Secretary General can aggressively implement reforms that are needed to make the UN an effective and transparent organization. The end of the scandal-ridden reign of Kofi Annan presents a new opportunity to move towards the reforms essential for restoring the UN's credibility. I have met with Mr. Ban, and look forward to working constructively with him and the new team he brings to the UN. Among these many challenges, Mr. Ban must be prepared to hold North Korea and Iran accountable for their actions, and he must also lead the efforts to end the genocide in Darfur. While UN management reform is not popular, it is critical, and it is going to take a focused and pragmatic leader to resuscitate the reform effort.
