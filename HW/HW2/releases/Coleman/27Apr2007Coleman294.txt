SEN. COLEMAN ANNOUNCES $878,000 LOAN FOR CITY OF ST. CLAIR
  Senator Norm Coleman today announced the City of St. Clair has been selected to receive an $878,000 Water and Waste Disposal Direct Loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. The federal funding will be used to help finance the purchase of a new water tower in the city, along with the demolition of the old tower.  
   "Upgrading water treatment infrastructure is a major need across rural Minnesota," said Coleman. "The cost of these improvements is great, and many municipalities simply lack the financial resources needed to pay for them. USDA Rural Development continues to provide resources to complete these projects, and I want to thank them for providing this loan for the folks in St. Clair." 
   USDA Rural Development uses the Water and Waste Disposal Loan program to develop water and waste disposal systems in rural areas and towns with a population not in excess of 10,000. The funds are available to public entities such as municipalities, counties, special-purpose districts, Indian tribes, and non-profit entities. 
   USDA Rural Development has invested over $4 billion into rural Minnesota for a variety of improvements since 2001. For more information, please visit www.rurdev.usda.gov.
