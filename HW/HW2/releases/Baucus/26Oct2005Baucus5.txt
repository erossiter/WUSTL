(Washington, D.C.)  Uncle Sam owes $167,000 to nearly 250 Montanans whose 2004 tax refund checks were returned to the post office, U.S. Senator Max Baucus said today. 
The refund checks were returned likely due to bad addresses, Baucus said, urging Montanans to contact the IRS to see if they are entitled to a refund. Nearly 250 Montanans didnt get their tax refund check back from the federal government, Baucus said. The IRS is trying to get these checks resent, but they need help finding the folks they belong to. Baucus said the average outstanding Montana refund is $672.19, from as little as $1.00 to as much as $15,734.00. They can be reissued as soon as Montanans correct or update their addresses with the IRS.  The IRS is holding checks belonging to 249 Montanans, including 28 taxpayers in Billings, 15 in Great Falls, 11 in Helena, 42 in Bozeman, 33 in Missoula, and 16 in Kalispell, Baucus said.  The agency contacted Baucus about the checks because he is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes and the IRS.  If Montanans move or change their address and fail to notify the IRS or the U.S. Postal Service, a check sent to their last known address is returned to the IRS. Montanans who have moved since filing their last tax return can ensure the IRS has their correct address by filing Form 8822, Change of Address, with the IRS. Download the form or request it by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). 
Those without access to the Internet, who think they may be missing a refund, should call the IRS toll-free assistance line at 1-800-829-1040. Related Links:  Wheres My Refund? Form 8822, Change of Address
