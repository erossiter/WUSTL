January 17, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) âMontana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, today passed out of his committee a new tax relief package to boost small businesses.  

âMontana is a small business state,â? Baucus said. âSmall business is the engine that drives our economy and creates jobs on Main Streets. Thatâs why Iâm proud we are getting them some tax relief from Uncle Sam.â?  

Baucusâ tax relief package includes credits for small businesses that hire hard-to-employ workers, increased deductions for improving buildings, and measures to help small businesses simplify their bookkeeping. His bill passed the Finance Committee today unanimously.   

As of 2003, Montana had nearly 34,000 small businesses, which represents 97.7 percent of all businesses in Montana, the Small Business Administration reports.  The number of people who were self-employed in that same year totaled 61,726.  

Baucus said his tax incentives are likely to be coupled with an increase in the minimum wage, something Baucus says is past due for Montanaâs workers.   

âTo call a minimum wage increase âoverdueâ is the understatement of the year,â? Baucus said. âItâs high time our workers get a raise. At the same time we are going to give a boost to small businesses.â?   

Following the Finance Committee action today, Baucusâ bill is ready to be debated on the floor of the Senate, likely the week of January 29.  

Baucusâ bill includes the following provisions to help Montanaâs small businesses:  

â¢           Workforce Opportunity:  The bill provides a five-year extension of the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce and expands it to include veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks.   

â¢           Small Business Expensing: Small business expensing helps small business owners buy new equipment and property.  This provision allows small businesses to deduct up to $108,000 of qualified equipment (such as: tractors and other ranch or farm equipment, copiers or other office equipment) or property expenses in the year that the equipment or property is bought, allowing businesses to recover the cost of equipment more quickly and simplify bookkeeping.   

â¢           Restaurant improvements: Allows leaseholders and restaurants to quickly recover the cost of improvements to their establishments, over 15-years rather than over the normal 39-year recovery period.     

â¢           Cash-basis accounting: Simplifies the way small businesses keep records for tax purposes.  The cash-basis accounting method is the preferred method of accounting for self-employed individuals as it is much simpler. Under cash-basis accounting, small business owners do not report income until payment is received.  This provision is only available to small businesses that have less than $5 million in gross receipts.
