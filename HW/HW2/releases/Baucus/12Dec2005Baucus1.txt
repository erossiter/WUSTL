(Washington, D.C.) âDespite efforts to change a controversial mining provision that would affect public lands in Montana and much of the West, U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said today he still opposes the provision sponsored by Reps. Gibbons of New Mexico and Pombo of California.    
Upon learning of the proposed changes, Baucus released the following statement:    
"It's still a bad idea and I'm still opposed to it. Changes such as these â which affect our ability to access public lands â should be debated in the light of day, not in some backroom of the Capitol. We need an honest and open debate over how are public lands are managed. This process is anything but open. It's in bad need of some sunshine."
