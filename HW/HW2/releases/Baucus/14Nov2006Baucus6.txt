Senator First-Ever Montanan To Chair Finance Committee
November 14, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Itâs official. Following a meeting of the Senate leadership today, Montana Senator Max Baucus will take over as chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee when the new Congress convenes in January.   

The Finance Committee, arguably the most influential panel in Congress, has jurisdiction over all taxes and revenue, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, welfare, and international trade policy. Baucus will wield significant clout over other legislation in the Congress as well.   

âI couldnât be more pleased,â? Baucus said today following a Democratic Caucus meeting. âThis is a very big deal for Montana. Being chairman will help me be even more effective for our state. Although taking the gavel puts me in a national leadership role, my number one goal is to do whatâs right for Montana and make folksâ lives better at home.â?   

Baucus, who has served on the Finance Committee since he was first elected to the Senate in 1978, is the first Montanan ever to chair the panel.   

Baucus said his top priorities on the panel will include:   

â¢           Lowering health care costs and providing quality care to all Montanans   
â¢           Boosting Montanaâs economy and creating more good-paying jobs   
â¢           Making America more energy independent and expanding alternative sources of energy, such as wind, biomass, and ethanol   
â¢           Cutting taxes for working Montana families   
â¢           Investing in education so Montana can better compete globally   
â¢           Knocking down trade barriers for Montanaâs high-quality agriculture products   

Baucus will also keep his other important committee assignments: Senate Agriculture, which will write the 2007 Farm Bill; and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over highway construction funding.   

Baucus is Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator. Heâs currently serving in his fifth consecutive six-year term in the U.S. Senate.   

Baucus has also been showing Montana Sen.-elect Jon Tester around Capitol Hill this week.   

âIâm committed to helping Jon and working with him to do whatâs right for Montana,â? said Baucus, a Helena native. âWeâre going to make a great team for Montana.â?
