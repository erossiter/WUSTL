Senator Says Bills Will Enable Seniors To Make More Informed Choices, Better Compare Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
April 27, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, today introduced two bills to help make the new Medicare prescription drug benefit program less confusing for seniors and more fair for pharmacists.   

âOur seniors deserve quality, affordable, common-sense health care and thatâs why Iâm introducing this legislation,â? Baucus said. âThe Medicare prescription drug benefit right now is way too complicated. This legislation will enable Montana seniors make apples-to-apples comparisons so they can get the prescription drugs they need at a price they deserve. We can make this new program work, we just need to work together to fine-tune it.â?   

Baucus, who worked to create the Medicare drug benefit in 2003, said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ignored warnings against approving too many plans, noting seniors werenât given clear comparisons of the plans as the drug benefit was implemented.    

Currently in many states, insurers are offering multiple plans with different names, inconsistent terminology, and wildly varying benefit packages, Baucus said, noting Montana seniors have more than 40 different plans to choose from.  The resulting confusion is keeping many seniors from signing up for the benefit, he said.  

At a press conference in Washington, D.C. today, Baucus unveiled his legislation that will make it easier for benefit comparisons by allowing seniors to choose a benefit package. The bill will also prohibit plans from changing drug coverage during the benefit year, prohibit unfair plan marketing practices to Medicare beneficiaries, and boost the plansâ performance ratings in their annual approval by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  

Baucus also introduced the Pharmacy Access Improvement (PhAIm) Act of 2006.  This bill addresses pharmacy-related problems that have arisen as the drug benefited is implemented. The bill will require drug plans to reimburse pharmacies more quickly and conveniently, establish help hotlines for pharmacists and physicians alike, and cut back on the practice of so-called pharmacy âco-brandingâ? by plans that can lead some patients to believe that only certain pharmacies can provide their medicines.    

âThe drug benefit plan should not be a guessing game for seniors,â? Baucus said. âIt should be a simple, clear â what you see is what you get plan. Our seniors should have the peace of mind that what they sign up for is indeed what they are entitled to â things shouldnât disappear or change midway through. Iâm committed to doing all I can to ensure that our Montana seniors have access to quality, affordable health care that makes sense.â?  

The Medicare Simplification Act of 2006:  

â¢           Requires the Health and Human Services Secretary to develop, in addition to the standard prescription drug package outlined in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, five additional types of benefit packages to be offered under Medicare Part D.  Three will be basic packages that would not include coverage of medications during the âcoverage gapâ? that occurs when patientsâ drug bills reach a certain cost.  Two will be supplemental packages that will include coverage of drugs during that gap before catastrophic coverage begins.    
â¢           The HHS department will develop standardized wording, definitions and formats for all packages to help seniors understand and compare them more easily.   
â¢           The simplification bill will solve another problem for Medicare beneficiaries by prohibiting plans from dropping coverage of a drug during a benefit year, and to provide clear information about any changes planned for the next benefit period.    
â¢           Requires drug plans to provide more and clearer information about what drugs they cover.  The process of appealing drug coverage decisions will be streamlined and standardized.     


The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006:  

â¢           Aims to address problems that have arisen for both pharmacists and Medicare beneficiaries during implementation of the benefit so far.    
â¢           Requires plans to reimburse pharmacies for drug costs within as little as 14 days for electronically filed claims, and within 30 days for all other claims.    
â¢           Requires reasonable dispensing fees to pharmacies.    
â¢           Plan providers will be required to establish hotlines offering more timely and accurate information to pharmacists and physicians.    
â¢           Drug plans will be required to use only pharmacies that are true âpoints of accessâ? for the general public.    
â¢           The bill will also place restrictions on the practice of âco-brandingâ? drug benefit cards and materials with pharmacy names.  

Baucus said the legislation will be considered by the Finance Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly.
