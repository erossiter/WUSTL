(Washington, D.C.) â News reports from Capitol Hill today say Congress may be called into session early to approve emergency relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina.  
Montana Senator Max Baucus said heâs on hand in the nationâs capitol and prepared to support the aid package, which is likely to provide $10 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for relief efforts.  
âWhen disaster hits, we as Americans come to the aid of our friends and neighbors,â? Baucus said. âThatâs just the right thing to do.â?  
Congress has been in recess for the month of August and was expected to reconvene after the Labor Day holiday, on Tuesday, September 6. Timing on when the House and Senate will vote on the aid package wasnât immediately clear Thursday.  
Baucus spent most of the summer recess traveling Montana and meeting with his constituents. He returned to Capitol Hill for planning meetings in advance of the Senate returning Tuesday.
