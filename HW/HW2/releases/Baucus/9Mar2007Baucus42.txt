Senator's Fish and Wildlife Trust Accepting Applications For Projects
March 9, 2007
WASHINGTON, D.C.)- More than $860,000 is available this year for wildlife habitat improvement and access to public lands through the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust, U.S. Senator Max Baucus announced today.     

Baucus authored legislation in 1999 that allowed 265 cabin owners to purchase their plots at Canyon Ferry Reservoir from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The bill set up the Conservation Trust to direct proceeds from the cabin sales to non-profit groups to do habitat restoration work and acquire public land access for hunting and fishing.     

Baucus said the Trust began accepting proposals for 2007 on January 27. Applications must be postmarked no later than April 6, 2007.     

Since grants became available from the Trust in 2004, nearly $2.6 million has been available for conservation and public lands projects. A total of 3,556 acres have been acquired through purchase or easements since inception, Baucus said.     

The Canyon Ferry cabin sales, including interest, have generated more than $19 million for the Trust. Only interest generated by the Trust is spent, so the fund will never be depleted, Baucus said.     

"In Montana, we hunt, fish, take our kids camping and hiking," said Baucus, a Helena native. "We're outdoors folks. And we're just starting to see how important this Trust will be to boosting wildlife habitat and our access to public lands. This Trust is a gift that will keep on giving - forever - and that's something we can all be proud of."     

Eligible projects must restore and conserve fisheries, wildlife habitat, enhance public hunting, fishing and recreation opportunities, and improve public access to public lands. While projects will be awarded statewide, at least half of the awards must go to projects located in the Upper Missouri River Corridor, generally between Holter Lake and the town of Three Forks, Baucus said.     

"Thanks to Max's efforts, the joint trust will make available $860,00 in grants for projects that restore and conserve fisheries, wildlife and improve access to public lands. This grant money is a huge boost to recreationalists in our state," stated Bill Orsello, a hunter and the Chair of the Citizens Advisory Board which makes recommendations to the MFWCT.     

Baucus said projects funded by the Trust include:     

â¢           Crow Creek: Acquired about 20 acres for public access in the Helena National Forest on Crow Creek, near the town of Radersberg     
â¢           Whitehorse Creek: Acquired about 20.5 acres on Whitehorse Creek, west of Townsend     
â¢           Elhorn Mtns.: Acquired 235 acres near Winston, in the Elkhorn Mountains between Helena and Townsend     
â¢           Black Bridge: Acquired about 71 acres for the Black Bridge Recreation Area near Glendive, to provide fishing access to the Yellowstone River.     
â¢           Iron Mask: A total of 1080 acres have been purchased in the Iron Mask area, overlooking Canyon Ferry Reservoir.    
â¢           Mt Ascension: Acquired 40 acres of land at the peak of Mt. Ascension in Helena.     
â¢           Oyler Ranch:  Acquiring about 587 acres in the Gallatin Valley, east of Manhattan.     
â¢           Selway Creek: A total of 1,280 acres of the Selway Creek area on Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, west of Dillon.    
â¢           Cedar Creek: Acquired 204 acres near Superior, Montana along the Cedar Creek corridor.     

"I am really proud of our Canyon Ferry bill because it let cabin owners purchase their lands and it set up this program to boost hunting and fishing in Montana," Baucus said. "That's a big win for everyone. This just goes to show what we can accomplish by working together."
