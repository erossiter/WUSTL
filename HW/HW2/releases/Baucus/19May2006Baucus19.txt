Senator Says Programs Stress Importance Of Healthy Diet, Lifestyle
May 19, 2006
Washington, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus has nominated three Montana programs for the national Victory Against Hunger Award.   

Baucus has nominated the St. Labre Indian School in Ashland, the Montana Office of Public Instructionâs Division of Health Enhancement and Safety, and the Missoula Community Food and Agriculture Coalition for the prestigious award.  

Award winners will receive a $1,000 grant. Applications for the grant began April 10 and go through May 31. The winners will be announced in July.   

The award is presented by the Congressional Hunger Center and only members of Congress can nominate programs. Fifteen awards will be given out across the country to groups that excel at this yearâs award theme of fighting hunger through developing local and state school meals wellness programs.  

âAll three of these programs provide valuable services to Montanans, and I am very proud to nominate them for national recognition,â? Baucus said.  

â¢           The St. Labre School was nominated for its outstanding school meal program, which is part of an all-school effort to promote healthy lifestyles. The meal program places heavy emphasis on not only serving healthy foods, but also educating students on why they should eat healthy.   

â¢           The Missoula Community Food and Agriculture Coalition is working to establish a Farms to School Program in Western Montana. This coalition works to integrate healthy, locally grown food into the public school system. In addition to providing healthy food, the coalition also educates students about the benefits of eating healthy.   

â¢           The Office of Public Instructionâs Division of Health Enhancement and Safety works to help schools develop effective wellness policies. To achieve this goal, they have a multi-faceted approach that ranges from passing legislation to training school administrators about the benefits of wellness.
