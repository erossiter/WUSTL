(Washington, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus today urged Congress to pass a relief package to help rebuild the Gulf Coast region and provide the victims of Hurricane Katrina with health care, housing, and employment assistance. 
Baucus is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over many of the nations health care programs, welfare, and all taxes and revenue. Early this week, he proposed a plan to help rebuild the Gulf Coast and help people hurt and displaced by the hurricane. That plan was included today in a sweeping relief package introduced by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) The important thing right now is working together to get these folks the help they need and deserve right away, said Baucus after joining Reid in unveiling the plan. We must take swift action to ease the blow and get folks back on their feet.  The Senate was expected Thursday to also take action on a request by President Bush for Congress to approve an additional $52 billion for the relief effort.
