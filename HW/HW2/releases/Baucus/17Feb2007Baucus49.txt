Senator 'Disappointed' In Failure to Debate the War
February 17, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - The U.S. Senate today rejected an effort to proceed to a debate over the war in Iraq. Proceeding to a debate required a 60-vote super majority. The effort failed on a vote of 56 to 34.     

Baucus, who voted to proceed to a debate, released the following statement.     

"Our job as United States Senators is to debate the tough issues facing our nation. If we can't debate, we can't do our job. A teacher can't just decide not to show up to class, or a farmer can't just decide not to harvest. As an employee of 900,000 Montanans I want to work hard and do my job.     

"It's time for Republicans and Democrats put aside our differences, debate this issue, and work together to find the best way to get Iraq to stand on its own two feet. I cancelled my trip to Iraq this weekend because I wanted to stay and debate the most important issue facing America in a generation. But we were denied an open and honest debate. That does a disservice to our country and the democratic process. I'm very disappointed."
