SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $700,000 to build on a statewide education technology initiative Sen. David Vitter started in 2004. The bill directs $100,000 each to seven Louisiana school boards, including Calcasieu, Lincoln, Livingston, Plaquemines, Rapides, St. Bernard and Vermillion. 
   "I am grateful that my colleagues understand the importance of promoting education technology in Louisiana," said Vitter. "This federal funding for improving technology will be a boost for Louisiana students and help prepare our children for 21st Century jobs."
   The $700,000 in federal funding will be used for the seven school boards to upgrade the technology in the classrooms to get children accustomed to technology early. This marks the third year that Vitter has secured funding for this initiative.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
