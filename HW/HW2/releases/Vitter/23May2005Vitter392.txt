SEN. VITTER JOINS CAFTA ACTION CAUCUS
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that he has joined the CAFTA Action Caucus, a congressional caucus that opposes the Central American Free Trade Agreement. 
   "Our sugar farmers and processors work hard and deserve a level playing field to do their jobs and support their families," said Vitter. "I've joined the CAFTA Action Caucus to work with a bipartisan group to keep CAFTA from passing because I believe it will hurt the Louisiana sugar industry."
   Louisiana is home to 27,000 sugar industry jobs, 15 sugar mills, two refineries, and more than 580,000 acres of sugar cane throughout 24 parishes. Louisiana produces 20 percent of the country's sugar. Sugar is a $2 billion industry and has been a vital part of Louisiana's history and way of life for more than 200 years.
   The United States is already the fourth largest net sugar importer in the world, importing from 41 countries every year. Allowing more imports from select CAFTA trading partners would flood the market and displace more domestic sugar. CAFTA could also set the stage for even more bilateral agreements focused on the largest sugar-producing nations.
   "I have supported and voted for a variety of trade agreements in the past because increased trade, when achieved through a true level playing field, helps grow the economy and create jobs," said Vitter. "I cannot support CAFTA as currently negotiated because the import increase will flood the U.S. market and devastate the Louisiana sugar industry."
