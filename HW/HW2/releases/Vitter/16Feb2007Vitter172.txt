SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS LOUISIANA HOUSE VOTE FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM
  Sen. David Vitter on Friday, Feb. 16, applauded the Louisiana House of Representative's vote to reject the Joint Budget Committee's recommendation to spend $300 million in federal hurricane disaster funds to build a new, large Charity Hospital building in New Orleans. 
   "I am glad to see that so many members of the Louisiana House of Representatives understand the importance of moving away from our old, failed two-tier health care system that segregated care for the poor. This vote is a real win for reform and change. I am hopeful that we can now all work together on health care redesign to produce a health care system that provides real access, quality and choice for all Louisianans," Vitter said.
   The Joint Budget Committee's recommendation failed to secure the 53 votes needed for passage in the House, so it will not be sent to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for consideration.
