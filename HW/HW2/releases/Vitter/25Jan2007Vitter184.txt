SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR LIVINGSTON PARISH
  Sen. David Vitter announced on Thursday, Jan. 25, that Livingston Parish will receive a federal grant of more than $1million to expand and improve its water system in the village of Albany and the surrounding areas. 
   "This federal funding will help improve the quality of life for the residents of Albany," said Vitter. "All citizens deserve access to a safe and dependable supply of drinking water, and this funding will address those concerns." 
   This grant of $1,038,000 will go toward the expansion and connection of water lines, purchase of an elevated storage tank and purchase of new property. The funding will allow water services to expand to 650 new users. The grant is provided under the Water and Waste Loan and Grant Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development.
