SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON CORPS ANNOUNCEMENT
  Sen. David Vitter made the following comments today after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announcement on levee preparedness:
   "This Corps announcement is a huge disappointment. I have been told for months that our system would be considerably stronger this season than the day before Katrina, though we had much more short-term work to do. I no longer have confidence in that being the case. 
   "The Corps leadership is completely failed and the Corps process completely broken. I'm in the process of telling President Bush this privately and in excruciating detail."
