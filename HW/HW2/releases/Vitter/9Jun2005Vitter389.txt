SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.7 MILLION LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN BASIN FOUNDATION
  Sen. David Vitter announced that $1.7 million in federal funding for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program was included in the Senate Interior Appropriations Bill, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today. 
   "Local grassroots organizations and many others have made a lot of progress on cleaning up Lake Pontchartrain, and this funding is going to get us even closer to finishing the job," Vitter said. "This $1.7 million in federal funding for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program will advance these efforts so that one day the lake will be fully restored."
   As a freshman in Congress, Vitter authored and passed into law the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, which created a partnership between the federal government and local stakeholders to further efforts to clean up the lake. Through this program Vitter has steered nearly $20 million to Louisiana for cleanup efforts in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin.
   "We're delighted. The funding is desperately needed to continue the restoration of Lake Pontchartrain. We greatly appreciate Sen. Vitter's work, and we will use this funding for restoration from habitat preservation to water quality enhancement," said Carlton Dufrechou, executive director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation.
   Lake Pontchartrain is the second largest lake in the United States after the Great Lakes and is surrounded by 1.5 million residents, making it the most populated area in the state of Louisiana. 
   The 16 parishes in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin are Ascension, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberville, Jefferson, Livingston, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington.
   The Interior Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this summer.
