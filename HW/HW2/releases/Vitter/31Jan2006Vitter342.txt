  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement on the confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.  
 The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Alito by a vote of 58-42:
    "I believe that Samuel Alito will 'uphold the rule of law,' and I was proud to cast my vote for his confirmation to the Supreme Court.
   "I voted to confirm Judge Alito because he is superbly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and because he possesses a conservative judicial philosophy, which I believe to be an essential quality in a federal judge. 
   "After studying his record, meeting with him personally and watching his confirmation hearings, I believe that Alito is imminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and that he will interpret the law based on the Constitution and rules of Congress."
