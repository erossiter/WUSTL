SEN. VITTER POSES SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR PRESIDENT BUSH'S STRATEGY FOR IRAQ
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today made the follow statement regarding the upcoming release of the president's strategy for Iraq. 
   "After meeting with the president yesterday to discuss his new strategy in Iraq, I look forward to hearing the full details of his plan tomorrow night.
   "Among the most important questions I hope to have answered are the following:
   1. What has Prime Minister Maliki promised in regards to tightening pressure on Muqtada al-Sadr and the militias?
   2. What specific goals will be used to monitor success or failure?
   3. How does an increase of 20,000 troops change the situation on the ground?
   4. How long is the increase troop level planned to last?
   "I hope the president's speech will address these questions, and I plan to continue asking tough questions in the coming U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others," said Vitter.
   Last fall, Sen. Vitter toured Iraq and met with Louisiana troops. He is a new member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
