  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today presented Livingston Parish President Mike Grimmer with a federal grant of $68,000 to build a community recreational trail at Denham Springs Freshman High School. 
   "The trail is a great addition to Livingston Parish," said Vitter. "This innovative project will provide the residents of Denham Springs with a natural recreational area to enjoy outdoor activities."
   This grant will go toward the construction of a 1,600 foot trail at Denham Springs Freshman High School. The trail will be open to the public and is aimed toward the youth and elderly of Denham Springs. It will include a walking trail, fitness area and recreational area.
   "Thank you to our Federal and State Delegation for assistance in securing the $68,000 to construct the community walking trail. This trail will be a wonderful resource for the entire community and we are looking forward to the community utilizing this facility this summer," said President Grimmer.
