SEN. VITTER TO TESTIFY AT COMMITTEE HEARING ON POST-KATRINA CRIME ON JULY 20
  Sen. David Vitter will testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday July 20th on crime challenges following Hurricane Katrina. The hearing begins at 10:00 a.m. ET/9:00 a.m. CT.  
   "This hearing will provide an opportunity to discuss solutions to the crime problems we've been facing since Hurricane Katrina. These issues include crime in a rebuilding New Orleans and the tracking and monitoring of criminal elements that scattered throughout the state as a result of hurricane evacuations," said Vitter. I have been working with the Department of Justice and state and local law enforcement to address these problems, and I have also worked to secure funding for these groups to help them fight the rise in crime. It is important that we address these issues now to continue encouraging people to visit and rebuild in the greater New Orleans area and to ensure the safety of our communities."
   Others who are testifying at the hearing include Jim Letten, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, David Bell, Chief Judge Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, Robert Stellingworth, President and CEO of New Orleans Police and Justice Foundation, Anthony Cannatella, Deputy Police Commissioner, and Hans Marticiuc, President of Houston's Police Officers' Union.
