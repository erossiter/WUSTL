SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS COMMITMENT FROM U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Sen. David Vitter on Tuesday, Feb. 13, applauded the announcement from U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that the U.S. Department of Justice is continuing their efforts to address the needs of law enforcement officials following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   "On November 16, 2006, I along with Rafael Goyeneche of the Metropolitan Crime Commission met with DOJ and U.S. Marshals Service to stress the importance of protecting victims and witnesses to crimes," said Vitter. "To end the reign of fear, we must protect our citizens and enable them to assist law enforcement, and the Department of Justice has offered enormous support and assistance to our law enforcement as recovery continues."
   The Department of Justice has committed funds to pay for two victim assistance specialists who can provide advice and support to victims and witnesses of crimes. 
   "Once again Senator Vitter and the Department of Justice have responded to a pressing local need by providing the leadership and resources needed to address the long-standing problem of victim and witness cooperation," added Goyeneche.
   These victim specialists will establish a regional victims services committee to lead and coordinate victims assistance efforts within Orleans and Jefferson Parishes; provide essential training and outreach to communities and participating local law enforcement offices as well as schools, community centers and faith-based organizations; educate the general population as well as victims about the criminal justice process; and provide essential advice, counseling and services to victims and witnesses served by the local criminal justice system.
