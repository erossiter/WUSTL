SEN. VITTER SECURES $131 MILLION FOR PORT OF IBERIA
  Sen. David Vitter today secured funding for work at the Port of Iberia in the Water Resources Development Act.  
   "Louisiana's hurricane, flood and coastal protection took a giant leap forward today with the authorization of this funding. This funding will be instrumental in the port's growth and in increasing hurricane protection for Vermilion Parish," said Vitter.
   This authorization provides $131.25 million for a deepening project at the Port of Iberia, and it improves hurricane protection for Vermilion Parish. It will provide a 16-foot access channel to the Port of Iberia which is currently 12-feet deep. In addition, it will integrate navigation and hurricane protection by requiring that the spoil material from dredging the deeper channel be used to raise hurricane protection levees on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and Freshwater Bayou for Vermilion Parish. 
   "This is tremendous news for Vermilion Parish and the Port of Iberia. By deepening the port channel, we will be boosting economic development and improving hurricane protection at the same time. This is a win-win for South Louisiana," said Vitter.
   This legislation is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. It will then go to a Conference Committee with the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
