SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS PRESIDENT'S VETO OF SCHIP
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today applauded President Bush for his veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Plan Expansion Bill. 
   "I strongly support continuing the SCHIP program to cover low-income children. But this bill is a dramatic expansion, which would include many adults and families with incomes of $75,000 or more in other states," said Vitter. "Why should a Louisiana family earning $40,000 help pay for free health care for a New York family earning $75,000?"
   Vitter is developing alternative legislation with others to both continue SCHIP for low-income children and make private health insurance available to all - with government help if necessary.
   "This SCHIP expansion actually pushes some folks off their private insurance," added Vitter. "That's moving in the wrong direction."
