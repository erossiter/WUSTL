SEN. VITTER SECURES AUTHORIZATION FOR $9.8 MILLION AT FORT POLK
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Defense Authorization Bill, which passed the U.S. Senate today by a vote of 96-0, included funding authorization for Fort Polk. 
   "I am very grateful to my colleagues for understanding how important Fort Polk is to Louisiana and to our nation's defense," said Vitter. "Funding for this project will only strengthen Fort Polk's standing as an asset to our military and will provide a permanent home for the Fourth Brigade/10th Mountain Division."
   The $9.8 million in authorized funds would go toward the construction of a new headquarters for the Fourth Brigade/10th Mountain Division at Fort Polk. This unit was activated in January 2005, and since that time the brigade combat team has operated out of a 30-year-old facility.
   As part of the Brigade's transformation to a Brigade Combat Team of Action, a new state-of-the-art headquarters facility is essential to support the Brigade's enhanced mission capabilities.
   "Authorization is the first concrete step in making this funding a reality," Vitter said. "The bill now moves to a House-Senate Conference Committee, and I hope that they will meet in the near future to get this project closer to completion."
