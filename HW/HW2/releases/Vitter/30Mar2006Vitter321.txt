SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON CHAIRMAN POWELL BRIEFING
  Sen. David Vitter made the following comments today about yesterday's briefing with Federal Gulf Recovery and Rebuild Chairman Don Powell: 
   "Don Powell laid out for us an additional $6 billion of essential levee work in the metro New Orleans area that must be done. This is enormously frustrating to me. I've been telling them since last November that they've sought way too little money for essential levee work, and this finally confirms that. Only it comes after months of stonewalling, with the new hurricane season right around the corner. 
   "I've called a high-level meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chairman Powell and others for this afternoon to get to the bottom of this and decide how we're going to get this work done quickly."
