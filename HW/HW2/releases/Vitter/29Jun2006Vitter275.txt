SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR HAMMOND IN SENATE INTERIOR & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the Senate Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $500,000 for drainage laterals in the city of Hammond. 
   "I appreciate that my Senate colleagues recognize the importance of flood prevention projects in southeast Louisiana," said Vitter. "This funding will help Hammond proactively solve storm-related problems."
   The $500,000 in federal funding will be used toward the construction and improvement of drainage laterals that are causing erosion and flooding problems for houses and roadways in Hammond. This construction project is preventive and will help solve future storm-related flooding problems. 
   "I am extremely excited for the city and its residents with this federal funding for the project. I thank Senator Vitter for helping find funds to protect Hammond in future storms and our legislators for tirelessly working to bring this project to fruition," said Hammond Mayor Mayson Foster.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The Senate Interior Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this year.
