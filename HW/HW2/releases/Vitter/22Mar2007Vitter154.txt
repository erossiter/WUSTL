SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE'S APPROVED, REWORKED HOSPITAL PLAN
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, March 22, made the following statement on the Louisiana Legislature's reworked funding plan for a new LSU hospital in New Orleans: 
   "This revised plan supports the compromise agreement I discussed with Gov. Blanco and others. I support this decision to provide $74 million for preliminary work on an LSU teaching hospital in New Orleans. As we move forward we need to commit to health care redesign to produce a health care system that provides real access, quality and choice for all Louisianans.
   "I've also been in regular contact with the Veterans Affairs secretary. He's made it clear to me that he wants to work with LSU in the context of broad health care redesign and that he wants the VA facility to stay in Southeast Louisiana no matter what," said Vitter.
