SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES WHITE HOUSE SAP CHANGE ON MORGANZA
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that the White House has changed the Statement of Administrative Policy on the Water Resources Development Act. Last week Vitter objected to a provision in a draft Statement of Administrative Policy urging further delays in construction on the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection project. 
   "Since discovering the plan to delay the approval of the Morganza to the Gulf project in the draft SAP, I have been in contact with White House officials, Army Corps of Engineers officials and OMB Director Rob Portman about concerns over the Morganza language. As a result of these meetings, the administration has lifted its objection to the Morganza provision," said Vitter. 
   The final SAP should be released today.
   "Through the WRDA reforms I developed, the Corps will have more flexibility to ensure that our hurricane protection and coastal restoration projects are complimentary of one another. This flexibility will keep Morganza on track," added Vitter.
