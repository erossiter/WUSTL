SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING CHALLENGES LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE ON IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on the U.S. Senate's vote on the motion to proceed on the Kennedy Immigration Compromise Bill drafted late last week: 
   "This is an absolute rush to judgment and rush to pass this bill. This so-called compromise was hatched among a small group of senators and is now being forced upon the Senate without allowing all senators the proper time to study, debate and negotiate this very large and sweeping legislation.
   "In the rush to pass this bill there are many questions left unanswered by this supposed grand bargain, including how much this will cost the U.S. taxpayer. We do not have any cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office on this bill - a cost that will be with us for decades to come. Who will pick up the tab? 
   "I also have grave concerns about the Z visa provision in this compromise legislation. Make no mistake, Z visas are amnesty. I oppose amnesty and will be offering amendments to address these Z visas. The American people deserve a vote on that amendment so that the Senate is on record about this issue and many other concerns in this rushed bill. 
   "The American public deserves answers to all of these questions. They deserve the right to a full deliberative discussion that is traditional of the Senate. If the American people knew the details of Kennedy Immigration bill and what they will be forced to live with for next 25 years, there would be a large outcry," said Vitter.
