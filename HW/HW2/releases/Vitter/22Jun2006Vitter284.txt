SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR NORTH LOUISIANA PROJECTS
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $238,000 for projects in north Louisiana.  
   "I appreciate that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee understand the benefit of these projects to north Louisiana," said Vitter. "We must address the concerns of our rural areas, including keeping a fresh, clean water supply for our residents and community development." 
   The bill includes $124,000 for the Union-Lincoln Parish Regional Water Conservation Initiative, which will help identify and develop an alternative water supply to abate the overuse of the Sparta Aquifer in north central Louisiana. 
   The Louisiana Tech Rural Development Center will receive $114,000 in the bill. The center is a source of information for rural citizens and a resource to rural communities and community leaders on community development and other issues of importance to rural areas. 
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for these projects," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill." 
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this year.
