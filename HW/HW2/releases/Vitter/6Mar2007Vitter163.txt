SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON VOTE AGAINST BIA NOMINEE CARL ARTMAN
  Sen. David Vitter on Tuesday, March 6, made the following statement about his vote against the nomination of Carl Artman to be Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the Department of Interior: 
   "I objected to Mr. Artman's nomination because of frustrations over the department's lack of leadership in implementing real reforms to reign in the expansion of Indian gaming and particularly off-reservation casinos. I have long advocated for Indian gaming reforms and have offered legislation that would prohibit forum-shopping by tribes and give local communities more input into the department's decision-making process on Indian gaming. The department needs to take concrete steps to address these and other reforms needed in this process," Vitter said.
