SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LEVEE BOARD CONSOLIDATION
 Sen. David Vitter issued the following statement on levee board consolidation:  
   "I strongly support fundamental levee board reform and consolidation like that embodied in the Boasso bill. First, it's the right thing to do to truly protect Louisiana citizens. And second, it's absolutely necessary to prove to Washington and the country that we're getting our act together. 
   "Exactly what does fundamental reform and consolidation mean? It has to mean having a blue ribbon committee selection process that puts real experts on the board and not political cronies. It has to mean stripping out all non-flood control responsibilities and having the board focus purely on levees. And it must mean major consolidation on a broad regional basis and not numerous, competing small jurisdictions."
