SEN. VITTER NAMED CONFEREE FOR WRDA
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today was named a conferee in the House-Senate legislative conference on the Water Resources Development Act. 
   "I am pleased to again be named a conferee on the WRDA bill. We came a long way in conference negotiations last year, and I plan to actively work to make sure that WRDA is quickly sent to the president's desk," said Vitter.
   In last year's legislative conference, Vitter negotiated key Louisiana protections and reforms ranging from the closure of the MRGO to true 100-year hurricane protection. As a result of those negotiations, many of those provision remained in this year's version of the bill. 
   "Last year, critical agreements between the House and Senate were reached on virtually all issues pertaining to Louisiana. I will be working to keep Louisiana's priorities at the forefront of negotiations in this year's bill as well," said Vitter. 
   In this year's WRDA conference, Vitter will work to build upon the key provisions he secured including the authorization of an expedited path to Category 5 hurricane protection, retaining the Senate approved framework for comprehensive coastal restoration projects, full closure and restoration of MRGO, authorization of the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane project and securing and improving Louisiana's vital port and navigation channels.
