SEN. VITTER MEETS WITH PENTAGON OFFICIALS ABOUT B-52S
  Sen. David Vitter joined other members of the Louisiana delegation for a briefing with Pentagon officials yesterday on the proposed reduction of the B-52s and the effect it would have on Barksdale. Following are Sen. Vitter's comments about the meeting: 
   "We had a very good briefing from Brig. Gen. Charles Lyon about this question of the B-52s, and I was joined by Sen. Landrieu and Congressman McCrery. We're all very, very concerned about a proposed reduction of B-52s and any impact that could have in the future on Barksdale.
   "As I explained to Gen. Lyon, my first concern is about national defense, and based on what I know, I really believe this proposed reduction is an idea of the bean counters trying to save money and not an idea of the commanders, in terms of real national security concerns.
   "I also explained to him, and he really couldn't argue the point, that the B-52 is enormously capable, it's the only platform we have for cruise missiles. It's much more capable in many ways than the B-1 or the B-2. So I think in general the discussion was very positive and very helpful.
   "We don't know exactly what will happen with this proposal, but I am hopeful on a number of respects. First, the Air Force has tried to cut the number of B-52s for amny years in the past and have always failed. Second, Barksdale has enormous capability - it's very solid and very well positioned in terms of its future use for the Air Force and the military.
   "And that was really reaffirmed by the recent round of BRAC, where Barksdale was rated very high. In fact, because of BRAC, Barksdale is getting more people and more assets, not less. So in general, I'm very confident in terms of the capability of Barksdale. It will be there for the future, it's not just tied to one platform. And it will continue to play a very important part of the economy of northwest Louisiana.".
