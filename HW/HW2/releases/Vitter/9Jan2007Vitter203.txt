SEN. VITTER, REP. BOUSTANY ANNOUNCE GRANT FUNDING FOR CAMERON FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter and Rep. Charles Boustany announced today that four fire districts in Cameron Parish will receive federal grants to meet the growing needs of each department. Cameron Fire Protection District #7 will receive a grant of $300,000. Cameron Fire Protection District #9 will receive $80,000. Cameron Fire Protection District #14 will receive $550,000, and the Hackberry Fire Protection District will receive $300,000. 
   "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita illustrated the importance of first responders to our communities," said Vitter. "They play a critical role in the protection of each and every citizen, and this funding provides vital help to rural communities."
   "The firefighters and first responders of Cameron Parish were among the unsung heroes of Hurricane Rita, and this funding is a testament to their dedicated service," Boustany said. 
   Each fire district will use the grants differently. District #7 will purchase a new pumper truck, apparatus truck and other necessary equipment and protective gear. District #9 will purchase a new command post trailer. District #14 will purchase a ladder truck, hoses, nozzles and communication equipment. The Hackberry District will purchase an emergency response system and vehicle.
   "Cameron Parish was devastated by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, and helping these communities rebuild their fire protection is a vital step toward recovery," Vitter said.
   "I'm pleased that the USDA has seen fit to upgrade these emergency response services so Cameron Parish can adequately prepare for any future disasters," said Boustany.
   These grants are provided through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Community Facilities Grant Program. They are also part of the Natural Disaster Funding Initiative.
