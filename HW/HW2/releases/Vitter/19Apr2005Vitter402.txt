SEN. VITTER TESTIFIES BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTATION
  Sen. David Vitter testified today before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions at a hearing called "An Approach to Drug Importation."  
 Vitter's first bill in the U.S. Senate was S. 109, the "Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2005," which would put affordable prescription drugs within the reach of all Americans.
   "This is an issue that I feel strongly about, which is why it was the first bill I introduced in the U.S. Senate," said Vitter. "Drug importation is neither a conservative nor a liberal issue. It is a universal issue and a challenge to provide our nation's consumers access to safe and affordable drugs."
   Vitter's legislation was created to give all Americans immediate relief from the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. This bill would, for the first time, legalize individual consumers' importation of certain prescription drugs for their personal use. In addition, the bill includes new requirements to existing law to promote the safety of domestic and imported drugs. This bill also has safeguards to protect the safety of consumers, including requirements for either tamper-proof packaging or for testing of drug imports.
   "It's time for action. America's seniors demand legislative action to lower their drug costs," said Vitter.
   In his testimony, Vitter reviewed the potential savings drug importation offers American consumers, explained why drug importation would not drain money from research and development at pharmaceutical companies and detailed how drug importation could be carried out safely to protect our consumers.
