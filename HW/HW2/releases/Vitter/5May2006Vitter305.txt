SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.7 MILLION FOR HOUMA POLICE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that the Houma Police Department will receive a federal grant of $1.7 million from the Interoperable Communications Technology Program. 
   "Interoperable communication is critical for first responders to provide public safety in Terrebonne Parish and throughout the state," said Vitter. "One of the major issues facing first responders is the inability to communicate with each other in emergency situations. This $1.7 million in federal funds will help the Houma Police Department communicate better during a crisis."
   The $1.7 million will be used to develop interoperable communications networks that enable first responders to communicate directly during crises. The grant will offset the cost of purchasing voice and data communications equipment, enhancing communications infrastructures and project management.
   The Interoperable Communications Technology grants fund projects that will help increase interoperability and data information sharing among the law enforcement, fire service and emergency medical service communities. The program is administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services at the U.S. Department of Justice.
