SEN. VITTER CONFIDENT IN SAINTS VICTORY
  Sen. David Vitter on Tuesday, January 16, made a friendly wager with U.S. Sen. Barack Obama on this weekend's National Football League NFC Championship Game.
   "The Saints will march through Chicago and make it a black and gold Super Bowl," Vitter said.
   The loser of the wager has to make congratulatory remarks on the floor of the U.S. Senate and serve the winner's staff a sampling of home cuisine.
