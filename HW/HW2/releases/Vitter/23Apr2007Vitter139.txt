  Sen. David Vitter today applauded the New Orleans District of the U.S. Postal Service for their decision to hold a public meeting with Northshore residents. The New Orleans District Office recently announced a plan to relocate mail processing operations currently in Mandeville. 
   "On April 11, I wrote a letter requesting that the Postal Service hold a public meeting to discuss their plan to relocate the Mandeville processing center. I am pleased that they have decided to hold this meeting and take the opportunity to discuss concerns with the residents and business owners who may be affected by the planned move," said Vitter.
