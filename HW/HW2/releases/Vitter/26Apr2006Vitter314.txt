SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY AMENDMENTS TO HURRICANE SUPPLEMENTAL
  Sen. David Vitter released the following statement today about the U.S. Senate vote on two amendments to the hurricane emergency supplemental bill dealing with border security.  
   "If we expand this bill to cover other areas like border security, we must have budget offsets. It's just essential that we not continue to drive up the overall cost of the bill. Upping the overall number would increase the cost-cutting pressure in the conference committee, which would in turn threaten our top Louisiana hurricane recovery priorities in the bill. We must protect those priorities - particularly our homeowner assistance and levee funds," said Vitter.
   This afternoon the Senate approved New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg's amendment that will provide $1.9 billion for border security but would require budget offsets. In addition, the Senate defeated an amendment by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) that would have spent additional money on border security, but contained no budget offsets. If it had passed, Reid's amendment would have jeopardized the passage of the hurricane emergency supplemental and the much needed money for levees in New Orleans. Vitter voted for Gregg's amendment and against Reid's amendment.
