HONORING OLD GLORY
  Although most businesses do not close in observance of it, Flag Day is still very important to our nation's history. Flag Day is celebrated on June 14, and this year is officially the 58th anniversary of National Flag Day. But Flag Day was celebrated long before President Wilson signed a proclamation declaring a National Flag Day. There are records showing that Flag Day was celebrated as far back as 1885. 
   The American flag is a symbol of freedom and hope, which is why I co-sponsored a proposed amendment to the Constitution to make it illegal to desecrate the American flag. We need to protect the flag and not allow people to burn or destroy it. 
   Many songs and our pledge give honor to the flag as it symbolizes the uniqueness of the American experience, especially the Star-Spangled Banner. Francis Scott Key wrote the Star-Spangled Banner in 1814 after the battle at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Key saw a tattered American flag flying over Fort McHenry after a night-long battle and was inspired to write the Star-Spangled Banner, one of the most famous songs in American history. 
   Although the flag has many different names - Stars and Stripes, Old Glory and Star-Spangled Banner - it always stands for the same thing. It represents American history, American sacrifice and hope for our nation's future. And whenever we pledge allegiance to the flag or sing the Star-Spangled Banner, we remember the flag's history and importance to our country.
