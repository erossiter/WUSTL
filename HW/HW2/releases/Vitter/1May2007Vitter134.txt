SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR LAFOURCHE
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that Golden Meadow will receive a federal grant of $492,000 to construct a town hall. 
   "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught us all a lesson on how important it is to have an operations center in place during an emergency. The new town hall will be a great asset to Golden Meadow and all of its citizens," said Vitter.
   This grant will be used to construct a town hall building that will also be used as an emergency operations center. On a daily basis the facility will serve Golden Meadow as a town hall, and during times of emergency the facility will serve the entire south Lafourche Parish area and Grand Isle as an emergency operations center. The grant is provided under the Community Facilities Loan and Grant Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development.
