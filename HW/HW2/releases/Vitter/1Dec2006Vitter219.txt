SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON PROGRESS OF TWO CRITICAL LOUISIANA BILLS STILL AWAITING VOTES THIS CONGRESS
Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on two critical Louisiana bills and their progress as Congress prepares to adjourn for the year: 
 "Next week will be one of the most important weeks in Louisiana's history. Both the outer continental shelf energy bill and the Water Resources Development Act are inches from the goal line.
 I am very pleased to learn that the House has finally scheduled a vote for next Tuesday on the OCS energy bill negotiated by the Gulf Coast Senators. While some hurdles still remain - the House vote will require support from two-thirds of the House Members in order to pass the OCS bill rather than the regular simple majority - I am optimistic that we will have good news next week. 
 The OCS energy bill's passage is critical for Louisiana. Not only does it give Louisiana its fair share of the oil and gas revenues, but the bill also provides the resources to fund the comprehensive coastal, flood and hurricane protections that I fought for in the WRDA bill," said Vitter.
