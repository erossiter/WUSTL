SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT
Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on the Iraq Study Group report: 
 "I was very impressed with the study group's presentation today, and I look forward to reading their full report. To me, their presentation makes clear that there's no quick fix in Iraq. I hope the report can lead to a bipartisan consensus on a new course to include more focus using our troops for training, more imbedding of our troops in the Iraqi army toward that end, and a demand that the Iraqi government reach real benchmarks on key political and reconciliation issues," said Vitter.
