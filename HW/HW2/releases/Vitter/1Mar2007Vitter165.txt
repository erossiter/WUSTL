SEN. VITTER TO TALK WITH BUSH ABOUT SUPPLEMENTAL NEEDS FOR RECOVERY
  Sen. David Vitter is traveling to Louisiana on Thursday, March 1, with President Bush aboard Air Force One and will discuss with him three immediate needs for Louisiana's hurricane recovery in the emergency supplemental.  
   Vitter is pushing for $1.3-3.2 billion to be added to the emergency supplemental bill before Congress to address the funding shortfall for levee work. He is also requesting additional flexibility for the Corps of Engineers so that they can more efficiently perform work as recovery projects are ready to be implemented. 
   In addition Vitter said language needs to be added to the supplemental to accelerate the Corps' work on closing MRGO. He said the deadline for the Corps to finalize plans and move toward construction on MRGO closure should be pushed up from December to June. 
   Vitter wrote Senate leadership yesterday requesting these three provisions. (To view Letter visit http://www.vitter.senate.gov/forms/emergencysupplemental.pdf.)
   "These are true emergency needs that represent work already committed to by President Bush and Congress to help Louisiana recover," Vitter said.
   The Senate is expected to debate the emergency supplemental on the floor in March.
