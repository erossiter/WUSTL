SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON KATRINA VIDEO
  Sen. David Vitter issued the following statement in response to new video showing federal officials at a briefing about Hurricane Katrina:
    "This makes it perfectly clear once again that this disaster was not out of the blue or unforeseeable. It was not only predictable - it was actually predicted. That's what makes the failures in response - at the local, state, and federal level - all the more outrageous.".
