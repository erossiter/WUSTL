SEN. VITTER AUTHORS LEGISLATION TO FORGIVE COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS
  Sen. David Vitter today introduced legislation to forgive the 2005 Community Disaster Loans that parish and local governments in Louisiana received after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In October 2005, Sen. David Vitter passed the Community Disaster Loan Act to help local governments and municipalities stay in operation following the devastating effects of the hurricanes. 
   "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were catastrophic natural disasters, and the local governments in South Louisiana needed assistance to keep basic operations running," said Vitter. "Historically, the president forgives loans given to local governments following such devastating disasters, and Louisiana deserves this too."
   Vitter's new legislation seeks to have the president forgive these loans. Local governments in Louisiana received nearly $577 million in CDL funds with the city of New Orleans receiving $120 million. 
   "The CDL funds were vital in keeping local governments operational following Katrina and Rita allowing essential city services, such as police protection and trash pick-up, to continue as each town and city began to rebuild," said Vitter. "But now we need the president to forgive those loans and allow the local governments to continue putting their money toward rebuilding and recovery efforts."
