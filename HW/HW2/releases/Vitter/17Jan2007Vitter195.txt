SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR ETHEL FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced on Wednesday, January 17, that the Ethel Volunteer Fire Department will receive a federal grant of $14,250 to meet the growing needs of the department. 
   "Volunteer firefighters are vital in protecting our rural communities, and they need access to the proper equipment and training," said Vitter. "This funding will help them acquire this equipment and will ensure the citizens of Ethel have the best fire protection possible."
   This grant will be used to support the firefighters and help them secure the necessary equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training and other resources needed to protect the public and emergency personnel from fire and related hazards. The funding is provided by the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
