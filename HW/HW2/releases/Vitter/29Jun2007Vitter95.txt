SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS FDA BAN ON CHINESE SEAFOOD
  Sen. David Vitter today applauded the recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to implement a ban on farm-raised seafood imported from China. 
   "For years Louisiana shrimpers and fishermen have been telling us about the potential chemicals and other foreign elements in Chinese farm-raised seafood imports, and I have been working on behalf of domestic producers to ensure a fair and level playing field so that imported shrimp has to comply with all of the food safety laws that domestic producers have to comply with," said Vitter.
   Vitter secured language calling for more rigorous seafood import screening in the FY06 Agriculture Appropriations Bill. During the debate, he raised concerns about the fact that the FDA inspects less than 2 percent of the seafood being imported into the United States. Vitter is also working to ensure our trade laws are enforced so that China, Thailand and other countries can't get away with dumping illegal seafood in our market.
   "I applaud the FDA for making this decision and leveling the playing field for our domestic shrimpers and fishermen," Vitter said. 
   The FDA has stated it will not allow the importation of these Chinese seafood products until they are sure that they are free of residues from drugs that are not approved in the United States.
