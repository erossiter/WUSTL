SEN. VITTER OFFERS AMENDMENT REALLOCATING LOST FUNDING TO US-VISIT PROGRAM
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today offered an amendment to the FY 2009 budget resolution denying funding to the International Seabed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. This funding is associated with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Vitter's amendment shifts funding to the US-VISIT program that tracks visitors to the United States to ensure that they do not stay beyond the expiration of their visas. 
   "I questioned Secretary Rice as to the logic behind the inclusion of this funding in the president's budget," said Vitter. "The budget provides $5 million for international bodies associated with a treaty that has yet to receive full debate or consideration by the Senate."
   Vitter has been a vocal opponent of the Law of the Sea treaty in the U.S. Senate and has raised multiple concerns about the treaty's sovereignty and international law ramifications. In previous Foreign Relations Committee meetings he has called for more hearings and testimony on the ramifications of the treaty. Vitter also called on other U.S. Senate Committees affected by the treaty, like the Environment and Public Works Committee, to hold additional hearings to ensure that the full Senate is aware of all implications of the treaty's full ratification.
   "Notwithstanding the many concerns I have regarding this treaty's impact on American sovereignty and security, funding a treaty that has not yet been ratified simply assumes too much, and these monies could be far better used by the US-VISIT program, which would strengthen our national security protocols, instead of weakening them like LOST would do."
