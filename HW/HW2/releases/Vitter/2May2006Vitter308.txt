SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES PASSAGE OF SENATE AMENDMENT CONTAINING $3.7 BILLION FOR HURRICANE PROTECTION
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement on passage of New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici's amendment to the hurricane emergency supplemental bill. Vitter was a cosponsor of the amendment. 
   "This is great news for New Orleans and southeast Louisiana. With Senate passage of the Domenici amendment, which includes $2.2 billion for our levees, we are another step closer to having the protection we need. I appreciate the hard work of Senator Domenici and look forward to working with the Senate leadership to pass this important hurricane supplemental this week," said Vitter.
   The Domenici-Vitter Amendment would grant Louisiana $3.7 billion worth of hurricane protection projects. It would include the president's initial $1.46 billion request from February and an additional $2.2 billion request last week. 
   The money would go to the following U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects:
   * $1.58 billion to replace "I" walls with "T" walls. 
   * $20 million to conduct a full levee inventory and to evaluate the structural integrity of all protection systems. 
   * $495 million to raise levees in the greater New Orleans area for a higher level of vertical protection. 
   * $530 million for modifications to the 17th Street, Orleans and London Avenue canals. This includes closures and pump stations. 
   * $250 million to storm proof pump stations - including protection for those manning the stations - to allow for sustained pumping through hurricanes. 
   * $170 million to armor levees. 
   * $350 million for closures on the Industrial Canal and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. 
   * $215 million for non-federal levees on the West Bank in Plaquemines Parish. 
   * $125 million to advance plans and construction consistent with the Louisiana Coastal Area project. The focus of this work will be on restoration that will help to temper storm surge. 
   The hurricane emergency supplemental bill is expected to pass the U.S. Senate this week.
