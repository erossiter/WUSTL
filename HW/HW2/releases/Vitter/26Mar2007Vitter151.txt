SEN. VITTER LEADS DELEGATION LETTER ADVANCING HEALTH CARE REDESIGN
  Sen. David Vitter on Monday, March 26, 2007, sent a letter along with the bipartisan Louisiana congressional delegation to HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt and Department of Health and Hospitals Secretary Fred Cerise. Sen. David Vitter spearheaded the letter, which offers a specific recommendation to move forward with health care redesign in Louisiana. 
   "The state, federal government and private providers need to reach agreement on the underlying statistics that we're dealing with. To move forward on health care redesign we must resolve this threshold dispute about these numbers," Vitter said. 
   Specifically, the letter asks HHS and DHH to convene a technical working group with a specific goal of coming to a consensus on the number of uninsured in Louisiana and a clear accounting of federal DSH funding in Louisiana. Vitter first suggested this idea after meetings with LSU and Gov. Kathleen Blanco in February. To date, there has not been agreement on these basic but vital facts, and this has prevented the redesign process from moving forward.
