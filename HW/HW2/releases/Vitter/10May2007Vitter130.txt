SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $14 MILLION FOR SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA PROJECTS
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that he secured an authorization of $14 million in environment and infrastructure projects for southeast Louisiana. These projects are included in the U.S. Senate's Water Resources Development Act, which is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. 
   "Sustainable development within a community depends on adequate infrastructure to support basic services like wastewater disposal, maintenance of pipes and a safe, potable supply of drinking water," said Vitter. "Improving these basic services helps ensure the public health of a community."
   Provisions in the WRDA bill authorize $12 million to be directed by the New Orleans Regional Planning Commission for water and wastewater improvements including measures to enhance the water quality of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin. In addition, Lafourche Parish will receive authorization for $2 million to prevent the intrusion for saltwater into the freshwater system.
