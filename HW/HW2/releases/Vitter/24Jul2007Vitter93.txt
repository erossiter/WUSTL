SEN. VITTER INTRODUCES HAZARD MITIGATION AMENDMENT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today introduced an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would remedy the hazard mitigation dispute between the Department of Homeland Security and the Louisiana Recovery Authority freeing up nearly $1.2 billion in federal relief funds that the state could use to fill the Road Home shortfall.  
   "This amendment directly addresses the concerns raised by FEMA shortly after it rejected the LRA's application to use hazard mitigation grants for the Road Home Program," said Vitter. "My amendment makes a concerted effort to clear those hurdles so that we can free up federal dollars for the Road Home program." 
   Vitter's hazard mitigation amendment would enable the state of Louisiana to use the funds in the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to reduce the loss of life and property due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and help defend against future disasters. A portion of the Road Home Program would be greatly assisted by the funding that includes this sort of hazard mitigation spending. The amendment would also allow FEMA to allocate the HMGP funding to the LRA for the Road Home Program waiving current statutory requirements that FEMA and DHS legally cannot waive. In addition, Vitter's amendment would expedite and streamline bureaucratic regulations that have slowed the HMGP's approval process.
   "We must rebuild smarter and stronger," added Vitter. "Hazard mitigation is an important element for achieving a smarter and stronger rebuilding effort, and my amendment bridges the gap between the state's need for additional federal rebuilding money and the importance of diligent hazard mitigation efforts."
   The hazard mitigation amendment would allow for HMGP funds to be used for the elevation of rebuilt homes. It would also allow the state's cost benefit analysis to focus on the entire region instead of the present project-by-project analysis that is required.
