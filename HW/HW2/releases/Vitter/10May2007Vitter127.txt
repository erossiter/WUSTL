SEN. VITTER SECURES $33 MILLION FOR J. JOHNSTON RED RIVER WATERWAY
  Sen. David Vitter today secured $33 million for the J. Bennett Johnston Red River Waterway in the Water Resources Development Act. 
   "This is good news for central and northwest Louisiana. The further development of the Red River Waterway is crucial to the economic development of the region. This authorization will help ensure that proper environmental safeguards are met as the traffic on the waterway increases," said Vitter.
   This authorization allows the Corps of Engineers to implement a fish and wildlife mitigation plan at a cost of $33 million. The mitigation plan is designed to address the impacts of implementation of the Red River Waterway project. In addition, it permits the Corps to reforest lands and improve species diversity. 
   This legislation is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. It will then go to a Conference Committee with the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
