SEN. VITTER CALLS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO LAW OF SEA TREATY
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter recently sent two letters calling for further hearings on the Law of the Sea Treaty - one letter addressed to the leadership of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and another letter to the leadership of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Each letter outlines concerns with the treaty that would potentially affect the work of each respective committee. 
   "The further we investigate this treaty and the international organizations it would empower, the more cause for concern we discover. This treaty could greatly affect our sovereignty and environmental and commercial policies, and a more thorough review of it is necessary," Vitter said.
   Vitter's letter to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden and Ranking Member Richard Lugar notes that several members of Congress have raised concerns in previous hearings that have not yet been adequately addressed. Due to the complex nature of the treaty, he has asked the Foreign Relations Committee to allow more expert witnesses from current and past administrations to provide a broader review of the treaty.
   In Vitter's letter to EPW Chairman Barbara Boxer and Ranking Member James Inhofe, he points to multiple provisions in LOST relating to protection of the marine environment and the control, reduction and elimination of pollution - including atmospheric and land-based pollution. If LOST is ratified by the U.S. Senate, these provisions could alter current U.S. domestic environmental law and public policy, an area within the expertise of the EPW Committee.
   "The impact of LOST on domestic environmental law and public policy cannot be underestimated and it is important that the committee be presented with a full and thorough explanation of this treaty," Vitter said.
