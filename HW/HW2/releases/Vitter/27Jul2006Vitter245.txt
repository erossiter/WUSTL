SEN. VITTER PRAISES COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS
  Today, the U.S. Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee passed the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006. Sen. David Vitter is a member of the committee. 
   "I am very pleased that the Small Business Reauthorization Bill was unanimously passed out of committee. As a coauthor, I worked very closely with the chairman and Senate Leadership to include real reforms to the Small Business Administration. This legislation makes some positive improvements in the SBA, in particular in the disaster loan program, implementing some of the lessons learned after Rita and Katrina," said Vitter.
   The Small Business Reauthorization and Improvement Act provides for the following reforms:
   * A new program to allow private banks to issue disaster loans that are guaranteed by the SBA. These loans would be available in a disaster area for two years after a storm 
   * A new disaster bridge loan program that would be administered by states and guaranteed by the SBA, after the state plan is approved by the SBA. 
   * The SBA would be allowed to contract with private companies for additional staff to help alleviate the burden of processing disaster loans, and the SBA would be required to examine other methods to expedite loan processing to the rebuilding effort. 
   * The SBA would have to update its hurricane response plan and develop simulation exercises that demonstrate the viability of the plan. 
   * The bill promotes job creation and recovery through stronger small business set asides on reconstruction contracts. 
   * The bill sets a policy that all federal agencies should reduce contract bundling - the practice of combining smaller contracts together to form larger single contracts. This policy will help reduce the need for big mega contracts and ensure small, local businesses get more contracting opportunities. 
   * The bill has a number of provisions to combat fraud by large businesses that game the system to obtain contracts meant for small businesses.
   "Today's committee passage is good news, and I am hopeful that this vital legislation will be brought to a vote on the Senate floor in the very near future," said Vitter.
