SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON SENATE'S FAILURE TO PASS FAMILY PROSPERITY ACT
  Sen. David Vitter made the following comment on the U.S. Senate failing to pass the Family Prosperity Act, which would have among other things raised the minimum wage and permanently reduced the estate tax: 
   "This vote is a perfect example of what Americans hate about Washington - the triumph of partisanship over people," said Vitter.
   "There are many Democrats who say they're for what's in this bill. They had already voted for a more generous death tax repeal. They say they are for the minimum wage increase, and the other tax provisions and the two-year extension of the Go Zone incentives, which are so essential for Louisiana's recovery. Yet they saluted the Democratic leadership and voted no because they didn't want to give Republicans a win.
   "What about giving Americans and Louisianians a win?".
