SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR INDEPENDENCE FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced on Thursday, April 19, that the Independence Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. will receive a federal grant of $320,000 to meet the growing needs of the department. 
   "Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, all Louisianians saw how important first responders are during an emergency or disaster," said Vitter. "This funding will ensure that the Independence firefighters are able to provide the vital first responder services that are so valuable to every community."
   This grant will be used to construct a new fire station and purchase a new fire truck. The grant is provided under the Community Facilities Loan and Grant Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development.
