SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORT FROM GEN. PETRAEUS, AMBASSADOR CROCKER
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today heard testimony from General David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker on our current policy in Iraq at his U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. At the hearing, he called for the Democratic leadership to join him in supporting and passing a resolution decrying MoveOn.org's attack ad in the New York Times smearing General Petraeus. 
   "Both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are intelligent, capable and courageous people serving us in the field in Iraq so I hope my colleagues quiet down for a moment from the typical partisan Iraq debate and actually listen to what they have to report. Our brave men and women in uniform have sacrificed a great deal, and they deserve a thoughtful debate on our policy moving forward.
   "I am pushing for the support and passage of a U.S. Senate Resolution decrying a personal attack against General Petraeus taken out by MoveOn.org in a recent edition of the New York Times. I find it despicable - especially since it was printed so close to September 11th. We should be able to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and denounce this type of rhetoric as beyond the pale. General Petraeus received large bipartisan support during his U.S. Senate confirmation and should not be subjected to personal attacks for political points," said Vitter.
   Vitter is a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
