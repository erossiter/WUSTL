SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.38 MILLION FEMA GRANT FOR JEFFERSON PARISH PUBLIC SCHOOLS
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that the Jefferson Parish Public School system will receive $1.38 million from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to pay for costs associated with Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. 
   "I appreciate the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarding this money to Louisiana," said Vitter. "This $1.38 million federal grant will help Jefferson Parish Public Schools cover some of its expenses associated with Hurricane Katrina, and to come closer to its goal of getting school facilities back to normal." 
   Jefferson Parish Public Schools will receive the $1.38 million grant as reimbursement costs for 42 temporary trailer units, which provide classrooms, restrooms, food service and necessary service spaces.
   "This grant is great news for Jefferson Parish. With this money, the federal government is recognizing the many needs of our local governments," said Vitter. "I will continue my efforts, in conjunction with the Louisiana delegation, to convince congressional leadership and the Bush Administration to bring additional resources to Louisiana to help in the recovery process."
