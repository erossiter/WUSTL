SEN. VITTER PUSHES FOR U.S. ATTORNEY DUGAS HEARING IN MEETING WITH RANKING MEMBER OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today met with U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, ranking member of the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee, to request that the committee move forward with a confirmation hearing on the nomination of U.S. Attorney David Dugas to the Middle District Court of Louisiana. 
   "Democrats - including Sen. Mary Landrieu - seem to be slow walking this nomination to set up an opening for a possible Democratic presidential nominee," said Vitter. "Every nominee deserves a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote, and I have asked Sen. Specter for his help in ensuring that David Dugas gets his."
   Vitter and his staff have met multiple times with Sen. Landrieu and her staff to discuss the Dugas nomination. After receiving little feedback, he wrote a letter to Landrieu requesting she turn in her "blue slip" to allow the Judiciary Committee to move forward with a hearing. Only after the delivery of this letter did Sen. Landrieu raise an objection to the Dugas nomination - citing concerns over a New Orleans court case involving insurance claim adjuster practices. That case was recently dismissed.
   "Sen. Landrieu raised only one objection to David's nomination, and that court case has just been dismissed," added Vitter." "By her own letter, I see no further reason for delay in allowing David Dugas' confirmation proceedings to move forward."
   It is common practice in the U.S. Senate for the Judiciary Committee to request senators from the state of a designated nominee turn in written "blue slips" or forms supporting that nomination. Landrieu has yet to turn in her "blue slip" - effectively obstructing the nomination of David Dugas from receiving a hearing on his nomination to the Middle District Court of Louisiana.
