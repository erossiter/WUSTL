SENATE PASSES VITTER CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK RESOLUTION
 The U.S. Senate this week passed a resolution authored by U.S. Sen. David Vitter recognizing Catholic Schools Week and honoring the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States. Catholic Schools Week is January 27th to February 2nd and is sponsored each year by the National Catholic Educational Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to raise awareness of Catholic education programs throughout the country. 
   "More than two million students attend Catholic schools in the United States, and more than 80 percent of them go on to pursue a college degree," said Vitter. "These students should be commended for their strong dedication to their faith, families and local communities and for their steadfast commitment to furthering their studies. This week we recognize the students and their families and educators for their continued achievement."
   The resolution also recognizes an overall graduation rate of 95 percent for all Catholic school students. Full text of the resolution is attached.
