SEN. VITTER AUTHORIZES $3 MILLION FOR NORTHEAST LOUISIANA PROJECTS
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that he secured an authorization of $3 million in environment and infrastructure projects for northeast Louisiana. These projects are included as provision in the U.S. Senate Water Resource Development Act, which is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week.  
   "Sustainable development within a community depends on adequate infrastructure to support basic services like wastewater disposal, maintenance of pipes and a safe, potable supply of drinking water," said Vitter. "Improving these basic services helps ensure the public health of a community."
   One example of a needed infrastructure project in northeast Louisiana is improvements to Monroe's wastewater collection systems. These systems were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s and are in a severe state of deterioration. Even with general maintenance throughout the years, cracks have developed along the pipeline and in manholes. These cracks and breaks allow excess rainwater and groundwater to enter the collection system adding extreme pressure to an already over-taxed system resulting in Sanitary Sewer Overflows. So these improvements are very important to public health in Monroe.
