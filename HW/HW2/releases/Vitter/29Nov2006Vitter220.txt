SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON RETIREMENT OF COL. WAGENAAR
Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on the retirement of Col. Wagenaar:
 "I wish Col. Wagenaar and his family all the best. In replacing him, I hope the Corps leadership works hard to find someone with a real can-do spirit, someone who thinks outside the bureaucratic box and who can really get this important work done on time. The Corps found such a person in Col. Jeffrey Bedey, who was put in charge of Hurricane Protection Office several months ago. We need more in that mold, including the new Chief of Engineers," said Vitter.
