SEN. VITTER OFFERS DRUG REIMPORTATION AMENDMENT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today offered an amendment to the FY 2009 budget resolution declaring the sense of the Senate regarding the need for comprehensive legislation to legalize the importation of prescription drugs from other industrialized countries like Canada. 
   "The Senate needs to take concrete action on this issue," said Vitter. "It's time that Senate leadership brings comprehensive legislation to the floor this year to allow for a full and thorough debate on reimportation. It is simply too important an issue to so many Americans to leave unaddressed."
   Vitter's amendment calls for the Senate to consider and have an up-or-down vote on comprehensive reimportation legislation this year.
