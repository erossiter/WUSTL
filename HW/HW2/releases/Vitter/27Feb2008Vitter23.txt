SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR.
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement regarding the news of the passing of William F. Buckley, Jr.  
   "William F. Buckley was a giant among intellectuals and patriotic cold warriors. With his famed God and Man at Yale and his founding of the highly influential National Review magazine, Buckley illustrated that the conservative movement in America is based in a strong intellectual tradition that ideas matter. America has lost one of our sharpest intellects and truest patriots today. 
   "Buckley's unfortunate passing reminds us all of a time where political discourse and debate could be practiced with the highest level of class, as he was the consummate gentleman. Although no one can replace what his presence meant to the formation of modern conservatism, he has inspired many new generations of conservatives in their admirable attempt to continue forward with his mission of defending freedom and promoting lean, responsible government. 
   "Wendy and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Buckley family."
