SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES SENATE PASSAGE OF BILL TO SPEED FEMA DISASTER RELIEF
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the Debris Removal Act of 2005 passed the U.S. Senate today.  
 Vitter was a cosponsor of this bill, which would broaden eligibility for federal debris removal reimbursement and expedite emergency assistance payments to local and state governments.
   "Debris removal remains a major problem in Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita," said Vitter. "Many of our local governments are facing major revenue shortages, so expanding the eligibility for debris removal reimbursements is greatly needed."
   The Debris Removal Act of 2005 would set the federal share for debris removal costs for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita at 100 percent for at least 180 days. The legislation would also authorize federal assistance for removing, clearing and disposing of debris from private property. 
   In addition, this bill requires authorized reimbursement for clearing and removing debris to include reimbursement for clearing, removing and disposing of debris from any emergency access road.
   To speed up federal payments, the bill also includes a provision directing FEMA to pay eligible disaster relief applicants at least 50 percent of the federal share of assistance that they are eligible for within 60 days after their claim for assistance is filed. 
   "There is a huge lag time between when communities apply for assistance and when they receive it," Vitter said. "This bill would help expedite the process to ensure our local and state governments get expedited assistance."
   The bill will now move to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.
