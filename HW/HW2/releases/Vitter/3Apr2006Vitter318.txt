SEN. VITTER, REP. BOUSTANY ANNOUNCE POWELL VISIT TO SWLA
  Sen. David Vitter and. Rep. Charles Boustany are pleased to announce that Federal Recovery and Rebuild Chairman Don Powell will visit southwest Louisiana on April 11. Powell will attend a Chamber/Southwest Louisiana luncheon at 12:30 p.m. 
   "Hurricane Katrina was not the only storm to hit Louisiana last year. I am constantly fighting to ensure that the federal government does not forget about the victims of Rita," said Vitter. "I'm grateful that Chairman Powell has accepted my invitation to see southwest Louisiana, and I look forward to working with him to fully address the concerns of southwest Louisiana as we strive to recover."
   "Our recovery in Southwest Louisiana is dependent upon the continued commitment of Chairman Powell and the Administration," said Boustany. "This visit will allow the Chairman to see first-hand the progress that has been made, as well as the challenges that remain."
   Vitter and Boustany have made a concerted effort to bring their colleagues to Louisiana for a tour of the devastation, to help prevent 'Rita amnesia' in Washington. On March 2, Vitter personally invited Powell to southwest Louisiana for a ground tour of the areas damaged by Hurricane Rita. Vitter took Powell on his first aerial tour of southwest Louisiana in November 2005. Boustany is actively pursuing the U.S. House of Representatives leadership to visit the areas affected by Hurricane Rita also.
