SEN. DAVID VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO SEN. REID'S INTRODUCTION OF 'CLAY PIGEON' AMENDMENT
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement in response to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's introduction of his "clay pigeon" amendment. This amendment is a parliamentary tool used to divide one amendment into multiple amendments. Reid is also using it to block all other amendments - essentially ending full and open debate. 
   "It was not long ago that Harry Reid and the national Democrats spoke at great length on the U.S. Senate floor about the institution's rich history of full and open debate. Now, with the drive to get any immigration bill passed - even a bad one - there seems to be little respect for such tradition. Our ability to represent our constituents and the views of millions of Americans has been blocked by a beltway procedural move. Now our immigration debate is mired in both bad policy and procedure," said Vitter.
