SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF FEDERAL ANIMAL FIGHTING BILL
  Sen. David Vitter on Wednesday, April 11, applauded the passage of the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007. This bill passed the Senate with unanimous support.  
   "With cockfighting being identified as a possible outlet to spread the avian flu and its link to associated violent crimes and illegal gambling, we have all the more reason to crack down on this cruel and dangerous practice," said Vitter. "This federal law increases the penalties for those who participate in animal fighting - including more jail time." 
   This legislation creates criminal penalties of up to three years for sponsoring or exhibiting an animal in an animal fighting venture. In addition, this bill penalizes those who buy, sell, or transport an animal in interstate or foreign commerce to promote or further an animal fighting venture. Current federal penalties are only misdemeanors, so this bill makes the crimes more serious by making violations felony offenses. 
   "Louisiana is the last state in the country to allow cockfighting. This practice fuels a negative image of our state and hurts our ability to bring in good jobs and economic development," added Vitter.
   The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 has already been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and is expected to be signed into law by the President in the near future.
