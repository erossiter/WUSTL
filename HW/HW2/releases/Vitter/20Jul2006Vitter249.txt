SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR STRATUS SYSTEMS IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $2 million for Stratus Systems to build an Advanced Helicopter Emergency Egress Lighting System. 
   "The U.S. Senate recognizes the importance of this system to our nation's armed forces," said Vitter. "This project is crucial in assisting our armed forces in the case of a disaster and leading them to safety."
   The $2 million will go toward the production of ADHEELS. It is a state of the art non-electric lighting system that is used in aircrafts to assist the crew to a safe escape in case of a crash or disaster. Hatches are illuminated and visible both on land and underwater allowing trapped crew members to find their way out of an incapacitated or rapidly sinking aircraft.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Department of Defense Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
