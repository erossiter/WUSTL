SEN. VITTER ASKS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DELAY GULF LEASE SALE
  Sen. David Vitter today asked the Bush administration to formally delay the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas lease sale scheduled for tomorrow. He told administration officials that while the federal judge denied the state of Louisiana's request for a preliminary injunction his strongly worded opinion creates too much uncertainty for the lease sale to move forward smoothly. 
   Vitter explained this point in a lengthy conversation with Minerals Management Service Director Johnnie Burton. 
   "The federal judge's opinion said two things that are very important. First, he said that the state was likely to win in at least some of its claims at the trial in November. Second, he told potential bidders caveat emptor - buyer beware - given the state's significant claims. In light of that I think the Bush administration must delay the lease sale until these uncertainties are resolved."
   The American Petroleum Institute has filed emergency motions with the federal judge asking him to stop the opening of these bids. This clearly supports Vitter's arguments to the Bush administration. 
   Vitter also expects to talk to Secretary of Interior Dirk Kempthorne today.
