SEN. VITTER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CYBER SPACE COMMAND AT BARKSDALE
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter yesterday was briefed by Lt. Gen. Robert Elder at Barksdale Air Force Base on the Cyber Space Command. Several community leaders were also present at the briefing including Bossier City Mayor Lo Walker, Shreveport Mayor Cedric Glover and Director of Barksdale Forward Murray Viser.  
   Vitter had a meeting with Secretary Michael Wynn of the Air Force in May along with Sen. Landrieu and Rep. McCrery to push for Cyber Space to be at Barksdale.
   "I am quite optimistic about the possibility of the Cyber Space Command being placed at Barksdale," said Vitter. "Barksdale looks great. Everyone has done a great job putting the package together for the base, and I am anxiously awaiting a decision from the president. 
   "I was also briefed on the CBAT program possibilities, and I am hopeful that this program will be placed at Barksdale as well. A decision on CBAT will not be made until January, but I will continue to track the program's progress until then.
   "Barksdale is such an important part of northwest Louisiana, and these programs would only increase that presence."
