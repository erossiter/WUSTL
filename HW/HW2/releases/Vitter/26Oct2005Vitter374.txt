  U.S. SENATOR VITTER STATEMENT ON U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE HARRIET MIERS MEETING  
   October 26, 2005 
   (Washington, D.C.) -U.S. Sen. David Vitter made the following statement following his meeting this morning with U.S. Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers:
   "Harriet Miers was fairly forthcoming and engaging in our meeting today, which I appreciated. She articulated the type of conservative judicial philosophy which I support.
   "My central question still remains to be answered, however: Is there objective, written evidence from prior to her nomination that fully shows that she has a truly consistent and well-grounded conservative judicial philosophy?
   "As we proceed toward the U.S. Senate hearings for her confirmation, I expect she will provide more information about her life's work. I'll need to see this objective evidence prior to making my decision.
   "I certainly will be following the Senate hearings closely and with great interest. It is the constitutional duty of the U.S. Senate to give advice and consent when a president nominates an individual to the bench. I firmly believe that all judicial nominees should receive a fair up-or-down vote."
