SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S VISIT, LEVEE NEEDS
  Sen. David Vitter commented today on President Bush's 10th visit to the Gulf Coast since Hurricane Katrina and on legislation to get the levees prepared for next hurricane season. 
   "It's great that President Bush is getting a first-hand look at Louisiana's recovery efforts once again. We now need to translate this into real results. We need legislation to move so we can get the help that we need to rebuild our levees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers needs drastic reform. That's why I have already introduced legislation to help get us where we need to be by June 1 and why I will be introducing additional legislation to provide oversight to the Corps of Engineers next week," Vitter said.
   Vitter recently introduced the "Louisiana Emergency Needs Corps of Engineers Authorization Act," which would give the Corps of Engineers full Congressional authorization to begin construction on projects that will go beyond pre-Katrina levels of hurricane protection for south Louisiana.
   Vitter's next bill would create a new federal council to oversee a comprehensive hurricane and flood protection, navigation and coastal restoration program for south Louisiana. The council will include both the Corps of Engineers and outside, independent engineering experts.
   "This will be the first effort to take a system-wide, coordinated implementation on the Corps' work in south Louisiana," said Vitter. "The council would be able to integrate the implementation to ensure consistency between projects, expedite completion of projects and save taxpayer dollars.".
