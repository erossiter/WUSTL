SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR TEXTRON MARINE AND LAND IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $155 million for Textron Marine and Land to build Armored Security Vehicles. 
   "The U.S. Senate recognizes the importance of these vehicles to our nation's defense," said Vitter. "This federal funding is crucial to the mission of America's armed forces as they fight in Iraq and Afghanistan."
   The $155 million will go toward the construction of ASVs. These vehicles are ideal in combating Improved Explosive Devices and Rocket Propelled Grenades that have become very common. They are not only highly survivable, but also extremely mobile. As of January 2006, the Army had ordered 1,118 ASVs.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Department of Defense Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
