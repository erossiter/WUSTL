SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR TANGIPAHOA FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that the Tangipahoa Fire Protection District #1 will receive a federal grant of $688,000 to meet the growing needs of the department. 
   "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita illustrated the importance of first responders to our communities," said Vitter. "They play a critical role in the protection of each and every community, and Amite will benefit greatly from this new fire station and fire truck."
   This grant will be used to construct a new fire station with living quarters and purchase a 75-foot aerial ladder truck. This funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Community Facilities Loan and Grant Program.
