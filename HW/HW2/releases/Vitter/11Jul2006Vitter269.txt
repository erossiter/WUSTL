SENATE APPROVES SEN. VITTER'S AMENDMENT ON DRUG REIMPORTATION
  Sen. David Vitter secured a major victory today on the U.S. Senate floor for drug reimportation with adoption of his amendment to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Vitter's amendment passed 68 to 32. 
   "This is a major victory in our fight to bring lower prescription drugs to all Americans. Our seniors are paying too much for their prescription drugs and are turning toward Canada, simply because it's cheaper. With passage of this bipartisan amendment, American citizens will be able to buy their medicines in Canada without the fear of our own customs and border agents seizing them," said Vitter. 
   Vitter's amendment, co-authored by U.S. Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) would ensure that no funds included in Homeland Security appropriations bill can be used by U.S. customs and Border Security to prevent individuals from importing cheaper prescription drugs for personal use from Canada.
   "Now while this is good news, we still have to secure this amendment in the upcoming House-Senate Conference. You can be assured that the big drug companies will not let our victory go unnoticed and will do everything in their power to strip this provision in conference," said Vitter.
   Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, which included language similar to Vitter's amendment. The U.S. Senate is expected to pass its bill this week, and the bills will then move to Conference.
