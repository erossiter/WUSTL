SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR FORT POLK IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the Senate Veterans Administration-Military Construction Appropriations Bill, which passed the U.S. Senate today, included $9.8 million for Fort Polk. 
   "I am pleased that I was able to convince my colleagues to include this crucial funding for Fort Polk," said Vitter. "This federal money will strengthen Fort Polk's standing as an asset to our military and provide a permanent home for the Fourth Brigade/10th Mountain Division."
   The $9.8 million will go toward the construction of a new headquarters for the Fourth Brigade/10th Mountain Division at Fort Polk. This unit was activated in January 2005, and since that time the brigade combat team has operated out of a 30-year-old facility.
   As part of the brigade's transformation to a Brigade Combat Team of Action, a new state-of-the-art headquarters facility is essential to support the brigade's enhanced mission capabilities.
   "It is crucial that we get this money for Fort Polk passed this year," added Vitter. I will continue to work with Congressman Jim McCrery to ensure that this becomes a reality."
   The Senate Veterans Administration-Military Construction Appropriations Bill will now be sent to a House-Senate Conference Committee before final passage.
