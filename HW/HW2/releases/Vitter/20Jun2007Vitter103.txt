SEN. VITTER TESTIFIES AT COMMITTEE HEARING ON POST-KATRINA CRIME
  Sen. David Vitter today testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on crime challenges following Hurricane Katrina. Sen. David Vitter discussed the challenges facing law enforcement statewide and the need for reforms at the local level. 
   "Congress has taken unprecedented steps to provide federal help with what is traditionally a local law enforcement problem, and I urge them to continue that federal help. More important, we must leverage that federal help to demand that needed reforms take place on the ground - specifically in the New Orleans district attorney's office and law enforcement.
   "We must use our federal help to demand reforms at the local level. All these foundational problems existed pre-Katrina - they were only exacerbated by it.
   "With local reforms and continued federal assistance, like the help for law enforcement to protect victims and witnesses to crimes, we can turn the corner," said Vitter.
