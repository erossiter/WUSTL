SENS. VITTER, LANDRIEU INTRODUCE SENATE RESOLUTION HONORING NATIONAL CHAMPION LSU TIGERS
  U.S. Sens. David Vitter and Mary Landrieu today introduced a Senate resolution recognizing the LSU Tigers for winning the 2007 Bowl Championship Series national championship game. The resolution honors the team, Coach Les Miles and the players for their special achievements over the 2007 college football season. 
   "We are very proud of our Tigers," said Vitter. "Their hard work on the field throughout the season was rewarded with a sound victory over the Buckeyes at the Louisiana Superdome, proving what LSU fans have long known - that the Tigers are truly the best team in the nation. I congratulate Coach Miles and the entire LSU team for a successful year and an outstanding Championship Game."
   "As an LSU alum and lifelong fan, watching the Tigers win the national championship in the Louisiana Superdome was exhilarating," Landrieu said. "The victory was the culmination of months of hard work by the whole team and proven leadership by the team's seniors and coach, Les Miles. In a region still recovering from the devastating 2005 hurricanes, the Tigers have been a beacon of hope for all Louisianans."
   A companion resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives was offered by Louisiana Congressman Richard Baker.
