SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS FINAL PASSAGE OF OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEGISLATION
Sen. David Vitter today applauded the final passage of the outer continental shelf legislation.  
 "This bill is a historic piece of legislation for Louisiana. Work on this bill is the product of many hours of negotiating and hard work by all members of the Louisiana delegation and the Gulf coast states. I personally reached out to friends and former colleagues to ensure that nothing was taken for granted until the final outcome was secured. I thank my colleagues for voting with an overwhelming majority to support this critical need for the people of Louisiana.
 "Congress has guaranteed that the people of Louisiana will finally receive our fair share of offshore oil and gas royalties and we will now have critical resources to fund the comprehensive coastal, flood and hurricane protections that I have fought for," said Vitter.
