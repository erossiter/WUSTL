SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES BICAMERAL AGREEMENT ON OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEGISLATION
Sen. David Vitter today announced that the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have reached an agreement on the outer continental shelf legislation. The House is expected to vote later today with the Senate following suit later this week. 
 "Congress is close to passing a historic piece of legislation for Louisiana. Work on this bill is the product of many hours of negotiating and hard work by all members of the Louisiana delegation and the Gulf coast states. I spent great energy helping to broker this compromise that ended the stalemate on the OCS bill to bring this crucial legislation to a vote. 
 "With the support of the House and Senate leadership, the people of Louisiana will finally receive their fair share of offshore oil and gas royalties. The bill also includes critical resources to fund the comprehensive coastal, flood and hurricane protections that I have fought to have authorized in the Water Resources Development Act," said Vitter.
