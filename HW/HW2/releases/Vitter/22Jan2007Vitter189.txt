SEN. VITTER SUPPORTS PRESIDENT'S NEW STRATEGY IN IRAQ
  Sen. David Vitter on Monday, January 22, made the following statement in support of President Bush's new strategy in Iraq: 
   "After a great deal of careful thought, I have decided to support the president's new strategy in Iraq as a final attempt to stabilize the situation and protect America's security.
   I also strongly urge the president to adopt three recommendations, which I've communicated personally to him and his top advisors. They are:
   1) The administration should be even stronger and clearer on benchmarks that the Iraqi government must meet for us to continue our military support over the next few months. 
   2) The administration should encourage and support a regional diplomatic conference of Iraq, its neighbors - including Iran and Syria - European representatives, and the U.S. focused solely and narrowly on stabilizing Iraq. 
   3) The administration should carefully examine whether our new troop levels will be adequate to get the job done quickly, since we've made mistakes from the beginning underestimating the troops we need.
   I look forward to the debate about all of this in Congress. But as the debate moves forward, I hope all of us realize that we have a responsibility to be for some plan forward, not just against one."
