SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF REVENUE SHARING
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement today regarding ongoing Outer Continental Shelf revenue sharing negotiations:
   "Based on meetings I've had this week, I feel very good about real progress in the senate on royalty-sharing.
   "I think we have an excellent shot at royalty-sharing combined with opening up new areas of the Gulf. I think that more focused approach is a lot more likely than the broader house approach, but certainly what the House has been doing has helped our efforts enormously."
