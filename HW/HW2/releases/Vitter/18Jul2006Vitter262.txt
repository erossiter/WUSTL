SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON SENATE VOTE ON H.R. 810, THE STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT
  Sen. David Vitter issued the following statement after today's U.S. Senate vote on H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act: 
   "At a time when many Americans believe that killing human embryos is immoral, I do not believe that the federal government should use taxpayer money to fund research that would do so. That is why I am so disappointed in today's action by the U.S. Senate. I believe that we must be careful not to compromise our values and we must fight to protect the sanctity of all human life. It is my hope that President Bush will follow through with his threat and veto this bad bill."
