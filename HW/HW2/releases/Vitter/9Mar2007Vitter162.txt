SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON HURRICANE RECOVERY AMENDMENTS
  Sen. David Vitter on Friday, March 9, made the following statement regarding the U.S. Senate's lack of action on two important hurricane recovery amendments for Louisiana on the U.S. Senate 9/11 Commission bill: 
   "I was really disappointed the two hurricane recovery amendments I worked on with Mary didn't get on this bill. The compromise language we worked out on both of them had wide support - including Sen. Coburn for instance - but we ran out of time for votes. I voted against cloture on the bill so we could get votes on these amendments."
   The 26 senators who voted against cloture were all Republicans.
   The first hurricane recovery amendment sought to waive the 10 percent cost share required of the state for federal public assistance funding for permanent repair work. The standard cost share is 75 percent federal, 25 percent from the state, but the president used his authority to make it 90/10. The state is allowed to use Community Disaster Block Grant funds for the 10 percent match, but that creates red tape and multiple reporting requirements and diverts valuable recovery dollars. The agreement negotiated on this amendment would have waived that 10 percent match requirement for the next two years. 
   The second hurricane recovery amendment would have granted loan forgiveness to local communities that received federal community disaster loan funding following hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The agreement negotiated on this amendment required that when repayment on these CDL loans were due, the loan debt would be repaid by the federal Disaster Relief Funds rather than with local funding. Local governments in Louisiana received nearly $577 million in CDL funds with the city of New Orleans receiving $120 million.
