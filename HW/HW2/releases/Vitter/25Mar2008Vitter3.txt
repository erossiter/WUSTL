SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS NAGIN'S APPROVAL OF LAFITTE DEMOLITION PERMIT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today applauded Mayor Ray Nagin's approval of the Lafitte public housing facility's demolition permit. During a meeting held in early March in Washington, D.C., to discuss hurricane recovery efforts, Nagin assured Vitter that the permit would be forthcoming. 
   "The approval of the demolition permit for the Lafitte complex was a crucial component of the redevelopment plan," said Vitter. "The demolition and redevelopment of the 'Big Four' housing projects represents a much-needed step in the New Orleans recovery process. Mayor Nagin's actions are especially timely, given that the redevelopment project must be completed by the end of 2010 if we are to utilize the tax credits that have been made available to finance this process."
   The New Orleans City Council voted unanimously to approve the demolition of the "Big Four" in December, and Nagin had previously signed demolition permits for the B.W. Cooper, C.J. Peete and St. Bernard complexes. During their meeting earlier this month, Vitter reiterated the importance of moving forward with this final stage of the demolition phase.
   "I'm glad that Mayor Nagin followed through on our meeting early this month," Vitter said. "It is high-time that we rethink our approach to public housing in New Orleans and move toward a tenant-based system that will offer opportunities for hardworking Louisiana families to live in safe and healthy environments, and leave this failed public housing model in the past - where it belongs."
