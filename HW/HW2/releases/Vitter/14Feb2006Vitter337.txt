SEN. VITTER WORKING TO KEEP HOUSING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS
  Sen. David Vitter today continued his efforts to find a solution to the pending housing crisis facing first responders in south Louisiana.  
   "My staff and I have been in direct contact with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials to find an acceptable solution to this crisis. I am working with the acting director of FEMA and others to find a solution that will provide our local police, fire fighters and other first responders with a viable, temporary housing solution after the cruise ships leave the New Orleans area on March 1," said Vitter.
   As of March 1, FEMA will no longer provide cruise ships as temporary housing, which have been serving a large number of first responders, including those in New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish. Vitter is working with R. David Paulison, acting director of FEMA, and others to ensure that these essential personnel have housing accommodations available to them upon the departure of the ships.
   "Our first responders and other essential personnel play such a key role in the recovery of our area that we must provide a solution that keeps them close to home," Vitter said. "This is the only way to ensure that our emergency services continue without interruption."
