SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $109,000 GRANT FOR CADDO SEWERAGE DISTRICT
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development will award a $109,000 grant to Caddo Sewerage District No. 8 in Keithville to improve its sewage system. 
   "I'm pleased that USDA Rural Development made this grant available to the Caddo Sewerage District No. 8. This federal funding will improve the efficiency of the town's water system and ensure that the residents of Keithville will have access to a cleaner environment."
   The grant, which is provided under the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program, will be used to bring the system in compliance with U.S. Department of Health and Hospitals regulations. New sewer mains will be installed for homes located in the sewage district, and old waste disposal ponds will be abandoned when the work is complete.
