SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $1.05 million for human nutrition and obesity research at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. 
   "We are lucky to have a facility as renowned as the Pennington Biomedical Research Center a part of our community," said Vitter. "I am grateful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee included funding for this important research at Pennington to help prevent obesity."
   The $1.05 million for Pennington Biomedical Research Center will be used for continuing research into preventing obesity and will emphasize the causes of the current obesity epidemic and the measures to prevent obesity.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this year.
