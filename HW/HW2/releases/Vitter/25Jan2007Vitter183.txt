SEN. VITTER ASKS BLANCO TO PICK UP PACE ON REIMBURSING LOCALS
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, Jan. 25, wrote to Gov. Kathleen Blanco calling for the state to speed up delivery to local governments of critical federal funding it has received from FEMA. 
   "One of the major issues hindering Louisiana's recovery is the snail's pace at which the state is reimbursing our parishes and municipalities. Particularly disappointing and frustrating are some of the dismally low payouts from the state to some of the parishes most desperately in need of these reimbursements. Cameron Parish has only received 13 percent of the money released by FEMA to the state for Cameron's needs, Plaquemines Parish only 28 percent, St. Bernard only 40 percent, and Orleans only 37 percent," Vitter said.
