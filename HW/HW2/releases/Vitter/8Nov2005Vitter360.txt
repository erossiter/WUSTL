SEN. VITTER SECURES $2 MILLION FOR LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN CLEANUP EFFORTS
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the final conference report to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill included $2 million in federal funding for Lake Pontchartrain. 
   "Before Hurricane Katrina, local organizations had made great strides in cleaning up Lake Pontchartrain," said Vitter. "This $2 million will provide much-needed support in the next steps needed to recover from Hurricane Katrina and get restoration of the lake back on track."
   As a freshman in Congress, Vitter authored and passed into law the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, which created a partnership between the federal government and local stakeholders to further efforts to clean up the lake. Through this program Vitter has steered nearly $22 million to Louisiana for cleanup efforts in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin.
   This $2 million in funding will provide for an analysis of the status and trends of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin's natural resources, a watershed analysis, investigations of critical habitat and water quality issues, development of basin restoration strategies and project concepts and monitoring programs that can document the performance of restoration projects.
   "We've been monitoring the water quality in Lake Pontchartrain since the storm, and the preliminary results are encouraging," said Vitter. "The effects of a large hurricane. on water are not always immediate. This funding will help us continue to monitor the water for any new impacts in the coming year."
   This funding is in addition to the $295,000 that Vitter secured in the Agriculture Appropriations Bill last month, which complements the ongoing clean up work to keep a healthy environment in Lake Pontchartrain.
   The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives are expected to approve the final conference report this week, before it is sent to the president for his signature.
