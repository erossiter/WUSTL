SEN. VITTER PUSHES FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND FLEXIBILITY FOR HURRICANE PROTECTION WORK IN SUPPLEMENTAL
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today wrote Senate leadership to advocate for three specific needs for Louisiana in the emergency supplemental.  
   He is pushing for the committee to address the funding shortfall for levee work as well as provide additional flexibility to the Corps of Engineers so that they can more efficiently perform work as recovery projects are ready to be implemented. 
   In addition Vitter highlighted the need for the Corps to accelerate its work on closing MRGO and has asked the committee to push the deadline up from December to June for the Corps to finalize plans and move toward construction on MRGO closure.
   Vitter will travel to Louisiana tomorrow with President Bush and will discuss these needs with him.
   The Senate is expected to debate the emergency supplemental on the floor in March.
