SEN. VITTER PASSES RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS
  The U.S. Senate this week passed Sen. David Vitter's resolution recognizing the goals of Catholic Schools Week and honoring the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States. 
   "I attended Catholic schools growing up, so I know first-hand of the benefits of a Catholic school education," said Vitter. "Catholic schools have always been a valuable component of our education system, and Catholic Schools Week recognizes their dedication to a student's education and personal growth."
   Vitter's resolution acknowledges the huge impact Catholic schools have had on the United States' education system, such as the 83 percent of Catholic high school graduates who go on to college and 95 percent graduation rate for all Catholic school students.
