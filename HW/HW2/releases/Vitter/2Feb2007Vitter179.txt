SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR BAYOU CANE FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced on Friday, Feb. 2, that the Bayou Cane Fire Department/District will receive a federal grant of $145,991 to meet the growing needs of the department. 
   "Firefighters play a vital role in every town so it is important that they have access to the proper equipment and training," said Vitter. "This funding will help ensure the Bayou Cane firefighters have this equipment and are able to continue protecting the community." 
   This grant will be used to support the firefighters and help them secure the necessary equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training and other resources needed to protect the public and emergency personnel from fire and related hazards. The funding is provided by the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
