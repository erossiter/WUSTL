SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE HARRIET MIERS
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers: 
   "Like many others, I have a lot of questions and some concerns, quite frankly, with the Harriet Miers nomination.
   "My top questions are: does she have a consistent and well-grounded conservative judicial philosophy and what objective evidence is there of it from her life's work? 
   "In terms of her background and experience, I'm hearing it described as very 'practical.' I just want to make sure she's not practical like a lot of political people are - with no consistent philosophy and without the will to stand up against popular attitudes when they're not grounded in the Constitution.
   "I look forward to hearing her address these questions and others as the U.S. Senate begins the confirmation process."
