SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON CORPS FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement in reaction to Gen. Reilly's and Gulf Coast Coordinator Don Powell's call for an additional $7.6 billion in federal funding for 100-year levee protection for South Louisiana:  
  "I am pleased to see that Gen. Reilly and Chairman Powell are finally stepping forward and publicly requesting this additional funding. This money will cover costs for the completion of this important work that I secured in the WRDA bill. This also includes all SELA funding. The inclusion of the SELA pump funding is a major victory as many believed that it would be left out.
   "The problem is that the president will not include this money until next year's budget cycle, pushing this critical funding for the Corps back to October of 2008 at the earliest. Therefore, I call on the president and my colleagues in Congress to include this money in a supplemental so that this money is delivered as quickly as possible.
   "President Bush made a promise to the people of South Louisiana that he would deliver the vital hurricane and flood protection measures they need by 2010. Without an urgent supplemental, meeting this goal will be next to impossible," said Vitter.
   Vitter included the 100-year protection and SELA pump work as part of the Water Resources Development Act. He is a U.S. Senate negotiator for the bill and plans to push the administration until it both passes and fully funds the legislation.
