SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON MEETING WITH MAYOR NAGIN, NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today met with Mayor Ray Nagin and members of the New Orleans City Council to discuss the city's continuing hurricane recovery efforts. In the meeting, Vitter again asked Mayor Nagin to move forward with redevelopment of the Lafitte housing projects. 
   "I was glad to hear today from Mayor Nagin that he is very close to allowing the demolition of Lafitte and the redevelopment process to move forward as originally planned. I reminded the mayor and members of the council about the importance of moving forward with planned redevelopment as soon as possible because the window of opportunity that provides tax credits and other financing mechanisms for the redevelopment is rapidly closing. They are set to expire in 2010.
   "We need to create more mixed-income housing units that promote growth and, ultimately, home ownership. And recent news reports have noted that the majority of former residents of the project housing developments surveyed stated that they have no desire to return to the old, failed New Orleans public housing projects that were concentrations of poverty and crime. The HUD redevelopment plan is a good first step, and I'm glad the mayor recognizes that and intends to move forward," said Vitter.
