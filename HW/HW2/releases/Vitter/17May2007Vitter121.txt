SEN. VITTER REACHES AGREEMENT ON VAN ANTWERP NOMINATION
  Sen. David Vitter today reached an agreement to confirm the nomination of Lt Gen. Van Antwerp through the U.S Senate. As of this morning, Van Antwerp had not been confirmed, but after Sen. David Vitter raised concerns about not having Van Antwerp in place as chief of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers prior to the beginning of hurricane season, his nomination was cleared.  
   "The 2007 hurricane season is just a few weeks away. We have already had one tropical storm this year and hurricane experts are predicting a very active season. With hurricane protection work in Louisiana still far short of where it needs to be, strong leadership at the top of the Corps is vital to the future of our state.
   "You don't go into battle without a leader. The hurricane season is days away, and the Senate needed to act responsibly and confirm General Van Antwerp as the chief of engineers and commander of the Corps," said Vitter. 
   Today is General Carl Strock's final day in his tenure as the chief of engineers and commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Confirmation of Van Antwerp's nomination was being held up by Senate Democrats.
