SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $165,000 GRANT FOR ALLEN PARISH
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development will award a $165,000 grant to Oberlin for a new sewer collection line. 
   "I'm pleased that USDA Rural Development made this grant available to Oberlin. This federal funding will improve the efficiency of the town's water system and help Oberlin serve all of its residents and handle increases in population."
   The grant, which is provided under the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program, will be used to construct a new sewer collection line to serve 38 new homes and a church in a newly annexed area south of Oberlin. This project will give the newly-annexed area of Oberlin access to safe, sanitary sewer conditions.
   Over the past two years, Oberlin has received grants totaling $1,136,000 through this program.
