SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES HOUSE-SENATE AGREEMENT ON HURRICANE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate reached an agreement on a hurricane supplemental bill. The final hurricane emergency supplemental bill conference report included many top Louisiana hurricane priorities. 
   "This is a huge win. The Louisiana Congressional delegation has succeeded in providing critical federal funding to meet Louisiana's biggest challenges," said Vitter. "Now it is up to the state to act quickly and get the money distributed where it is needed most to facilitate recovery."
   The hurricane emergency supplemental conference report includes key provisions for Louisiana. The relief bill contains the full $4.2 billion for homeowner relief and housing-related infrastructure in Louisiana requested by the White House and included in the original U.S. Senate bill. The bill includes $3.7 billion for levee improvements and hurricane protection projects in south Louisiana. 
   "This bill marks an important success and turning point in our recovery," Vitter said. "With our most immediate needs met, we will start looking to the long-term recovery of the entire state's economy."
   The hurricane emergency supplemental bill is expected to come for a vote in the U.S. Senate early next week.
