SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE SAMUEL ALITO
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement following his meeting this afternoon with U.S. Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito: 
   "I had a very good one-on-one meeting with Judge Alito today. It's a great chance for me to ask him a lot of questions directly and get a much fuller sense of his judicial philosophy. So it was a very good discussion. 
   "I continue to be extremely impressed. He is obviously very well qualified and has a great background He's very smart, has the right temperament to be judge and a lot of experience, including arguing before the Supreme Court in major cases. 
   "But what is most important to me is that he seems to have a conservative judicial philosophy. Knowing what the proper role of judge is, which is not to make up opinions based on his personal opinions, but to follow the law as enacted by the legislature. So that was very positive.
   "I look forward to his nomination hearings, as it is the constitutional duty of the U.S. Senate to give advice and consent when a president nominates an individual to the bench. And I still firmly believe that all judicial nominees should receive a fair up-or-down vote on the Senate floor."
