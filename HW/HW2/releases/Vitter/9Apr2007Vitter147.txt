SEN. VITTER URGES PRESIDENT TO CORRECT WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT POLICY STATEMENT
  Sen. David Vitter on Monday, April 9, wrote to President Bush urging him to change the Statement of Administration Policy on the Water Resources Development Act. Sen. David Vitter objected to a draft Statement of Administration Policy asking Congress to delete provisions authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf project and limiting resources for coastal restoration work in Louisiana. 
   "The Morganza project is one of the most worthy and carefully developed in WRDA. The project protects an area that is not only home to ten of thousands of Louisianans but also at the heart of our domestic energy and fishery industries," wrote Vitter.
   WRDA authorizes Corps of Engineers projects for flood control, navigation, hurricane protection, storm-damage reduction and ecosystem restoration.
   In the letter Vitter urged the president to take "immediate action to strike the ill-advised provisions from the SAP on the WRDA bill."
   "South Louisiana deserves better," Vitter said.
