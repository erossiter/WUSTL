SEN. VITTER SECURES ADDITIONAL $66 MILLION FOR EAST BATON ROUGE FLOOD CONTROL
  Sen. David Vitter today praised passage of the Water Resources Development Act in the U.S. Senate. Included in this legislation is authorization for an additional $66 million for flood control work in East Baton Rouge Parish.  
   "This is good news for the citizens of East Baton Rouge Parish. This authorized work will help prevent flooding in thousands of homes along the Amite River Basin. I am grateful to my colleagues for helping me get this crucial project included in WRDA," said Vitter.
   WRDA provides for authorization of an additional $66 million in flood control work in East Baton Rouge Parish. This will make total funding for this flood protection project $178 million. The project will improve 66 miles of drainage channels to ensure the efficient drainage of water from residential areas.
   WRDA now goes to a House-Senate conference committee.
