SEN. VITTER OFFERS AMENDMENT TO END TAXPAYER FUNDED ABORTIONS
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today offered his Title X Family Planning amendment to the U.S. Senate Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill. This amendment would prohibit the distribution of taxpayer dollars to abortion providers. 
   "The federal government should not redirect taxpayer dollars to pay for acts that so many Americans find morally wrong," said Vitter. "This amendment closes a loophole for taxpayer funded abortions."
   Vitter's amendment prohibits the distribution of taxpayer dollars, through Title X of the Public Health Service Act, to those that provide abortions. The original intent of the Title X in the 30-plus year-old Public Health Service Act was to make contraceptive supplies and family planning services available to those unable to afford them without government assistance. The amendment does not affect hospitals nor does it reduce any family planning funds. 
   "The federal tax payer's money is being used to indirectly fund abortions," said Vitter. "When abortion is such a divisive issue and so many Americans have such grave moral reservations about its practice, the federal government should not underwrite private abortion providers with taxpayer funds."
   Current regulations are ambiguous about the clear separation between federally funded family planning services and abortions. This ambiguity has allowed organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, to receive large sums of federal funding for "reproductive health activity" programs and often channel these federal dollars to clinics that perform abortions to pay for overhead expenses like electricity bills and office support staff - freeing up other funds for abortions.
