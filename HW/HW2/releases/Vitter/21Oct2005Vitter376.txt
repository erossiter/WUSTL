SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES NEARLY $23 MILLION IN FEMA GRANTS FOR HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that East Baton Rouge Parish, St.  
 Bernard Parish and the state of Louisiana will receive nearly $23 million from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to pay for costs associated with Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
   "I appreciate the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarding this money to Louisiana. This $22.8 million in federal grants will help offset some of the costs that local and state governments experienced during Hurricane Katrina," said Vitter. 
   East Baton Rouge Parish will receive $6.76 million for emergency response actions taken to alleviate immediate threats to life, health and public safety by activating the Emergency Operations Center and for deploying the police, fire and other essential public service personnel. The parish will also receive $8.75 million for debris removal efforts.
   The Lake Borgne Levee District in St. Bernard Parish will receive $1.35 million for response actions of barricading roadways, controlling traffic, conducting search and rescue operations and providing security to a population threatened by Hurricane Katrina.
   In addition, the state of Louisiana will be awarded $5.93 million to the Louisiana Department of Public Safety State Police for the deployment of personnel throughout the state to assist with evacuation and traffic control for Hurricane Katrina.
   "These grants are another way the federal government has brought resources to the table to assist our local and state governments during this extraordinary crisis," said Vitter. "I will continue to work with the Bush Administration, congressional leadership and the Louisiana delegation to bring additional resources to Louisiana to help in the recovery process."
