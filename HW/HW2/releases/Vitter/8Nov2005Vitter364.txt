SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $250,000 TO FIGHT CORRUPTION IN LOUISIANA
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the final conference report to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill included $250,000 in federal funding to fight corruption in Louisiana through the Metropolitan Crime Commission.  
   "We have to face the challenge of ending our legacy of corruption and cronyism. The work of the Metropolitan Crime Commission is helping change that perception," said Vitter. "The right actions over time can change the way people view Louisiana politics. And by doing so, we'll foster a new, healthier environment for business development and job growth in Louisiana."
   The Metropolitan Crime Commission will receive $250,000 to continue its Watchdog Corruption Hotline, an avenue for the public to report instances of government waste, corruption, mismanagement and unethical behavior. 
   These funds build on the more than $3.5 million Vitter has secured in previous spending bills for anticorruption efforts while in the U.S. House of Representatives.
   "This $250,000 in federal funding will continue the Metropolitan Crime Commission's important work of fighting corruption and cronyism in Louisiana," Vitter said.
   The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives are expected to approve the final conference report this week, before it is sent to the president for his signature.
