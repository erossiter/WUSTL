SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF SOUTHWICK TO SERVE ON U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE 5TH CIRCUIT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on the Senate's confirmation of Judge Leslie Southwick to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which includes Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas: 
   "I believe that every judicial nominee deserves a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote, and I am pleased that enough senators decided it was time to overcome this filibuster of Judge Southwick. Unfortunately, Sen. Landrieu was not among that group, continuing her trend of not allowing nominees that have direct connections to Louisiana to even receive an up-or-down vote - much like she is doing to David Dugas who is nominated to fill another critical court vacancy in the Middle District Court of Louisiana
   "Judge Southwick has received high marks from the American Bar Association and was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for his current judicial position. His nomination was being opposed for purely partisan reasons, and this seat on the 5th Circuit - which has jurisdiction in Louisiana - has been deemed an emergency need to fill. Thankfully, we can now fill this critical need with a thoughtful, strict constitutional jurist," said Vitter.
