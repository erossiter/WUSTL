SEN. VITTER SECURES $4 MILLION FOR CYBERSPACE INNOVATION CENTER
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today announced funding of $4 million in the 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for the Cyberspace Innovation Center at Barksdale Air Force Base. The Cyberspace Innovation Center will serve as a hub for businesses, education and training relevant to the Department of Defense's Cyberspace Command, which is currently housed at Barksdale until the determination of a permanent location. Barksdale Air Force Base is one of several sites under current consideration as the permanent home for this new command. Working with U.S. Rep. Jim McCrery, Vitter was able to secure this funding for the center. 
   "I am extremely pleased that we were able to secure this funding for the Cyberspace Innovation Center," said Vitter. "When we talk about fighting for a vibrant future for Louisiana, the first thing we focus on is economic growth for our businesses - especially in technology fields and 21st century industries. This command will provide excellent economic opportunities for local industry."
   The Cyberspace Innovation Center will be responsible for the training, planning and equipping of operations related to the Cyberspace Command. Working in conjunction with the local community, the center will help promote cyber research and technology development on behalf of our national security.
   "The Cyberspace Center will be a strong economic boost for our state, creating revenue and sustainable IT jobs by attracting professionals from the military and civilian communities. These new jobs will, in turn, bring new businesses and services to the area, creating even more positive economic growth," Vitter said.
   The DOD Appropriations Bill has passed the House and Senate and has been sent to the president for his approval. Sen. Vitter has been meeting with Air Force officials since the spring regarding the possible permanent stationing of the Cyberspace Command in Louisiana.
