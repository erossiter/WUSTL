SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES MAJOR FUNDING TO PROTECT COASTAL LOUISIANA
  Sen. David Vitter declared victory today on his top hurricane priority: securing a big down payment in the hurricane spending bill for higher levels of protection beyond category 3 and for coastal restoration work.  
 This is in addition to the approximately $3 billion of immediate category 3 levee work President Bush is supporting, also included in the bill.
   "This is a strong signal to Louisiana that Congress is committed to building a stronger level of defense for our entire coast. This funding is a down payment from the federal government toward better hurricane, coastal and flood protection for all of south Louisiana," said Vitter. 
   Vitter credited his work with Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, who toured the New Orleans and southeast Louisiana devastation on November 7th at Vitter's invitation.
   With the support of the whole Louisiana delegation, Stevens and Vitter crafted a Gulf Coast Recovery and Disaster Prevention and Assistance fund and secured its inclusion in the final bill. This fund would secure revenue from two sources--upcoming government auctions of digital television spectrum and energy production in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The fund would yield Louisiana a total of $9.8 billion--$3 billion over the next 4 years and the remaining $6.8 billion over 30 years. 
   The Louisiana money could be used for three broad categories: higher levels of hurricane and flood protection, coastal restoration work, and hurricane evacuation routes like I-49. 
   This legislation is expected to pass the U.S. House of Representatives tonight and the Senate tomorrow.
