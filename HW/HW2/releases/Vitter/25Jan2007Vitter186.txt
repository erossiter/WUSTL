SEN. VITTER PRAISES COMMITMENT FROM U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, Jan. 25, praised a commitment from U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to continue U.S. Department of Justice efforts to address major law enforcement needs in the city of New Orleans. 
   "After extensive conversations with Department of Justice and state and local law enforcement officials, I believe we can make strides and clamp down on the crime problems plaguing New Orleans," said Vitter. "The increase in the number of agents assigned to the Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Force is just one example of how this continued commitment from DOJ will help."
   In the fourth emergency supplemental appropriations bill, Vitter helped secure $125 million for the most basic operational needs of law enforcement officials throughout the Gulf Coast of which the Department of Justice allocated $12 million specifically for Orleans parish law enforcement officials. In an effort to continue assisting New Orleans, the Department of Justice has allocated additional resources to the city such as hiring more Assistant U.S. Attorneys and increasing the number of ATF, DEA and FBI agents.
   "My focus has been to place more federal agents in New Orleans and to get them to immediately coordinate with local law enforcement on the ground," said Vitter. "To end the reign of fear, we must protect our citizens and enable them to assist law enforcement."
