SEN. VITTER PRAISES PASSAGE OF SENATE OFFSHORE ROYALTIES BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement on the passage of the Senate Offshore Royalties Bill: 
   "Today's passage is a historic breakthrough -both in terms of Louisiana and other producing states getting our fair share of offshore royalties and in terms of producing more energy domestically. After passing royalty sharing four times while I served in the U.S. House, I am pleased that I was able to negotiate this compromise in my first term as a U.S. Senator. This is at the heart of securing our coast and, along with it, a strong, stable future for Louisiana.
   "While this is good news, it is not the end. I look forward to working closely with the House, led by Congressman Jindal, to ensure we deliver a bill to the President that recognizes the vital role Louisiana plays in our national energy security and provides new, abundant, secure, domestic energy sources for all Americans," said Vitter.
