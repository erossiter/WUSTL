SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES CLARIFICATION FROM TREASURY THAT WILL BENEFIT LOUISIANA RICE FARMERS, MILLERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the U.S. Department of Treasury has clarified a regulation benefiting rice farmers and millers. 
   "This is great news for rice farmers and millers because it makes it easier for them to sell their product," said Vitter.
   Vitter and Louisiana rice farmers and millers have been working to get clarification from Treasury on a rule requiring advance payments in permitted trade of food and medicine with Cuba. The rice farmers and millers were not sure if a letter of credit could serve as a payment in advance. 
   "Cuba used to be one of our greatest export markets, but since the embargo we lost that market. We didn't get it back until Congress approved food and medicine sales and now Senator Vitter's clarification makes for a less bureaucratic transaction," added Bobby Hanks of the Louisiana Rice Mill, LLC. 
   Treasury issued a letter on April 6th saying a letter of credit is considered payment in advance in the eyes of the U.S. Treasury. The clarification to allow a letter of credit to serve as a payment in advance helps Louisiana rice farmers and millers sell their rice to Cuba under the limited food trade that is allowed.
