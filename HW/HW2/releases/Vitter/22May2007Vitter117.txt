SEN. VITTER OFFERS AMENDMENT TO REMOVE AMNESTY PROVISIONS IN IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today offered an amendment to the Immigration Bill that would strike the entire section of the legislation providing Z Visas. 
   "Z Visas are amnesty - pure and simple. My amendment strikes the entire Z Visa provision from this legislation so we can focus on securing our borders and strengthening enforcement," said Vitter. 
   Vitter's amendment strikes all of title VI of the Immigration Bill, eliminating the Z Visa amnesty provisions in the legislation.
