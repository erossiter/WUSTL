SEN. VITTER DISCUSSES HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS WITH DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on his recent conversation with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and FEMA Administrator Paulison. Last week Sen. David Vitter wrote a letter to Sec. Chertoff expressing his concerns over the federal level of hurricane readiness: 
   "I wrote Sec. Chertoff a couple weeks ago about my concerns over inadequate hurricane preparations within our state by the federal government. Yesterday I followed up on that letter with a conference call with both the secretary and the head of FEMA, David Paulison. 
   "It was a very substantive call where we discussed point by point all of the issues I brought up in the letter. I think both the letter and the call have moved all parties to correcting the situation. In some cases, there were miscommunications, and in other cases, I think FEMA has now gotten on the ball and done what they should have been doing all along - working with the state to ensure that supplies and other vital items are in place. 
   "This improvement is good news, but the key for Louisiana is to stay constantly vigilant, and I will continue to do that - meeting and talking with both federal officials and folks on the ground at the state and local level," said Vitter.
