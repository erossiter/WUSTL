SEN. VITTER TOURS FORT POLK
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today toured Fort Polk with Brig. Gen. Daniel P. Bolger, commanding general of Fort Polk. Several community leaders were also present on the tour including Leesville Mayor Betty Westerchill, Anacoco Mayor LeRoy Cooley Roespine Mayor Bruce Ward and Hornbeck Mayor Clarence Beebe.  
    "Fort Polk is an asset to Louisiana and is an important part of our national military and security," said Vitter. "The soldiers at Fort Polk are working to defend our freedom around the world."
   One topic that was discussed was the possible expansion of Fort Polk. The Army is planning on adding five new brigades, each with 3,600 soldiers. Fort Polk is one of the final 10 bases that could possibly receive one of these brigades. A decision on the designation of those brigades will not take place until the end of this year. 
   "Expanding Fort Polk with a new brigade would not only increase Fort Polk's presence and importance but would also create new civilian jobs and improve the economy," Vitter said. "Although a decision on the new brigades is many months away, I plan on meeting with Army officials to discuss Fort Polk's assets and will encourage other members of the Louisiana congressional delegation to do the same."
   On Vitter's tour, he saw the Combat Training Center and the progress being made there. He also met with families of deployed soldiers at the Family Readiness Center. There are many families at Fort Polk who have relatives fighting abroad. The Family Readiness Center helps them cope while their loved ones are away.
   "When we think about the soldiers who are sacrificing their lives for our freedom, it is important to remember that each of them comes from a family who loves and cares about them. The Family Readiness Center gives support to those families, which is invaluable, especially during a time of war," Vitter added.
