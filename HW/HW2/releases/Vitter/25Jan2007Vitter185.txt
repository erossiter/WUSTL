SEN. VITTER DISAPPOINTED BY DEMOCRATIC DEFEAT OF HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT AMENDMENT
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, Jan. 25, expressed his disappointment in the Democratic defeat of an amendment by Sen. John Ensign of Nevada to the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. This amendment would have made health care more affordable and accessible by expanding the ability of people to use their health savings accounts to pay for health insurance. 
   "I was really hoping we'd build a bipartisan compromise combining a minimum wage increase with real help for small business. But today the Democrats voted in block to kill an amendment that would have simply allowed using health savings accounts to pay for health insurance," said Vitter. 
   The health savings account amendment failed with a vote of 47 - 48. No Democrats voted for the amendment. 
   "And now they're blocking even having votes on my small business amendments. This is really, really disappointing," said Vitter.
   Vitter offered two of his own amendments to the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. His first amendment grants relief to small businesses for a first-time violation of an agency's paperwork requirements. Vitter's second amendment allows small businesses to pool together to purchase health insurance.
