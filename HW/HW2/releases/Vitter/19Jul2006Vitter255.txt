SEN. VITTER SECURES $204 MILLION FOR PORT OF IBERIA
  Sen. David Vitter today praised passage of the Water Resources Development Act in the U.S. Senate. Included in this legislation is authorization for work at the Port of Iberia.  
   "Louisiana's hurricane, flood and coastal protection took a giant leap forward today with the passage of WRDA. As Louisiana's only member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I was in a unique position to secure authorization of more than $204 million for the Port of Iberia and Vermillion hurricane protection," said Vitter.
   "As Chairman of the EPW Committee, I worked closely with Senator Vitter on the development of these provisions in WRDA that will go a long way to providing strong hurricane, flood and coastal protection for Louisiana. I want to thank Senator Vitter for bringing these ideas to my attention," said U.S. Senator James Inhoffe (Okla.), Chairman of the Senate EPW Committee.
   WRDA provides for authorization of $204.6 million for the deepening project for the Port of Iberia and improves hurricane protection for Vermillion Parish. It will provide a 20-foot access channel to the Port of Iberia, which is currently 12-feet deep. In addition, it will integrate navigation and hurricane protection by requiring that the spoil material from dredging the deeper channel be used to raise hurricane protection levees on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and Freshwater Bayou for Vermillion Parish. 
   "This is tremendous news for Vermillion Parish and the Port of Iberia. By deepening the port channel, we will be boosting economic development and improving hurricane protection at the same time. This is a win-win for Southwest Louisiana," said Vitter.
   WRDA now goes to a House-Senate conference committee.
