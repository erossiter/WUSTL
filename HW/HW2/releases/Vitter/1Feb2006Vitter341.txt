SEN. VITTER INTRODUCES LEGISLATION FOR EMERGENCY HURRICANE PROTECTION PROJECTS
  Sen. David Vitter introduced new legislation today to give the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers full authorization to complete projects that will go beyond pre-Katrina levels of hurricane protection for south Louisiana.  
   "The Corps of Engineers currently has the necessary authority to rebuild the pre-Katrina hurricane and flood protection system. As we found out from Hurricane Katrina, this system wasn't good enough," said Vitter. "We need to give the Corps full-authority to go beyond pre-Katrina levels - to true Category 3 - to protect south Louisiana, and we need to do it before hurricane season begins."
   Vitter's bill, the "Louisiana Emergency Needs Corps of Engineers Authorization Act," would give the Corps of Engineers full congressional authorization to begin construction on these critical projects for hurricane and flood protection, including: 
   * Strengthening and fortifying existing levees and floodwalls to prevent any future failures or collapse,
   * Storm-proofing pumping stations in Jefferson and Orleans parishes to ensure full operations and operator protection during a hurricane,
   * Compensating property owners at a level to at least pre-Katrina or pre-Rita fair market values for the purchase of property required for flood or hurricane protection infrastructure,
   * Installing permanent gates and constructing pumping stations at the head of the London, Orleans and 17th Street outfall canals that drain into Lake Pontchartrain and installing liners under these three outfall canals adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain to prevent seepage to adjacent properties or undermining floodwalls,
   * $250 million in coastal restoration work designed to buffer storm surge from causing damage to property in south Louisiana, and
   * Protecting Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes by authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project.
   "The authorization of these projects is crucial to the livelihood of not only south Louisiana, but the entire state. By taking this step in a timely manner, the federal government can demonstrate its commitment to the resurrection and the rebuilding of our great state," said Vitter. 
    "This bill is a first step to get us where we need to be by June 1. But I will continue to pursue other legislation to provide stronger levels of protection," Vitter said.
   Under Vitter's legislation, all required work would be performed at full federal expense. The Morganza to the Gulf project would be authorized at $800 million, remaining projects at $1.4 billion for a total of $2.2 billion.
