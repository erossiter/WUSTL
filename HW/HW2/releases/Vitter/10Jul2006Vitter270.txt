SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON CORPS REPORT
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement following the release of the six-month report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: 
   "Another week, another disappointing announcement from the Corps of Engineers. Today, the Corps of Engineers released their six month report, which they were required to do by law, but it included no specific project recommendations. This is extremely disappointing because I have been in constant contact with the Corps and the State on specific project recommendations. While these discussions seemed to be progressing well, the Assistant Secretary of the Army decided to gut the report and remove all substance from the report."
   "This lack of leadership and ineptitude has become the rule rather than the exception. Two weeks ago I expressed frustration with the Corps on their repeated failures to meet self-imposed deadlines and goals. This report is nothing more than another slap in the face of Louisiana."
   "Our delegation is committed to receiving specific recommendations from the Corps as directed in the law. I have negotiated a new provision for the Senate's Corps' bill that provides an expedited approval process for hurricane, flood and coastal protection projects in south Louisiana. While the Corps' decision is a setback, I am committed to ensuring that red tape is cut and the bureaucracy is eliminated at the Corps of Engineers."
