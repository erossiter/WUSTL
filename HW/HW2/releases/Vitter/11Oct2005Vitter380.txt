SEN. VITTER HOPEFUL ABOUT BRAC ANNOUNCEMENT
  Sen. David Vitter said today that he was hopeful that Louisiana would receive good news when the final Base Realignment and Closure recommendations are announced tomorrow.  
   "As the final vote gets closer, I've been calling the BRAC Commissioners to highlight the merits of the Federal City proposal and what an asset it could be in maintaining our nation's defense," Vitter said. "I've also discussed the proposal with BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi and the Chief of Naval Operations, and I'm hopeful we've been able to convince them of the military assets Louisiana provides."
   Vitter has been working with the rest of the Louisiana delegation to have the Naval Support Activity Base in Algiers and the Defense Information Systems Agency facility in Slidell taken off of the BRAC Commission's recommended closure list.
   Vitter visited NSA in June with the BRAC Commissioners to demonstrate the merits of the base and explain the Federal City proposal, and he testified before the BRAC Commission in July on the importance of NSA and DISA to southeast Louisiana.
   Vitter first invited local elected officials and members of the Louisiana Congressional delegation to finalize the BRAC strategy for southeast Louisiana in light of the BRAC Commission's recommendation of closure in May for NSA and DISA.
