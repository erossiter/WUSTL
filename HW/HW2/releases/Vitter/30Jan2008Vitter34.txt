SEN. VITTER ASKS SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DUGAS NOMINATION
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today sent a letter to U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy requesting a formal hearing on the nomination of U.S. Attorney David Dugas to the Middle District Court of Louisiana. 
   "I sent a letter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee requesting that he schedule a hearing on the nomination of David Dugas in the very near future. Mr. Dugas was nominated by the president on March 19, 2007. There is an urgent need to fill this vacancy, and a debilitating backlog is soon becoming a reality that will create a judicial emergency. David has established himself as an extremely qualified jurist who has received the American Bar Association's highest rating. 
   "The Senate Judiciary Committee has not scheduled a hearing because Senator Landrieu has not returned her "blue slip." And the only reason she has stated publicly for her opposition has been fully resolved. I asked that Chairman Leahy meet with Senator Landrieu and encourage her to return her "blue slip" or, alternatively, move forward and schedule a hearing without it in light of her baseless opposition. 
   "As the president highlighted in his State of the Union address, the Senate should move forward with up-or-down votes on his judicial nominees and David Dugas's case is no exception. To continue to block this qualified nominee is nothing more than partisanship and obstructionism - exactly what the American people want to see Congress rise above," said Vitter.
