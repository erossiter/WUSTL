SEN. VITTER, REP. ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE COLUMBIA FIRE DEPARTMENT GRANT
  Sen. David Vitter and Rep. Rodney Alexander announced today that the Columbia Volunteer Fire Department will receive a $3,600 federal grant to support its services in the community through a fire prevention program. 
   "These grants give our fire districts access to the equipment they need to take care of fires and emergency situations in the community more safely and efficiently," said Vitter.
   The Columbia Volunteer Fire Department will receive $3,600 in federal funds for fire prevention. This federal grant program is designed to assist local fire departments in protecting citizens and firefighters against the effects of fire and fire-related incidents. This one-year grant award goes directly to fire departments to support firefighters and the services they deliver. 
   "This is good news for the residents of Columbia," Alexander said. "This is an investment in one of our rural communities and it will reap dividends."
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness, in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
