SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES NEARLY $21 MILLION FOR CITY OF NEW ORLEANS FROM COMMUNITY DISASTER LOAN
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that the city of New Orleans will receive more than $20 million as the first installment of a $120 million Community Disaster Loan (CDL) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  
 This first installment will assist New Orleans in providing essential services as it recovers from Hurricane Katrina.
   "The more than $20 million that New Orleans will receive from the CDL program will ensure that essential city services will continue," said Vitter. "These services - from police and fire protection to trash and debris removal - are critical to the rebuilding process and let others know that New Orleans is open for business."
   The city of New Orleans will receive $20.96 million as the first of eight installments on the $120 million loan approved earlier this month. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina left Louisiana's most severely affected parish governments with very little, if any, local tax revenue for the foreseeable future. Community Disaster Loans apply to localities suffering decreased tax revenue as a result of a disaster.
   The Community Disaster Loan program for Louisiana was made possible by Vitter, who in October succeeded in Congressional passage of $1 billion in emergency loans to help local governments in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
