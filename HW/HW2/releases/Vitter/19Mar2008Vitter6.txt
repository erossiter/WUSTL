SEN. VITTER PARTICIPATES IN CODEL TO AFGHANISTAN
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter is this week visiting Afghanistan as part of a congressional delegation with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso.  
   "I believe it is very important to visit the troops in the field and get a firsthand perspective of how effectively we are fighting the war on terror. I look forward to visiting our brave Louisiana soldiers in the region as well as meeting with U.S. military and Afghani officials. Gen. David Petraeus is planning to report to Congress about our mission status in Afghanistan in April, and I believe it is important to see things directly before this discussion," said Vitter.
   Vitter also visited Iraq in 2006 and 2007.
