SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR AGRICULTURE REMEDIATION
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, included $292,000 in federal funding for agriculture waste remediation. 
   "I appreciate that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee understand the problems dairy and other agriculture waste can cause for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin," said Vitter. "This funding complements the ongoing work to keep a healthy environment in the basin, which is all the more important after the hurricanes last year."
   The agriculture industry in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin includes 300 dairies. Currently, dairy waste from cattle holding paddocks and the milking parlors are washed from the concrete surfaces into large holding ponds and retained until land application. The funding will help explore alternatives to address this waste and keep it from getting into the lake. The $292,000 builds on the last several years of federal funding and will fit in with the ongoing work of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Management Conference.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this year.
