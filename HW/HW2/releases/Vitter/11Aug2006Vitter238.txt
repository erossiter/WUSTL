SEN. VITTER AGAIN CALLS ON GOV. BLANCO TO WITHDRAW I-10 AND I-12 TOLL PROPOSAL
  Sen. David Vitter today commented again on Gov. Kathleen Blanco's proposal to toll I-10 and I-12:  
   "Yesterday, I asked Governor Blanco to formally withdraw her administration's written submission to the federal government to toll all of I-10 and I-12 in Louisiana. I am still waiting for a clear response to that clear request. 
   In the meantime, her Secretary of Transportation has said two things. First, he's said that they haven't decided to impose tolls. In that case, why did he make a written submission to the federal government in March and write: 'Our proposal is for converting the I-10/I-12 corridor in Louisiana to a toll facility. . . . We believe this project is essential to the economic recovery of the state and to better prepare for future events.' Second, he's said that I and the entire Congressional Delegation were fully briefed on this proposal . . . but that the governor was not. 
   Well, she certainly knows about it now. I again ask her to exert some leadership and act."
