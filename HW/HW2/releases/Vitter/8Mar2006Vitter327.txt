SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON OFFSHORE ROYALTIES
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following comments about the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources legislation that did not include an offshore royalties provision for Louisiana:  
   "Once again, I am extremely disappointed that an offshore royalties provision for Louisiana and the Gulf Coast states was not included by the Senate Energy Committee in its legislation today. Senator Landrieu should be applauded for her continuing efforts, but once again her colleagues, particularly Senator Bingaman, have turned a deaf ear to her requests. 
   "Louisiana cannot afford to keep running up against this brick wall time and time again. Time is not a luxury Louisiana can afford. With this in mind, I am actively pursing two things: first, a floor amendment to the 181 bill to give Louisiana its fair share of those royalties, and secondly, new, broad royalty-sharing legislation that would move through the Commerce Committee to avoid Senator Bingaman's obstructionism.".
