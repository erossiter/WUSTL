SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF FEMA BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement about the final passage of H.R. 1134, a provision that will exempt FEMA flood mitigation grant recipients from having their grants taxed as income: 
   "I'm both pleased and relieved that Congress took the opportunity to prevent the hardship these taxes would cause to homeowners before Tax Day. Flood mitigation funds are important to many Louisiana residents and it would have been devastating to homeowners if these funds were subject to tax. 
   "By passing this bill through the Senate, we ensure that Louisiana homeowners who have been through a flood will not get hit with unfair tax bills. These flood mitigation grant programs were intended to help homeowners modify their homes to protect them from future flooding. 
   "I applaud Congressman Bobby Jindal for his leadership in getting the provision passed so quickly in the House of Representatives. Now that the bill has been amended and passed in the Senate and the House, it can be sent to President Bush for his signature."
