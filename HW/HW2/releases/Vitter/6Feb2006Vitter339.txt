SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
 Sen. David Vitter made the following statement after the release of President Bush's budget today: 
   "These budget numbers are extremely disappointing in a number of ways. The worst is the Corps of Engineers' numbers - cut 11 percent from last year and Corps' construction cut 34 percent! While I was able to secure almost $2 billion to fund all flood and hurricane Corps projects in metropolitan New Orleans through emergency supplemental, we continue to have unmet needs. These sorts of cuts in the past are what led to cutting corners. And that led to catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. The Administration has to remember that most of that flooding was a man-made, not natural, disaster."
