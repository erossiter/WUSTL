SEN. VITTER OUTLINES LOUISIANA PRIORITIES ACHIEVED IN WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today wrote a letter to Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer and Ranking Member James Inhofe thanking them for addressing Louisiana priorities in the U.S. Senate's Water Resources Development Act. 
   "With lasting memories of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and another hurricane season rapidly approaching, Congress needs to get serious about passing a WRDA bill," said Vitter. "The bill we crafted in committee and the proposed manager's amendment make important strides in addressing some of our most urgent needs with immediate authorizations for pressing problems like closing MRGO, establishing a 100-year level of hurricane protection and protecting and restoring coastal Louisiana." 
   Several Louisiana priorities are set to be authorized in the WRDA manager's amendment including the closure of MRGO, the Louisiana Water Resources Council - which serves as the exclusive peer review entity for all Army Corps of Engineers water resources projects in the disaster areas of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita - and authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf hurricane protection project for Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes. 
   "This current WRDA manager's amendment has some great achievements for hurricane, coastal and flood protection but does leave a void," said Vitter. "We must work to address the flexibility and expediting mechanisms needed to make progress on providing greater hurricane protection to south Louisiana."
   Vitter intends to offer an amendment to address this void when the bill is considered on the U.S. Senate floor.
