SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON POWELL'S FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY FLOOD MAP ANNOUNCEMENT
  Today, Sen. David Vitter made the following statement on Federal Recovery and Rebuild Coordinator Don Powell's announcement regarding Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps: 
   "Although the announcement today certainly isn't ideal, at least it allows our citizens to move forward with rebuilding. I have been pushing Don Powell and FEMA on this flood map issue for sometime because so much activity has been stalled waiting for advisory flood maps.
   Today, I made it very clear to Don Powell that we need the president to lead by offering a specific plan for lower Plaquemines Parish, making specific requests to congress to put money in the current supplemental appropriations bill before us now, and stating that this should be done at 100% federal expense," said U.S. Sen. David Vitter.
