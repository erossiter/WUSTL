SEN. VITTER APPOINTED RANKING MEMBER ON U.S. SENATE COMMERCE SUBCOMMITTEE
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today was appointed ranking member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences. 
   "I am very excited to have been named to this position," said Vitter. "NASA has a long history and significant presence in Louisiana. Thousands of Louisianans are employed by the Michoud Assembly Facility and Stennis Space Center, and the impact of the space program on Louisiana cannot be overstated. I look forward to playing a significant role and representing Louisiana's interests as we work to shape the future of the space program."
   With this new committee assignment, Vitter will play an important role in determining space policy. His appointment also places Louisiana in a unique and highly favorable position on matters related to NASA, aeronautics and related sciences.
  The Michoud Assembly Facility in south Louisiana is currently charged with the production of the Space Shuttle's external fuel tanks and is home to more than 4,200 employees.
   "This is a fantastic opportunity," Vitter said. "This subcommittee handles issues that are important to Louisiana industry and to our continued presence at the forefront of space and aeronautical sciences. I look forward to next year and the work ahead."
   Vitter's appointment will be effective immediately following the official resignation of U.S. Sen. Trent Lott. Vitter serves on the Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittees on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security; Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Safety, Infrastructure and Security; Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard; Interstate Commerce, Trade and Tourism; and Consumer Affairs, Insurance and Automotive Safety. Vitter will also retain his membership on the Foreign Relations and Environment and Public Works Committees and on the Special Committee on Aging.
