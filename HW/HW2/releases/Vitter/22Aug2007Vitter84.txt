SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT VISIT TO IRAQ
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on his recent visit to Iraq: 
   "My trip to Iraq was very productive for two reasons. First of all, I wanted to thank our troops - including many from Louisiana - for their enormous sacrifices. I also wanted to get briefed and see first hand the situation on the ground before a large and important debate on Iraq in Congress in September.
   "We saw a number of things while there and had a number of important meetings, including an hour and a half meeting with General Patreaus and Ambassador Crocker, a meeting with both of the Iraqi vice presidents - one Sunni, one Shia - and meetings with many of the forces on the ground. We also met with local sheiks, who - Sunni and Shia - are working very cooperatively with our military.
   "In general, I think the surge is working in two important areas. First, the surge has been effective getting at al Qaeda and having them on the run. Second, the surge has tapped down sectarian violence. 
   "Where it has fallen short is that the surge was supposed to create breathing room for political developments on the ground, but the Iraqi Central Government has not stepped up and done enough with this breathing room to make progress. But that is happening more at the local level, so I am hoping that this will continue to develop.
   "All of these matters were very significant to see as we go into a very important Iraq debate in September," said Vitter.
   Vitter traveled to Iraq with U.S. Sens. Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker, and George Voinovich. This is Vitter's third trip to the Middle East and his second trip to Iraq. On this trip Vitter also visited wounded soldiers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near the Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
