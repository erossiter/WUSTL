REP. ALEXANDER, SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCE USDA FUNDING FOR BUNKIE POLICE FORCE
  Rep. Rodney Alexander and Sen. David Vitter announced on Wednesday, Feb. 21 that the City of Bunkie will receive a USDA Community Facility Grant totaling $32,175 for the purchase of three used patrol cars and equipment. 
   "Without assistance, obtaining necessary equipment is often difficult for small police forces, such as the Bunkie police force," Alexander said. "This funding will provide for some very basic needs that will enable the Bunkie police officers to continue their service."
   "This is good news for Bunkie because it provides the police department with the patrol cars it needs to continue keeping the streets of the community safe," said Vitter.
