SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING DEFEAT OF IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement regarding the defeat of the immigration bill. 
   "This is an incredible victory for the American people. The Kennedy immigration bill was flawed and granted amnesty to millions of illegals. 
   "For a while, a small group of us were the only senators advocating the position of the majority of Americans. I am thankful that the continued calls and persistent engagement of the American people on this issue paid off. 
   "The next step is to immediately push the president to take up his word and enforce security at the border. I am ready to support the work that is needed to accomplish this goal," said Vitter.
