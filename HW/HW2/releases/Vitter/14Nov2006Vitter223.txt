SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR BELLE CHASSE JOINT RESERVE BASE IN MILITARY APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the Senate Veterans Administration-Military Construction Appropriations Bill, which passed the U.S. Senate today, included $6.307 million for the Belle Chasse Joint Reserve Base. 
   "With the inclusion of this federal money, Congress is sending a strong signal to the local community in Belle Chase that the JRB will remain a fixture in the community for long time," Vitter added. "This funding will strengthen Belle Chasse's ability to process and screen new recruits."
   As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) movement of assets, the MILCON appropriations bill contains $6.037 million for a Military Entrance Processing Center at the Belle Chasse JRB. This Center is used by the Department of Defense to process civilians who are entering the military. Examples of such processing would be blood tests and finalizing paperwork.
   The Senate Veterans Administration-Military Construction Appropriations Bill will now be sent to a House-Senate Conference Committee before final passage.
