SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPLACING FEMA
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement after the release of a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report, "A Nation Still Unprepared," recommended that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) be replaced with an authority that would be independent of the Department of Homeland Security:
   "I think this clearly confirms what folks in Louisiana have known for months - that FEMA is beyond repair. In addition, to the Senate committee recommendations, I think we need to consider removing the new disaster agency from the Department of Homeland Security.".
