   304 Senate Russell Building
   Washington, DC 20510 
   Dear John: 
   I was dismayed to hear your recent comments about our military men and women in Iraq, suggesting that they are stuck there because they're uneducated, perhaps because they didn't work hard at their studies. I write to demand an immediate apology from you in light of those comments. 
   On October 30, 2006 at an appearance in California on behalf of Phil Angelides' Governor Campaign, your comments were truly despicable and offensive. It's a slap in the face of all of our intelligent, dedicated, brave men and women in the military. Of course, there are many of these from Louisiana, whom I have the honor to represent. I take particular offense on behalf of them. 
   I interact with our fine military regularly, particularly those from Louisiana. I'm always struck by their courage, dedication, AND intelligence. It's an objective fact that our military today is better educated and trained than ever before. In light of this obvious reality, your comments suggest that either you don't interact with today's military in any significant way or, even more troubling; you have a basic and deep-seated contempt for them. 
   They aren't stupid, uneducated, or lazy. They're heroes. And they deserve your immediate apology. 
   Sincerely,
   David Vitter
   United States Senator.
