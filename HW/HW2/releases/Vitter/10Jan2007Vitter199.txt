SEN. VITTER QUESTIONS COMMITMENT TO ETHICS REFORM
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement regarding the U.S. Senate's vote to table his tribal campaign contribution amendment:
   "The Abramoff scandal - what led to this debate - had unlimited Indian tribe money in the middle of it. And yet one of the new majority's first votes is to kill an amendment that would simply treat tribes like everyone else and properly regulate their campaign contributions? This is blatant hypocrisy - even by Washington standards," said Vitter.
