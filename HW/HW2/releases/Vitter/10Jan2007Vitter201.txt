SEN. VITTER REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S IRAQ SPEECH
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter tonight made the following statement regarding the president's speech on his strategy for Iraq: 
   "I absolutely agree with the president that as bad as the situation in Iraq is now it could get a lot worse if we immediately withdraw. Allowing the situation in Iraq to disintegrate further is not just a threat to the people of Iraq, but to our own security interests as well.
   I will be studying the details of the president's plan to turn things around, specifically in regard to what sort of difference this troop surge can make on the ground and to how serious Prime Minister al-Maliki is in his commitment to stopping the violence.
   "We will have extensive hearings in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the coming week to explore this new strategy and make sure we get it right," said Vitter.
