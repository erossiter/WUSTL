SEN. VITTER EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER JUDICIAL NOMINATION PROCESS
  Sen. David Vitter signed a letter with other freshmen Senators to encourage Senate leadership to refine the confirmation process of federal judicial nominees and break down the partisan walls that stand in the way of filling these vacancies. 
   "I pledged to do the people's business and put Louisianians and Americans first by putting judges on the bench. This is a solution that needs to happen now as a matter of principle. Judicial nominees should be treated the same regardless of which party controls the White House or the Senate," said Vitter. 
   The letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, (R-TN), and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, (D-NV), urges them to work together to address the judicial crisis that threatens to severely damage our system in the years to come. U.S. Senators have the responsibility to respond to these judicial emergencies and maintain our nation's distinction that requires its legislature act to ensure balance among its citizens and its branches of government.
   "I eagerly signed this letter to encourage our leadership to give all judicial nominees a fair up-or-down vote. It is inexcusable to have judicial vacancies open for years," said Vitter. "We have to break through the obstructionism and give every judicial nominee an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor."
