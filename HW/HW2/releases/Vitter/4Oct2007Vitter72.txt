SEN. VITTER LEADS REPUBLICANS IN ASKING PRESIDENT BUSH TO RECONSIDER POTENTIAL WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT VETO
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today sent a letter to President Bush requesting that he reconsider his staff's recommendation to veto the Water Resources Development Act and sign the bill into law. 
   "I am very confident that this letter makes it clear that the Senate can override a potential veto of the WRDA bill, and I urge the president to reconsider his staff's veto recommendation and remember the promise he made to Louisiana and the nation in Jackson Square two years ago," said Vitter.
   Vitter has been recruiting fellow Republican senators to commit to WRDA's enactment since the White House indicated it may try to veto the bill. Twenty-one Republicans joined Vitter and signed the letter to the president asking him to reconsider a veto of WRDA. These votes in addition to the party-line Democratic votes in support of WRDA's passage should guarantee the two-thirds vote needed to override the veto in the U.S. Senate.
   "This bill is critically important to Louisiana's recovery and will authorize incredible advancements in Louisiana's coastal, hurricane and flood protection," added Vitter. "The bill also provides greater flexibility and improvements in the Corps of Engineers."
