SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS VOTE TO DERAIL DREAM ACT
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today applauded the failure of the cloture vote on the U.S. Senate Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. This vote effectively stops the Senate from debating the DREAM Act. Vitter offered the following statement after the vote: 
   "The pro-amnesty crowd keeps trying to find creative ways to sneak amnesty provisions through the U.S. Senate, but once again the voice of the majority of Americans was heard. This summer they called it earned citizenship and this time they tried to call it a dream, but these new names are just creative cover for the what 'it' really is - amnesty.
   "There seemed to be no age limit to apply for this proposed retroactive amnesty. The DREAM Act would have merely required an illegal alien to demonstrate that he entered the U.S. illegally before the age of 16. But how can an individual with no paper trail or records demonstrate this? It's a cover provision for mass amnesty.
   "Illegal immigrants are already receiving millions in federal taxpayer dollars in Social Security, health care and other welfare programs, but now the DREAM Act wanted American taxpayers to pay for their college tuition as well," Vitter said.
   This summer, Vitter joined a small group of senators in leading the opposition that derailed the Kennedy amnesty bill. Many of the border security provisions he advocated for during the immigration debate were included in later emergency border security funding measures passed by the U.S. Senate.
