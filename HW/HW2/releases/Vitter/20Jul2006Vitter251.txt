SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS MEDIA PROJECT IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $250,000 for the Robert E. Nims Center for Entertainment Arts and Multi-Media Technology at the University of New Orleans. 
   "I am grateful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee understand the economic importance of this project by expanding the film industry in Louisiana," said Vitter. "This federal funding will help UNO provide a program to educate graduate students in cutting-edge media technology."
   The $250,000 in federal funding will be used toward upgrading existing facilities, equipment and curriculum at the Robert E. Nims Center. The graduate high-tech media program is designed to provide cutting-edge media technology for the creation of post-production visual and special effects that are an integral part of the production of many Hollywood and independent feature films.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
