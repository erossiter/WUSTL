REP. WAMP SUPPORTS CLEAN AND GREEN SOLAR TAX ACT
  As co-chairman of the House Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Caucus, I recognize that few issues are more important to the independence and security of our country than the availability and affordability of energy.  
 For decades, we have relied on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas to meet our energy needs, and now we are facing the consequences. 
   I have decided to cosponsor H.R. 4300, the Clean and Green Solar Tax Act, which will extend the residential solar tax credit through 2011. We need to make renewable energy more cost-effective so consumers will choose this option. As Congress prepares a second, more comprehensive energy bill, we should also include this provision to make this incentive permanent. Clean energy is a must for our future energy security as a nation.
   With the right incentives and investment in research and technology, we can make renewable energy a more affordable option for the whole country.
