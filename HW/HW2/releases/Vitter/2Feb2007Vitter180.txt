SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FUNDING FOR ST. TAMMANY FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. David Vitter announced on Friday, Feb. 2, that the St. Tammany Fire Protection District #7 will receive a federal grant of $44,631 to meet the growing needs of the department. 
   "Firefighters and all first responders are important to every community and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita really illustrated that for citizens of South Louisiana," said Vitter. "This funding will help ensure that these firefighters have access to all the proper and necessary equipment that allows them perform at their best."
   This grant will be used to support the firefighters and help them secure the necessary equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training and other resources needed to protect the public and emergency personnel from fire and related hazards. The funding is provided by the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.
