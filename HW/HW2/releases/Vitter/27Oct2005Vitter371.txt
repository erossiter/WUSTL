SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.58 MILLION FOR PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER
  Sen. David Vitter announced that $1.58 million in federal funding for Pennington Biomedical Research Center and the LSU Ag Center was included in the final conference report to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. 
   "We are lucky to have such a renowned facility as the Pennington Biomedical Research Center to be a part of the Baton Rouge community," said Vitter. "I am grateful that my colleagues on the conference committee included funding for this important research at Pennington to help prevent obesity."
   The $1.58 million for Pennington Biomedical Research Center will be used for continued funding of research to prevent obesity and to develop other research programs to contribute to Pennington's designation as a USDA Human Nutrition Research Center. The program at Pennington focuses on the prevention of obesity and emphasizes the causes of the current obesity epidemic and the measures to prevent obesity.
   "Today's innovative research at Pennington may lead to tomorrow's solutions for stemming the tide of obesity in the country," Vitter said.
   The U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives are both expected to pass the final conference report this week, and then it will be sent to the president for his signature.
