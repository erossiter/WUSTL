SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR ST. TAMMANY PARISH WATER PROJECT
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development will award a $478,200 grant to upgrade the St. Tammany Parish water system. 
   "I'm pleased that USDA Rural Development made this grant available to upgrade the St. Tammany Parish water system," said Vitter. "This federal funding will ensure that residents of Covington will have access to a water system that is up to code and can meet the needs of the growing population."
   The grant, which is provided under the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program, will be used toward renovating an existing waste water system, including all pumping stations and treatment facilities to comply with environmental regulations.
