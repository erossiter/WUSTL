SEN. VITTER TO HOST SENIOR CITIZENS FORUM
  Sen. David Vitter will host a Senior Citizens Forum on Thursday, March 31 from 10:00 a.m. until noon in Baton Rouge at the Independence Park Theatre and Cultural Center located at 7800 Independence Blvd.  
 Vitter will be on hand to answer questions and he will have policy experts to present information on current issues affecting senior citizens.
   "Our country was built by those we now call 'senior citizens,'" said Vitter. "I pledge to you that I will work hard everyday to ensure our senior citizens live in independence and dignity for as long as possible." 
   The forum will also feature booths sponsored by private, public and non-profit agencies that will give timely information on medical benefits, veterans' benefits, Social Security and prescription drugs among others. 
  The Senior Citizens Forum is free and open to the public. All seniors, and their family and friends, are encouraged to attend to learn about issues that directly affect their way of life. 
   "We'll have a lot of useful information for seniors and will answer the questions that are important to them," said Vitter.
   For more information about the forum, contact Vitter's Baton Rouge office at (225) 383-0331.
