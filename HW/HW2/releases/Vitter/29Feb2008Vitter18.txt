SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS NASA EXTERNAL TANK CONTRACT FOR SPACE SHUTTLE
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today applauded NASA's award of a $47.5 million contract modification with Lockheed Martin to build space shuttle external fuel tanks. The modification extends an existing production contract to include the final assembly of one tank, partial construction of an additional tank and the purchase of parts for a spare tank. 
   "This is great news for Southeast Louisiana and the Michoud Facility, in particular," said Vitter. "The modification of the Lockheed contract means that planned production for the shuttle's external tanks will be able to continue uninterrupted."
   Work on the tanks will be performed at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans and at two additional NASA facilities in the South. The external tanks hold the fuels for the shuttle's three main engines and are the only component of the space shuttle that are not reused.
   Vitter recently oversaw his first hearing as ranking member of the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences. In a that hearing Vitter stressed the importance of continuing to fund the space shuttle program until development of the next generation of space exploration vehicles is complete.
