SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON SENATE VOTE TO BEGIN DEBATE ON OFFSHORE ROYALTIES
  Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement on the Senate voting 86-12 to proceed with debate on the offshore royalties bill. 
   "This is a very strong start toward Louisiana securing its fair share of offshore royalties. I was especially pleased that all but one of my Republican colleagues joined me in support of this vitally important legislation."
   "However the big hurdle and vote is still ahead, and I am working very hard toward securing the necessary votes to bring this legislation one step closer to reality," said Vitter.
   The U.S Senate is expected to debate the offshore royalties bill for the rest of this week and then have another vote on whether to move to final passage next Monday.
