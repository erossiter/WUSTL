SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR SHREVEPORT-BOSSIER
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the final conference report to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill included $1 million in federal funding for the National Center for Community Renewal (NCCR). 
   "The National Center for Community Renewal does the valuable work of training our nation's cities how to restore and maintain the elements needed to foster healthy communities," said Vitter. "I am pleased that my colleagues understand how essential this program can be to helping cities in Louisiana and around the nation."
   This $1 million for the NCCR will fund development of model safety and prevention protocols with law enforcement agencies in Shreveport; Baton Rouge; Austin; Abilene, Texas; and Knoxville. In addition, the funds will be used for prevention strategy planning, development of trainings materials and manuals for neighborhood use and field testing in core cities.
   The NCCR has demonstrated a new social technology that has the disintegration of neighborhoods by teaching three interconnected strategies that bring a community together. This technology has created additional capital in Shreveport and enables neighbors, neighborhoods and communities to achieve permanent lifestyle change.
   "This program is particularly important for assisting many Louisiana communities that have had population growth due to evacuees from the hurricanes," said Vitter.
