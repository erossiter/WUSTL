SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $98,000 GRANT FOR HAMMOND
  Sen. David Vitter today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development will award a $98,000 grant to the city of Hammond to foster local small businesses. 
   "I'm pleased that USDA Rural Development made this grant available to the city of Hammond because small businesses are the backbone of our economy," said Vitter. "This federal funding will help grow local small businesses and increase economic development opportunities in the area."
   The grant, which is provided under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program, will be used to establish a revolving loan fund to finance small and emerging business enterprises. This fund will help retain or foster the development of several small businesses in Hammond that will create or retain at least 10 to 20 jobs.
