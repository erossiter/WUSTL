SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LONG TERM ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement: 
   "Part of the hurricane rescue and relief effort that must happen is the return of businesses, jobs and economic opportunity to greater New Orleans. As a small part of this work, I've begun talking to businessmen and women from all walks of life and all parts of the region, encouraging them to be leaders on this front. And I've gotten great, positive responses.
   "Today, I had a very good, reassuring conversation with Tom Benson about the need for all of us to join together in rebuilding Greater New Orleans, including its jobs and business base. In that conversation, Mr. Benson assured me of two things: 
   1. He is eager to maximize the number of Saints' home games which could be played in Tiger Stadium consistent with first meeting the medical, housing, and other needs of evacuees in the region.
   2. He is eager for the Saints to return to New Orleans as soon as possible and for his organization to be part of our rebuilding effort and long-term future.
   "I look forward to working with the Saints and other local businesses as we complete the immediate rescue efforts and move toward rebuilding southeast Louisiana."
