SEN. VITTER BRIEFED ON IRAQ BY KEY OFFICIALS
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today participated in two key briefings on the current state of affairs in Iraq. Vitter attended a members' only briefing with Gen. David Petraeus and was updated by Ryan Crocker, Ambassador to Iraq, during a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, of which he is a member.  
   "I was involved in several hours of briefings - some classified, some not classified - on Iraq from two of our top people in Baghdad. It was very helpful to talk with Gen. Petraeus our top military leader in Iraq," said Vitter. "I think it is very important that we understand the facts as they are on the ground and not let policy be driven by arm chair generals - politicians - here in Washington," said Vitter.
   Vitter attended a members' only meeting with Gen. Petraeus at the Pentagon this morning. Petraeus is the commander who oversees all U.S. forces in Iraq.
   Vitter also participated in today's U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. Crocker reported to the committee via teleconference from Iraq.
   "Amb. Crocker indicated that the 18 detailed, very specific benchmarks may not always be the best indicator of progress in Iraq. I agree that we need to take into account all factors and not rely exclusively on these precisely-defined benchmarks, which were written in Washington and not on the ground at the troop level," Vitter said.
