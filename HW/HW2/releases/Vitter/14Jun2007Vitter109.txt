SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.8 MILLION IN FUNDING FOR CAMP MINDEN IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the U.S. Senate Veterans Administration Military Construction Appropriations Bill, which passed the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $1.8 million for the Camp Minden Training Site in Minden, Louisiana. 
   "This funding will help make Camp Minden an even more important military asset for Louisiana and our nation's military forces," said Vitter. 
   The $1.8 million is for the relocation and consolidation of the Air Support Operations Squadron facility at the Camp Minden Training Site. The current facility is undersized and located in a congested area. The Air Support Operations Squadron facility is one component of a master plan to construct an Armed Forces Readiness Center at Camp Minden. The new facility will provide 91,000 square feet of facilities to support the 1083rd Transportation Company, the 39th Military Police Company and Detachment 1 of the 122nd Air Support Operations Squadron, Air National Guard. 
   "The Armed Forces Readiness Center is a crucial project for Louisiana's Army and Air National Guard," said Vitter. "The new facility will provide the soldiers with a safer and more efficient work environment."
   The Senate Veterans Administration-Military Construction Appropriations Bill will now wait for a full debate on the U.S. Senate floor.
   "I will continue to work with U.S. Rep. Jim McCrery to ensure that this funding for Camp Minden gets passed this year," Vitter said.
