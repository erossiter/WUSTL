PREPARING FOR HURRICANE SEASON
  June 1 is the beginning of a brand new hurricane season. While we continue to recover and rebuild in Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we must also prepare for an active 2006 hurricane season. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the 2006 hurricane season is expected to produce 13 to 16 named storms, including four to six "major" hurricanes of Category 3 strength or higher. 
   We need to hope and pray that Louisiana be spared this hurricane season - as we do every year, but we must also be prepared for whatever comes our way. Being prepared is particularly important after having such a devastating season last year. That's why I sponsored a U.S. Senate resolution to designate a National Hurricane Preparedness Week to encourage the people of the United States to be prepared for the upcoming hurricane season and promote awareness to help save lives and protect communities.
   It's never too soon to start planning how you and your family will react to an approaching storm. The most important thing you can do for your family is to be informed and prepared. 
   One of the most important decisions you may have to make is whether or not to evacuate. Individual citizens and families need to focus on having an evacuation plan. Know where you are going and evacuate as soon as that is recommended. But even if you are not told to evacuate, it's important for you and your family to have a plan that makes you as safe as possible in your home. 
   To create a plan for your family, here are some tips from the National Hurricane Center:
   * Determine escape routes from your home and places to meet. 
   * Have an out-of-state friend or family member as a contact, so everyone has a single point of contact. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, it was very difficult to make calls to the hurricane ravaged areas. 
   * Make a plan for your pets, should you need to evacuate. 
   * Stock non-perishable emergency supplies and a disaster supply kit. 
   * Take First Aid, CPR, and disaster preparedness classes.

   In short, advance preparation is the key for staying safe during hurricane season. I urge you to take hurricane watches and warnings seriously. Please plan ahead for your family's safety and encourage your neighbors to do the same.
