  Sen. David Vitter and Rep. Rodney Alexander today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development will award a $394,450 grant to upgrade the East Carroll Parish water system. 
   "I'm pleased that USDA Rural Development made this grant available for the East Carroll water system to expand," said Vitter. "This federal funding will ensure that parish residents will continue to have access to a dependable supply of drinking water."
   "By securing this federal funding, we are also able to help improve the way of life for so many East Carroll Parish residents," Alexander said. "This funding will address the concerns of the current water system."
   The grant, which is provided under the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program, will be used toward replacing two existing 270 gallons-per-minute pumps with 500 gallons-per-minute pumps, replacing a non-functioning chlorinator, replacing 470 existing service meters and constructing a maintenance building. In addition, these funds will help cover the costs of purchasing a service truck, backhoe, computer and printer and to repaint and repair the existing storage tank.
