SEN. VITTER SECURES AGREEMENT ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER GULF OUTLET CLOSURE STRUCTURES
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, Feb. 22, announced that the Army Corps of Engineers reversed an earlier decision and agreed to begin planning, engineering and designing a closure structure on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet. Sen. David Vitter has been pushing the Army Corps of Engineers to use funds he secured to advance the closure plan on the channel.  
   "When I met with key officials at the Corps in January, I explained the intent of my provision to advance the closure of the MRGO. After reviews by General Don Riley and the command's top attorneys, the Corps now agrees that they will move forward on a closure structure," said Vitter. "Today they assured me that they will reallocate the $75 million I secured to engineer and design a closure structure, wetlands protection and restoration."
   Vitter specifically added provisions in the fourth emergency supplemental appropriations bill that enables the Corps of Engineers to begin work on these closure structures immediately. The Senator recently met with Major General Don Riley, Director of Civil Works, Deputy Director of Civil Works Steve Stockton and New Orleans District Engineer Colonel Richard Wagenaar to clarify the Corps misinterpretation of his provision. The Corps' prior MRGO plan did little to solve the threat of storm surge flooding or the long-term environmental destruction caused by the channel. 
   "These closure structures are a critical step in protecting Louisiana residents from this hurricane highway," added Vitter. "I appreciate General Riley's efforts to recognize the critical need for this work."
