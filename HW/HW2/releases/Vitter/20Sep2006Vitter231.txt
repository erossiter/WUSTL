SEN. VITTER NAMED CONFEREE ON WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT BILL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Bill Frist today named Sen. David Vitter to serve on a House-Senate conference committee charged with producing a final agreement on the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA).  
   "It is an honor to be named to the WRDA conference committee, especially as a freshman senator. Serving on the conference committee, I will be in a unique position to legislate real reform in the Army Corps of Engineers and provide leadership on critical hurricane recovery issues," said Vitter. 
   Vitter, a member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, will work to ensure that Louisiana's top priorities are included in the final WRDA legislation. Vitter will continue to press for the expedited approval of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO) plan in December of 2007. As a conferee, he will also fight for an expedited approval of a comprehensive, integrated hurricane, flood and coastal restoration program for Louisiana. 
   In addition, Vitter will help ensure the establishment of the Louisiana Water Resources Council to manage and oversee the implementation of a system-wide, comprehensive plan for projects of the Corps of Engineers that address issues vital to Louisiana such as hurricane protection, ecosystem restoration and flood protection.
   "Hurricane protection is vital to Louisiana's recovery and its future. My position as a conferee provides me with the ability to secure comprehensive restoration of Louisiana's coast," added Vitter. "I look forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues as we develop a final product to be signed into law."
