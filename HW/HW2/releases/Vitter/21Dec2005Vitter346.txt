SEN. VITTER DISAPPOINTED IN TODAY'S U.S. SENATE VOTE
  Sen. David Vitter today made the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted not to end debate on the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, which effectively prevented the Senate from bringing the bill to a vote.  
 This bill included nearly $40 billion in hurricane relief funding:
   "The success of this Democratic filibuster is the single most disappointing moment I've had in six years in Congress. It denies all of us in Louisiana the help we so desperately need - four days before Christmas.
   "Now I'll go back and insist that we at least save the underlying hurricane relief package and pass it before Christmas. This includes the $3 billion we need for immediate levee work.
   "But best case - even if that is achieved - we've lost a $9.8 billion down payment on higher levels of hurricane protection and coastal restoration work for all of south Louisiana. That's gone - it won't be passed anytime soon - because of this Democratic filibuster."
