SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON FAILED COCHRAN AMENDMENT VOTE
  Sen. David Vitter on Wednesday, March 28, 2007, made the following statement regarding the U.S. Senate's vote against the Cochran Amendment to the Senate Supplemental Appropriations Bill. The amendment sought to remove the troop withdrawal language from the legislation: 
   "I am extremely disappointed in the outcome of this vote. The majority continues to play partisan politics at the expense of our troops and devastated areas of Louisiana. The withdrawal language in this bill will hurt our effort in Iraq and will lead to this bill's veto by the president - delaying much needed funding for both our troops in the field and hurricane recovery," said Vitter.
   The Cochran Amendment failed with a vote of 48 - 50. The only Democrat to vote in favor of the Cochran Amendment was Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR).
