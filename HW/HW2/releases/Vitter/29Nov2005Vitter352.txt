SEN. VITTER LEADS FEDERAL HURRICANE RECOVERY COORDINATOR ON TOUR OF RITA DEVASTATION
  Sen. David Vitter today showed the areas of southwest Louisiana and Acadiana devastated by Hurricane Rita to Don Powell, the newly appointed Federal Coordinator for Hurricane Recovery. The two spent several hours this morning touring the devastation by air during Powell's first visit to the state since his appointment. 
   "I pushed very hard for the creation of this Federal Coordinator position so that we could have a single federal point person and advocate for hurricane recovery," Vitter explained. "Now that Don Powell is on the job, I wanted to show him first-hand the havoc we're still dealing with caused by Rita."
   During the tour, Vitter discussed many ongoing challenges with Powell, including the need for better coastal restoration and hurricane protection all along the coast, confusion over FEMA benefit issues, and the very slow pace at which Small Business Administration loans are being processed. 
   "We have to do better - much better - in all of these areas," Vitter said. "Our top priority is clearly much more aggressive coastal restoration and improved hurricane protection."
