SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES COAST GUARD'S COMMITMENT TO FEDERAL CITY
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, Feb. 22, announced that the USCG will build its Coast Guard Sector Headquarters in the planned Federal City in Algiers beginning 2008. 
   "On November 27, 2006, I called Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen and representatives from the Mayor's office to discuss locating this Sector Headquarters in Federal City in Algiers," said Vitter. "Today's decision by the Coast Guard is a huge first step toward making Federal City the critical military base we envisioned at its conception."
   Federal City will be the new naval base located on the West Bank that was created out of discussions following Base Realignment and Closure Commission's 2005 rulings. The Coast Guard Sector Headquarters in New Orleans will be the largest and most complex safety field unit in the Coast Guard. Responsibilities include all the traditional services of vessel inspection, personnel and casualty investigation, licensing and documentation of vessels, licensing and certificating of merchant marine personnel, port safety, environmental protection and search and rescue.
   "Federal City has the potential to bring economic growth and development to another important segment of New Orleans, and this decision by the Coast Guard strengthens the vitality of Federal City," added Vitter.
