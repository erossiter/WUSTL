SEN. VITTER SECURES $15 MILLION FOR CALCASIEU RIVER
  Sen. David Vitter today secured $15 million for the Calcasieu River and Pass in the Water Resources Development Act.  
   "This is good news for Southwest Louisiana. The Calcasieu River is essential to this region of the state and its water navigation. This funding will help ensure that proper protection measures are taken as traffic on the river continues to increase," said Vitter.
   This authorization provides for the construction of a rock bank protection on the Calcasieu River. The protection measures will preserve a dredged material disposal site on the river and will allow for navigation dredging to continue. 
   This legislation is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. It will then go to a Conference Committee with the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.
