SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR GREATER OUACHITA PORT IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $3.5 million for the Greater Ouachita Port.  
   "I am grateful that my colleagues understand the importance of the port to the economy of Northeast Louisiana," said Vitter. "This federal funding will help existing businesses grow, while also providing incentives for other businesses to relocate to the port."
   The $3.5 million in funding will be used to construct and operate a new intermodal container handling facility on the Ouachita River. This includes a container dock and rail facilities ultimately leading to the operation of a full-functioning container handling facility linking the Ouachita region to international trade and commerce.
   The effects of this project on the economy of Northeast Louisiana are immense with the possibility of creating 50 jobs this year and an additional 500 in the years to come. 
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
