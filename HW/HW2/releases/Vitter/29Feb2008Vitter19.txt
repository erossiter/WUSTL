SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON FEDERAL COORDINATOR OF GULF COAST REBUILDING POWELL RESIGNATION
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement regarding the resignation of Donald Powell, Federal Coordinator of Gulf Coast Rebuilding: 
   "Don Powell has been a dedicated public servant and a great, great friend to the people of Louisiana. It was Don going into the Oval Office and focusing the president on levees that produced billions of dollars of work and commitment very soon after his appointment. And then he went back into the Oval Office two months later and convinced the president on Road Home. He's been a great advocate, a great partner to work with. Wendy and I wish Twanna and him all the best," said Vitter.
