SEN. VITTER ADVANCES IN FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, CRONYISM
  Sen. David Vitter addressed the Metropolitan Crime Commission at a luncheon today and gave a policy address regarding his fight against corruption and cronyism in Louisiana. 
   "Together we are working toward ushering in a new era in Louisiana - an era of open and honest government that leads to an environment for businesses to grow and create jobs," said Vitter. "It's an exciting, positive time to be in Louisiana. Effective action against corruption and cronyism is at an all time high. And public acceptance of corruption and cronyism is at an all time low."
   During his address, Vitter announced a toll-free number for residents statewide to conveniently and confidentially report detailed, credible tips to be called into his U.S. Senate Office. The hotline number is 1-866-345-0931. Vitter's Web site also offers an interactive form where tips can be anonymously reported. After receiving these calls, Vitter's office will then forward the information to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
   In addition Vitter gave an update on his progress in the fight against corruption and cronyism in Louisiana since becoming U.S. Senator, including new reforms to the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program and his efforts to fight the expansion of gambling in Louisiana.
