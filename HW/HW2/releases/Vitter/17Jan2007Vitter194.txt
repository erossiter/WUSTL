SEN. VITTER PUSHES CORPS TO COMPLETE PUMP REPAIRS
  Sen. David Vitter on Wednesday, January 17, wrote the Army Corps of Engineers expressing concern about their schedule for completing work on the outfall canal pumps at Lake Pontchartrain. 
   "I am deeply disappointed by the Corps' repeated failure to complete the vitally important outfall canal pumps at Lake Pontchartrain. It appears the Corps has slipped again, and we will enter this next hurricane season with insufficient protection yet again.
   "I have been pressing the Corps for more than two years to meet these goals and give Louisianans some assurance that they will protected. These pumps are important to providing flood protections from severe storms as well as illustrating that this area of Louisiana is back in business," said Vitter.
   Through his work on the Water Resources Development Act and his position on the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Vitter has been pushing vital Corps of Engineers reform.
   "We have provided the Corps with billions of dollars and explicit authority to get this work done. In this case it appears that they are on track to miss even their low-projected targets. There is no excuse for the repeated lapses," Vitter said.
