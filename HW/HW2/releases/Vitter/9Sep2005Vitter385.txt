SEN. VITTER'S BILL KEEPS FEDERAL COURTS OPERATING
  Sen. David Vitter today announced the passage of his bill, the "Federal Judiciary Emergency Special Session Act of 2005," which will let the federal courts in the Eastern District of Louisiana continue to operate in another jurisdiction due to the impact from Hurricane Katrina. 
   "Like the rest of southeast Louisiana, our courts were not spared the wrath of Hurricane Katrina," said Vitter. "My bill ensures that the federal court system will be maintained and that Louisiana residents will have the opportunity to exercise their rights in court."
   This bill authorizes circuit, district and bankruptcy courts to conduct special sessions outside of their geographic boundaries if no location is reasonably available in its own jurisdiction because of emergency conditions. 
   The bill was strongly supported by Senators from affected states, including U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu.
   "During this time of devastation, we must keep the doors of our courts open so that justice may be served," said Landrieu. "This bill is one more step in our delegations' efforts to recover from this tragedy and rebuild the Gulf Coast."
   "We need a federal district court presence to ensure that criminal cases proceed and that law and order is maintained," said Vitter.
   The passage of this bill will allow the courts of the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Southern District of Mississippi and the Southern District of Alabama to operate outside of their jurisdictions and to try cases before the deadlines imposed upon them by the Speedy Trial Act.
