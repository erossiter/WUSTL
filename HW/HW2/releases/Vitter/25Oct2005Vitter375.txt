COMMUNITY DISASTER LOANS APPROVED BY LOUISIANA BOND COMMISSION
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement about the Louisiana State Bond Commission's decision to approve 23 units of local government for Community Disaster Loans (CDL) from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: 
   "I've been doing all I can to make this program work - including working with Treasurer John Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security late into last night to ensure that the collateral requirement could be met. I congratulate the bond commission for acting responsibly today on the CDL issue so that these local governments get the help they so desperately need."
