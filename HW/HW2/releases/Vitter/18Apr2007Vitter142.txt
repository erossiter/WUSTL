SEN. VITTER QUESTIONS ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS NOMINEE
  Sen. David Vitter on Wednesday, April 18, questioned Army Corps of Engineers Chief Engineer Nominee Lt. Gen. Robert L. Van Antwerp, Jr. during a Senate Environment and Public Works hearing on his nomination. Sen. David Vitter is a member of the Committee, and he asked committee leadership to hold this hearing because he wanted to have the opportunity to discuss issues facing Louisiana that involve the Corps. 
   "The new Chief of Engineers must understand the unique issues that are facing Louisiana, especially in light of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita," said Vitter. "It was important to me that Lt. Gen. Antwerp addresses questions in a full hearing about his plans for the Corps so that we know he is doing all he can to reform the Corps and protect Louisiana."
   Vitter questioned Van Antwerp on the Corps' long and arduous approval process, and made it clear that this process is in need of reforms. Vitter also raised many concerns about the Corps' lack of urgency to address pressing needs. 
   In mid-March, Vitter placed a hold on Van Antwerp's nomination and requested that the EPW Committee hold this nomination hearing because of the critical role the Corps and its work has on South Louisiana.
