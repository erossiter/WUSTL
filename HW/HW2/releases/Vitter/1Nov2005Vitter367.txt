SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW FEDERAL RECONSTRUCTION AND RECOVERY COORDINATOR
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement following President Bush's announcement on the creation of a new Federal Reconstruction and Recovery Coordinator and the naming of current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Don Powell to fill this new post: 
   "I'm really pleased that the President has named a single, focused Federal Coordinator for the hurricane recovery effort. I've pushed very hard for this position for weeks, including in numerous meetings with the President, the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, and many others.
   "I'm studying the Executive Order creating this position now, as well as the second Executive Order creating the new, related Policy Council in the White House.
   "In addition, I'll be meeting one-on-one with Don Powell very soon to begin an important dialogue about just what leadership and focus is needed on the ground in Louisiana. I look forward to getting to know Don a lot better, given that we'll be working on these crucial challenges together for some time."
