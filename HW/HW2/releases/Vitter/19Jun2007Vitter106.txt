SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON KANSAS LANE PROJECT
  Sen. David Vitter issued a statement on Sen. Jones' actions to stop the Kansas Lane Project: 
   "Senator Jones' success in killing the Kansas Lane Project sure is disheartening. I led the effort with Rodney Alexander to get $10.3 million in federal funds for the Kansas Garret Connector, a closely aligned project, which along with the Kansas Lane, would help make an inner loop to stimulate economic growth. And even after that success, old-style Louisiana politics - the personal interests of one state senator - kills the first stage of this important work. I know one thing - my colleagues in the Senate from other states will be happy to now take the federal dollars we had secured for Louisiana," said Vitter.
   Vitter secured the federal funding for the Kansas Garret Connector in the federal highway bill in 2005.
