PREPARING FOR HURRICANE SEASON
  June 1st marks the start of a brand new hurricane season. As we saw from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, hurricanes can have a wide-spread impact on the entire state, and we must prepare ourselves for this new hurricane season. By taking a few simple steps, you can make sure that your family is ready to face the challenges hurricane season brings. 
   It's never too soon to start planning how you and your family will react to an approaching storm. And it is very important that you and your family are informed and prepared.  
   For those in coastal and other vulnerable areas, deciding if you will evacuate is a decision you may have to make during hurricane season, so it is important to have an evacuation plan in place. The National Hurricane Center recommends deciding ahead of time where you are going to evacuate and having an out-of-state friend or family member as a contact, so everyone has a single point of contact. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it was very difficult to make calls to the hurricane ravaged areas, and a central contact can give your family the peace of mind that everyone is safe. 
   For those who live inland or in north Louisiana, you may wind up opening your homes to friends and family who need your help during a disaster. Families outside of the areas of direct threat can help greatly by being prepared to shelter on short notice families who need to evacuate. 
   It is also important to have a plan that makes you as safe as possible in your home should you not have to evacuate. Tornadoes and widespread rains and flooding can accompany hurricanes and occur far from where the storm actually makes landfall. As we saw in Olla, La., a few years ago, last year with heavy rains in central Louisiana, and in Kansas just this month, hurricanes are not the only natural disaster we face. No matter where you live, all families need plans for disasters. 
   To create a plan for your family, here are some other tips from the National Hurricane Center:
   * Discuss the type of hazards that could affect your family. Know your home's vulnerability to storm surge, flooding and wind. 
   * Locate a safe room or the safest areas in your home for each hurricane hazard. In certain circumstances the safest areas may not be your home but within your community. 
   * Make a plan for your pets, should you need to evacuate. 
   * Stock non-perishables and emergency supplies - things like bottled water, first aid supplies, medicines and a battery-operated radio. 
   * Take First Aid, CPR, and disaster preparedness classes. 
   These are just a few of examples of actions you can take to be ready. Advance preparation is key for staying safe during hurricane season. I urge you to take hurricane watches and warnings seriously. Please plan ahead for your family's safety and encourage your neighbors to do the same.
