SEN. VITTER AMENDMENT WILL AID FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNICATIONS
  Sen. David Vitter succeeded in including an amendment to expedite interoperability funding for first responders in the Communications, Consumers' Choice and Broadband Deployment Act. Sen. David Vitter is a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which oversees the telecommunications bill and passed it out of committee today. 
   "We haven't made much progress on interoperability since September 11, 2001, which was made clear again during Hurricane Katrina and Rita, when we had a complete breakdown in communications in the hardest hit areas," Vitter said. "Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Ted Stevens on this committee, interoperability funding will be expedited so that $1 billion in federal funding will be released in September 2006 instead of over the next four years." 
   Last year, the Commerce Committee included in the digital television transition bill $1 billion for interoperability funding, which would be distributed in smaller amounts from 2006 to 2010. This interoperability funding would help different levels of first responders communicate with each other even using different types of devices. Vitter's amendment would make all the funding available by September 30, 2006.
   "Following Hurricane Katrina, FEMA, state and local officials not only lost communications, but were unable to effectively talk to each other when communications were restored because they were not using compatible equipment," Vitter said. "This funding will help all of our officials communicate better in future emergencies."
   The bill is expected to move to the full U.S. Senate for a vote later this year.
