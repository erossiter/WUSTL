SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON TERRORIST PLOTS IN UK
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement today regarding the terrorist plots in the U.K.: 
   "Obviously, this terror plot targeting planes flying from the U.K. to the U.S. is extremely serious. The good news is that some things both we and our British partners have been doing have worked - we've uncovered the plot and hopefully disrupted it."
   "But this reminds us that we are at war, we do have deadly serious enemies who are evil, and we must remain vigilant. We must also realize this is a worldwide war against radical Islamic fascism, and events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Israel/Lebanon are directly related."
