SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES A $2.14 MILLION FEMA GRANT FOR HURRICANE KATRINA
  Sen. David Vitter announced today that the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office will receive $2.14 million from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to pay for costs associated with Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. 
   "I appreciate the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarding this money to Louisiana," said Vitter. "The Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office lost many of their police vehicles during Hurricane Katrina and in the flooding that occurred afterward, and this $2.14 million federal grant will help cover some of these expenses." 
   The Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's Office lost police vehicles due to non-repairable damage from the flood waters after Hurricane Katrina. This $2.14 million will allow for replacement of these police vehicles.
   "The federal government continues to provide resources to assist our local and state governments as we continue our recovery from Hurricane Katrina," said Vitter. "I will continue my efforts, in conjunction with the Louisiana delegation, to convince congressional leadership and the Bush Administration to bring additional resources to Louisiana to help in the recovery process."
