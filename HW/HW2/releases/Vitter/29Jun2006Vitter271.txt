SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.52 MILLION FOR LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN CLEANUP
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the Senate Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $1.52 million in federal funding for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program. 
   "Local grassroots organizations and many others have made a lot of progress on cleaning up Lake Pontchartrain, and this funding will help get us closer to finishing the job," Vitter said. "This $1.52 million in federal funding for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program is even more important after last year's storms and will advance these local efforts so that one day the lake will be fully restored."
   As a freshman in Congress, Vitter authored and passed into law the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, which created a partnership between the federal government and local stakeholders to further efforts to clean up the lake. Through this program Vitter has steered nearly $20 million to Louisiana for cleanup efforts in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin.
   Lake Pontchartrain is the second largest lake in the United States after the Great Lakes and is surrounded by 1.5 million residents, making it the most populated area in the state of Louisiana. 
   The 16 parishes in the Lake Pontchartrain Basin are Ascension, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Iberville, Jefferson, Livingston, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. Helena, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The Interior Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this summer.
