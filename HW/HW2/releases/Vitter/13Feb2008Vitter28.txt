SEN. VITTER REAFFIRMS HOLDS OF ATF NOMINEE SULLIVAN
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today reaffirmed his hold on Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms nominee Michael Sullivan. A "hold" is a legislative procedure used by a U.S. Senator to block a nominee's confirmation hearings. 
   "After my initial meeting with the nominee I submitted some follow up questions to address concerns I had. I recently received his answers to those questions, and I was disappointed in his responses so I am going to continue to hold this nominee," said Vitter. "The ATF is continuing policies that place an impossible standard on gun owners when it comes to applying for a license, as well as not allowing for a reasonable method for gun owners to challenge these overly burdensome regulatory policies. The nominee seems to support the ATF's current inadequate policies and exhibits a lack of willingness to address these problems."
   Vitter has voiced a series of concerns relating to Sullivan's nomination and to current policies practiced by the ATF. Specifically, he has questioned ATF policies that hold gun owners and dealers to unreasonable standards - often leading to severe actions based on errors in paperwork. He also scrutinized the alarming rate of veterans being added to the National Instant Check System by the ATF, which often unfairly denies them of their second amendment rights, and criticized the lack of an adequate and fully funded appeal system for gun owners to challenge over-aggressive ATF regulation.
