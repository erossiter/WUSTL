SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR SHREVEPORT ROBINSON FILM CENTER IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter announces that the U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes $250,000 for the Robinson Film Center in Shreveport. 
   "I am grateful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee understand the economic importance of this project to expand the film industry in Louisiana," said Vitter. "This federal funding is essential to helping complete the renovation of the Robinson Film Center and to the Red River Film Society that operates the center."
   The $250,000 in federal funding will be used for the renovation of the historic building that will serve as the home of the Robinson Film Center, located at 617 Texas St. in downtown Shreveport. The Red River Film Society operates the Robinson Film Center to present the best in international, independent and classic film and to serve as a resource for film education and film production. In addition, the Robinson Film Center hosts the annual Louisiana International Film Festival bringing industry professionals to Shreveport from outside the state.
   "While committee passage is only the first step in the legislative process, it is an important one for securing funding for this project," Vitter said. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to help keep this federal funding in the final bill."
   The U.S. Senate Treasury, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote later this year.
