SEN. VITTER JOINS POWELL TO ANNOUNCE $4.2 BILLION FOR LOUISIANA
  Sen. David Vitter joined Federal Gulf Recovery and Rebuild Coordinator Don Powell, other members of the Louisiana Congressional delegation and state officials this afternoon to announce an additional $4.2 billion in new Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for the state of Louisiana. Vitter's statement on this announcement follows:  
   "I welcome this announcement of an additional $4.2 billion in new CDBG money for housing proposed by the White House and Chairman Powell. This is very good news for the people of Louisiana, particularly those most devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   "It's also important to remember that this amount is the start of the process, not the end. Louisiana needs to develop a single, unified, bold and specific plan for rebuilding. The governor, the mayor of New Orleans, parish presidents, all of their commissions must produce one, single, fully-fleshed out, detailed plan, one that addresses issues head on, including the footprint question of where and where not to rebuild. That's the Louisiana side of the equation in obtaining this funding.".
