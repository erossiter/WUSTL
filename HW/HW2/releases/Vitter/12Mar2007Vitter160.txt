SEN. VITTER PRAISES U.S APPEALS COURT RULING ON GUN BAN
  Sen. David Vitter on Monday, March 12, made the following statement in support of the decision on March 12 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn Washington D.C.'s long-standing handgun ban: 
   "The second amendment is a constitutional right, and no city, state or district has the authority to trample an individual's constitutional right. This decision is a great example of a strict constructionist judicial temperament. For too long federal judges have been injecting personal policy stances into their legal opinions and recklessly expanding the power of our judicial branch. 
   "I have co-sponsored the District of Columbia Personal Protection Act, which will be re-introduced to the U.S. Senate this week. This legislation would end D.C.'s prohibition on using guns for self-defense in one's home, while keeping stiff penalties for illegal gun possession and gun crimes," Vitter said.
