SEN. VITTER'S LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN BASIN RESTORATION ACT PASSES COMMITTEE
  Sen. David Vitter today praised the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Work Committee's passage of his Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act. This legislation, S.3630, is a reauthorization of Sen. David Vitter's previous house bill. 
   "We have accomplished a great deal since the passage of the Lake Pontchartrain Restoration Act of 2000, including improvements in water clarity and the return of pelicans, oysters, and blue crabs to the lake. This body of water was once not safe enough for swimming, but now beaches are gradually being reopened," said Vitter. "Even with this great progress, more must be done to build on this great advancement and finish the job."
   The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act granted Lake Pontchartrain the same status as the Great Lakes and Florida Everglades restoration efforts. This legislation also created a partnership between the federal government and local stakeholders to further clean up the lake. The reauthorization of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Act was approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee and extends appropriations for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program from fiscal year 2006 to 2011.
   "Many of the parishes that benefit from this funding were affected by Hurricane Katrina and the passage of this legislation will provide funding to construct much needed wet weather watershed projects," Vitter said. 
   The next step for this piece of legislation is for it to be brought up on the floor of the U.S. Senate for a vote.
