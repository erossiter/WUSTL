SEN. VITTER VOTES AGAINST LAW OF SEA TREATY DURING FOREIGN RELATIONS BUSINESS MEETING
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today outlined his concerns with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea Treaty during a business meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Vitter has been a vocal opponent of the treaty and voted against sending the treaty to the U.S Senate floor for full consideration. 
   "Despite the potentially disastrous ramifications it holds for American sovereignty and security, the Law of the Sea Treaty has not received the national attention it deserves. We cannot blindly place issues impacting our national security in the hands of a dysfunctional international body. LOST attempts to govern the use of the seabed, the airspace above it and the topsoil below it - infringing on the ability of sovereign nations to explore the oceans, conduct scientific research or collect military intelligence vital to national defense.
   "LOST places the interpretation and application of the treaty's terms, such as 'military activities,' in the hands of international courts and tribunals. This 'lawfare' holds grave repercussions for our rights as a country and provides the U.N. with simply too much authority over American interests and concerns.
   "LOST needs further discussion in Senate committees, as I have called for in both the Foreign Relations and Environment and Public Works committees. We need to more thoroughly examine this treaty, not speedily rush it to a vote on the Senate floor," said Vitter.
