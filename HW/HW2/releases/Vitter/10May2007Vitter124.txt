SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR NORTHWEST LOUISIANA PROJECTS
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today announced that he secured an authorization of $2 million in environment and infrastructure projects for northwest Louisiana. These projects are included in the U.S. Senate's Water Resources Development Act, which is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. 
   "Sustainable development within a community depends on adequate infrastructure to support basic services like wastewater disposal, maintenance of pipes and a safe, potable supply of drinking water," said Vitter. "Improving these basic services helps ensure the public health of a community."
   The Northwest Louisiana Council of Governments will receive an authorization of $2 million in water and wastewater improvements in the WRDA bill. One example of a project that needs improvement is the Cross Lake Reservoir. This reservoir is unable to provide adequate capacity or pressure to meet the current demands of residents of Caddo Parish. Improvements need to be made to fix this problem so that citizens of Caddo Parish have the pressure and groundwater capacity necessary for their day-to-day lives. These improvements will play an important role in the continued development of the region as well as continuing improvements in public health.
