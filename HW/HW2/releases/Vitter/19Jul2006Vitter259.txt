SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER GULF OUTLET AND WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT PASSAGE
  Sen. David Vitter made the following statement today about the passage of the Water Resources Development Act and its effect on Mississippi River Gulf Outlet: 
   "With today's passage of WRDA, we are one step closer to the closure of MRGO. This legislation will expedite approval of the closure plan for December 2007 that I detailed in a press conference in New Orleans back in March. In addition, WRDA authorizes $175 million in grants and $200 million in loans to help relocate businesses on the MRGO, but requires them to remain in Louisiana for that assistance. This is a real win-win for Southeast Louisiana," said U.S. Senator David Vitter.
