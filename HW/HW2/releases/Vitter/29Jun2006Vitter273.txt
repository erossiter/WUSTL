SEN. VITTER APPLAUDS DEBRIS REMOVAL EXTENSION
  Sen. David Vitter today applauded the president's decision to extend 100 percent reimbursement of debris removal in five Louisiana parishes through the end of 2006. 
   "This is great news for southeast Louisiana," said Vitter. "With the amount of debris left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, I appreciate the Bush Administration extending debris removal through the end of the year, which is so important to Louisiana's recovery efforts."
   Vitter sent a letter with the Louisiana Congressional delegation requesting the extension and the 100 percent share, which is critical to ensuring that Louisiana parishes and cities can continue this vital work. Vitter also called acting FEMA director David Paulson to stress the need for an extension.
   "We have made much progress in cleaning up the debris and have already hauled away 25 times more than the debris in New York after September 11, but we still have a long way to go," Vitter said. "This extension will help these parishes continue to clean up and recover."
   Funding is extended for Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Washington parishes from June 30 until Dec. 31, 2006.
