SENATE ADOPTS SEN. VITTER'S AMENDMENT TO INCREASE PENALTIES FOR LOBBYISTS
  Sen. David Vitter on Friday, Jan. 12 secured passage of a second amendment to the U.S. Senate's ethics and lobby reform legislation. This amendment will increase the maximum penalty for lobbyists who fail to comply with the requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. 
   "We need to hold people accountable for their actions," said Vitter. "And increasing these fines will make those who abuse the rules truly feel the impact of their actions rather than simply receiving a slap on the wrist." 
   Current law states that lobbyists who do not comply with the requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act and fail to remedy the situation within 60 days are subject to a fine of no more than $50,000, depending on the severity of the violation. Vitter's amendment changes the maximum penalty limit from $50,000 to $200,000.
   Vitter's amendment passed with a vote of 81-6. He authored and passed earlier this week another amendment to the ethics bill establishing criminal penalties and increasing the maximum civil penalties for lawmakers who falsify their financial reports.
