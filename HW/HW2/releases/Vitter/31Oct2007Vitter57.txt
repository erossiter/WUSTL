SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES JOB FUNDING FOR LOUISIANA
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today announced that the Louisiana Department of Labor will receive a federal grant of $10.5 million to further cleanup and recovery efforts in areas of the state impacted by Hurricane Katrina and to provide job training assistance to areas impacted by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. 
   "More than two years after these hurricanes hit our state, Louisianans are still feeling their devastating impact," Vitter said. "These funds will aid our ongoing process of recovery, assisting local communities in their cleanup and repair efforts and creating 3,500 temporary jobs as a direct result."
   The grant will provide funding for temporary jobs to assist in cleanup and recovery efforts in St. Bernard, Plaquemines and Orleans parishes.
   The funds will also provide workforce development services including assessment, case management and career and occupational training in Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis, Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John and St. Tammany parishes.
   "These job training programs will undoubtedly have a positive impact on our communities and are a valuable resource for local businesses and economies," Vitter said.
   The grant is provided under the National Emergency Grant program at the U.S. Department of Labor.
