SEN. VITTER PUSHES FOR REAUTHORIZATION OF ABSTINENCE EDUCATION PROGRAM
  Sen. David Vitter last week authored a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee expressing support for reauthorization of the Title V Abstinence Education Program of the Social Security Act. Twelve senators joined Sen. David Vitter in writing in support of the program.  
   "This a valuable program with proven results, but it is nearing its expiration. We must reauthorize this program so we can continue the incredible strides we have made in teaching teens about both risk avoidance and protecting themselves from potential abuse," Vitter said.
