SEN. VITTER COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. David Vitter on Wednesday, Jan. 24, made the following statement in reaction to the president's State of the Union speech: 
   "I thought the president gave a strong speech in many ways. He was bold and ambitious in addressing key domestic challenges like health care and energy. And I think he put our foreign policy challenges in the right context - the global war against Islamic extremists, reminding us why we can't fail. 
   "I was disappointed he didn't address our continuing challenges on the Gulf Coast. On the other hand, I'm not terribly surprised when the federal taxpayer has sent us billions but it isn't getting to the people who need it because of state debacles like the Road Home Program.".
