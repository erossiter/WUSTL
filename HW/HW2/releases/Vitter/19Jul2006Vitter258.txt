SEN. VITTER SECURES $33.2 MILLION FOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON RED RIVER WATERWAY
  Sen. David Vitter today praised passage of the Water Resources Development Act in the U.S. Senate. Included in this legislation is authorization for $33.2 million for the J. Bennett Johnston Red River Waterway.  
   "This is good news for central and northwest Louisiana. The further development of the Red River Waterway is crucial to the economic development of the region. This authorization will ensure that proper environmental safeguards are met as the traffic on the waterway increases," said Vitter.
   WRDA allows the Corps of Engineers to implement the fish and wildlife mitigation plan at a cost of $33.2 million. The mitigation plan is designed to address the impacts of implementation of the Red River Waterway project. In addition, it permits the Corps to reforest lands and improve species diversity.
