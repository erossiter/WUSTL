SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $700,000 FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM
  Sen. David Vitter announced that the final conference report to the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill included $700,000 federal funding for the Early Intervention Program in the 16th Judicial District Attorney's office.  
 The 16th Judicial District Attorney's office includes Iberia, St. Martin and St. Mary parishes.
   "The Early Intervention Program helps identify elementary school students that have behavioral and academic problems. This work helps children become more successful in school," said Vitter. "I am grateful that my colleagues understand how this unique program can help at-risk-children before they become troubled youth."
   This $700,000 for the Early Intervention Program will sustain and enhance the quality of the program and be used to administer support and counsel to the 2nd Judicial District for replication of this vital program. 
   This prevention-based program helps children become more academically successful and decreases the number of behavioral problems in the classroom. The program acts as a pre-court diversion program, which helps reduce the juvenile court case load and avoids the time expenses incurred by judges, clerks of court, law enforcement, district attorney and probation officers.
