SEN. VITTER HIGHLIGHTS ENDEAVOUR LAUNCH
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today issued the following statement regarding tomorrow's early morning launch of space shuttle Endeavour: 
   "I am excited to have the opportunity to witness the launch of the Endeavour tomorrow. As ranking member of the Senate Space Subcommittee, I have a serious interest in our space program and specifically how it relates to Louisiana.
   "This launch is of particular interest to Louisianans as the Mission Commander, Dominic Gorie, is a Louisiana native who hails from Lake Charles. He leads a multi-national team that also includes astronauts from Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan.
   "The space shuttle program continues to capture the imagination of America and I know that all Louisianans will feel great pride tomorrow as Endeavour leaves Earth and heads for the International Space Station. I am especially pleased to have the chance to be a part of this historic launch."
   Vitter serves as ranking member of the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Sciences.
