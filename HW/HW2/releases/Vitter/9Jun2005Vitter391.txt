SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $1.9 MILLION FOR TENSAS RIVER NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Sen. David Vitter announced that $1.9 million in federal funding for the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was included in the Senate Interior Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the Appropriations Committee today. 
   "I am grateful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee were persuaded of the importance of the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge to Louisiana and to our nation," said Vitter. "The Tensas River Refuge is truly a gem in northeast Louisiana. It's one of the largest continuous blocks of bottomland hardwoods remaining in the nation and provides Louisiana residents with opportunities to hunt, fish, walk, bike and observe wildlife." 
   The $1.9 million in federal funds will be used for land acquisition at the Tensas River NWR. This funding will support the third of four phases of the Chicago Mill acquisition at the Tensas River NWR, which includes 2,450 acres of the Chicago Mill tract. This phase of the project will provide connectivity among refuge-protected habitat lands, safeguard important wildlife habitat and allow restoration activities to proceed at the Tensas River NWR.
   The Interior Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this summer.
