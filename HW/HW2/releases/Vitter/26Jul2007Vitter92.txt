SENATE PASSES SEN. VITTER'S REIMPORTATION AMENDMENT
  The U.S. Senate today adopted U.S. Sen. David Vitter's drug reimportation amendment as part of the U.S. Senate Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. The amendment went well beyond the language Sen. Vitter passed into law last year by allowing importation through the internet and mail order and allowing more than a 90-day supply.  
   "We have secured another important victory in the fight for comprehensive prescription drug reimportation. This amendment will provide more access to affordable prescription drugs for residents of Louisiana and other states that aren't close to the Canadian border," Vitter said.
   Vitter's victory in last year's appropriations bill prohibited the U.S. Custom and Border Patrol from seizing legal prescription drugs from American citizens crossing the border returning from Canada. This year's amendment broadens the scope of the current policy to allow for prescriptions drugs to be purchased from Canada through mail order and internet. It also removes the limit of only allowing the purchase of a 90 - day supply.
   "The support for drug reimportation continues to build even as the big drug lobby continues to ratchet up pressure against it. We have now passed my reimportation provisions to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill two years in a row, indicating growing support for taking up broader reimportation legislation," added Vitter. "We must continue to fight to bring Americans more relief from the high prices of prescription drugs."
