SEN. VITTER MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ABOUT ACTIONS IN IRAQ
  Sen. David Vitter today met with President Bush to discuss the president's strategy for Iraq. 
   "Today, I met with the president and 11 other senators in the White House Cabinet Room to discuss the president's strategy for Iraq. I believe we had a good discussion, and I am very interested in hearing more details when the president announces his full plan later this week.
   "Specifically, I was pleased to hear the president speak about the Iraqi government's true commitment to security. When I asked the president specifically about the situation facing Iraq Prime Minister Maliki and Muqtada al-Sadr, he informed me that he and Maliki have spoken about the matter and that Maliki is committed to addressing it. I am eager to see more concrete detail and action in this specific area.
   "I will continue to ask tough questions and plan to participate actively in the coming U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others," said Vitter.
   Last fall, Sen. Vitter toured Iraq and met with Louisiana troops. He is a new member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
