SEN. VITTER AUTHORIZES $3 MILLION FOR SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA PROJECTS
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today announced that he secured an authorization of $3 million in environment and infrastructure projects for southwest Louisiana. These projects are included as provision in the U.S. Senate Water Resource Development Act, which is expected to pass the U.S. Senate next week. 
   "Sustainable development within a community depends on adequate infrastructure to support basic services like wastewater disposal, maintenance of pipes and a safe, potable supply of drinking water," said Vitter. "Improving these basic services helps ensure the public health of a community."
   In Lake Charles, one important infrastructure project is the Southern Regional treatment plant. This plant is intended to accommodate the current wastewater collection, along with accommodating future wastewater as Calcasieu and Cameron parishes continue to grow.
