SEN. VITTER TAKES A STAND AGAINST EXPANDING IMMIGRATION
  Sen. David Vitter today voted against an amendment that would have exceeded the limits on immigrants or non citizens working in the United States. 
   "Our borders are wide open, our immigration enforcement completely broken. We need to enact real enforcement before simply letting more non citizens into the country," said Vitter.
   Vitter voted against Maryland Sen. Barbra Mikulski's amendment that would have increased the number of aliens working in the United States under certain visas. Under current law, these visas are capped at 66,000. If signed into law, the amendment would have placed no limit on these visas. 
   While the amendment was agreed to in the Senate, it faces an uncertain future in the U.S. House of Representatives.
