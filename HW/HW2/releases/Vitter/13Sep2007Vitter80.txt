SEN. VITTER WINS CONCESSION FROM ADMINISTRATION ON FUNDING FOR HURRICANE PROTECTION
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today won a critical concession from the White House on funding for improved hurricane protection in southeast Louisiana. Vitter secured the agreement in a meeting with Gulf Coast Coordinator Donald Powell and Steve McMillin, Deputy Director of the White House Office and Management and Budget. 
   "We had a very good meeting today, and the administration agreed to reduce the state's cost share requirement for improved hurricane and flood protection in southeast Louisiana by nearly a billion dollars," said Vitter. "This includes nearly a quarter of a billion dollar reduction in the state cost share for 100-year levee protection."
   On August 22, 2007, Chairman Powell announced that President Bush would seek an additional $7.6 billion toward his commitment for a stronger, higher and more secure hurricane protection system for southeast Louisiana. Under the Vitter agreement, the state share has been reduced by nearly $2.7 billion to approximately $1.7 billion.
   "We also discussed a payment plan so that whatever the state's cost share may be, it can be paid over a significant and manageable amount of time," added Vitter. "This isn't the end of negotiations; rather, it is just the beginning. The White House's agreement today is a good step forward."
   This hurricane protection work consists of armoring the protection system, outfall canal modifications, southeast Louisiana urban flood control (SELA), protections on the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal and other critical flood prevention work.
