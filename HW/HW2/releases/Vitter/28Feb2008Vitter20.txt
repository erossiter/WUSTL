SEN. VITTER CRITICIZES U.N. MEDDLING IN REBUILDING OF NEW ORLEANS PUBLIC HOUSING
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today reacted to the news reports of United Nations experts weighing in on the New Orleans public housing debate. 
   "Sadly, the debate on public housing reform in New Orleans has taken a turn toward theater of the absurd. The United Nations, an organization that has been scrutinized for its exploitation of the poor in the Oil for Food Scandal, has deemed itself a high enough authority to look down its nose at us here in the United States over the public housing debate in New Orleans.
   "I'm not surprised that this wasteful international organization - that relies heavily on foreign aid from the United States - disagrees with the HUD/ HANO redevelopment plan. The philosophy of the plan is the opposite of the U.N.'s mission, which is clearly expanding the dependency of people on government. The current redevelopment plan promotes homeownership and independence and provides a fresh alternative to the decades-old, failed New Orleans public housing system that trapped people in a cycle of poverty and crime.
   "I encourage the U.N. to focus on cleaning up its own act rather than commenting on our efforts. It surely will keep them busy for the next 20 years or so," said Vitter.
