SEN. VITTER ANNOUNCES $2.7 MILLION FOR NATCHITOCHES AREA
  Sen. David Vitter announced that $2.7 million in federal funding for Natchitoches area groups were included in the Senate Interior Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the Appropriations Committee today.  
 The National Center for Preservation Technology and Training received $1.9 million and the Cane River National Heritage Area received $800,000 for continuing preservation and conservation efforts.
   "I am grateful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee were persuaded of the importance of these projects to Louisiana and to our nation," said Vitter. "The National Center for Preservation Technology and Training does a remarkable job in its work to enhance the preservation and conservation of resources in the area and throughout the country."
   The National Center for Preservation Technology and Training received $1.9 million in federal funding to increase its preservation research and technology for the National Park Service. The center was created in 1992 to develop and distribute skills and technologies that enhance preservation, conservation and interpretation of prehistoric and historic resources across the United States. 
   "The Cane River National Heritage Area does tremendous work to preserve natural treasures and improve the quality of life in the Natchitoches area," said Vitter.
   The Cane River National Heritage Area partners with more than 40 local, state and federal entities to assist in the preservation and enhancement of the cultural landscape and traditions of the Cane River Region. Designated by Congress in 1994, the Cane River National Heritage Area works to complement the Cane River Creole National 
   Historical Park and to improve the quality of life of current residents by increasing economic benefits through promotion of the heritage area. The Interior Appropriations Bill is expected to move to the Senate floor for a vote later this summer.
