SEN. VITTER EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED BY PRESIDENT'S WRDA VETO
  U.S. Sen. David Vitter today expressed his extreme disappointment in President Bush's veto of the WRDA Conference Report. 
   "I am extremely disappointed by the president's veto of WRDA, and I want to reiterate the very clear statement I made when the WRDA veto threat was first announced in August - I will enthusiastically work to override this veto.
   "In fact, I led 21 other Senate Republicans on a letter recently sent to the president encouraging him to sign WRDA into law. With the commitments to WRDA I secured in this letter, I am 100 percent confident that we can override this veto.
   "Two years ago, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast, and the federal levees buckled under the intense storm surge. This WRDA bill contains critical authorizations that repair and strengthen those levees in addition to updating, improving and streamlining the bureaucracy of the Army Corps of Engineers. It also provides critical infrastructure for all other parts of the state including bank protection and flood prevention for the Ouachita and Black Rivers, deepening access for the port of Iberia while improving flood protection for Vermillion Parish and solving dredging problems on the Calcasieu River.
   "The U.S. Congress has not passed a substantive water resources bill in more than seven years. If the president and his administration are serious about addressing the infrastructure problems all over the country - from the Gulf Coast to the recent tragedy in Minnesota - then vetoing WRDA sends the wrong message," said Vitter.
