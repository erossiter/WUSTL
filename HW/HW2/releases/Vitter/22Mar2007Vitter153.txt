SEN. VITTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOUISIANA PRIORITIES IN SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  Sen. David Vitter on Thursday, March 22, made the following statement about the U.S. Senate Emergency Appropriations Bill, which passed out of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today: 
   "I am pleased that this bill has the critical funding and flexibility for the Army Corps of Engineers that I have been pushing for in meetings with the Senate Appropriations Committee and others. The $1.45 billion in funding to cover Corps budget shortfalls and flexibility for the Corps to ensure that they can efficiently address key hurricane protection issues in the Greater New Orleans area are vital to our continuing recovery. 
   "I also advocated for the committee to insert Community Disaster Loan forgiveness language, which would allow the president to forgive loans to local governments immediately following hurricanes Rita and Katrina, and for a waiver of the 10 percent match to remove the wasteful bureaucratic hurdles tied to the state match requirement. I am pleased that all of these provisions were added to the committee's bill. 
   "I am concerned though about the partisan language in this vital emergency funding legislation forcing the president to remove troops from Iraq and the huge cost of this bill to the taxpayers, which could provoke a presidential veto. I hope that as this bill is debated on the U.S. Senate floor we can get past the partisan politics holding our soldiers and the devastated areas of Louisiana hostage."
