SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR HIGHWAYS
  Montanans will spend less time stuck in traffic, while driving on safer roads thanks to $1,160,000 in grants, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The following two grants were awarded by the Department of Transportation:
   $840,000 for Judith Basin County: The funds will be used to improve S-239, a National Forest access road, between Hobson and Utica. The improvements will include widening the existing shoulder, and straightening traditionally dangerous curves.
   $320,000 for Lewis and Clark and Powell County: While construction is being done on US Highway 12, these funds will be used to use new repair technology so only one lane of traffic is closed at a time. This will not only save money, it will ease traffic congestion.
   "Highways are our lifeblood in Montana, and these much deserved dollars will help folks travel safer, with less traffic, across our state," said Baucus, who helped secure more than $2 billion for Montana roads in the 2005 Highway Bill. "Highway dollars not only bring good-paying jobs, they drive down tragedies, and I am going to make sure the highway funding faucet keepings flowing into our state."
   "Montanans spend more time behind the windshield then most folks in the nation, and if these dollars can prevent one accident then they are well worth it," Tester said. "And whether in Helena, or Hobson, I'm going to make sure our roads are the safest, and smoothest, in the nation."
   The funds were distributed through the Federal Highway Administration.
