$4.5 MILLION FOR SUN RANCH LAND ACQUISITION CLEARS ANOTHER HURDLE
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved $4.5 million in funding to protect some of Montana's most prized back country in the Madison Valley. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested the funding for the Sun Ranch Land Acquisition project earlier this year. Now the decision will go the full Senate.
   "Thanks to the remarkable work of Senators Baucus and Tester, this bill includes $4.5 million in Land and Water Conservation Funds for Sun Ranch, a crown jewel in the Yellowstone Ecosystem," said Alex Diekmann, Project Manager for The Trust for Public Land. "This is a critical step towards the eventual conservation of 18,000 acres in the Madison Valley that contains some of the most valuable wildlife habitat in the entire Greater Yellowstone region. We thank Senators Baucus and Tester for their leadership and commitment to Montana's recreational landscapes and natural resources." 
   "Montanans are an outdoors people. We hunt, we fish, we hike. We take our kids camping," Baucus said. "Purchasing land for the Sun Ranch will enable us to carry on that tradition for years to come."
   "This decision will make sure some of Montana's most precious land stays wild," Tester said. "And it will make sure Montanans have access to the best hunting grounds in the world forever. It's always a privilege to fight hard in Washington for projects like this." 
   The Sun Ranch Land Acquisition Project consists of two conservation easement purchases. It will protect critical habitat for Montana wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, wolverines, lynx and elk.
   The project will also preserve and guarantee hunting access to some of the best big game habitat in the state, the senators said.
