SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES $1 MILLION FOR BLACKFOOT RIVER RECREATION AREA
  Funding to protect one of Montana's most famous recreation and wildlife areas today cleared another hurdle by winning approval from the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested the funding for the Blackfoot River Special Recreation Management Area earlier this year. A Senate subcommittee first approved $1 million for the project on Tuesday.
   "The Blackfoot is a symbol of Montana's proud outdoor heritage," Baucus said. "What Norman Maclean made so famous in A River Runs Through It should be able to be enjoyed, and inspire, Montanans for generations. That is why Jon and I worked so hard to secure these much deserved dollars"
   "The Blackfoot Valley is one of the most prized places in the entire world," Tester said. "And this project will keep the area wild for future generations. It's always a privilege to fight hard in Washington for projects like this."
   The Blackfoot River Special Recreation Management Area will protect critical wildlife habitat for rare, threatened and endangered animal and plant species.
   It will also keep Montana's heritage alive and well by boosting rural economies that benefit from the Blackfoot River and its surrounding habitat.
   Today's decision now goes to the full Senate for approval.
