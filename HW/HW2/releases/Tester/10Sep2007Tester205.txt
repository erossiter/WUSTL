MONTANA SENATORS ANNOUNCE $250,000 FOR ROCKY BOY
  The Rocky Boy Indian Reservation is getting a quarter-million dollar boost to fight problems related to alcohol, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The Chippewa-Cree Tribe will receive a $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.
   The grant will be used to establish a tribal family court service delivery system.  The family court will provide assessment, intervention, treatment, monitoring and case management services to a minimum of forty families per year.
   "Helping combat alcoholism in Indian Country will strengthen the entire community," Baucus said. "Offering services like a family court is a good way to empower the Chippewa-Cree nation to provide new hope and opportunity for its members."
   "Alcoholism is something that is threatening lives and livelihoods in Indian Country," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Using federal dollars to help the Chippewa-Cree Tribal Council combat this epidemic is a valuable investment."
