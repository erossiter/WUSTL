SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION
  Sen. Jon Tester released the following statement: 
   "Tonight, the President proposed sending more troops into Iraq as a strategy for victory. Staying the course by escalating this war only spells disaster. 
   I call on the President to listen to the Iraq Study Group. The solution for Iraq will not solely be a military one. Switching to political and diplomatic solutions involving our allies in the region is not a defeatist strategy, but instead an appropriate course for a war of this complexity and magnitude. 
   Today my colleague, Sen. Max Baucus, said he would not have voted for the war knowing what we know today. I commend Max for his courage and stand with him, the thousands of Montanans and millions of Americans who agree we cannot afford the status quo. We have already lost too much blood because of an Administration that will not admit when it is wrong. 
   I will continue to hold the President, our Commander in Chief, accountable for a sensible plan for Iraq to get our troops home as soon as possible."
