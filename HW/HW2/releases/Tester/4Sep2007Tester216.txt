  Several Montana communities will be able to pull a page from James Bond's playbook in the fight against crime thanks to $145,191 in grants, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funds will be used to purchase high tech equipment and weapons to prevent and control crime including mobile data terminals, flash bangs, chemical munitions, X-26 tasers, and digital recorders.
   The grants were distributed to the following communities:
   $67,692 for Great Falls: The funds will be split between Great Falls and Cascade County and will be used to purchase twenty mobile data terminals and software licenses. 
   $33,508 for Butte: The funds will be split between Butte and Silver-Bow County and will be used to purchase computers, mobile printers, drivers license readers, tasers, digital recorders and cameras, and a crime scene trailer. 
   $23,465 for Bozeman: The funds will be split between Bozeman and Gallatin County and will be used to purchase ballistic helmets and blankets, flash bangs, wall bang entry tools, chemical munitions, and a camera. 
   $10,526 for Cut Bank: The funds will be used by Glacier County to purchase X-26 tasers and holsters, a vehicle weapon mount, and a laptop computer 
   "Criminals are a wily lot, and are always looking for new ways to cheat the system," Baucus said. "And these funds will help Montana's finest stay ahead of the curve so they can put criminals where they belong: behind bars."
   "Every Montanan has the right to feel safe, whether walking down the street or at home at night," Tester said. "And these much deserved dollars will help our law enforcement officers do their job more effectively and efficiently."
   The funds were distributed through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.
