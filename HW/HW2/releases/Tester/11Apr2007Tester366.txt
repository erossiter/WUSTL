SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $44,000 FOR POPLAR
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester on Wednesday, April 11, praised the U.S. Department of Commerce for awarding the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation $44,000 for economic development.  
   The funds will be used to help develop, and achieve, long term economic goals for the region. 
   "I'm pleased that folks around Poplar got these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "My top priority is to create more good paying jobs and boost our state's economy, and these funds will go a long way towards achieving this goal." 
   Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, called the grant a good start. 
   "There's a lot of potential in the northeast corner of Montana," Tester said. "Money like this will help empower Indian Country with resources to make the future brighter and bring more jobs to the region." 
   The grant was distributed through the Economic Development Administration.
