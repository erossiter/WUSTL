SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL NEARLY $4MILLION FOR YELLOWSTONE PARK
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $3.8 million for Yellowstone National Park as part of the fiscal year 2008 Interior Appropriations Bill. 
   The senators said that the appropriations bill passed the Senate Appropriations today and will now go before the full Senate for approval.
   The funds will be used in the West Yellowstone-Hebgen Basin portion of the park. The National Parks Service will use the funds to improve the municipal solid waste disposal system for the processing and disposal of municipal solid waste generated by park visitors and staff. 
   "Yellowstone is a cornerstone of Montana's history," Baucus said. "And these much deserved dollars will keep the Park in top shape, and allow millions of visitors to enjoy all that Yellowstone, and Montana has to offer."
   "These funds are going to allow more visitors to visit the crown jewel of our national part system and pump life into the economy of Southwestern Montana," said Tester. "Yellowstone has been a treasured place to visit for years to come and I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure it stays that way."
   The senators said that Yellowstone National Park is an economic lifeline for Montana, and these funds will be used to increase the capacity of visitors the Park can handle.
