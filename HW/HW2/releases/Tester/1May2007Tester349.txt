SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON VETO OF WAR SPENDING BILL
  Montana Sen. Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to President Bush's veto of the war spending bill:  
   "I am deeply disturbed by the President's veto today. Rejecting the will of Congress and the will of a majority of Americans is a powerful statement with very serious consequences. 
   For four years our troops have done everything asked of them, from ousting Saddam Hussein, to securing democratic elections to policing a centuries-old civil war. Getting them out of Iraq is the right thing to do after a job well done. 
   As the President continues to mismanage this war alone, we in Congress will work together to keep pushing for a new direction. 
   We will continue to remind him that Americans do not accept keeping our troops in Iraq with no plan and no end in sight. 
   And we will continue to support our military while ensuring that our troops have the resources they need both in the field and when they come home."
