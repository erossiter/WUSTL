SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $10M FOR BUTTE
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today that they have sealed up vital federal funds for the Mining City. 
   The Senators announced today that $10 million for military projects in Butte has been included in the final Defense Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the House and the Senate and is slated to be signed by the President.
   "This is really a win-win situation, not only will these funds give a boost to Butte's economy, it will also protect our soldiers and make all of us more secure," Baucus said. "And if these projects can help prevent one tragedy, or allow one soldier to return home safely, then they were well worth the investment."
   "These dollars represent safety, and security for all of us," Tester said. "Everyone of these projects is vital to our military, our state, and our country, and that's why Max and I went to bat for them."
   "The inclusion of funding to continue MSE's work on the MARIAH Hypersonic Wind Tunnel and our plasma arc technology for conventional weapons destruction is a very strong endorsement of the value that the people of MSE bring to America's national defense from our location here in Butte," said Jeff Ruffner, President and CEO of MSE. "The efforts of the entire Montana congressional delegation, and the advocacy of Senators Baucus and Tester for these very important projects, will continue Montana's development of its aerospace and defense technology industrial base,"
   The Projects, all located in Butte, include:
   * $4 million for the Mariah Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Development Program: The funds will be used by MSE Technology Applications Inc for the Mariah Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Development Program. The program is vital for the U.S. Army to develop new combat technology.

   * $2 million for Montana Tech: Montana Tech will use the funds to develop Low Acoustic and Thermal Signature Battlefield Power Source Fuel Cells for the U.S. Navy
   * $1.6 million for the Synesis 7, NAVAIR CPI Tech Manual Conversion: The funds will be used to help complete the "F/A-18 A-D Series Tech Manual Conversion" and related support tasks for the NAVAIR F/A-18 program.
