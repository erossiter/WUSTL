SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $500,000 FOR TRACKING OFFENDERS
  Keeping track of offenders who live in all corners of the Treasure State is about to get easier, thanks to a half-million dollars in funding announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the funding plan today, as part of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill. Baucus and Tester requested funding for the Montana projects earlier this year.
   The $500,000 will go to the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association to launch the Montana Offender Notification and Tracking System (MONTS), which will track offenders using GPS technology.
   "A little technology goes a long way when tracking offenders across the fourth-largest state in the country," said Bill Slaughter, former director of the Montana Department of Corrections and a lifetime member of the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. "Max and Jon have helped make a big and very important investment for Montana."
   MONTS focuses especially on rural Montana, where electronic monitoring has previously been unreliable. The system also notifies neighbors when offenders move to new communities.
   "We need the best technology available to keep tabs on our rural communities," Baucus said. "All Montanans deserve this money. It will go a long way in making our state a better place to live and work."
   "This money will make Montana's cities and towns safer by providing the resources needed to make sure all folks in Montana follow the law," Tester said. "This is a critical part of Montana's infrastructure that I'll continue fighting for in Washington every day."
   The Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill now goes to the full Senate for approval.
