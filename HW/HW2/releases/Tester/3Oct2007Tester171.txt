SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S VETO OF CHIP
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to President Bush's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP):
   "This administration is out of touch with a lot of things, but vetoing a smart, bipartisan measure that provides health insurance to millions of children takes the cake. I look forward to working with Max Baucus as he leads the fight to override this veto, giving our kids the health care they deserve."
