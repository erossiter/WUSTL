SENATORS SECURE MILLIONS TO UPGRADE MONTANA'S WATER SYSTEMS
  Federal funding is about to flow to Montana for two important water projects, thanks to Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
  The senators secured nearly $16 million to upgrade two major water systems in north-central and northeastern Montana. The funding is part of the government's overall funding bill for the next fiscal year, which cleared both the House and the Senate this week.
  Baucus and Tester made sure the measure includes nearly $9,840,000 for the Dry Prairie Rural Water System. The Dry Prairie project is rural water system for the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, which also serves Valley, Daniels, Sheridan and Roosevelt counties. Once completed, the project will deliver treated water from the Missouri River through 3,200 miles of pipeline to 31,000 people in northeast Montana.
  The measure also includes nearly $5,904,000 for the North Central Montana Regional Water Authority. The North Central project will deliver clean, safe drinking water to more than 50,000 people in northern Montana. The project will eventually deliver treated water from Lake Elwell to the Chippewa Cree Tribe and 22 public water systems.
  "All Montanans deserve good, clean water for drinking and agriculture," Baucus said. "Jon and I made these projects a top priority because they will bring more good-paying jobs and a better economy to Big Sky Country."
  "Water is one of our most precious resources, and these projects will help make sure Montanans have access to it," said Tester. "This funding is a step in the right direction when it comes to improving Montana's infrastructure."
  The overall spending bill contains nearly $112 million for various projects across Montana to improve public safety, infrastructure, economy, education and economic development.
  President Bush said he expects to sign the legislation into law.
