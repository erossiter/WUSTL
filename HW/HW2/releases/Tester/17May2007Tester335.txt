SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR MONTANA HEALTH CENTERS
  Two community health centers in Montana will receive grants from the federal government, Montana sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The grants come from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to improve health services. The grants will be distributed as follows: 
   Lincoln County Community Health Center, Libby: $367,554 Ashland Community Health Center, Ashland: $283, 190 
   "Making sure that all Montanans have access to quality, affordable health care is one of my top priorities," Baucus said. "Folks in Libby and Ashland, like all Montanans, are good hard working people and these dollars will help make sure they have access to top notch care. "
   "This money will go a long way for rural Montana," Tester said. "Better facilities leads to better health care, which leads to a better economy, more jobs and more opportunity for places like Libby and Ashland." 
   The grants will be distributed through the Health Resources and Services Administration.
