SEN. TESTER BEGINS 2008 WITH NEW GREAT FALLS FIELD OFFICE
  Senator Jon Tester has moved his Great Falls field office to a new location. 
   Tester's new office in the Electric City is now open in the Lee Forrest Building at 119 First Avenue North, Suite 102. The phone number (406-452-9585) remains the same.
   After a full year in office, Tester decided that moving to a new location would be best for Montanans who live in and around Great Falls.
   "The office doesn't belong to me. It belongs to all Montanans," Tester said from his farm near Big Sandy. "The offices need to be convenient and easy to visit. The Lee Forrest Building is a well-known, accessible place with plenty of good-quality space."
   Tester has seven other field offices across Montana--in Billings, Bozeman, Butte, Missoula, Kalispell, Helena and Glendive. All of Tester's offices can be reached through his toll-free phone number, 866-554-4403.
   Tester's new contact information for Great Falls is:
