SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $150K TO FIGHT METH
  The fight against meth is about to get a high tech boost thanks to $150,000 from the National Science Foundation, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The grant was awarded to Bridger Photonics, which is based in Bozeman and affiliated with Montana State University, and will be used to develop a high tech laser system that can detect chemicals used to make methamphetamine.
   "Meth is a scourge on our state, and I'm committed to stomping it out of Big Sky Country," Baucus said. "These dollars will help develop technology that law enforcement can use to detect, and shutdown meth labs."
   "Meth destroys Montana families and tears apart communities," Tester said. "This grant will foster good, quality research that will put our law enforcement officials in a better position to combat this epidemic."
   The grant was distributed through the National Science Foundation's Small Business Phase 1 program.
