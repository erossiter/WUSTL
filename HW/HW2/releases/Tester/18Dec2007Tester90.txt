SPENDING BILL INCLUDES MORE THAN $9.6 MILLION FOR BILLINGS PROJECTS
  Folks in Yellowstone County are breathing a little easier today after getting word from Montana's two U.S. Senators that more than $9.6 million for Billings-area projects have survived an intense budget battle between Congress and President Bush. 
   Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that a package of spending bills being finalized in Congress includes funding for 19 different projects in and around the Magic City, including the much-anticipated Shiloh Road expansion and Cobb Field renovation. The bill also pumps dollars into both hospitals, MSU-Billings, and the Billings Police Department.
   Baucus said the package of 11 spending bills, known as an Omnibus Appropriations spending bill, will provide funding for Montana's agriculture, anti-drug programs, health care, education, energy and water, transportation, veterans and housing development projects. All told, the legislation includes nearly $112 million for Montana projects.
   The situation got dramatic when President Bush threatened to veto at-home spending measures put forth by Congress, compelling some lawmakers to suggest stripping all appropriations projects from the overall spending measure. Negotiators came to an agreement on the legislation late Sunday. On Monday, President Bush said he is "hopeful" he can sign the $500 billion bill, reported the Associated Press.
   "I'm pleased these important projects stayed off the chopping block and received funding," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked hard to bring home millions of dollars that will help create jobs, boost our state's economy, invest in education, and grow agriculture in our state. We did very well in this year's appropriations process. It was a tough fight but we're about to bring this ball across the goal line."
   "This is a bit of good news at the end of the year," Tester said. "There was a time when it looked like this funding might not come but in the end we prevailed. Max and I worked together to deliver to Montana. We're thrilled with today's news."
