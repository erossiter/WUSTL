MONTANA SENATORS ANNOUNCE $1 MILLION FOR NORTHWEST MONTANA
  Three counties in northwest Montana are about to receive $1,114,239 in federal grants, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   * $400,000 to the DOVES Project in Lake County. The money will be used to provide civil legal representation, advice and supportive services to victims in Lake County and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The grant will also pay for hospital staff training to better serve victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.
   * $264,053 to the SAFE Harbor and DOVES Project in Lake County. The two organizations will partner with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes crime victim advocate program to increase the safety and well-being of women and children in rural Lake County.
   * $450,186 to the Sanders County Coalition for Families in Sanders and Lincoln Counties. The money will be used to provide civil legal representation and advice, supportive services and outreach to victims within the two counties.
   "Helping victims of domestic violence is a valuable investment of federal dollars," Baucus said. "By providing proper legal representation, this money will ensure that our justice system works for those who need it most."
   "Women and children deserve to be safe and secure in all communities across Montana," said Tester. "I am proud to announce this grant because it will make a real difference in the lives of families in northwest Montana."
   The three grants will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice.
