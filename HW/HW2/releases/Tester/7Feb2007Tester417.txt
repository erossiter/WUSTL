SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Four small fire departments across Montana will receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced Wednesday.  
   The grants, totaling more than $700,000, come from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program. The AFG Program regularly awards grants to fire departments and emergency medical service organizations across the country to help those agencies purchase equipment, vehicles, protective gear and training programs. 
   The grants awarded to Montana fire departments this week will go to: 
   * Plevna Volunteer Fire District: $328,320 ? Columbia Falls Fire Department: $57,485 ? Gore Hill Volunteer Fire Department: $20,093 
   * Centerville Volunteer Fire Department: $299,414 
   All four fire departments applied for the grants last spring. 
   "I commend our Montana firefighters for the great job they do each and every day," Baucus said. "These dollars will help ensure our firefighters have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs efficiently and effectively." "This is the sort of critical funding our rural communities need to keep all Montanans, no matter where they live, safe," Tester said. "We all benefit when our emergency responders have the equipment and training they need." 
   The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training has administered the AFG Program with help from the U.S. Fire Administration since 2001. Congress has authorized funding for the program through 2010.
