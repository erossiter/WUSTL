SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1.3 MILLION FOR GREAT FALLS
  More Montanans are going to be able to have a place to call home thanks to $1,390,567 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funds will be used to help people of modest means find affordable housing, and to fund local and State housing programs.
   "Having a home is part of the American dream and a foundation for building a great community," Baucus said. "And these dollars will go a long way towards making strangers into neighbors, and make our great state an even better place to live, work, and raise a family."
   "The more Montanans who have affordable, quality housing, the stronger our state will be," Tester said. "Better housing leads to more opportunity, more good-paying jobs and a stronger economy. I look forward to seeing this money go to work." 
   The funds were distributed through the Community Development Block Grant program, and the HOME program.
