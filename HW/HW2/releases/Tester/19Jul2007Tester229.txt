SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HARVEST $3 MILLION FOR MINING CITY
  $3 million dollars is on a fast track to Butte after a key Senate panel approved the funding, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funding will go to the ATTRA-NCAT National Center for Appropriate Technology which provides technical information, educational resources, and assistance to farmers, ranchers and agricultural information providers who are interested in sustainable agriculture technologies and in marketing methods which improve farm sustainability. 
   The funds were included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill which was approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee.
   "Helping producers benefits our state, and our economy, and we are committed to making sure that Montana producers have new information right at their finger tips," said Kathleen Hadley, executive director of the Center. "On behalf of farmers and ranchers across Montana, we want to thank Max and Jon for their work to get these dollars."
   "Agriculture is the backbone of our state's economy and I want to make sure our producers have every resource possible to continue to succeed," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked for these funds because new information, and new marketing techniques means that agriculture will remain strong for generations.'
   "As a farmer, I know first-hand that new information can be a real boost to production, and to producers' bottom line," Tester said. "These funds will help folks across our state keep their family farms strong, and in the family."
   The bill will now go before the full Senate for its consideration.
