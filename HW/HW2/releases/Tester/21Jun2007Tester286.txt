SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL $300K FOR MISSOURI RIVER WATER TREATMENT PLANT
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $300,000 to reconstruct the Missouri River Water Treatment Plant as part of the fiscal year 2008 Interior Appropriations Bill. 
   The senators said that the funding bill passed the Senate Appropriations committee today and will now go before the full Senate for approval.
   The Missouri River Water Treatment Plant has been providing clean, safe, reliable water to the Queen City for more than 47 years. The senators said the funds will be used to repair the aging water treatment system so that the facility is up to today's standards and can provide safe water for the greater Helena area well into the future.
   "When folks turn on the faucet, they shouldn't worry whether or not the water coming out is safe for drinking, cooking and bathing," Baucus said. "Clean, reliable, safe water is a basic right. That's why Jon and I worked so hard to secure these funds."
   "This plant has been working hard for Helena and the entire valley for years. A couple repairs will allow it to do the same thing for years to come," Tester said. "Folks in every corner of Montana deserve access to clean, safe water and Max and I work every day in Washington to make sure that these projects get funded."
   Tim Burton, Helena City Manager was pleased with today's announcement.
   "Senator Baucus has come through once again on a very important project," said Burton. "As we told him the money will be put to good use in a timely manner, ultimately to protect the health and safety of citizens in the Helena area. This has always been a top priority for Max.".
