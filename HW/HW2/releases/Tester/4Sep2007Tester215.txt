SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MONEY TO CRACK DOWN ON FUEL TAX CHEATS
  It's the end of the road for tax cheats trying to cross into in Montana from Canada, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The senators said a $103,000 grant for the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) will allow state and federal agents to test whether fuel in incoming tankers is dyed red, which means the fuel is not taxable. MDT is trying to crack down on shippers who haul regular fuel into Montana but claim they are carrying dyed fuel in order evade taxes.
   "Folks who try to cross our border while lying, cheating and stealing are about to hit a major roadblock," said Baucus, Chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which oversees taxes. "Lying about fuel shipments is unfair to every taxpayer in the country, but it's about to become a lot harder for people set on breaking our laws."
   "The message should be loud and clear: if you do want to do business in Montana, you will follow the rules. We don't do business with tax cheats," Tester said. "This grant is a little step in a big fight to make sure folks are paying their fair share."
   In addition to testing fuel samples from tankers coming across the border, Baucus and Tester said the grant will also help build stronger working relationships between state and federal agencies working along the U.S.-Canadian border. The project is a joint effort between the states of Montana, North Dakota and Idaho, the IRS and U.S. Customs and Border Control.
   The $103,000 grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
