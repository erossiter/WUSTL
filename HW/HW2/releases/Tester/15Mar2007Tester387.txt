SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER PRAISE FUNDS FOR MONTANA WATER PROJECTS
  As part of their on-going efforts to fund Montana water projects, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today praised the White House's Office of Management and Budget for allocating money for three Montana projects.  
   The OMB will allocate $800,000 to the Rocky Boy/North Central project, $7 million for Fort Peck Dry Prairie, and $500,000 for St. Mary's. 
   "While not as much as I'd like, these dollars mark a step in the right direction for these projects," Baucus said. "Water is the lifeblood in rural Montana, and these projects will go a long way towards improving the quality of water in rural Montana." 
   "Water projects in Montana have been studied now is the time for action and for shovels to turn. I'm pleased to see these funds coming to Montana, they are a good start," Tester said. "As a dryland farmer from North Central Montana I understand the importance of these projects and I will continue to work to make sure these projects get the dollars they need and soon." 
   Baucus and Tester both personally contacted the OMB to push for the funds. 
   The St. Mary project would divert water from the St. Mary River Basin on the Blackfeet Reservation near Glacier Park to the North Fork of the Milk River via a 90-year old, 29-mile long facility. 
   The Rocky Boy project will provide municipal drinking water to the Rock Boy Reservation as well as residents in Chouteau, Hill, Liberty, Pondera, Teton, Glacier, and Toole Counties. 
   The Fort Peck Dry Prairie Rural Water System would provide a safe and reliable water source to communities in northeastern Montana, especially the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. 
   The Senators said that these projects need to be funded so they can be completed at one time, instead of incrementally.
