SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MILITARY ACADEMY NOMINATIONS
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced their nominations for Montana students interested in attending the nation's military service academies. 
   Baucus and Tester nominated the 25 Montana students separately. Nominees are chosen based on their academic achievement, leadership, community service and participation in various extracurricular activities.
   "These folks have worked hard and have the smarts and leadership to be great military leaders," Baucus said. "It's always rewarding to see so many young, qualified Montanans interested in serving our country, and it's an honor for me to recommend them to our military academies."
   "Earning a nomination to a service academy is no small feat," Tester said. "These students have already shown they have what it takes to lead our nation's armed forces. They are among Montana's best and brightest, and I look forward to hearing about them in the future."
   A nomination is the first step in applying for a prestigious spot in one of the nation's military academies. All applicants must be nominated, usually by a member of Congress, in order to be considered.
   Qualified Montanans interested in applying for a military academy nomination are encouraged to do so online.
