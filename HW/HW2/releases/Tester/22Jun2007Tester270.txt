SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $1M FOR MINING CITY
  The Butte economy is about to get a shot in the arm thanks to a $1 million grant from the Commerce Department, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funds will be given to the Butte-Silver Bow county to help build critical infrastructure to expand the Port of Montana Business Development District to attract more businesses, including some high-tech companies, potentially creating more than 140 new good-paying jobs.
   "More building space means more companies which means more good-paying jobs," Baucus said. "These dollars have the potential to provide a strong stimulus not only to Butte's economy, but to our entire state's."
   "Butte has a long history of hard work and innovation. This money will keep the Mining City at the top when it comes to good jobs and positive growth," Tester said. "This is great news for Butte, and it will bring good things to all of Montana."
   "This is key to getting our infrastructure done in the industrial park area," said Paul Babb, Chief Executive Butte-Silver Bow county. "This will help out with REC and any other future development that we have in that area. This is fantastic news."
   The grant was awarded by the Economic Development Administration. Both senators worked closely with the EDA to make sure the grant would be awarded.
   Baucus and Tester said that the investment could pay huge dividends for Montana because it will provide a prime location for businesses.
   In May, Baucus brought national and multi-national companies to Butte for his Economic Development Summit to showcase Butte's burgeoning high-tech corridor.
