SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE DOLLARS FOR CROW WASTE WATER
  A key Senate panel today approved a request by Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester for funds to help repair the wastewater treatment facility on the Crow Indian Reservation. 
   The Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee today set aside $600,000 to help upgrade the failing sewer system, which has resulted in sewage backups into homes and onto the streets of Crow Agency. The facility also sits on the banks of the Little Bighorn River, and has at times leaked partially treated water into the river and nearby farmland.
   Recent flooding in the Little Bighorn River exacerbated the situation.
   The facility is 95 years old and in bad need of repairs, the Senators said.
   "These dollars are sorely needed to protect water quality in the Little Bighorn and make sure sewage is dealt with properly on the reservation," said Baucus, Montana's senior U.S. Senator. "I was proud to work with Jon to clear this initial hurdle. Now we'll make sure these dollars make it to the President's desk."
   "This money will go a long way for the Crow Nation," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "All Montanans deserve critically important services like this, and it's a privilege for Max and me to make sure these projects get up and running back home."
   Big Horn County Commissioner John Doyle praised the dollars.
   "This dollars coming through Senator Baucus' and Tester's efforts are a much needed addition," said Doyle, who is also a member of the Apsaalooke Water-Wastewater Authority. "We have been working with the Senators' office on this project and we appreciate their hard work in helping the Crow Tribe complete this important upgrade of the Crow Agency wastewater treatment facility. Without their efforts, it would be years to finish. "
   The full Appropriations Committee is slated to take up the measure Thurs.
