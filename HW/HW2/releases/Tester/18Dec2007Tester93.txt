SPENDING BILL INCLUDES $12.6 MILLION FOR BUTTE PROJECTS
  Folks in the Mining City are breathing a little easier today after getting word from Montana's two U.S. Senators that $12.6 million for Butte-area projects have survived an intense budget battle between Congress and President Bush. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester said the package of 11 spending bills, known as an Omnibus Appropriations spending bill, will provide funding for Montana's agriculture, anti-drug programs, health care, education, energy and water, transportation, veterans and housing development projects. All told, the legislation includes nearly $112 million for Montana projects.
   The situation got dramatic when President Bush threatened to veto at-home spending measures put forth by Congress, compelling some lawmakers to suggest stripping all appropriations projects from the overall spending measure. Negotiators came to an agreement on the legislation late Sunday. On Monday, President Bush said he is "hopeful" he can sign the $500 billion bill, reported the Associated Press.
   "It was a tough fight but Jon and I are pleased with the outcome," Baucus said. "There was a time when we weren't sure the funding was going to be delivered but we kept at it and now Butte and communities all across the state will receive funding they need and deserve. Given the tight budget climate, we did very well in this year's appropriations process."
   "This is great news for folks in Butte," Tester said. "We weren't sure this funding would come through but in the end we pulled it off. Max and I fought hard to deliver for Montana by fighting for-and getting-funding that will bring new good-paying jobs and opportunity to our state."
   Butte's highlights of the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill include:
   * $2,581,800: AATRA-NCAT - provides technical information, educational resources, and assistance to farmers, ranchers and agricultural information providers who are interested in sustainable agriculture technologies and in marketing methods which improve farm sustainability. 
   * $260,000: Basin Creek Reservoir
   * $260,000: Port of Montana Water
   * $1,968,000: Western Environmental Technology Center
   * $7,629,000: Army Reserve Center - for purchasing land, constructing an ARC Training building, Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS), unheated storage building, and organizational parking.
   The funding passed the House late Monday night. The Senate will take up and pass the measure late Tuesday or Wednesday before sending it to President Bush. Baucus and Tester said that the bill is expected to be wrapped up by week's end.
