SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER URGE PRESIDENT TO APPROVE MORE THAN $1.3 MILLION FOR HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today urged President Bush to sign a bill that sets aside more than $1.3 million for various health care and education improvement projects in Great Falls and northern Montana. 
   The money is part of the final Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the Senate and the House and is now headed to President Bush's desk. Both Baucus and Tester requested funding for the projects earlier this year.
   The final appropriations bill passed by Congress includes:
   * $995,000 for the Benefis Healthcare Foundation/North Central Montana Healthcare Alliance (NMHA), based in Great Falls. The organizations will use the money to invest facilities and equipment, including electronic medical records that will benefit numerous counties across northern Montana. 
   * $200,000 for the Marias Medical Center in Shelby. The money will help the hospital replace its current CT scanner. 
   * $160,000 for the Ft. Belknap Reservation, which will use the money to support educational and career training for at-risk youth. The Hays Community Economic Development Corporation will use the funds to expand opportunities for American Indian youth. 
  "This funding is going to do a lot of good for a lot of folks in Great Falls and throughout north-central Montana," Baucus said. "These projects will provide more Montanans with more opportunities and better access to the health care they deserve."
   "Making sure all rural communities have the same access to quality health care and education are top priorities for Max and me," Tester said. "That's why we worked closely together and with folks on the ground to get these dollars to Montana."
