SENATORS ANNOUNCE $100,000 GRANT FOR MISSOULA PARKS
  Montana's U.S. Senators are proud to announce a $100,000 grant from the United States Soccer Foundation for soccer fields in Missoula. 
   Friends of Missoula Parks will receive an All Conditions Field grant, which includes funds for initial field planning, field lighting, goals and field-level signage to help generate additional revenue through sponsorship.
   "Anything we can do to get our kids, and adults, out and enjoying the big Montana sky above them and clean air in their lungs is a great thing," said Baucus. "I'm very happy for the soccer players of Missoula."
   "If you live in a place like Big Sandy, you know just how important sports are to a community," Tester said. "This grant will give Missoulians more places to come together to exercise, play and cheer on their kids."
   The U.S. Soccer Foundation is the major charitable arm of soccer in the United States. The funds are part of a $1.47 million effort to promote soccer development programs across the United States. Since 1995 they have issued over 570 awards to groups of all sizes.
