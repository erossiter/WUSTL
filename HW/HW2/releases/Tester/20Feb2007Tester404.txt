SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $1.8 MILLION IN HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester on Tuesday, Feb. 20, praised the HUD for awarding $1,839,392.00 to Montana organizations providing assistance to homeless people.  
   The Continuum of Care Homeless (CoC) funds are awarded annually in a nationwide competition and are used to provide housing and other supportive services to homeless people. 
   "I'm glad that these great organizations get these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "Unfortunately many of our fellow Montanans don't have a warm home to go to, and I look forward to working together with these organizations to help get more people into quality, affordable housing. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I'm going to keep looking for creative ways to get these folks into permanent houses, and find good-paying jobs." 
   "It's great to see these funds awarded to deserving organizations in Montana," Tester said. "Homelessness is a sad reality nationwide and I look forward working with these and other groups to get as many people as possible into permanent housing. As a member of the Senate's Committee on Veteran's Affairs I plan to tackle this issue and make outreach to the men and women that served this country and are now living on the street a priority."
