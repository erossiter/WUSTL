KALISPELL PROJECTS AVOID BUDGET AXE
  Folks in the Flathead Valley are breathing a little easier today after getting word from Montana's two U.S. Senators that more than $6.2 million Kalispell-area projects have survived an intense budget battle between Congress and President Bush. 
   Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that a package of spending bills being finalized in Congress includes funding for 8 different projects in the Flathead, including the much-anticipated Kalispell bypass project and funds to assess the impact of mining in British Columbia on Glacier National Park and Flathead Lake.
   The bill also set aside dollars to beef up Flathead County's emergency response system and establish the first-ever Montana Center for Community Entrepreneurship at Flathead Valley Community College.
   Baucus and Tester said the package of spending bills, known as an Omnibus Appropriations spending bill, will provide funding for Montana's agriculture, anti-drug programs, health care, education, energy and water, transportation, veterans and housing development projects. All told, the legislation includes nearly $112 million for Montana projects.
   The situation got somewhat dramatic when President Bush threatened to veto at-home spending measures put forth by Congress, compelling some lawmakers to suggest stripping all appropriations projects from the overall spending measure. Negotiators came to an agreement on the legislation late Sunday. On Monday, President Bush said he is "hopeful" he can sign the $500 billion bill.
   "I'm pleased these important projects stayed off the chopping block and received funding," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked hard to bring home millions of dollars that will help create jobs, boost our state's economy, invest in education, and grow agriculture in our state. We did very well in this year's appropriations process. It was a tough fight but we're about to bring this ball across the goal line."
   This is a bit of good news at the end of the year," Tester said. "There was a time when it looked like this funding might not come but in the end we prevailed. Max and I worked together to deliver to Montana. We're thrilled with today's news."
   Baucus and Tester said the following projects are slated to receive funding:
   * $3,939,600: Highway 93 Kalispell Bypass 
   * $885,960: Cline Mine/Flathead Baseline Study 
   * $223,250: Flathead 911 Dispatch 
   * $268,231: FVCC - Entrepreneurship Program
   * $178,600: Whitefish Police Department Equipment
   * $260,000: Bigfork Ranch Water System
   * $260,000: Greater Woods Bay Water System
   * $260,000: Dayton Wastewater System
   The funding passed the House late Monday night. The Senate will take up and pass the measure late Tuesday or Wednesday before sending it to President Bush. Baucus and Tester said that the bill is expected to be wrapped up by week's end.
