SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $2M FOR MONTANA HOSPITALS
  Two Montana hospitals are about to get a financial shot-in-the-arm thanks to grants announced today by Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
  The Department of Health and Human Services awarded the Community Health Partners in Livingston $1,851,203 and Custer County Community Health Center in Miles City $440,805.
  "When talking about health care, these dollars are the good kind of a shot-in-the-arm," Baucus said. "One of my top priorities is to make sure every Montanan has access to quality affordable health care, and these dollars will give folks in Livingston and Miles City even greater access to top-notch care."
  "Rural health care is vital to folks in Big Sky Country," Tester said. "Living in Big Sandy, I know first hand how important it is to have access to health care without driving a hundred miles, and these dollars will give folks in Livingston and Miles City quality health care just around the corner."
  The grant was distributed through the Health Center Clusters program.
