SENATE PASSES SEN. TESTER'S AMENDMENT TO 9/11 BILL
  The Senate today passed a measure by Sen. Jon Tester that will tighten security along Montana's border with Canada.  
   The measure is an amendment to the 9/11 Bill, also called the Improving America's Security Act of 2007, which passed this afternoon on a vote of 60-38. Tester applauded the passage of the bill, which turns into law 37 of the 39 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   "This bill is a very important piece of legislation based on years of hearings, research and debate. It really does make Montana and all of America safer," said Tester, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. 
   Tester's amendment makes the northern border more secure by: 
   Requiring the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress about the needs and weaknesses of the America's northern border within 180 days after the 9/11 Bill becomes law. 
   Requiring the Government Accountability Office to recommend ways of improving security along the border within 270 days after the initial report. 
   "It's time we get serious about securing our border with Canada," Tester said. "My amendment gives us a clear picture of what we need to tighten security, and it focuses more attention on our northern states." 
   The northern border security measure is Tester's first amendment. The U.S. House passed its version of the 9/11 Bill earlier this year.
