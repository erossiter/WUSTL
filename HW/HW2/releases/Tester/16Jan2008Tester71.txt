SENATORS HAIL $3.6 MILLION IN ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR MONTANA
  As temperatures across the Big Sky state continue to drop and folks struggle to pay their heating bills, Montana's U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that an additional $3.6 million in energy assistance is on the way. 
  The senators said today that the Administration released the funding through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP, which will help folks across Montana and the country pay their heating bills to keep their homes warm in winter months.
  The funding announced today is part of LIHEAP's emergency contingency funds that the Administration can release at its discretion throughout the year.
  Last year, Baucus and Tester along with other Senate colleagues, urged the Administration to release additional funding. The senators said they are pleased that the Administration responded to their requests. 
  "As temperatures drop, heating costs rise, and that causes strain in many household across our state," Baucus said. "Folks shouldn't have to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table. This funding will provide a real boost for many families in Montana at a very critical time. I'm glad Jon and I were able to help get this done."
  "LIHEAP keeps the Montana winter out of thousands of Montana homes, especially as energy costs go through the roof," Tester said. "Like food and clothing, staying warm at this time of year is one of those things every Montanan deserves, and it's something Max and I will always fight for."
  LIHEAP currently helps more than 25,000 Montanans pay their heating bills. The senators said that number could double by the end of this winter.
