SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $3,200 GRANT FOR NORTHEASTERN MONTANA
  The Sheridan Memorial Hospital Association in Plentywood will receive a $3,200 "Quality of Life Grant" from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The money will be used to buy pediatric physical therapy equipment for children who suffer from Spina Bifida and Cerebral Palsy, diseases which cause debilitation and paralysis. The equipment will help young patients build strength and improve mobility. 
   The Reeve Foundation, founded by the late actor Christopher Reeve and his wife, is dedicated to curing spinal cord injury by funding research and improving the quality of life for people living with paralysis. 
   "One of my top priorities is to make sure all Montanans have access to quality, affordable health care," Baucus said. "This new equipment will give Montana's children the building blocks they need to live a full, enriched life." 
   "This will have a major impact on folks living with disabilities in northeastern Montana," Tester said. "Good equipment will open up new doors, empowering people with access, strength and freedom things every Montanan deserves." 
   Most of the grants awarded by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation are provided through cooperation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
