SEN. TESTER: MY NEWEST BILL WILL MAKE MONTANA LEADER IN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
  Still farming when I can, I finally put my seeds into the ground this weekend. But I couldn't stop thinking about another crop that's beginning to make a big impact in Montana agriculture and potentially America's energy independence. If I had more time at home I'd be growing camelina myself.  
   Farmers have been growing camelina (also called false flax or German Sesame) for thousands of years. It is a huge player in the future of alternative energy because its small seeds produce a lot of oil, which can be converted into biodiesel fuel. 
   Camelina will make Montana a world player in the energy market. That's why I introduced legislation last week to provide crop insurance for camelina a process that usually takes years. Right now the only reason more farmers don't grow it is because they can't afford to take the risk. 
   Camelina grows easily in Montana. Farmers can rotate it with wheat and barley, so producing it won't compete with our food supply. And after the seeds are crushed, the leftovers can be used as high-protein livestock feed. 
   As I told reporters during a news conference in my office last week, expanding biofuels in Montana is a win-win-win situation. It provides options and job opportunities for farmers. It's responsible and sustainable development of a renewable resource. And it makes our country more secure by cutting back on our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Senator Max Baucus is also trying to boost Montana's camelina production. In fact, he plans to roll out legislation loan deficiency payments to farmers who grow camelina. 
   Both our pieces of legislation will open the door to a whole lot of opportunities in Montana and across America. It's exciting stuff, and I look forward to the good changes it will bring. 
   Until next time, 
   Jon
