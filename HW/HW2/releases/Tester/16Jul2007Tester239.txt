SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $2 MILLION FOR BOZEMAN
  The City of Bozeman is about to get nearly two million dollars from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The City of Bozeman will use the $1,901,339 grant to help build a new parking garage and a transit hub in downtown Bozeman.
   The proposed 159,000 square foot parking garage will accommodate 435 parking spaces--adding 331 new parking spaces to Bozeman's business district. The transit hub will serve as the primary hub and transit site for Streamline Transit, Bozeman's bus system.
   "These well-deserved dollars will go a long way in making downtown Bozeman a better place to visit and to do business," said Baucus, who helped secure funds for the garage in the 2005 Highway bill. "Making sure Montana's cities get the funding they need for good projects like this is one of my top priorities."
   "This is good news for one of Montana's fastest-growing cities," Tester said. "It will making living and working in Bozeman easier, and it will ultimately lead to more opportunity and a better economy."
   The grant will be awarded through the Federal Transit Administration.
