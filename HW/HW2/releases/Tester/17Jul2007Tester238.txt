SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF VA SECRETARY JIM NICHOLSON
  Senator Jon Tester, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, today released the following statement in response to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson: 
   "I thank Secretary Nicholson for his commitment to public service and wish him the best in the future. Jim and I were able to roll up our sleeves, put politics aside and get real results for Montana veterans. Working together we cleared the bureaucratic logjam and brought a veterans' cemetery to Missoula and two new VA clinics to Montana. 
   But make no mistake, there is tremendous work to be done to fulfill the promise we made to all the men and women who served our country. We have a responsibility to provide our veterans with access to quality, affordable health care. We still have a long way to go.
   I look forward to working with the next VA Secretary to continue bringing real results to Montana's and America's veterans."
