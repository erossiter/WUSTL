SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $450K FOR AGRICULTURE EDUCATION
  Agriculture research and education is going to get a much deserved boost thanks to two grants worth $487,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The grants were awarded for the following projects:
   Montana State University: $400,000 for the Department of Plant Sciences and Plant Path to perform a functional analysis of the Wheat Grain Hardness Locus.
   Shields Valley School District: $87,000 to help update curriculum for Montana's Agricultural Education System.
   "Agriculture is the backbone of our state's economy," Baucus said. "And these dollars will go a long way towards making sure agriculture remains strong for generations to come."
   "When we invest in Montana agriculture, we invest in a stronger future for our state," said Tester, a third-generation Montana wheat farmer. "This money will help keep our family farms and ranches a part of the national economy, bringing more jobs and opportunity to Montana, for a long time."
   The grants were awarded through the National Research Initiative Competitive and Secondary Agriculture Education Challenge programs.
