SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HELP SECURE NEARLY $600 THOUSAND TO BATTLE HUNGER IN MONTANA
  Two Montana Food Banks will soon see some extra cash in their bank accounts, after they received almost $600,000 in funding in the omnibus appropriations bill that's headed to the President's desk. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester fought to keep the money in the bill after the President threatened to veto all state specific spending. 
  "Making sure every Montanan goes to sleep with a full stomach is not a seasonal job. Every day, and especially around Christmas, keeping food on the table often means more than any gift under the tree," Baucus said. "Food Banks work hard year round, to keep their neighbors fed and I'm glad we can help them keep up the good work."
  "Food Banks in Montana bring volunteers and donors together with the folks who need them most," Tester said. "Providing their neighbors with the peace of mind that comes with a warm meal is often one of the best gifts charities like these can provide."
  The Missoula Food Bank Inc. will use the $295,470 grant for a brand new fleet of food transportation trucks. Eight refrigerated trucks will help deliver food to shelters across the state.
  The bill also included in a provision for $294,000 for the Billings Food Bank. That money will be used to demolish an old building and make room for a new safer place facility.
  All told the senators delivered nearly $112 million for more than 120 projects across Montana.
