SEN. TESTER ANNOUNCES NEW OFFICE LOCATIONS IN MISSOULA, KALISPELL
  Senator Jon Tester today announced that he has moved his Missoula and Kalispell field offices to new, more convenient locations. 
   After a year in office, Tester decided that moving the two offices would benefit Montanans who live in and around the two cities. The phone numbers remain the same.
   "These offices aren't mine. They belong to the folks who hired me to go to work for them," Tester said. "The new offices in Missoula and Kalispell are more convenient and easy to visit for folks in northwestern Montana."
