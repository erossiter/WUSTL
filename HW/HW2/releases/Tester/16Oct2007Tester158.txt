SENATE APPROVES $5.2 MILLION FOR MONTANA
  From meth awareness to new emergency vehicles to drug courts, the U.S. Senate today passed a measure that sets aside $5.2 million for various projects across Montana that will improve public safety. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested funding for the projects earlier this year. They are part of the 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill, which passed the Senate by a vote of 75 to 19.
   The 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill includes:
   * $500,000 for the statewide Montana Meth Project. 
   * $200,000 for the Billings Police Department to purchase a new crime scene investigation vehicle. 
   * $300,000 for Montana State University-Billings for its Academic and Workforce Development Program at the Montana Women's Prison. 
   * $300,000 for Gallatin County to purchase two new emergency response vehicles. 
   * $500,000 will go to the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association to launch the statewide Montana Offender Notification and Tracking System (MONTS), which will track offenders using GPS technology. 
   * $350,000 for statewide Montana drug courts. 
   * $500,000 for the Chippewa Cree Nation's Juvenile Detention Center Renovation Project. 
   * $500,000 for classroom and office space for the Great Falls Emergency Services Advanced Regional Training Center. 
   * $650,000 to purchase equipment and vehicles for a new Missoula Police Headquarters. 
   * $100,000 to purchase communications equipment for the Missoula Emergency Operations Center. 
   * $350,000 to improve The University of Montana's Montana Youth Empowerment Project, which helps at-risk children. 
   * $250,000 to purchase radios and other communications equipment for Mineral County's Search and Rescue. 
   * $250,000 to upgrade the Eureka Justice Center. 
   * $200,000 to improve the Whitefish Police Department. 
   * $250,000 for Kalispell's Flathead 911 Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System. 
  "This measure is going to do a lot of good for communities all across Montana," Baucus said. "It will help us fight the scourge of meth. It will give cops and courts the resources they need. This is well-deserved funding and it will go a long way in Big Sky Country."
   "This bill is about making Montana a better, safer place to live and raise a family," Tester said. "These projects are good investments in Montana for fighting crime, keeping drugs off our streets, and for making sure folks have the opportunities they deserve."
   The Senate will vote on a final appropriations bill after merging it with the House version of the measure. It must then be signed into law by President Bush.
