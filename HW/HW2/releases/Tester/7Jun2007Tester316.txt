SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $360,000 TO IMPROVE CRIMINAL RECORDKEEPING
  The State of Montana will improve the way it keeps track of criminals and people with criminal records, thanks to a federal grant announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The $359,856 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice will go to the Montana Board of Crime Control for its part in the 2007 National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP). NCHIP seeks to improve safety across the country by improving criminal history record information.
   The money will be used to help create an electronic system to better share criminal records between prosecutors and courts.
   "Knowing where criminals are is vital to keep our streets safe and secure," Baucus said. "And these dollars will help make sure that our law enforcement agencies have the resources they need to keep tabs on the bad guys."
   "The better we keep track of criminals across Montana, the safer our state will be," Tester said. "This money gives a shot in the arm to a very important government responsibility, and I look forward to seeing these dollars at work.".
