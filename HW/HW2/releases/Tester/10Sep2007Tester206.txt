SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $240K FOR MONTANA
  While a penny saved might be a penny earned, $240,000 in grants will pay even larger dividends for five Montana communities, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The U.S Department of Commerce awarded the dollars to help create an economic development framework to boost businesses and create more good-paying jobs.
   The following communities received funds:
   $44,000 for the Crow Tribe in Crow Agency
   $50,000 for the BitterRoot Economic Development District, Inc. in Missoula
   $44,000 for the Chippewa Cree Tribe in Box Elder
   $51,000 for the North Central Montana Economic Development District, Inc. in Cut Bank
   $51,000 for the Southeastern Montana Development Corporation in Colstrip.
   "My top-priority is to create more good-paying jobs here at home, and boost our state's economy," Baucus said. "And these dollars will be a real shot in the arm to folks across Big Sky Country."
   "These well-deserved funds will be a real boost to our state," Tester said. "From down in Colstrip to up in Cut Bank, these dollars will help plant some great seeds for economic growth."
   The funds were distributed through the Economic Development Administration.
