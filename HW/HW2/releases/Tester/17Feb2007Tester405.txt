SEN. TESTER: TROOPS DESERVE DEBATE ON DIRECTION OF IRAQ
  "I support our troops, but I don't support escalating this war. I'm disappointed that for the last week, the Senate can't seem to do anything but debate about whether or not to debate; that's not why Montanans sent me here. Our troops in Iraq deserve an open and honest debate about the direction of this war."
