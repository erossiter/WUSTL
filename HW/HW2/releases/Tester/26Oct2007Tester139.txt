SEN. TESTER REQUESTS MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF FALLEN SERVICEMEN
  Senator Jon Tester today requested a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. Senate in honor of a Montana sailor and four other U.S. servicemen whose remains were recently identified, more than 40 years after they were declared missing in action during the Vietnam War.
   The U.S. Department of Defense today announced that it identified the remains of Lt. Donald Wolfe of Hardin. Wolfe and the four other sailors were flying from Chu Lai Air Base in Vietnam to the U.S.S. Oriskany aircraft carrier on October 8, 1967, when their plane crashed on a mountainside near Da Nang, Vietnam.
   The military couldn't recover the wreckage because of bad weather, steep terrain and hostile forces in the area. In 1993, 1994 and 2007, the Vietnamese government handed over to the U.S. newly discovered, unidentified human remains. The Department of Defense identified Wolfe and his crewmates through extensive DNA research and dental comparisons.
   The other sailors on board the plane with Wolfe were:
   Lt. Norman Roggow of Aurelia, Iowa.
  Lt. Andrew Zissu of The Bronx, New York.
  Chief Petty Officer Roland Pineau of Berkley, Michigan.
  Petty Officer 3rd Class Raul Guerra of Los Angeles, California.
   The sailors' remains will be returned to their families for burial with full military honors. Pineau has already been laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.
   "Right now five families across the country finally have closure after 40 years of uncertainty," said Tester, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. "These sailors were true heroes, and we ought to honor them. It will remind everyone that it's never to late to show appreciation for heroism."
