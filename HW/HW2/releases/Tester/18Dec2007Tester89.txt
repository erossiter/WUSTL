SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HELP SECURE MORE THAN $4 MILLION FOR LEWIS, CLARK COUNTY
  Folks in the Queen City are breathing a little easier today after getting word from Montana's two U.S. Senators that more than $4 million for Helena-area projects have survived an intense budget battle between Congress and President Bush. 
   The overall bipartisan appropriations bill is before lawmakers in Washington D.C. this week, and it could mean nearly $112 million for more than 120 projects across Montana.
   The situation got dramatic when President Bush threatened to veto at-home spending measures put forth by Congress, compelling some lawmakers to suggest stripping all appropriations projects from the overall spending measure. Negotiators came to an agreement on the legislation late Sunday. On Monday, President Bush said he is "hopeful" he can sign the $500 billion bill, reported the Associated Press.
   "In Montana, this is money we use to improve the lives of our children, to keep folks healthy and to keep our economy strong," said Baucus. "In my hometown of Helena, it's easy to see how important it is to keep funding places like Shodair Hospital and Exploration Works, their efforts really do make kids lives better."
   "This money belongs right here in Montana," Tester said. "It will go to all kinds of good projects in Helena that will do great work for the community. I look forward to seeing Montanans' money go back to work for the entire state."
   Shodair Children's Hospital and Exploration Works are just a few of the Helena area projects set to get more funding for 2008. St. Peter's Hospital, the Rocky
   Mountain Development Center, the Missouri River Water Treatment Plant, and the I-15 and Custer Ave Interchange are also on the list.
   In addition to those projects, there is almost $2 million to battle methamphetamine use and crime in Montana. That includes funding for the Montana Meth Project, more than $300,000 in drug courts and $650,000 for the Montana Offender Notification Tracking System (MONTS).
   The Projects for Lewis and Clark County:
   * $470,000 Montana Meth Project (another $446,500 will go to the Meth Project Foundation in Missoula)
   * $650,480 Montana Offender Notification Tracking System (MONTS)
   * $312,550 Montana Drug Courts
   * $295,320 Missouri River Water Treatment Plant
   * $246,100 Wolf Monitoring
   * $191,593 Carroll College Civil Engineering Program
   * $114,956 Shodair Children's Hospital
   * $114,956 St. Peter's Hospital
   * $984,900 1-15 Custer Avenue Interchange
   * $426,790 Exploration Works
   * $196,000 Rocky Mountain Development Center, Eagle Manor
   The funding passed the House late Monday night. The Senate will take up and pass the measure late Tuesday or Wednesday before sending it to President Bush. Baucus and Tester said that the bill is expected to be wrapped up by week's end.
