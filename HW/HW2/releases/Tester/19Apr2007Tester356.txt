SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $220K FOR HAVRE
  Travelers to Havre are about to become a little safer thanks to a $223,735 grant from the DOT, Montana's Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The grant will go towards purchasing a new Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Vehicle to be used at the Havre airport. The vehicle is specially designed to perform multiple tasks while responding to a plane crash. 
   "This fire truck will make the airport safer and better prepared in the case of an emergency," said Bob Breum, Havre City County Airport Board Chairman. "These funds are good for Havre and all of north central Montana." 
   "I'm very pleased that Havre got these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "A lot of folks fly into Havre, and having this new equipment could literally mean the difference between life and death." 
   "A growing city like Havre needs resources to be prepared for the unthinkable," Tester said. "I'm pleased the government is pitching in to help make Havre a safer place to live and visit." 
   The grant was distributed through the Federal Aviation Administration.
