BUSH'S PROPOSED BUDGET HURTS RURAL MONTANANS
  President Bush's budget will hurt rural Montanans-especially family farmers, ranchers and small businesses, Montana Sen. Jon Tester said on Friday while unveiling a "Rural Report Card" on the proposed budget with several of his Senate colleagues.  
   Tester and eight of his colleagues called a press conference on Capitol Hill to outline the President's proposed cuts that directly affect the quality of life of rural Americans. The cuts are detailed in the senators' Rural Report Card, which is available online here. 
   "If you have a total disconnect with rural America you put out a budget like the President just put out," Tester said at the news conference. "This budget has no vision for rural America." 
   Here are some of the key cuts as outlined by the Rural Report Card: 
   * Agriculture: The President's Farm Bill proposal cuts crop safety net and insurance programs by close to $14 billion over ten years and does not provide disaster assistance for farmers. 
   * Rural Health Care: The President proposes slashing rural hospital flexibility grants, the rural and community access to emergency devices program, and area health education centers, which provide vital health and health education services to rural areas. 
   * Rural Firefighting Efforts: The proposed budget eliminates funding for the Department of the Interior's rural fire assistance and eliminates the state and local fire assistance program. 
   * Rural Economic Development and Energy: The President's budget cuts nearly $260 million from Rural Housing Assistance funding grants. Loans to rural utilities would be cut by more than $1.3 billion from the last fiscal year. The budget also contains severe cuts to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and it cuts funding for wind energy development. Rural Education: The President's budget freezes funding for two vital programs that benefit children in rural America: the Small, Rural Schools Achievement program and the Rural and Low-Income Schools program. 
   * Rural Law Enforcement: The President's budget would cut $1.4 billion in funding for all state and local law enforcement programs in the Department of Justice, including programs specifically designed to help rural communities. 
   "The President's budget proposal doesn't take care of folks in rural America, and that's unacceptable," Tester said. "We need to take care of the government's overwhelming deficit, but we can't do it at the expense of rural America. It's a burden all Americans should share." 
   Joining Tester for today's news conference were Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.
