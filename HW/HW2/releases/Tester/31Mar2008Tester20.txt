SEN. TESTER RESPONSE TO HUD SECRETARY'S RESIGNATION
  U.S. Senator Jon Tester, who serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, released the following statement on today's resignation of HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson: 
   "As more and more working families in rural America struggle to find affordable housing, we need stronger leadership at the national level. The serious allegations of cronyism and corruption against Secretary Jackson must be investigated fully, and let the chips fall where they may. The American people deserve honorable public servants tending to public business, and I stand ready to work with my colleagues in the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, to respond to this housing crisis on behalf of all Montana families."
