SENATORS ANNOUNCE $500,000 FOR NORTHERN CHEYENNE RESERVATION
  The Northern Cheyenne Reservation in southwest Montana will receive a half-million dollar grant to fight domestic violence, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The $500,000 will be used to hire several new, full-time employees to work solely on domestic violence. 
   * A Victim Advocate will oversee the tribe's Healing Hearts program and provide advocacy and supportive services to victims. 
   * A Domestic Violence Probation Officer will supervise offenders who have been sentenced by the tribal court. 
   * A Clerk will assist the trial prosecutor preparing for domestic violence cases.
   * The tribe will also maintain a full-time Domestic Violence Coordinator to oversee the services offered to victims of domestic violence. 
   "This money will make a real difference on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation," Baucus said. "Making sure there are full-time employees dedicated to helping victims of domestic violence is an essential service and I look forward to seeing the good things it will bring to Montana." 
   "Hiring full-time folks to tackle domestic violence is a big step in the right direction for the Northern Cheyenne Nation," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Empowering tribal nations with services like this help pave the way to solutions for other issues in Indian Country like health care, quality housing, education and good-paying jobs."
   The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice.
