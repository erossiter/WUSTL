SENATORS ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO TACKLE JAIL OVERCROWDING, METH ABUSE
  Montana's communities will be a little safer, thanks to a new grant announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The $78,500 grant will specifically help the Montana Detention Dilemma Task Force collect new information about the impact of jail overcrowding across the state. The Task Force will use the data to find which detention centers can help ease overcrowding. 
   Part of the grant money will also go to the Billings Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assess the impact of meth and other drugs and crime reported by tribal law enforcement officers.
   "The last thing we need is for criminals to be turned loose on our streets because of overcrowding," Baucus said. "And these dollars will help make our communities, our neighborhoods, and our children safer."
   "Simply put, this money will make Montana's communities safer," Tester said. "It will go a long way in finding solutions to some pretty tough problems like crowded jails and drug abuse, and I look forward to seeing the results."
   The U.S. Department of Justice is giving the $78,500 grant to Montana's State Justice Statistics Program. The program determines what resources Montana needs by researching and analyzing statistics.
