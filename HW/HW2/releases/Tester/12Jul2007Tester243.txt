SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE FUNDING FOR ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE
  Essential Air Service planes will continue to fly the 'Big Sky' for another year thanks to funding secured by U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   Earlier this year the President proposed to slice in half the program that provides low-cost air service to eight Montana communities but both Montana senators fought back and secured $110 million nationally for the vital program - Montana's eight communities will each receive a portion of the funding. The funding was included in the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today.
   "Montana is aptly named the 'Big Sky' state and with all of our big, wide-open spaces, we need our Essential Air Service to travel the state for work and to visit family and friends," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked together to restore funding so our rural airports can continue to stay open for business."
   "Essential Air Service is important to our everyday lives in Montana," Tester said. "Folks need rely on it to travel to get medical attention, for business and for vacations. Max and I are committed to making sure Essential Air Service is in Montana for years to come."
   The program subsidizes flights to rural areas, keeping the ticket price lower for customers.
   Montana has eight airports served by EAS. Seven of these airports - Glasgow, Glendive, Havre, Lewistown, Miles City, Sidney, and Wolf Point - are served by Big Sky Airlines. SkyWest Airlines provides service to West Yellowstone seasonally. 
   The senators said the THUD Appropriations bill must now go before the full Senate for its consideration.
