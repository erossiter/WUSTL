SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HELP MOVE BYPASS PROJECT FORWARD
  The long-awaited Kalispell bypass project is trucking along now that Congress has approved Senators Max Baucus' and Jon Tester's request for federal dollars. 
  The overall federal spending bill passed by Congress this week sets aside $3,939,600 for the Highway 93 Kalispell Bypass.  After years of planning and design work, officials have started constructing the new bypass, which will provide a safe new route around Kalispell for large trucks, relieve congestion, and create jobs in one of Montana's fastest growing communities.
  The project will reroute U.S. Highway 93 around Kalispell and connect to U.S. Highway 2. The eight-mile project will expand Highway 93 to four lanes and provide interchanges and on/off ramps.  Baucus and Tester said U.S. 93 is the highest volume, non-Interstate highway in Montana.
  "This bypass will help create good-paying jobs, boost commerce, relieve congestion, and provide a safe way around Kalispell," said Baucus.  "And now, we are on our way to getting it finished up. I'm proud to have worked with Jon to secure these dollars."
   "I'll always stand behind funding projects that improve Montana's highways, and securing funding for the Kalispell Bypass is critically important to Max and me," Tester said. "I've been following the progress of this project for years and I look forward to the new jobs and the stronger economy it will bring to Kalispell."
  In 2005, Baucus secured $30 million for the bypass project as an author of that year's highway construction bill.
