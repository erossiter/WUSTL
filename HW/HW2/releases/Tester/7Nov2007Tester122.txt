SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER URGE PRESIDENT BUSH TO APPROVE MONEY FOR BILLINGS
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today urged President Bush to sign a bill that sets aside $2,630,000 for both Billings hospitals and Montana State University-Billings (MSU-B). 
   The money is part of the final Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the Senate and the House and is now headed to President Bush's desk. Both Baucus and Tester requested funding for the projects earlier this year.
   The final bill approved by Congress includes the following funding for Billings:
   * $1 million for St. Vincent Healthcare for facilities and equipment, and to establish the Montana Children's Hospital Network. The funding will create a pediatric intensive care program to avoid transporting young patients to out-of-state children's hospitals. 
   * $280,000 for St. Vincent Healthcare's Northwest Research Institute/Rocky Mountain Health Network, which provides continuing education to physicians across Montana. 
   * $320,000 for Billings Clinic to create an advanced cancer outpatient center. 
   * $280,000 for Billings Clinic to improve its Rural Information System, which provides quality health care to rural Montanans 
   * $300,000 for the Billings Clinic Diabetes Center, which will promote health and to fight the high incidence of diabetes across eastern Montana. 
   * $160,000 for MSU-B to expand its health care education program, focusing on much-needed health care professionals like surgical technicians, drug counselors and home health aides. 
   * $160,000 for MSU-B's Skilled Trades Workforce program. 
   * $130,000 for MSU-B's Montana Energy Workforce Training Center, which trains highly skilled entry level workers. 
  "The efforts of Senators Baucus and Tester to improve health care in Montana through access to pediatric critical care and medical research is an investment that will pay dividends for generations to come in Montana," said Dave Irion, executive director of the St. Vincent Healthcare Foundation. 
   "Working hard to make sure health care and education get the resources they need are top priorities for Jon and me," Baucus said. "These projects will provide more Montanans with more opportunities and better access to the health care they deserve."
   "Max and I worked closely together and with lots of folks on the ground in Montana to shepherd this money through Congress," Tester said. "These projects are going to do a lot of good for our state by providing the quality health care and better opportunities for education."
