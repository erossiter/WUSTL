SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ARMY CONTRACT FOR GREAT FALLS AREA
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that the U.S. Army has awarded a lucrative contract that will bring new jobs to the Great Falls area. 
  The contract, which is expected to be worth nearly $20 million over six years, is going to Precision Lift, Inc. Precision Lift will partner with West Coast Weld Tech in Great Falls to build customized metal platforms for maintenance crews to work on Apache, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters.
  The Army has already ordered 16 of the customized maintenance platforms, and may order up to 178 more.
  "The Army made a good choice by investing in Precision Lift," Baucus said. "This means new jobs and a big boost to the economy, and it's going to be a real shot-in-the-arm for the Great Falls area."
  "This is a good situation all around," Tester said. "This contract brings new jobs to central Montana, it results in better equipment for the Army, and it promotes a real 'Made in Montana' product."
  The Army expects Precision Lift to complete its orders by January 31, 2013.
