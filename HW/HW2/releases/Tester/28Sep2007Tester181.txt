SEN. TESTER RESPONSE TO LIMBAUGH'S 'PHONY SOLDIERS' REMARKS
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to recent remarks by radio host Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh called U.S. troops who support withdrawal from Iraq "phony soldiers."
   "I don't care if they come from the left or the right, below-the-belt attacks like Rush Limbaugh's are wrong, disrespectful and hurtful to thousands of men and women risking their lives and dying for our country. Nobody who serves in our military is a phony. He owes them all an apology."
