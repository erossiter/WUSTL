SENATE PANEL APPROVES $650K FOR EXPLORATION WORKS
  History is one step closer to coming alive in Helena thanks to a $650,000 boost, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funding for the ExplorationWorks Science museum was included in a bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee today.
   ExplorationWorks, which is a part of CommunityWorks, will use the funds to continue to build the museum which will feature a main exhibit area, a flexible classroom/exhibit space, and a unique second floor outdoor exhibit and rooftop garden area.
   "Helping people understand our role in history is vital," said Suzanne Wilcox, executive director of CommunityWorks. "On behalf of all Montanans, and inquiring minds across the country, we want to thank Max and Jon for getting this money."
   "Our world, and our state has a rich history, and this new facility will bring the past to life," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked hard for these funds, because by knowing our past, we can shape an even brighter future."
   "It's important to know where we came from, and understand how we got to where we are," Tester said. "And these much deserved dollars will give all of us a glimpse into our past as Montanans, and as humans."
   The bill will now go before the Senate for its consideration.
