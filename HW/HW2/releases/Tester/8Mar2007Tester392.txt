  Sen. Jon Tester on Thursday, March 8, released the following statement after co-sponsoring a resolution with Senate leaders to revise the U.S Policy on Iraq: 
   "For too long the President has stayed the course in Iraq while the American people have demanded a new direction. This measure is a new direction. Now I call on my Senate colleagues to listen to the American people. For them, and for our fine troops, it's time for an honest, open debate.".
