SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SETS ASIDE NEARLY $4 MILLION FOR MONTANA AGRICULTURE RESEARCH
  Millions of dollars in funding for several agriculture projects at Montana State University have cleared another key hurdle in the U.S. Senate, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a measure that includes $3,725,000 to fund five major MSU agriculture programs. 
   "We're very grateful of both Senator Baucus' and Senator Tester's support to Montana State University and this project which is so important to the livestock industry," said MSU President Geoff Gamble. 
   The Agriculture Appropriations Bill sets aside:
   * $1.6 million to build MSU's Animal Bioscience Research Facility, which will boost the quality of Montana seedstock and the commercial livestock industry. 
   * $990,000 for the Joe Skeen Institute at MSU, which will go toward restoring, sustaining and improving the health of Montana's rangelands. 
   * $735,000 for the Barley for Rural Development project. This project allows MSU researchers to find and use high-quality barley for malt, feed, food and ethanol. 
   * $200,000 for the Montana Sheep Institute. This project will research the role of sheep and goat grazing as means of controlling the spread non-native weeds. 
   * $200,000 for the Montana Sustainable Beef Network to boost Montana's $900 million-per-year beef industry. 
   "Montana State is a true leader when it comes to agricultural programs, and these dollars will keep our state competitive and productive" said Baucus, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Jon and I know Montana agriculture inside and out and we're proud to fight for our producers every day in Washington."
   "From beef to grain, Montana has worldwide reputation when it comes to agriculture," said Tester, one of only two farmers in the U.S. Senate. "That's why Max and I fought so hard to make sure MSU gets the funding it needs to stay at the top of the food chain."
   The Agriculture Appropriations Bill now goes to the full Senate for approval.
