SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $80,000 GRANT FOR BEE DISEASE RESEARCH
  A Missoula-based company generating a lot of buzz with its research is about to get a new boost, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   Bee Alert Technology will receive an $80,000 grant to research diseases and parasites that infect colonies and kill bees, which are crucial to crop pollination across Montana. 
   Researchers at Bee Alert use high-tech equipment to listen to the 'buzz sound' of bee colonies, which changes slightly when bees become infected by diseases or parasites. Using sophisticated technology, researchers diagnose bee problems by comparing the frequency of sounds. 
   "I don't want agriculture to be stung by a declining bee population," said Baucus, who spearheaded a letter last April to the Department of Agriculture demanding action be taken on Colony Collapse Disorder. "This project will help our bee keepers, which in turn will help our farmers and ranchers. Bee Alert Technology has been at the forefront of honey bee issues recently and this grant only verifies their quality work." 
   "Without bees, farmers have a tough time making things grow," said Tester, one of only two farmers in the U.S. Senate. "This is some pretty incredible research, and it will go a long way for Montana's farmers." 
   Bee Alert conducts is bee research with cooperation from the University of Montana. The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
