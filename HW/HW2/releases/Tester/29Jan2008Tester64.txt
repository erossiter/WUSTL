SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $300,000 FOR MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENTS
  Three Montana communities are getting a little help to make their communities safer, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is awarding grants through its Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The program is designed to improve emergency response and to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public from fires and other hazards.
  The following Montana fire departments are receiving grants to help with ongoing operations and safety: 
   Black Eagle Volunteer Fire Department will receive $47,500. Kalispell Fire Department will receive $106,696. Libby Fire Department will receive $173,551. 
   "Ensuring that our local fire departments have the tools they need to protect our communities is essential", said Baucus. "Investing federal dollars where they will do the most good is something I am very proud to announce."
  "Our home town fire departments are critically important for keeping our communities safe," Tester said. "This money will make sure the folks on the front lines have the resources they need to protect Montanans."
  The grants will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
