SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER URGE PRESIDENT TO APPROVE $260,000 FOR LIBBY ASBESTOS CLINIC
  More than a quarter million dollars in funding for Libby's Center for Asbestos-Related Disease has cleared its final hurdle in Congress and is now headed to President Bush's desk for a signature. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested the emergency funding earlier this fall. The $260,000 is part of the final Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the Senate and the House.
   The Center for Asbestos-Related Disease, commonly known as the CARD Clinic, tests and cares for victims of asbestos related disease. It is also regarded as a national leader in the field of asbestos-related disease research.
   Asbestos has killed and sickened hundreds of Libby residents who were exposed to the dangerous substance from W.R. Grace's nearby vermiculite mine.
   Baucus has visited Libby personally 21 different times since the tragedy was exposed in 1999. He secured millions of federal dollars for cleanup, health care, and economic development in Libby. Baucus also helped establish the CARD Clinic in 2000.
   "The folks in Libby have had more than their share of troubles. Making sure they get the resources they need to keep the CARD Clinic up and running is a sound investment of federal dollars," Baucus said. "Working hard to get funding for things like good health care and disease research is something Jon and I take very seriously."
   Tester has also been working closely with community leaders in Libby and CARD officials since taking office earlier this year.
   "The CARD Clinic has been a Montana success story from day one," Tester said. "Max and I worked closely together to get this critically important funding to Libby in order to keep one of Montana's most valuable research facilities up and running."
