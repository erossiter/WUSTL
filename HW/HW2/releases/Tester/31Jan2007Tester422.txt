SEN. TESTER HELPS SECURE HIGH-PROFILE EXHIBIT FOR LAUREL AVIATION AND TECHNOLOGY WEEK
  Thousands of Montana students will get to see a popular exhibit this spring after Sen. Jon Tester urged the U.S. Air Force to send the display to Montana for the upcoming Laurel Aviation and Technology Week (LATW). 
   Tester on Monday asked the Air Force to consider the educational benefits of sending the hands-on Do Something Amazing Tour to Laurel, where as many as 12,000 students from across Montana, northern Wyoming and even North Dakota will see it. The Air Force announced this week it will send the tour to Laurel for LATW, where it will be on display from May 8 through May 10. 
   The high-profile Do Something Amazing Tour features an actual F-16 fighter jet, a mid-air refueling simulator, a flight training simulator, a movie theater and a satellite exhibit. 
   A similar exhibit, called Cross into the Blue, was an extraordinarily popular attraction during the last LATW in 2004. Other attractions for the four-day event include speakers, high-tech displays, aircraft and flyovers. 
   "I'm thrilled we can make this work," Tester said. "It'll make for some exciting field trips come May. The Do Something Amazing Tour is an important resource that shows students of all ages how exciting science and technology can be." 
   LATW co-chairman Jack Bayne agrees. 
   "This event allows students to see, touch and experience the Air Force's technology first hand," Bayne said. "Instead of looking at pictures, they get to see the real thing. They get to see some very exciting careers in science and math. And they get to see what kind of education it takes to get there."
