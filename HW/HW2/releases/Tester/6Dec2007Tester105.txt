SEN. TESTER RESPONSE TO HOUSE PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to the U.S. House's passage of the Energy Bill. The bill - and all energy legislation - fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy Committee, of which Tester is a member. 
   "There's a lot of good for Montana in this Energy Bill, and I look forward to debating it and passing it through the Senate. As a member of the Energy Committee, I can say this measure is a good first step in moving us away from our dependence on foreign oil. It will make our country more secure while bringing new jobs and opportunity to Montana through renewable and responsible energy development."
   The measure passed the House 235-181.
