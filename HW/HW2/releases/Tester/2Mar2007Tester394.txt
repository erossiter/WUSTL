SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR MONTANA TRIBES
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester on Friday, March 2, praised the HUD for awarding the Northern Cheyenne Tribe $333,590 and the Blackfeet Tribe $324,159.  
   The funds will be used to create economic opportunities and good-paying jobs, as well as providing better housing opportunities and living environment, for people of modest means, the Senators said 
   "I'm very pleased the Northern Cheyenne and the Blackfeet received these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "My top priority is to create more good paying jobs all across Big Sky Country, and these dollars will go a long way to making that happen." 
   I couldn't be happier that these grants and the opportunities associated with them are going to Indian Country," Tester said. "Everyone deserves a roof over their head and these funds will go to help those that need it the most." 
   The grant was distributed through the Indian Community Development Block Grant Program.
