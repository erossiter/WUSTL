SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $13 MILLION IN HOUSING, COMMUNITY GRANTS FOR MONTANA
  The State of Montana and City of Missoula will receive nearly $13 million in grants to improve housing and support community development, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The grants come from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   HUD awarded four different types of grants to Montana. Community Development Block Grants provide annual funding to state and local governments to develop decent housing, affordable infrastructure, and job creation for low and moderate income families. HOME Program Grants help to expand affordable housing to low income families. Emergency Shelter Grants provide money for homeless shelters. American Dream Downpayment Initiative Grants provide financial help to first-time homebuyers. 
   The HUD grants will be distributed as follows: 
   Community Development Block Grants (CDBG): 
   * State of Montana: $6,935,714 
   * City of Missoula: $643,038 
   HOME Program Grants: 
   * State of Montana: $4,376,646 
   * City of Missoula: $561,320 
   Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG): 
   * State of Montana: $398,241 
   American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) Grant: 
   * State of Montana: $82,255 
   "A family owning its own home is the cornerstone of the American dream," Baucus said. "And these well-deserved dollars will go a long way towards helping Montanans realize their own dreams of having a place to call home, as well as providing other critical support for our Montana communities." 
   "This money will make Montana's communities stronger," Tester said. "And stronger communities lead to positive growth, job opportunities and a better economy." 
   Similar grants for the cities of Great Falls and Billings are expected in the coming months.
