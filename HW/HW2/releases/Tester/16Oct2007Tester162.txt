SENATE OKAYS $300,000 FOR GALLATIN COUNTY FIRST RESPONDERS
  Gallatin County is a big step closer to receiving $300,000 in federal money to purchase two new emergency response vehicles. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested funding for the new vehicles earlier this year as part of the 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill. The Senate approved the measure today. 
   The pair of vehicles, a mobile communications command vehicle and a special response vehicle will allow Gallatin County first responders to respond more quickly and efficiently to emergencies and manage incidents remotely.
   "A big thanks to Max and Jon for fighting for this money, it's going to make Gallatin County a safer place to live and visit," said Gallatin County Sheriff Jim Cashell. Both vehicles are expected to be used in Gallatin and surrounding counties. 
   "Our first responders deserve only the best equipment," said Baucus. "Jon and I know the value of giving those folks every tool necessary to do their jobs right and make Montana safe. I was glad we were able to get this done."
   "It's an awful long way from the north end of Gallatin County to the south end and too often, there's a need to be in two or three places at once," Tester said. "These vehicles will make that a little easier for the folks in Gallatin County and I was proud to work with Max to make this happen."
   The Senate will vote on a final appropriations bill after merging it with the House version of the measure. It must then be signed into law by President Bush.
