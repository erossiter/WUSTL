SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER: BETTER DRINKING WATER COMING TO LAKE COUNTY
  The Lake County Water and Sewer District will receive money to make significant improvements to its drinking water system, thanks to two grants announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The grants, totaling $1,085,400, come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They will be used to improve the quality and quantity of drinking water in Lake County. The grants will help pay for a new water well, repairs to the existing water storage tank, a new storage tank, and water transmission pipes.
   The new system will provide cleaner water, and it will better allow the County to flush water from storage units if it becomes contaminated.
   "All Montanans deserve good, clean drinking water," Baucus said. "These dollars will go a long way in making sure folks in the Flathead Valley have some of the best drinking water in the world."
   "These grants will go a long way in improving the infrastructure of Lake County," Tester said. "Max and I fight hard for money that goes to projects like this-to make sure our supply of water is fresh, safe and pure."
   The grants will be awarded through the USDA's Office of Rural Development.
