SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $22K FOR BELT FIRST RESPONDERS
  The Belt volunteer ambulance service is going to get some much needed equipment thanks to a $22,668 grant from the Department of Agriculture, Montana sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
  The grant will be used to purchase a new ambulance, and update ambulance equipment including a gurney and Spider straps. 
   "In an emergency a few minutes can be the difference between life and death, especially in rural areas," Baucus said. "And this new equipment will help the Belt ambulance service respond to calls faster, which could prevent an accident from becoming a tragedy."
   "This money will improve resources and make health care more accessible in and around Belt," Tester said. "Montanans should have access to quality ambulance service no matter where they live."
   The grant was distributed through the Community Facility Grant program.
