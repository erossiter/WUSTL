SEN. TESTER STATEMENT ON SENATE VOTE TO BEGIN DEBATING IRAQ POLICY
  Sen. Jon Tester on Wednesday, March 14, released the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted 89-9 to begin debating a resolution to revise U.S. policy in Iraq: 
   "For months I've said our troops deserve an open and honest debate about the direction of the war in Iraq. Today's action is a good first step. For too long the Senate has debated whether to debate the course of the war. Now we have a chance to do what Montanans sent me to Washington to do. Our country can no longer afford to wait."
