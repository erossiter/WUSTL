SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $300,000 TO HELP FORT PECK FARMERS, RANCHERS
  Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced a significant grant to help farmers and ranchers on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. 
   The $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be used to address the needs of farmers and ranchers who have been struggling with years of drought.
   Baucus, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said the funding will go a long way in northeastern Montana.
   "Montana's farmers and ranchers have dealt with more than their share of problems, including irrigation and drought," Baucus said. "These dollars will help keep Fort Peck's agriculture strong by making sure the water flows and equipment works."
   "When we invest in Montana agriculture, we invest in the entire state," said Tester, a third-generation grain farmer. "This money will sustain the farms and ranches that have sustained Montana for more than a century."
   The grant will be awarded through the USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Services.
