SEN. TESTER COMMENTS ON KARL OHS
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement: 
   "With the passing of Karl Ohs, Montana lost one of its best. Karl was a man who cared deeply about his family, always wore an easy smile and set aside differences and partisanship to do what was right for the state he loved.
   Karl was one of the first people I met when I came to Helena to serve in the state legislature. I will always remember how helpful and friendly he was.
   Karl Ohs will be remembered as a truly decent, hardworking, trustworthy Montana cowboy.
   Sharla and I join all Montanans in mourning Lieutenant Governor Ohs' passing and celebrating his life."
