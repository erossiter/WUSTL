SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $350K FOR MILES CITY
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $350,000 for Miles City Community College as part of the fiscal year 2008 Labor Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. 
   The senators said that the funding bill passed the Senate Appropriations committee today and will now go before the full Senate.
   The funds will be used for the Pathways to Careers in Health Care initiative. The program will help to train health care workers to work in rural communities both in eastern Montana, and nationwide.
   "We have a shortage of health care employers in eastern Montana, and Miles City Community College is providing a great program to fulfill this shortage," said Tad Torgerson, Dean of Administrative Services. "This appropriation was very important and we are tickled to death, and want to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Tester for their hard work."
   "Whether in a city, or rural community, every Montanan should have access to quality, affordable health care," Baucus said. "And I was pleased that the college got these dollars to provide top-notch training to future health care workers."
   "Being from Big Sandy I know how important rural health care is," Tester said. "And these dollars will provide many Montana communities with the resources they need to get the health care they deserve."
   The senators said that Miles City Community college is well-positioned to implement the Pathway to Careers in Health Care initiative because the school already offers certain health care education programs including a two-year Registered Nursing program, Certified Nursing Assistant preparation course and a Radiologic Technology Program partnership with Butte College of Technology.
