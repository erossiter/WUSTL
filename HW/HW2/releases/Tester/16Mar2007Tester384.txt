SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER: $140 MILLION SECURED FOR MALMSTROM HOUSING
  Following a telephone call with Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced that $140 million has been recovered for housing units at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls.  
   The funds were lost when Congress didn't fund specific projects, also known as earmarks, in the fiscal year 2007 spending bill earlier this year. 
   Baucus and Tester set out to secure the dollars directly from the federal government, lobbying agency officials. Both men urged Portman personally to fund the Malmstrom project. 
   "I'm relieved and thrilled at the same time," Baucus said. "It wasn't easy but we got those dollars for Malmstrom back. We had a great case to make - that Malmstrom's role in our nation's defense is critical, and that Great Falls relies on the base for jobs and our economy." 
   The Malmstrom housing project was the state's largest earmark that didn't get funded in the 2007 spending bill. 
   "Malmstrom Air Force Base is critically important to this country's security and it is the backbone of the Great Falls economy," Tester said. "These are vital dollars to ensure Malmstrom continues to be a world-class military installation." 
   In a telephone conversation, Portman committed that $140 million will be set aside to build 493 Family Housing Units at the base. The housing units will accommodate the growing needs of military families and personnel stationed at the base, the senators said.
