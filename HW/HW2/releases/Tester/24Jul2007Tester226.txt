  Montana will receive $1.5 million in grants to help the disabled and the homeless, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The two grants will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   * Opportunities, Inc., based in Great Falls, will receive $1,201,777 to help Head Start Projects in the Great Falls area, including designing activities for children with disabilities. 
   * The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services will receive $300,000 for the Assistance in Transition from Homelessness program. 
   "It's never too early to start learning, and never too late to have a place to call home," said Baucus. "And these much deserved dollars will go a long way towards helping folks all across our state."
   "These federal dollars will have a ripple effect throughout Montana," Tester said. "Helping students learn is good for down the road and helping folks find homes is good for right now.".
