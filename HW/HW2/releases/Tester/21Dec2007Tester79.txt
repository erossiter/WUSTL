SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER CONTINUE WAR ON METH
  A lot of solid progress has been made in the fight against meth in Montana and it will continue in 2008 thanks to Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. The Montana U.S. Senators helped to pump nearly $1.5 million into vital anti-meth projects including one of most successful anti-drug campaigns in Big Sky history; the Montana Meth Project. 
  "Through programs like the Montana Meth Project, we are getting the upper hand in this fight," Baucus said. "We can't lose the ground we've gained. Just like a campfire, we need to put out the flames completely, to make sure meth use never rekindles in our great state."
  "It's clear that powerful messages and smart laws are working in the fight against meth," Tester said. "But the war on meth isn't behind us. Funding programs like the Montana Meth Project is a smart investment for our communities and families."
  The cash is part of the end of the year omnibus spending bill that deposits almost $112 million in funding for more than 120 separate projects in Montana. The bill is now on its way to the President's desk.
  The bill includes $916,500 for the Montana Meth Project, the statewide organization responsible for graphic anti-meth advertisements. The Meth Project has been credited with a dramatic drop in meth use in Montana and has become a model for other states combating the drug.
  Drug courts in Montana are also getting a $312,550 boost. These courts are specifically for drug offenders and aim to treat addiction and eventually help those offenders rejoin their communities.
  Finally, the bill includes $171,943 for University of Montana Methamphetamine Detection and Health Effects research. Researchers there are ideally positioned to establish an integrated meth detection and health effects research program to serve as a central resource for the nation in addressing Meth abuse.
