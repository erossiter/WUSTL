SEN. TESTER COMMEMORATES NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE MONTH
  U.S. Senator Jon Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, today issued the following statement in the commemoration of November as National American Indian Heritage Month: 
   "As our nation recognizes the contributions of the approximately 4.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, including more than 56,000 in Montana, we celebrate the richness and diversity of American Indian cultures and traditions.
   In every facet of our progress as a society, from economy and politics, to sciences and arts, American Indians have contributed their talents, visions and hard work to build a stronger and more prosperous nation.
   I am working hard to improve Indian Country by introducing legislation aimed at boosting opportunities at tribal colleges across the country--especially for folks interested in heath care. And I'm working to pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007.
   I am committed to supporting and protecting the rights of American Indians and to supporting their pursuit of a better future for their families. We will continue to fight for increased economic and educational opportunities, improved health care access, and protection of the civil rights of indigenous people and all Americans."
