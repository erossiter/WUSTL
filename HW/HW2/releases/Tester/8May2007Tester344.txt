SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $170,000 FOR MONTANA STUDENTS
  Students and communities across Montana are poised for a win-win situation thanks to a $172,228 grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The Office of Public Instruction received the grant to help foster community service among K-12 students. The money will help programs that operate after school, on weekends, or during the summer and develops students' academic, leadership, and civic responsibilities through service. 
   "I'm very pleased with these dollars because not only do they expand students' education, but it's also a way to give back to our communities," Baucus said. "One of my top priorities is to make sure every Montanan has access to a quality education, and any activity that broadens students' horizons, really goes a long way towards achieving this." 
   "This is great news for our kids," Tester said. "This grant gives students options and resources to make basic education not-so-basic. They'll also have a chance to help their communities, which is a Montana value that's easier to learn outside the classroom." 
   The Office of Public Instruction will use the grant to develop Service-Advisory Learning Councils, which will help identify local needs for service, as well as help students with academic achievement. 
   The funds were distributed through the Learn and Serve America program.
