SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE DEVELOPMENT MONEY FOR SOUTHWEST MONTANA
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that Headwaters Resource Conservation and Development Area, Inc., will receive a $51,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
   Headwaters, based in Butte, is a program under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service. Its mission uses a community-based approach to address cultural, social and economic problems.
   "It's always good to see opportunities for community-based development across Montana," Baucus said. "Headwaters will use this money to bring more good-paying jobs in southwest Montana, which will help strengthen the economy."
   "Resource conservation and development are key to Montana's future," Tester said. "Headwaters is no exception. This money will help them fulfill their mission, pairing environmental stewardship with economic development." 
   The $51,000 grant will be awarded through the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Council.
