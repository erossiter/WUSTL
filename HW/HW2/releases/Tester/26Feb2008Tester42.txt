SEN. TESTER: INDIAN HEALTH CARE BILL 'A NEEDED STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION'
  Senator Jon Tester released the following statement in response to today's passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the measure 83-10. 
   "Health care is the number one issue in Indian Country and this legislation is a needed step in the right direction towards fulfilling our commitment to the first Americans. Reauthorization of this vital legislation is long overdue. It's good to see that both Democrats and Republicans joined together to overwhelmingly pass this health care bill. I hope that bipartisanship will carry over as we work to improve opportunities in Indian Country."
   Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, rallied support for the measure on the Senate floor earlier this month. More information about the Indian Health Care Improvement Act can be viewed at http://tester.senate.gov/News/record.cfm?id=292959.
