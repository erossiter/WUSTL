SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE NEARLY $11 MILLION FOR MISSOULA
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester have secured more than $10.7 million in federal funding for Missoula as part of a bipartisan overall funding bill working its way through Congress. 
   The $10.7 million for the 2008 fiscal year will be invested in education, scientific research, public safety, infrastructure and fighting drug abuse in Missoula, Baucus and Tester said. The funding includes money for new equipment for Missoula police officers, nearly $500,000 for the Montana Meth Project and nearly $300,000 to help the Missoula food bank purchase new refrigerated trucks. 
   The projects for Missoula break down as follows:
   $580,450 to purchase equipment for a new Missoula Police Headquarters. 
   $312,550 to improve The University of Montana's Montana Youth Empowerment Project. 
   $89,300 to purchase equipment for the Missoula County Interoperable Communications Center. 
   $446,500 for the Meth Project Foundation in Missoula (another $470,000 will go to the statewide Montana Meth Project). 
   $366,600 for the Missoula Public Safety Training Center. 
   $492,200 for the Blackfoot River Special Recreation Management Area that will protect critical wildlife habitat for rare, threatened and endangered animal and plant species.

   $268,231 for Community Medical Center to help provide new labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum birthing suites; cesarean delivery rooms; and private rooms for neonatal intensive care patients. 
   $171,943 for the UM Methamphetamine Detection and Health Effects Research where Montana researchers are ideally positioned to establish an integrated meth detection and health effects research program to serve as a central resource for the nation in addressing Meth abuse. 
   $114,956 for the UM Rehabilitation, Research, and Training Center that will fund a demonstration project under the Living and Working Well with a Disability program under the auspices of Medicare/Medicaid. 
   $76,637 for the Montana Committee for the Humanities that will fund a year-long program of conferences, forums, meetings, and other public gatherings. 
   $656,600 for the Bridge Over Broadway that would provide a pedestrian bridge for access to the Rattlesnake Recreation area new East Broadway Avenue. 
   $656,600 for homeWORD that will help to develop affordable, rental housing for citizens of Missoula. 
   $295,470 for the Missoula Food Bank, Inc. Transportation System that will be used to purchase eight refrigerated trucks to help transport food to food shelters across the state. 
   $2,058,000 for spiroid winglets research. 
   $738,920 for the Missoula Air Traffic Control tower replacement. 
   $260,000 for the Seeley Lake Water Improvements project. 
   "Jon and I have fought for these projects from day one, because they bring good-paying jobs and new opportunities to Western Montana," Baucus said. "These dollars will make Missoula safer and healthier and they will make sure that the world class research being done at the University of Montana continues."
   "These dollars will go a long way for Missoula, UM, and all of Montana," Tester said. "Max and I fight for projects that strengthen communities, create jobs, and protect our Montana way of life-that's exactly what these do."
   The House passed the funding measure late last night. The Senate is expected to vote today on the legislation, which sets aside nearly $112 million for Montana projects. The overall bill will then go to President Bush.
   President Bush has already signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, which sets aside nearly $31 million for military research and development projects across Montana.
