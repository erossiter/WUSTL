SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT ON MALMSTROM MISSILES
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement:
   "I was disappointed to learn that the Air Force is targeting the elimination of fifty Minuteman III missiles from Malmstrom Air Force Base. Malmstrom is critical to our national security and the economy of North Central Montana. I will continue to fight for Malmstrom and the Air Force in the United States Senate and I will work toward getting another mission at the base."
