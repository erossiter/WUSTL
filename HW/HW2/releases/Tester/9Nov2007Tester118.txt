SEN. TESTER: VETERANS' DAY A TIME TO SHOW RESPECT, APPRECIATION
  Senator Jon Tester, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, today released the following statement in advance of the Veterans' Day weekend: 
   "Veterans' Day is an important day for our country. It is a chance to show our respect and appreciation to the millions of men and women who put their lives on the line for our country--and the many who paid the ultimate price for it. To all vets, and to all troops serving our military today, thank you.
   It is also a chance to say thanks to the families and friends of the folks who serve our country. You all have made a good deal of sacrifices too.
   And Veterans' Day is a chance to renew our commitment to all veterans. This country must live up to the promises it makes to our men and women in uniform. With your help, I will do everything I can to provide them the resources they need to be successful and safe in the field, and with the resources they need to have access to affordable, quality health care and other necessities when they come home."
