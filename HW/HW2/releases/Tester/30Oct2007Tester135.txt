SEN. TESTER RESPONDS TO VA SECRETARY NOMINATION
  Senator Jon Tester, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, today released the following statement in response to President Bush's nomination of retired Lieutenant General James Peake, M.D., to become the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs: 
   "Our next VA Secretary is going to be in for one heck of a tough job. We have a long way to go to fulfill the promises we made to all vets, no matter where they live, and we could use a doctor's perspective as we improve their access to quality health care. 
   I thank Dr. Peake for his service to this country. I look forward to seeing if his record gives him the independence and credibility he needs to lead a department facing such enormous challenges."
