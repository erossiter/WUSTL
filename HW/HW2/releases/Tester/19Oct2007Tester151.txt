SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $450,000 FOR HELENA
  A plan to bring a major airline carrier to Helena is ready for take-off thanks to a $450,000 grant, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funds will be used to put together a marketing strategy to lure a new airline into providing service to Helena, as well as offer a revenue guarantee to help lower the risk of a new carrier coming.
   The senators said that by bringing a new carrier to the Helena airport, travelers will have more destination choices and lower airfare prices.
   "The process for getting this grant was highly competitive, and I'm very excited that we were selected to receive this money, because a new airlines would have a tremendous financial benefit for our city" said Ron Mercer, manager of the Helena Airport. "Max and Jon know how important air travel is to Montanans, and I'd like to thank them for their unwavering support."
   "My hometown is growing, and this grant will really be a boost to Helena, Lewis and Clark County, and all Montana," said Baucus, a Helena native. "More flights means more options, more business, more destinations, and cheaper prices, and that's good for everyone."
   "Montanans should be able to travel as hassle free as people living in big cities," said Tester. "And with these dollars, the Helena airport will continue to be able to give folks a first class traveling experience."
   The grant, which was one of only 26 distributed nationally, was distributed through the Department of Transportation.
