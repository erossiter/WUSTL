SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER OPPOSE AMNESTY
  Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester sent a clear message today that they believe the 12 million illegal aliens currently in the country need to go to the back of the line.  
   Baucus and Tester voted today for a provision that would eliminate the entire section of the pending immigration bill granting amnesty to 12 million illegal aliens currently living in the U.S. 
   The amendment to the immigration bill was proposed by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and it would eliminate all of the so-called "Z" Visa language from a massive immigration bill already several hundred pages in length. 
   "Amnesty is wrong because it's not good for Montana, and it's not good for America. It's not fair to try and cut to the front of the line," Baucus said. "If folks want to immigrate to our great nation, and pursue the American dream, they must get to the back of the line and do it the right way." 
   "Folks need to get in line, no different than my grandparents did. And if they're illegal, they need to go to the back of the line," Tester said. "There's no question we need immigration reform in this country but I won't support amnesty and I was pleased to have the chance to get amnesty out of this bill." 
   Earlier in the week, Baucus and Tester cited their opposition to amnesty as the reason for voting against even bringing the bill to the senate floor for debate.
