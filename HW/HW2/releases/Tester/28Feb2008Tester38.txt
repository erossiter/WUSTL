SENATORS ANNOUNCE $213,750 GRANT TO MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECT
  Montana's two U.S. Senators are pleased to announce a $213,750 grant for a scientific research project at Montana State University in Bozeman. 
   The Department of Health and Human Services funding will be used in the University's study entitled "Influence of the Host Molecular Environment on Toxoplasma Development."
   Toxoplasma is a single-cell parasite that can infect humans. It's a common and serious infection in AIDS patients, and can cause severe birth defects in children. Results from these studies will help researchers understand the onset of disease, and identify potential treatments.
   "I'm really happy about this grant," said Senator Max Baucus. "I may not know too much about Toxoplasma, but I know investing in Montana's students is always the right decision. I can't wait to see what our researchers find out."
   "Montana's universities are the best in the country," said Senator Jon Tester. "Grants like this will make sure that when it comes to science, our students will be ahead of the curve-right where they should be."
   The grant was awarded by DHHS' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
