SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO DECISION TO REMOVE MIKE HORSE DAM
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to a Forest Service decision to remove and clean up the Mike Horse Dam on the Blackfoot River. Tester toured the dam site and called for full cleanup of the area in early June.
   "The Forest Service has done right today. This is a critically important, once-and-for-all decision for Montana. It's the best thing to do for the Blackfoot and its residents, and for all Montanans who value hunting and fishing Montana's wild places the way they're meant to be."
