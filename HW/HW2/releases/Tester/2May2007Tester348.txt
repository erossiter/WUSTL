SEN. TESTER CALLS ON WILLIAM MERCER TO RESIGN
  On May 2, Wednesday morning, the Washington Post reported that William Mercer was violating federal law by serving both as Montana's U.S. Attorney and as a high-ranking official at the Department of Justice. Instead of abiding by federal law, Mercer had the law changed.  
   Today, Sen. Jon Tester issued the following statement: 
   "For months, I gave Bill Mercer the benefit of the doubt that he was shooting straight with me and with the people of Montana. Mr. Mercer has been given every opportunity to do right by the people he represents; he has passed on that chance too many times. Mr. Mercer was operating outside federal law, so he had the law changed. That might work in Alberto Gonzales' Justice Department, but it's not how we do business in Montana. He should resign his post as Montana's U.S. Attorney immediately."
