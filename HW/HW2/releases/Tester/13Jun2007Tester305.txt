SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $800,000 FOR MONTANA COLLEGES
  Two colleges in Montana will receive significant grants, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The U.S. Department of education is awarding a $400,000 grant to Rocky Mountain College in Billings, and a $399,975 grant for Helena's Carroll College. Both five-year grants are awarded through the Strengthening Institutions Program.
   Strengthening Institutions Program grants help colleges and universities strengthen their academic programs. It also helps colleges expand their ability to serve low-income students.
   "These dollars will really give a boost to the Bears and Saints," Baucus said. "This grant will keep these colleges top notch, and students will get an even better education which is the key to a strong economic future."
   "It's going to be exciting to see this money go to work for both Rocky Mountain and Carroll," Tester said. "It will make two great Montana colleges even better, it will bring positive growth, and it will open doors for more students."
   According to the Department of Education, the colleges may use the grants for planning, developing faculty and academic programs, and to establish endowment funds. The grants may also be used for construction, maintenance and student services.
