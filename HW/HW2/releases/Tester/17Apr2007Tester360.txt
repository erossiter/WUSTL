SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $179K FOR ST. LUKE'S COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IN RONAN
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today praised the HHS for awarding St. Luke's Community Hospital in Ronan $179,878.  
   The funds will be used for the Rural Health Network Development Program, which is designed to help rural-based health care organizations work together to integrate administrative, clinical, financial or technology-related activities. 
   "I'm very pleased that the folks at St. Luke's received these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "One of my top priorities is to make sure that all Montanans have access to quality, affordable health care, and these funds will go a long to make sure that the folks around Ronan will have this access." 
   "As a Big Sandy farmer, I know firsthand the importance of access to quality health care in rural Montana," Tester said. "This money will go a long way in Lake County to boost access to quality health care. Max and I will continue to fight for important funding like this." 
   The grant was distributed through the Human Resources and Service Administration's Grant Management Operation.
