SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $25,000 FOR BIG READ
  Readers of all ages in Montana will be able to come together to read and discuss classic American literature, thanks to grants announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The National Endowment for the Arts is awarding Montana libraries matching grants to help fund the Big Read, the largest community reading program in the United States.
   The Lewis and Clark Library in Helena and the Lincoln County Public Libraries based in Libby are among 118 libraries nationwide selected for the Big Read this fall.
   The Lewis and Clark Library will receive $20,000 to organize a community reading and discussion of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. The Lincoln County Libraries will receive $4,600 to read and discuss Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston.
   "Reading can open up new doors and expand folks' horizons," Baucus said. "And reading the classics like To Kill A Mocking Bird and Their Eyes Were Watching God will give people a glimpse into the past, which will prepare them for the future."
   "This is a valuable program at a time when so many folks would rather watch TV than read a book," Tester said. "I encourage all people in Helena and Lincoln County to take part in the Big Read. It's not only fun, it will introduce readers to some classic books that are part of our American heritage."
   The National Endowment for the Arts will also provide the libraries with free support materials including guides, audio introductions and access to a discussion website.
