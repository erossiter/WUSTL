SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HELP SECURE FUNDS TO BOOST COPS
  Montana's U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today helped pass a measure that will provide $110 million to put 1,400 new police officers on the streets nationwide to help fight drug use and keep our communities safer. 
   Baucus and Tester were co-sponsors of the amendment that will help hire new officers for the Community Oriented Policing Program, commonly referred to as COPS. The measure was included in the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill that passed the Senate today.
   "More officers on the streets helps keep crime down," Baucus said. "I want to do all I can to help keep our Montana communities safe. COPS has proven to be an effective crime-fighting program. That's why Jon and I teamed up to help get these funds."
   "Keeping Montana and its communities safe is one of my top priorities," Tester said. "Max and I are committed to doing our part to help fight crime and that's why we teamed up to help secure these federal dollars."
   The COPS program was created in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. COPS helps to advance community policing by preventing crime and fear of crime on a local basis. The program operates in communities of all sizes nationwide, including law enforcement organizations at the tribal, state, and local levels. By working at the community level, COPS strengthens bonds between law enforcement, civic leaders, and the people they serve. Since its inception, COPS has accounted for $11.3 billion of additional community police nationwide.
   The senators said that in fiscal year 2006 Montana received $2,129,250 in COPS funding.
