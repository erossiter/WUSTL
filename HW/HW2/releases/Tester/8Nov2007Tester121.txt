SEN. TESTER RESPONDS TO SENATE OVERRIDE OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S WATER PROJECTS VETO
  Montana Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate overrode President Bush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). With a vote of 79-14 this is the first veto override of Bush's Presidency: 
   "Anyone in Montana will tell you how important water projects are for our state. I can't imagine why, after seven years of drunken sailor spending, the President would stand in the way of repairing crumbling bridges and delivering a lifeline as simple as water to rural America. I'm proud to see that we were able to override this irresponsible veto and these good projects will be saved."
