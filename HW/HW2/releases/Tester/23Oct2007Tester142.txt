SENATE APPROVES NEARLY $200,000 FOR DEER LODGE, TWIN BRIDGES
  The U.S. Senate has just given a green light to nearly $200,000 to improve health care services and education in Deer Lodge and Twin Bridges. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested the funding earlier this year. The full Senate agreed to pay for the projects as part of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill.
   Baucus and Tester said $95,000 will go to the Powell County Memorial Hospital in Deer Lodge to upgrade its Emergency Room equipment. The hospital will also use the money for new diagnostic software and hardware.
   The Northern Rockies Educational Service in Twin Bridges will receive $100,000 to help schools across the state implement the Taking Technology to the Classroom project. The project is designed to help Montana K-12 teachers better integrate technology into their classrooms.
   "Thank you to Max Baucus and Jon Tester for all their hard work," said Ron Hanson, Powell County Planner. "They know how critical these dollars are to smaller counties, because we have a great need, but not always the resources. They worked hard for these dollars, and we are very grateful."
   "Every Montanan should have access to quality, affordable health care and a good education," Baucus said. "That's why Jon and I worked so hard to secure these funds, because whether you live in a town of 100 people or one million you should have good schools, and good health care."
   "I know first hand how tough it can be for hospitals and schools in rural communities," Tester said. "Working to secure these funds was important because no Montana should ever wonder if they are going to get good health care, or if there kids will get a good education."
   The Senate will vote on a final appropriations bill after merging it with the House version of the measure. It must then be signed into law by President Bush.
