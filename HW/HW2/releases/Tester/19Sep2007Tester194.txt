SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MONEY TO HELP MONTANA'S CHILDREN
  Collecting new information about the mental health of Montana's children just got a little easier, thanks to a grant announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
  The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services will receive $142,200 to collect data on the mental health of Montana children.
  "Understanding the mental health of our children is a huge priority," said Baucus. "Because understanding the current state of their mental health will allow for easier, more effective treatment."
  "This is an important step in making sure our young people get the health care they deserve," said Tester. "This information will go long way towards developing programs to help all children in our state."
  The $142,200 grant will come from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
