SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE NEARLY $9 MILLION FOR NORTH-CENTRAL MONTANA MILITARY PROJECTS
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester have secured $8.8 million for military projects in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Nation. 
   The Senate last night passed the final Defense Appropriations Bill by a voice vote, sending the measure to President Bush to be signed into law. The bill sets aside nearly $31 million for various projects across Montana.
   Baucus and Tester requested funding for the projects earlier this year. The final spending bill includes:
   * $4 million for Cubic Corporation in Great Falls to purchase an Initial-Homestation Instrumentation Training System (I-HITS). The I-HITS system provides both training and live-combat technology to help American troops better identify friendly forces on the battlefield. Both Malmstrom Air Force Base and the Montana National Guard will use system. 
   * $800,000 for Malmstrom Air Force Base for cyber security attack and defense exercises. The money will fund two community exercises in Great Falls and one statewide exercise to examine and enhance the ability to cooperatively address a cyber attack on military installations. The exercise will focus on community-military interaction to ensure that communication is good. 
   * $1.6 million for the Blackfeet Nation Tribal Business in Browning to develop lightweight, low-cost materials for missile defense equipment. The Blackfeet Nation, in partnership with Radiance Technologies, Inc., will manufacture much-needed materials to replace traditional heavy, logistically constraining equipment.
   * $2.4 million to improve communications for aircraft that patrol the northern border, including the Montana Air National Guard. 
  "These dollars are going to provide good paying jobs in Great Falls and Browning while strengthening our national security," Baucus said. "Jon and I make good projects like these a priority and we've fought hard to get them through Congress."
   "This is a big investment in the future of Montana and these projects will do a lot of good for our state," Tester said. "Now it's time for President Bush to sign this bill into law to make our country more secure and make Montana a leader in defense technology and research."
