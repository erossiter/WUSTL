SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $12 MILLION FOR BUTTE
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester have delivered on their promise to secure federal funding for the Mining City. 
   The Senators announced today that $12.5 million for vital military projects in Butte has been included in the Defense Appropriations Bill, which passed the U.S. Senate today.
   "Butte is known for its great work ethic, and innovative spirit, and these dollars will keep Montana on the cutting edge of military technology," Baucus said. "Jon and I were proud to go to bat for these dollars, and we are going to make sure the ball gets across the goal."
   "These dollars will advance projects that will keep our nation safe from all kinds of threats," Tester said. "And I can't think of any better investment then safety, which is why Max and I are going to make sure these dollars get delivered."
   "The engineers, scientists and staff of MSE are very appreciative that the Senate of the United States has continued to recognize the importance of both the MARIAH Hypersonic Wind Tunnel program and MSE's plasma arc technology to our national defense," said Jeff Ruffner, President and CEO of MSE. "Thanks to the support and leadership of Senators Baucus and Tester, these efforts will continue the development of Montana's aerospace and defense technology industries. MSE is thankful for the confidence that our Senators continue to show in our efforts to support our Department of Defense customers."
