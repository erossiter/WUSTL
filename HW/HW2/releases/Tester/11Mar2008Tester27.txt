SEN. TESTER RESPONSE TO W.R. GRACE ANNOUNCEMENT
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to news that W.R. Grace and Company has agreed to pay $250 million for cleanup and investigation of asbestos contamination in Libby, Mont.:
   "You can't put a price on human lives, and far too many folks were lost in Libby because of asbestos. Cleaning up the mess and taking care of the Montanans poisoned by W.R. Grace will take years of hard work. It will also require responsibility from a company that knowingly turned so many Montana families into victims."
