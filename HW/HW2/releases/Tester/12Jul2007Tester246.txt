SENATE PANEL APPROVES $1.6 MILLION FOR GREAT FALLS PROJECTS
  A key Senate panel has given a green light to two projects that will keep the Electric City on the move, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon approved a measure setting aside $1.6 million for the projects in Great Falls and Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation. Baucus and Tester requested the funding earlier this year.
   When the funding measure passes, the Great Falls Transit District will receive $1 million to replace its aging fleet of buses with newer, more fuel efficient buses. The funding will allow the city to purchase 13 new buses.
   "This is going to give Great Falls a big boost, and it will provide better services for people who rely on public transportation," said Great Falls Mayor Dona Stebbins. "This is great news for Great Falls and I thank Max and Jon for looking out for our city's needs."
   The Chippewa-Cree Housing Authority will also receive $600,000 to refurbish old housing duplexes at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, and transport them about 90 miles north to the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, where many families are waiting for homes. 
   "Making sure all Montanans have a decent place to live and means to get to and from work are some of my top priorities," Baucus said. "I was proud to work with Jon to help get these projects rolling. They'll mean so much to folks in Great Falls and at Rocky Boy's."
   "As fuel prices continue to shoot through the roof, this funding will save money and provide folks more options in and around Great Falls," Tester said. "Max and I know how critical it is to keep projects like this funded and we fought hard to make it happen."
   The Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee approved the funding yesterday. Now the measure goes to the full Senate for approval.
