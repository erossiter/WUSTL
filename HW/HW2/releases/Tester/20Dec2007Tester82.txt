SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER BEEF UP MONTANA'S MILITARY FACILITIES
  Montana will receive millions of dollars for new military facilities now that Congress has approved various funding requests by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
  The bipartisan spending bill, which funds the federal government for the next fiscal year, cleared both the House and the Senate this week.
  Both Baucus and Tester made sure the measure sets aside $7 million to build a new community activity center at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls.
   The center will include a fitness facility, a conference center and a kitchen to allow the military to cater events on base.
  The senators also secured more than $7.6 million to purchase land and build a new Army Reserve Center in Butte.
   The money will be used for a new training building, maintenance shop, storage building and a parking lot.
  The measure also includes $906,000 to replace the Montana National Guard's Readiness Center in Miles City. The new readiness center was the Guard's top priority for military construction projects in 2008.
  "This is a solid investment for Montana for the folks who protect our country every day," Baucus said. "Our troops are the best in the world, and Jon and I worked together to make sure they get the funding they need and deserve."
  "Whether it's community well-being or military training, our troops deserve the best," Tester said. "Securing this funding for Great Falls and Malmstrom was a top priority for Max and me, and it will make all of Montana a better place to live."
  The overall spending bill contains nearly $112 million for various projects across Montana to improve public safety, infrastructure, economy, education and economic development.
  President Bush said he expects to sign the legislation into law this week.
