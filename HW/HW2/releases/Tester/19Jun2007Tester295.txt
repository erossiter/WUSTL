SENATE PANEL APPROVES $1 MILLION FOR BLACKFOOT RIVER RECREATION AREA
  One of Montana's most famous recreation and wildlife hotspots will get a million dollar boost under plan approved today by a key Senate panel.  
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested the funding for the Blackfoot River Special Recreation Management Area. Today, senators approved 1 million for the Western Montana project.
   "The Blackfoot is a symbol of Montana's proud outdoor heritage," Baucus said. "What Norman Maclean made so famous in A River Runs Through It should be able to be enjoyed, and inspire, Montanans for generations. Which is why Jon and I worked so hard to secure these much deserved dollars"
   "The Blackfoot Valley is one of the most prized places in the entire world," Tester said. "And this project will keep the area wild for future generations. It's always a privilege to fight hard in Washington for projects like this." 
   The Blackfoot River Special Recreation Management Area will protect critical wildlife habitat for rare, threatened and endangered animal and plant species.
   It will also keep Montana's heritage alive and well by boosting rural economies that benefit from the Blackfoot River and its surrounding habitat.
   Today's decision to fund the project now goes to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for approval.
