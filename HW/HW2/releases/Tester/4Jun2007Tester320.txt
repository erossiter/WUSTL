SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER OPPOSE IMMIGRATION BILL
  Montana's Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced their opposition to the immigration bill before the Senate, saying the legislation is flawed and that it doesn't go far enough to crack down on illegal immigration. 
   Baucus and Tester said that the bill aimed at reducing the number of illegal immigrants entering the country makes it too easy for an illegal immigrant to get a work visa, does not go far enough in strengthening the country's borders and does not have tough enough enforcement measures. 
   "This bill is flawed," Baucus said. "I cannot support a bill that provides amnesty for illegal immigrants. Anyone who wants to live in this country must follow the proper process. They must go to the back of the line, learn English, take citizenship classes and pay back taxes. I don't support the immigration bill before the Senate."
   "This bill isn't fair to Montana taxpayers," Tester said. "We're not even enforcing the laws we already have on the books, so there's no way I can support a new law that does nothing to make us safer and gives 12 million people living here illegally a free pass."
   The senators said they'll continue to work together with their Senate colleagues to make the bill tougher on illegal immigration and to strengthen the country's borders.
   Votes on amendments to the bill are expected throughout the week and a final vote on the entire immigration bill is expected within the next week, Baucus and Tester said.
