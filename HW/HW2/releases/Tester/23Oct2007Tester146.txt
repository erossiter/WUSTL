SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER: $540,000 FOR MILES CITY CLEARS ANOTHER HURDLE
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that $540,000 will be set aside for Miles City Community College and Holy Rosary Healthcare as part of the fiscal year 2008 Labor Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which passed the full Senate late today. 
   Baucus and Tester said $350,000 will be used for Miles City Community College's Pathways to Careers in Health Care initiative. The program will help to train health care workers to work in rural communities both in eastern Montana, and nationwide.
   "We have a shortage of health care employers in eastern Montana, and Miles City Community College is providing a great program to fulfill this shortage," said Tad Torgerson, Dean of Administrative Services. "This appropriation was very important and we are tickled to death, and want to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Tester for their hard work"
   Holy Rosary Healthcare will receive $190,000 for its teleradiology program, which allows doctors to send, receive and analyze x-rays via computers without having to physically send them around the state. The new technology will greatly improve health care for many Montanans who live in eastern Montana, Baucus and Tester said.
   "No matter where folks live, every Montanan should have access to quality, affordable health care," Baucus said. "And I was pleased to help get these dollars to provide top-notch training to future health care workers."
   "Living in Big Sandy, I know how important rural health care is," said Tester, who visited Holy Rosary Healthcare earlier this month. "These dollars will provide many Montana communities with the resources they need to get the health care they deserve."
   Baucus and Tester said the House has already passed its version of the bill. Now the legislation will now go to a joint House and Senate committee to work out differences between the two bills.
