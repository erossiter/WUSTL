SEN. TESTER: ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 'A SOLID COMPROMISE'
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to the Senate's passage of the economic stimulus bill:
   "This plan is a winner. It's a solid compromise to keep our country's economy and Montana's small businesses on their feet. And it means cash for Americans who need it most.
   Thanks to Max Baucus' hard work, hundreds of thousands of disabled veterans and millions of seniors are now part of the economic recovery picture, and illegal immigrants aren't."
