SENATORS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $2.5 MILLION TO HELP COVER COST OF DERBY FIRE
  Montana's U.S. Senators today announced that the State of Montana will receive nearly $2.5 million dollars to help cover the cost of the 2006 Derby Fire in south-central Montana. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) more than $2.49 million to help pay for expenses including expenses for fire camps, equipment repair and use, tools, materials and supplies.
   "The Derby Fire cost Montana a fortune in land, timber, homes and resources," Baucus said. "The DNRC fought hard to protect our state, and I'm pleased that FEMA is doing what it can to help recoup the costs."
   "Wildfire burns up a huge part of the budget every year, and any help Montana can get in the way of relief will go a long way," Tester said. "This is a good investment back into Montana's resources so emergency services will be available to help protect our families and communities from future wildfires."
   The 2006 Derby Fire destroyed more than two dozen homes between August and October of 2006. The fire scorched nearly a quarter million acres across Sweetgrass and Stillwater Counties.
   The FEMA grant will be awarded through the President's Disaster Relief fund.
