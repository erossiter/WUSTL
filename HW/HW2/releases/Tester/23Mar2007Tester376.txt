SENATORS: CAMPGROUND NEAR ROSCOE GETS $584,000 FOR IMPROVEMENTS
  Montana's Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced on Friday, March 23, 2007, that $584,000 in federal funding has been released to improve the Jimmy Joe Campground, nine miles south of Roscoe.  
   The funds, which will be distributed through the U.S. Forest Service, will be split with $277,000 used for facilities maintenance and $307,000 used for access road improvements. 
   The facility maintenance will include a complete overhaul of current bathrooms and camping sites, which were damaged in the massive 1996 Shepherd Mountain fire. The new renovations will also make the facilities handicap accessible. 
   The road maintenance will include improving the access road, and creating more vehicle turnouts. 
   "The funds are very important, because we will be able to improve our facilities so everyone can come and visit and enjoy," said Dave Schmid, District Ranger for the Beartooth District of the Custer National Forest. 
   "I'm glad for these dollars because not only will they improve a great camping facility for folks in the East Rosebud," said Baucus. "But they will also provide a great facility for folks from all across Montana, and the country" 
   "These funds will allow Jimmy Joe's to stay a top notch facility and allow folks to enjoy the greatest gift Montana has to offer: public access to our open spaces, streams and mountains," Tester said. "Outdoor recreation and access to our public lands is our heritage and I'll work with Max to make sure all Montanans can enjoy it." 
   The Jimmy Joe Campground, which has only been open intermittently since the Shepherd fire, covers four acres and is located in the Custer National Forest.
