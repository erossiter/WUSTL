SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $160,000 FOR STONE CHILD COLLEGE
  Stone Child College on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation will be able to implement a program designed to help American Indian high school students make a successful transition to post secondary education, thanks to a grant announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The U.S. Department of Education awarded Stone Child College $159,599 to fund the 'Bridge Program'. The program will be a joint effort between Stone Child College and two rural school districts, Rocky Boy Public School and Box Elder. Together, they will build a comprehensive academic counseling program.
   In addition to preparing students for college, the program will include activities to engage students in the community, fostering social responsibility.
   "A good education is the key to a strong economic future, and this money will help better prepare students on the Rocky Boy Reservation for the future," Baucus said. "The Bridge Program is the first step towards ensuring American Indian students make a successful transition to college."
   "Better prepared high school students become more successful college students," said Tester, who in May introduced legislation to improve tribal college education nationwide. "Investing in good education in Indian Country will lead to stronger and healthier communities across Montana's tribal nations."
   The grant was awarded through the U.S. Department of Education.
