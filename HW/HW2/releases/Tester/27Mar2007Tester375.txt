SENS. TESTER, BAUCUS ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR HIGH-TECH GEAR
  Officers, firefighters and rescue teams across Montana are about to get some a high-tech boost from the federal government, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   Nearly 20 "first responder" agencies across the state will receive thousands of dollars from the Department of Homeland Security to purchase tools like night vision cameras, surveillance cameras and protective gear. 
   The grants are part of the Department of Homeland Security's Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program (CEDAP). CEDAP provides first responder agencies mostly in rural communities with high-tech equipment and training. 
   "I'm very pleased that these much deserved funds were awarded across Big Sky Country," Baucus said. "These dollars will go a long way towards making our streets more secure, our homes better protected, and our children safer." 
   Tester, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, added the grants are especially important for smaller communities. 
   "These grants will make all of Montana safer and more secure," Tester said. "But they're critical for places like Ekalaka, Conrad and Fort Benton. When it comes to homeland security, all communities, big and small, need to be up to snuff." 
   The new CEDAP grants, totaling more than $226,000, will go to the following Montana agencies: 
   Big Horn County Sheriff's Office, $38,117.87 
   Glacier County Sheriff's Office, $33,100.00
