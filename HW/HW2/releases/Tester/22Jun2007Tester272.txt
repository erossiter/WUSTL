MONTANA CRIME VICTIMS TO RECEIVE EXPANDED SERVICES
  Victims of crime across Montana will have access to better services, thanks to a grant announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The U.S. Department of Justice is awarding the Montana Board of Crime Control $1,567,000 to fund victims' services across the state.
   The nearly $1.6 million grant will be divided and sent to dozens of communities across the state by the Montana Board of Crime Control.
   Projects funded by the grant include domestic violence prevention and protection programs, child and witness advocacy programs, services for sexual assault victims, and training.
   "Victims of crime should have access to the best service possible," Baucus said. "These dollars will help our communities by making people aware of violence and abuse, assisting victims of these crimes, and keeping criminals behind bars."
   "The better the services available to victims, the better we can protect them and prosecute the bad guys," Tester said. "This money will make Montana safer, and it is critically important for victims of domestic abuse, sex abuse and child abuse."
   The Montana Board of Crime Control says the grant money will provide direct, immediate assistance to victims in order to improve their willingness to cooperate with the criminal justice process, and to restore their faith in the criminal justice system.
