SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MAJOR GRANTS FOR MONTANA'S AIRPORTS
  Airports across Montana are about to get a lift from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The FAA is awarding 32 airports in all regions of the state nearly $16 million in grants. The money will be used for various projects including runway improvements, fences, lighting and equipment.  
   The funding also includes $1.6 million for the City of Poplar and Roosevelt County to build an airport. 
   "Montanans depend on good airports to see family and friends, get medical attention, and travel for business," Baucus said. "These dollars will open up great opportunities for folks in every corner of our state" 
   "In a state as big as Montana, good airports are critically important," Tester said. "This money will literally pave the way to better infrastructure in cities and small towns. Better airports mean better economy, better security and better health care."
