SEN. TESTER ISSUES STATEMENT IN OBSERVANCE OF MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND
  Sen. Jon Tester today released the following statement in observance of Memorial Day Weekend:  
   "This Memorial Weekend we remember the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan and in generations past. The Americans who have died while serving our country leave behind families, friends, communities, careers and dreams for the future. 
   They aren't numbers; they are true American heroes and we owe them thanks and gratitude forever. And we owe them the promise that we will never forget. 
   This Memorial Weekend, I also want to share a message for all those mourning the loss of relatives and friends in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. To the spouses - the children - the parents - friends: 
   Montanans and all Americans support you. We grieve with you and we thank you. 
   As Americans, we will work together as the future of these wars unfold. 
   And while we honor the fallen, we must also honor the thousands of men and women returning from war, wounded. Many of them need lifelong care to treat physical and psychological injuries. We will support our troops by giving them the resources they need to be successful overseas, and by giving them the resources they were promised after they come home. 
   Sharla and I ask that you join us in taking time out of your weekend to pay tribute to the fallen."
