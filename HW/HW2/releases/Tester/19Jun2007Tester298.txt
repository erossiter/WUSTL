SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL NEARLY $17 MILLION FOR MONTANA FISH, WILDLIFE AND LAND PROJECTS
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $16.62 million for Montana conservation projects as part of the fiscal year 2008 Interior Appropriations Bill. 
   The senators said that the appropriations bill passed the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee today and is expected to go before the full Appropriations Committee before the end of the week.
   "I am pleased that these important projects got these well deserved dollars," Baucus said. "Montana is an outdoor state. And these funds will help care for our public lands, parks, and wildlife for generations to come."
   "Hard work goes a long way in Washington and I'm glad to see it paying off," Tester said. "This money is about Montana values. It's about securing and improving public land for future generations, it's about clean water, healthy wildlife and better access to recreation. It's a privilege to bring Montana values back home."
   The fiscal year 2008 Interior Appropriations bill includes the following projects for Montana:
   * $4.5 million: Sun Ranch Land Acquisition: The Sun Ranch project, in Madison County, will consist of two contemplated conservation easement purchases. The easements will not only protect the ranch, they will also protect wildlife, and provide great access for hunters.
