SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $3 MILLION FOR NORTHERN CHEYENNE
  Members of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe are going to have access to better housing thanks to $3,214,470 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Montana's Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The funds will be used for a variety of affordable housing activities including constructing new homes, or acquiring existing homes and modernizing them.
   "Having a place to hang your hat and call home is the cornerstone of the American dream," Baucus said. "And these much deserved dollars will go a long way towards helping folks accomplish this dream."
   "Improving housing in Indian Country will lead to more opportunity, and more opportunity leads to good-paying jobs," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "This money will literally help build up the Northern Cheyenne Nation."
   The funds were distributed through the Indian Housing Block Grant program.
