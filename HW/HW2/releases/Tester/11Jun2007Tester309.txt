SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $42K FOR MONTANA TRIBES
  Each of Montana's seven federally recognized tribes will be able to improve their local libraries thanks to grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The IMLS will distribute $6,000 to each tribe and the funds will be used to support library staff.
   Each of the following tribes received awards:
   Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy's Reservation - Box Elder
   Blackfeet Tribe - Browning
   Crow Tribe of Montana - Crow Agency
   Fort Belknap Indian Community - Harlem
   Northern Cheyenne Tribe - Lame Deer
   Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes - Pablo
   Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation - Poplar
   "Education is the key to a strong economic future, and I want to make sure that every Montanan has access to every resource to get the best education possible," Baucus said. "And these dollars will go a long way towards keeping Montana's libraries second to none."
   "Better libraries will lead to bigger and better opportunities in Indian Country," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "This money will go a long way in improving educational resources and I look forward to seeing the good things it will bring to Montana's Indian communities."
   The funds were distributed through the Native American Library Services program.
