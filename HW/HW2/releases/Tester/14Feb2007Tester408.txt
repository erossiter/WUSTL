SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER PUSH FOR MONTANA BEEF IN SENATE DINING ROOM
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester have a beef with the U.S. Senate dinning room.  
   During a recent lunch meeting, Baucus and Tester noticed the Senate dinning room serves Japanese raised Kobe beef. 
   Puzzled, the two men today wrote to Robert Savidge, general manager of the United States Senate Dining Room, requesting that Montana beef served in the Senate dining room. 
   "We were puzzled that the United States Senate Dining Room featured Japanese beef instead of home-grown Montana Beef," wrote Baucus and Tester. 
   Baucus, who is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture committee, and Tester, a dry land grain farmer, said that Montana ranchers raise the highest quality, best tasting beef in the world and the Senate Dining Room would be a perfect venue to serve their products. 
   "Ranchers in our state raise the best beef around and we would like to see it showcased in the Senate Dining Room," wrote the Senators.
