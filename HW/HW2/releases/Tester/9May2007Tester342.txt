SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $14 MILLION FOR MONTANA TRIBES TO PROVIDE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HOUSING
  Four Montana Tribes are set to provide more quality affordable homes to people of modest means thanks to grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The grants will be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities, including building new homes, as well as buying, or remodeling existing homes. 
   "Having a place to call home is part of the American dream, and these dollars will help many Montanans achieve this dream," Baucus said. "These dollars are not only going towards homes, they are also going towards building up communities and neighborhoods across the Big Sky state." 
   "Building and improving homes is a critically important step toward bringing more hope to Indian Country," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Better places to live will lead to stronger communities, more opportunities and better health care for Montana's tribal nations." 
   The grants amounts are as follow: 
   * Blackfeet: $6,487,883 
   * Chippewa Cree: $1,865,862 
   * Fort Belknap: $2,463,851 
   * Salish-Kootenai: $4,197,051 
   The grants were distributed through the Indian Housing Block Grant Program.
