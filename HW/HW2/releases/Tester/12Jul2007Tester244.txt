FUNDING FOR CUSTER AVENUE INTERCHANGE CLEARS ANOTHER HURDLE
  Funding for one of Lewis and Clark County's busiest intersections cleared a another major hurdle by winning approval from the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The I-15/Custer Avenue Interchange is set to undergo a major reconstruction to help alleviate traffic and improve access for emergency vehicles. The project, being handled by the Montana Department of Transportation, will widen both Custer Avenue and Interstate 15.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved $1.5 million for the project. The funding cleared the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday.
   "This project one of our priorities and Max and Jon went to bat for it," said Jim Lynch, director of the Montana Department of Transportation. "This is good news for the people Helena and it's good news for anyone passing through."
   "This is an important project that will improve the infrastructure of our capital city and my hometown," Baucus said. "Jon and I will continue to work together to make sure important projects like this continue to get funded, bringing better paying jobs to Montana and making the Helena area a safer place to live."
   "The renovation and reconstruction to the Custer Avenue Interchange is an ambitious undertaking and one that will have lasting affects on the Queen City," Tester said. "I've spent a lot of time in Helena and traveled many miles on I-15. I know firsthand how critical this project is and that's why Max and I fought so hard for this funding."
   The THUD bill now goes to the full Senate for approval.
