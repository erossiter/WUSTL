SEN. TESTER COMMENTS ON FUTURE OF SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS ACT
  The Senate Energy Committee on Thursday, March 1, held a public lands subcommittee hearing to discuss the future of the Secure Rural Schools Act. Montana Sen. Jon Tester released the following statement in response to President Bush's proposal to eliminate Secure Rural Schools and provide one time funding to rural schools by selling off public land:  
   "Access to public land is a deep-rooted Montana value that sustains our outdoor traditions like hunting and fishing. I'm deeply concerned by the President's plan to sell-off our public lands it again shows a real disconnect between the administration and rural America. Montanans want more, not less, access to our public lands."
