SEN. TESTER: LEGISLATION WILL LEAD TO CLEANER AIR, MORE EFFICIENT APPLIANCES
  Montana Senator Jon Tester joined a bipartisan group of Senators cooking up legislation that will pay Montanans to use cleaner stoves, leading to better air quality and healthier homes. 
  The Clean Stove Act of 2008 would authorize a $500 tax credit to encourage home owners and consumers to replace conventional wood stoves and replace them with cleaner, EPA-certified wood, pellet or corn stoves.
  "This is a good incentive for Montanans to have healthier homes, cleaner air, lower heating costs, and it's going to be a boon for small business," Tester said. "When you take a common-sense idea like this and put some tax breaks behind it, it's a winner for everyone involved."
  Libby, Montana, has led the way over the past several years as Lincoln County, the State of Montana, the EPA and the stove industry partnered to replace old stoves. Since 2005 more than 1,000 stoves have been replaced. The northwest Montana town has since reported an almost 30% improvement in air quality.
  With record high home heating costs consumers can also help their checkbooks by taking advantage of the newer, more efficient stoves. The EPA certified stoves can run up to 50% more efficiently than the older stoves by burning less fuel for more heat.
  Tester's legislation will also be a win for the many small businesses in the hearth industry, which will benefit as more Americans choose to replace their conventional stoves. 
  It is estimated that there are at least 7.5 million old wood stoves still in use today across the U.S.
  The Clean Stove Act of 2008 was introduced by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. Other cosponsors are Senators Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo.
