SEN. TESTER: A 24-HOUR PORT WOULD BRING BENEFITS, JOBS TO MONTANA
  Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in response to a new report examining the status of the Port of Wild Horse north of Havre. Tester has sponsored legislation to turn the border crossing into a 24-hour, commercial port. 
   "This study shows very clearly that the Port of Wild Horse needs to be a 24-hour port. Increasing traffic through a 24-hour port by a third will bring real economic benefits and good-paying jobs to the Hi-Line. I look forward to sharing this information with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate as we continue to move this legislation forward."
