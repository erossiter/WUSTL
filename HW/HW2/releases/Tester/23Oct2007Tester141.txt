SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL FUNDS FOR MONTANA LABOR, HEALTH, EDUCATION PROJECTS
  Montana's U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that $7 million has been set aside for Montana projects as part of a 2008 spending bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill.
   The senators said the full Senate passed the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill today. The bill will now go before a joint committee to iron out the differences between the House and the Senate bills. 
   "These dollars will provide a real boost to our state's health care services and work force training programs," Baucus said. "I was proud to work together with Jon to help secure these funds for Montana."
   "This is great news for Montana's health care and employee training programs," Tester said. "I'll continue to work together with Max to get these funds passed by the Senate and delivered to the Big Sky state."
