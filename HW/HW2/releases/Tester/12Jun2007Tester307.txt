SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $85,000 FOR ROCKY BOY SCHOOL DISTRICT
  The Rocky Boy School District will get nearly $85,000 for student drug-testing programs, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   To qualify for the three-year, $84,762 grant, the Rocky Boy School District had to show a significant need for the drug-testing within a target population. The district, based in Box Elder, Mont., also had to provide a plan for referring and treating students identified as drug users, while keeping the entire process confidential. 
   "Drugs don't belong in our classroom, and this is one test no student should fail," Baucus said. "Education is the key to a strong economic future, and by eliminating drugs from schools, students will be able to propel our economy into the 21st Century."
   "This grant will empower the Rocky Boy's Nation with the resources needed to make sure drugs and education don't mix," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "A drug-free school system will lead to better education, better opportunities and stronger communities in Indian Country."
   "The Rocky Boy School District is intimately familiar with the destructive effect of drug use on students," said Superintendent Voyd St. Pierre. "We, along with the state and country, are working towards reducing the incidence of student drug use and abuse. Drug use and abuse by students also negatively influences the open and safe learning environment we work diligently to foster in our schools". 
   The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Education.
