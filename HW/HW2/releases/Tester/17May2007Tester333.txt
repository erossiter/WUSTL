SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $60K FOR MISSOULA
  Montana's humanities community is about to get a shot in the arm thanks to a $58,260 grant, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The funds will go the Montana Committee for the Humanities, which is based in Missoula. The dollars will go towards sponsoring the Open Book reading program, the Montana Festival of Books, as well as bringing in guest speakers. 
   "I'm very pleased that the Committee for the Humanities got these much deserved dollars," Baucus said. "Like the old saying goes, the more you know the more you grow, and these programs will really help all Montanans, young and old, expand their horizons." 
   "The humanities are a critical part of Montana culture," Tester said. "This money will strengthen our state by opening the door for more thinkers, writers, readers and historians." 
   The funds were distributed through the National Endowment For the Humanities.
