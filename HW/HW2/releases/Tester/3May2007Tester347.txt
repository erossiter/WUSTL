  Sen. Jon Tester today announced the opening of his eighth office in Montana. Sen. Jon Tester's Glendive office, at 122 West Towne Street, will serve the residents of Glendive, Dawson County and all of Eastern Montana.  
   "Our number one priority is to make sure Montanans have access to me and my staff we work for them," Tester said. "Being a third generation family farmer, I understand the concerns and the needs of folks in Eastern Montana and I hope that this office will allow them to get a hold of us."
