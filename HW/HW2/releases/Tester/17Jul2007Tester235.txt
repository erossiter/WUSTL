MONTANA SENATORS CAPTURE CRITICAL FUNDS FOR MONTANA RANCHERS
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that a key Senate panel today approved funding for predator control, which will protect Montana ranchers and landowners. 
   The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee green-lighted $1,324,000 for Wildlife Services to continue assisting property owners in addressing an increasing number of predators in Montana and two neighboring states.
   Baucus and Tester said that without these funds Wildlife Services would be forced to cut the number of employees supporting landowners and drastically cut the operational budget for aerial predator control operations.
   "Montana ranchers face many obstacles today. These dollars are going to undoubtedly prevent losses to their property," said Baucus, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Jon and I knew these funds would mean a great deal to the bottom-line for Montana producers. That's why we fought for them."
   "Production agriculture is in my blood and it's the number one industry in our state," Tester said. "This money will protect land and livelihoods. It was a priority for Max and me and we went to the mat to see it come through."
   The appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate Appropriations committee for consideration.
