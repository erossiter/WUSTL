SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE MONEY FOR ROCKY MOUNTAIN FRONT PRESERVATION
  Montana's prized Rocky Mountain Front will receive $1.25 million to acquire conservation easements along the pristine area under a plan announced today by a key Senate Committee. 
   Montana Senator's Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced the funding that will allow for the protection of the native habitats of a number of endangered plant and animal species. The dollars will help safeguard otherwise threatened species such as the piping plover, gray wolf, Canada lynx, bull trout, grizzly bear and slenderleaf moonwart.
   "The Front is one of Montana's crown jewels, and these much deserved dollars are an investment in the future" said Baucus, who passed legislation late 2006 that banned all new oil and gas development on the Front, forever. "By protecting the Front, and boosting agriculture, Montanans will be able to enjoy this great place for generations."
   "We need to do everything in our power to make sure that national treasures like the Front are protected, this is doing just that," Tester said. "I've spent my entire life on a piece of dirt in the plains of North Central Montana with the Rocky Mountain Front just miles from my farm. I've enjoyed it for generations and want to make sure that many more generations can do the same thing."
   Today's decision to fund the project now goes to the full Senate Appropriations Committee for approval.
