SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $910,000 FOR UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA
  The University of Montana will be able to make college more accessible and affordable for disadvantaged students, thanks to a grant announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded U.M. $419,199 in grants for scholarships for disadvantaged students. HHS also awarded a $490,000 grant to the university's Rural Institute, which provides services and outreach for people with developmental disabilities.
   "All Montanans, regardless of ability, have the right to pursue higher education," Baucus said. "These dollars will help make college affordable and accessible in Montana."
   "These grants will go a long way in making sure college is open and accessible to everyone," Tester said. "This money provides means and resources needed to give disadvantaged students in Montana the fair shake they deserve."
   The grants were awarded through the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities.
