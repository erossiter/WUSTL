SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL $5 MILLION FOR MONTANA WATER PROJECTS
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $5 million for water projects across the Big Sky state as part of the fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill.
   The funding bill passed the Senate Appropriations committee today and will now go before the full Senate for approval. 
   "All Montanans should have access to reliable, affordable water for drinking, cooking or irrigation - it's as simple as that," Baucus said. "I was proud to work together with Jon to help secure these funds for water projects all across our state."
   "It's not right that some folks in this day and age worry when they turn on the faucet about whether or not usable water will come out," Tester said. "That's why I worked with Max get these dollars and we'll keep working until every Montanan has access to clean water."
   The appropriations funding will be split amongst the following water projects:
   * Crow Tribe Water and Wastewater: This project will replace the 95-year old wastewater and water collection and treatment facilities.
   * Libby Cabinet Heights Wastewater: This project directly benefits all the residents of Cabinet Heights by eliminating inadequate sub-surface wastewater disposal systems. 
   * Ranch Water District, Bigfork: The current water system is 30 years old and worn, and there is imminent threat to illness. The improvements are necessary while keeping costs to low income users down.
   * Town of Medicine Lake: To make improvements to water system. 
   * County Water District of Billings Heights: Improve water system servicing the heights. 
   * Power Water System Improvements: The distribution system, constructed nearly 40 years ago, is undersized and does not provide sufficient flows and pressures during high demand periods. 
   * Seeley Lake Wastewater: The existing wastewater treatment system consists of a two-cell facultative lagoon system that discharges to the Madison River and to groundwater via infiltration ponds. 
   * Greater Woods Bay Wastewater: This project will have a direct and positive effect on the water quality of Flathead Lake by removing near-shore septic systems and replacing them with a community wastewater collection and treatment system that will reduce nutrients discharged into Flathead Lake by 80-90%. 
   * Basin Creek Reservoir, Butte: The Basin Creek Reservoir provides a substantial percentage of the Butte, MT, potable drinking water. 
   * Dayton Wastewater Collection and Treatment: The subsurface conditions in Dayton are unsuitable for on-site wastewater disposal. As a result, effluent discharge flows only through soil to the clay layer, then down gradient into Flathead Lake, resulting in environmental pollution. 
   * Phillipsburg Wastewater: First of three phases to upgrade the town's sewer system and wastewater facility for 568 service connections to meet 2011 permit limits.
   * Glasgow Wastewater: The wastewater treatment facility is 30 years old and serves 3,018 households. It has deficiencies in treatment and the lift station. The project will also help meet MPDES permit schedule 2010. 
   * Whitehall Wastewater: The existing wastewater treatment system discharges to Big Pipestone Creek, a tributary to the Jefferson River. Wastewater improvements are needed to protect stream water quality, prevent groundwater pollution, improve aquatic habitat, protect public health, and support economic development. 
   * Cut Bank Water System: The City of Cut Bank's water distribution system was constructed in 1914 and was constructed with galvanized and cast iron piping that is undersized and severely corroded. The distribution system leaks and requires frequent repairs. 
   * Hamilton Wastewater: The City of Hamilton has recently completed a comprehensive update to their Wastewater Facilities Plan, and has identified problems at their wastewater treatment plant and within their collection system that pose a threat to the City's ability to protect public health and the environment. 
   * Conrad Wastewater: The wastewater treatment facility is 35 years old, and it has a deficient aeration system. The facility needs to be upgraded to meet MPDES permits for nutrients, BOD, TSS, sludge management, and ammonia limits in 2011. 
   * Billings, West Wicks Lane Water & Sewer: Infrastructure improvements to accommodate planned growth. 
   * Port of Montana Water: The Port of Montana - Business Development District (PORT) currently does not support a potable water system.
