SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE SECURE OVER $16 MILLION FOR BOZEMAN
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester secured $10,741,438 in federal funding for Bozeman. The funding is included in a bipartisan overall funding bill working its way through Congress.  
   The nearly $16.5 million dollars headed to Bozeman will be invested in education, scientific research, agriculture, and infrastructure, Baucus and Tester said. The measure includes funding for new emergency vehicles for Gallatin County and nearly $200,000 for grants for local law enforcement agencies.
   The projects for Bozeman break down as follows:
   $547,143 for the Barley for Rural Development project. This project allows MSU researchers to find and use high-quality barley for malt, feed, food and ethanol. 
   $148,950 for the Montana Sheep Institute. This project will research the role of sheep and goat grazing as means of controlling the spread non-native weeds. 
   $1,869,819 to build MSU's Animal Bioscience Research Facility, which will boost the quality of Montana seedstock and the commercial livestock industry. 
   $983,070 for the Joe Skeen Institute at MSU, which will go toward restoring, sustaining and improving the health of Montana's rangelands. 
   $148,950 for the Montana Sustainable Beef Network to boost Montana's $900 million-per-year beef industry. 
   $465,717 for the Ruminant Nutrition Consortium 
   $219,453 for MSU's Wool Research program 
   $277,300 for a mobile communications command vehicle and a special response vehicle will allow Gallatin County first responders to respond more quickly and efficiently to emergencies. 
   $188,000 in grants for local law enforcment 
   $5,904,000 for MSU's Center for Zero Emissions Research & Technology which is focused on developing zero emissions coal 
   $500,000 for MSU's TechRanch 
   $200,000 for Montana Manufacturing Extension Center 
   $4,429,800 for the Sun Ranch Land Acquisition Project consists of two conservation easement purchases to protect a critical habitat for Montana wildlife and preserve and guarantee hunting access 
   "If a project brings good-paying jobs and opportunities to Montana you can bet it'll have my support and that's exactly what these do," Baucus said. "Jon and I fought hard to make sure that funding that'll continue to make Bozeman a great place to live was delivered. And I'm happy to say that we had some success."
   "Max and I fought hard to make sure that there was funding for Bozeman, whether it's the first-rate research being done at MSU, protecting our Montana way of life, or bringing good paying jobs to our state," Tester said. "These projects are good for Bozeman and they're good for Montana's biggest industry-agriculture."
   The House passed the funding measure late last night. The Senate is expected to vote today on the legislation, which sets aside nearly $112 million for Montana projects. The overall bill will then go to President Bush.
   President Bush has already signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, which sets aside nearly $31 million for military research and development projects across Montana.
