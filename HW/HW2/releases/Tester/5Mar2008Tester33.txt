SEN. TESTER NAMES NEW COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR
  Senator Jon Tester today named Patrick Devlin as his new Communications Director. 
   Devlin brings nearly 20 years of experience as a legislative communications specialist to Tester's office. For the past eleven years Devlin served as Legislative Director for Rep. Bob Etheridge, a North Carolina farmer and Chairman of the U.S. House Agriculture Commodities Subcommittee.
   "I'm pleased to add another dedicated public servant to the team," Tester said. "Pat's many years of professional experience in public policy and his impressive record in legislative communications will serve Montana well as my staff and I work every day to address the needs and concerns of all Montanans."
   After attending Carroll College in Helena, Mont., Devlin graduated from Virginia Tech in 1989, earning a B.A. in Political Science.
   Devlin began his Congressional career as personal assistant to the late Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., while Aspin served as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Devlin also served in various capacities for Reps. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn., Jim Chapman, D-Texas, and Rick Boucher, D-Va.
   "With 11 years under his belt working for another farmer in Congress, Pat understands that rural America is full of honest, hard-working folks who want their leaders to do right by working families," Tester said.
   Devlin will begin working from Tester's Washington office on March 10.
