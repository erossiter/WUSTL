SENATORS ANNOUNCE $669,000 GRANT FOR HYSHAM WATER PROJECT
  The City of Hysham will receive nearly $670,000 from the USDA to improve the city's water plant, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   The $669,000 grant comes from the USDA's Office of Rural Development. The City of Hysham will use the money to replace deteriorated water filter tanks that can no longer be repaired. 
   "I'm pleased that the folks in Hysham and Treasure County got these funds," Baucus said. "With a hot dry summer just around the corner, these dollars are much needed." 
   "In Eastern Montana, water is more precious than gold," Tester said. "And for a region struck by years of drought and low water levels, this money couldn't come at a better time." 
   The City of Hysham has bid the project twice but costs exceeded the budget. The City requested the USDA grant, citing a need to improve the community's only source of water.
