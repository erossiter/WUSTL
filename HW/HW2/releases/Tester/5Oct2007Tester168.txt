SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $50,000 FOR LOCKWOOD FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Just in time for Fire Prevention Week, the Lockwood Rural Fire Department is getting a big boost from the federal government, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is awarding the department a $54,374 grant through its Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The program is designed to improve emergency response and to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public from fires and other hazards.
   The Lockwood Fire Department will use the money to purchase new vehicle extrication equipment, wildland firefighting equipment, flooding pumps, generators and new fire hose.
   "Helping strengthen a fire department so it can better serve a community like Lockwood is an important investment of federal dollars," Baucus said. "And a stronger fire department is going to make Lockwood a safer place to live."
   "A fire department is usually a community's first line of defense against disasters like fires," said Tester. "Making sure that a place like Lockwood has the resources it needs is critically important and I look forward to seeing this money go to work."
   National Fire Prevention Week begins this Sunday, October 7 and goes through October 13. Firefighting agencies nationwide will encourage all Americans to check their smoke detectors and plan escape routes.
   The $54,374 grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
