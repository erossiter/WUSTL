SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE ALMOST $4 MILLION FOR SWAN VALLEY LAND ACQUISITION
  Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced that $3.92 has been approved to protect public lands in the Swan Valley. 
   Due to increasing land values, private forestland parcels in the Swan Valley are at risk of conversion to both subdivision and development. Many parcels are intermingled with public forestland ownership in the Flathead National Forest and have provided for forest products, public recreation, and important wildlife and fisheries habitat. 
   "We applaud Senators Baucus and Tester for their efforts to secure critically-needed funding for the Swan Valley Ecosystem," said Eric Love, Northern Rockies Program Director for The Trust for Public Land. "The funds, provided through the Federal Forest Legacy Program, are another big step forward in protecting forestland resources that provide important wildlife and fisheries habitat as well as public recreation opportunities for Montanans to enjoy." 
   "Protecting Montanans' access to our public lands is one of my top priorities," Baucus said. "Jon and I worked hard to secure these funds so we can continue to expand access to public lands."
   "The Swan Valley is truly a Montana treasure," said Tester. "Whether it's the folks that make their living in the woods, the families that fish and camp there, or the wildlife that calls the Swan home, these dollars will help preserve that way of life."
   The $3.92 million was approved today by the Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee; the full Appropriations Committee is slated to take up the measure Thursday.
