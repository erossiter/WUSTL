SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER: $140 MILLION 'IN MAIL' FOR NEW MALMSTROM HOUSING
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced that $140 million is on the way to Malmstrom Air Force Base to build hundreds of new family housing units on base. 
  Both senators secured funding for the project last year to accommodate the growing needs of military families and personnel stationed at the base. The $140.3 million will fund 382 new housing units at the Great Falls airbase.
  The money was tied up for several months because the overall housing project has been redesigned. But both Baucus and Tester received word that the U.S. Air Force is finally releasing the money.
  "The check is in the mail for Malmstrom," Baucus said. "This is good news for Malmstrom and great news for Great Falls. It will give the economy a boost by providing new good-paying jobs and development in the Electric City."
  "This money is going to go a long way at the right time for Malmstrom and Great Falls," Tester said. "It's a smart investment for the Air Force because it's an investment in both people and infrastructure at Malmstrom."
  The overall project will be subdivided into six smaller projects to ensure that smaller contractors in the area are able to compete for contracts.
