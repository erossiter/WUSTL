SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR HELENA MUSEUM
  Artwork in Montana will be better preserved for future generations thanks to a grant announced today by Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester. The Holter Museum of Art was awarded $39,000 in a Conservation Project Support grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.  
   The Holter Museum of Art, a contemporary art museum in Helena, will use the grant to install a moving panel storage system in the museum's main collection that will eventually house 127 paintings, 100 framed works on paper, and 18 mixed media works. 
   "The Holters are great friends and for twenty years the Holter Museum has been a cultural bright spot in my hometown," Baucus said. "I'm very pleased that they got these dollars so folks not only from the Queen City, but from all over Montana, can experience Montana's proud art tradition." 
   "Whether it was the work Charlie Russell was doing a hundred years ago or the work being done today, Montana has always been home to some of the world's most talented artists," Tester said. "I couldn't be happier that the folks at the Holter Museum are receiving this money and I can't wait to get over there to see it put to work." 
   The museum is located at 12 E. Lawrence Street.
