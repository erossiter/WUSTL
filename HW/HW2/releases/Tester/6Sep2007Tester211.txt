SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $150K FOR STONE CHILD COLLEGE LIBRARY
  The Chippewa Cree Indians of Rocky Boy's Reservation will see great improvements to their library facilities thanks to a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   Stone Child College, at Rocky Boy Agency, will use the awarded funds to increase their library's collection, add additional computer workstations, and develop training classes to expand and improve Internet usage on the reservation. The grant will also help support a summer youth literacy club, said Baucus and Tester.
   "These dollars are going to expand educational opportunities for both the young and the old," said Baucus. "I look forward to visiting my friends on the Rocky Boy's Reservation and seeing these funds put to good work."
   "We need to expand opportunities and restore hope in Indian Country. Programs like this do just that," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "As a neighbor of the Rocky Boy's Reservation and a former teacher, I'm thrilled to see this funding coming to North-Central Montana."
   The funds were distributed by the Institute of Museum and Library Services through the Native American Library Services program.
