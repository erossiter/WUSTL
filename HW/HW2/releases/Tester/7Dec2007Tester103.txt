SEN. TESTER: WASHINGTON REPUBLICANS THREW WRENCH INTO ENERGY BILL
  Senator Jon Tester, a member of the Senate Energy Committee, today released the following statement after Republicans in the U.S. Senate blocked the 2007 Energy Bill: 
   "At this rate I'd be surprised if Senate Republicans even voted yes to naming a post office. With $3.25 gas and record home heating prices, I don't know why anybody would want to throw a wrench into this Energy Bill. It would have opened the door to jobs and development in Montana while taking big steps to slow global warming. And it would have led to more renewable fuel created here at home. Every gallon of fuel we make is a gallon we don't have to get from the Middle East."
