SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE GRANTS FOR MONTANA FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced that four fire departments will receive thousands of dollars in grants from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  
   The grants come from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program. The AFG Program regularly awards grants to fire departments and emergency medical service organizations across the country to help those agencies purchase equipment, vehicles, protective gear and training programs. 
   The grants awarded to Montana fire departments will go to: 
   * Baker Volunteer Fire District: $53,200 
   * Fort Benton Rural Fire District: $5,966 
   * Vaughn Volunteer Fire Department: $15,913 
   * Manhattan Fire Department: $21,249 
   "I commend our Montana firefighters for the great job they do each and every day," Baucus said. "These dollars will help ensure our firefighters have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs efficiently and effectively." 
   "This is the sort of critical funding our rural communities need to keep all Montanans, no matter where they live, safe," Tester said. "We all benefit when our emergency responders have the equipment and training they need." 
   The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training has administered the AFG Program with help from the U.S. Fire Administration since 2001. Congress has authorized funding for the program through 2010.
