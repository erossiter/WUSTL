SEN. TESTER RESPONSE TO HOUSE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM VOTE
  Sen. Jon Tester today released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives fell short of the 2/3 majority needed to override President Bush's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP previously passed the Senate with bipartisan veto-proof majority. A CBS News Poll released today shows 81% of Americans support the program. 
   "Like a vast majority of Montanans, I just don't understand why President Bush and many Republicans in Congress don't consider health care for children a national priority. It's a shame they're putting millions of kids at risk while they play partisan politics with CHIP. I'll stand with Max Baucus as he leads the fight to make sure millions of children get the health care they deserve."
