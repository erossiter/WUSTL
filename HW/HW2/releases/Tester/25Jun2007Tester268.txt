SEN. TESTER WELCOMES BARRASSO TO THE SENATE
  Today at 3:15 p.m. EST, Dr. John Barrasso was sworn in to fill the senate seat of the late Sen. Craig Thomas, who passed away on June 5. Sen. Jon Tester released the following statement: 
  "No one needs to tell Sen. Barrasso that he's got some big boots to fill. I know he's eager to roll up his sleeves and get to work for the Cowboy State.
  The nearly 400 miles of border between Wyoming and Montana doesn't amount to much, because our states have so much in common. We share a Western ethic of hard work, common sense, respect for the land and respect for our neighbors.
  As a colleague and as a neighbor, I welcome Sen. Barrasso to the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to working with him in bringing these Montana and Wyoming values to Washington."
