SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $1 MILLION FOR MONTANA STATE
  Montana State University's research department is getting a little help from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   MSU will receive from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:
   A $213,750 grant to research the development of toxoplasma, which can cause inflammation in the brain and affect the heart, liver and eyes. The effects of toxoplasma are only felt by pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. 
   A $510,077 grant to allow researchers to continue developing software that will allow investigators to annotate, collaborate and share the data they collect. 
   MSU will receive from the National Science Foundation: 
   A $206,752 grant to study microorganisms. Researchers will see if the microorganisms are capable of metabolism in glacier ice. The research will take place in the McMurdo Dry Valley in Antarctica. 
   A $235,388 grant to allow researchers will observe plankton dynamics during the transition to polar night. This research will also take place at the Palmer Station in the McMurdo Dry Valley in Antarctica. 
   "Scientific research done at Montana State benefits all of Montana by providing good-paying jobs and national prestige," said Baucus. "I am proud to announce these dollars because they will help advance our understanding of important aspects of science." 
   "Montana State is already a national leader when it comes to groundbreaking scientific research," Tester said. "This money will help make MSU an even bigger player in the science community, and in the process it will go a long way in finding solutions to some very pressing medical problems."
