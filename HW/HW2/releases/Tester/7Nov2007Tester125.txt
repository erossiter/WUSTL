SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER URGE PRESIDENT TO APPROVE $280,000 FOR FLATHEAD VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today urged President Bush to sign a bill that sets aside $280,000 for Kalispell's Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC). 
   The money is part of the final Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the Senate and the House and is now headed to President Bush's desk. Both Baucus and Tester requested funding for the college earlier this year.
   The $280,000 will go to FVCC's Center for Community Entrepreneurship Education. The money will help expand FVCC's current one-year Certificate in Entrepreneurship to a two-year, transferable degree. FVCC students have the option of taking the classes online and can choose from courses in business planning, marketing, economics, accounting, software, human relations and communications.
   "This money will help pave the way for success for all folks looking to start their own small businesses in Montana," Baucus said. "This funding will go a long way to help Flathead Valley Community College train our state's future entrepreneurs."
   "As a lifelong farmer I know a thing or two about small business, and any project that makes small businesses in Montana stronger has my full support," said Tester, a member of the Senate Small Business Committee. "That's why I worked so closely with Max to shepherd this funding through Congress."
   According to the Montana Department of Labor, 80% of businesses in Flathead County have 10 employees or less, further reinforcing the need for training in small business.
