$600,000 GRANT TO LAUNCH FIRST-EVER RESEARCH PROGRAM IN MONTANA
  The University of Montana will launch the country's first research program specializing in trauma among American Indian children, thanks to a grant announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded UM $600,000 for the National Native Children's Trauma Center.
   The Center is a partnership with the Rocky Boy, Blackfeet and Flathead reservations. The research done on those reservations will benefit American Indian children all over the country. The aim of the Center is to develop culturally appropriate school-based mental health intervention programs. 
   "Helping reduce mental illness among American Indian kids across Montana is a great investment of federal dollars," Baucus said. "This program will make Montana a leader in this kind of research, and it will serve children all over the United States." 
   "This money will go a long way to make sure our Indian nations are healthy, prosperous places to grow up," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "It is a great thing that children across the country will benefit from research done here at home."
   The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
