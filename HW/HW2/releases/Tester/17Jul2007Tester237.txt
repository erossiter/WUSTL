SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE FUNDING FOR BRUCELLOSIS RESEARCH
  Montana's U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today successfully secured funding for brucellosis research, which will go towards protecting and sustaining the existing free-ranging elk and bison populations in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) and the livestock industry in the Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. 
   Brucellosis is a devastating communicable disease that causes abortion of calves through infection. It is present in wildlife in Yellowstone National Park. It is essential that Montana retains its Brucella-free status. Montana is working together with other states on novel vaccines, vaccine delivery systems, and preventive research to eliminate brucellosis infections.
   Baucus and Tester worked to secure $929,000, which will be used for brucellosis research in Montana, Idaho and Wyo. The funding was included in the fiscal year 2008 Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill, which passed the subcommittee today. The bill is expected to go before the full Appropriations Committee within the next week.
   "Agriculture is the backbone of our state's economy and I'm going to do all I can to make sure it stays that way," Baucus said. "That's why Jon and I worked so hard to secure these dollars. We want to keep our cattle safe from this devastating disease."
   "As a Montana farmer, I know how destructive brucellosis is," said Tester, a third generation Montana farmer. "Montana is proud of its brucellosis-free status and we want to make sure we keep it. That's why Max and I worked together to secure this funding."
   Errol Rice, Executive Vice President of the Montana Stockgrowers Association was pleased with today's news.
   "We appreciate Senator Baucus' and Senator Tester's efforts to secure funding for brucellosis eradication and mitigating brucellosis' effects upon Montana cattle producers," said Rice. "This is extremely important for Montana ranchers."
