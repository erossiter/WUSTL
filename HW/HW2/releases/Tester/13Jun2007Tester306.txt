SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER HAIL FUNDS FOR MONTANA MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
  Montana's Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced $14.6 million for Montana military projects as part of the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. 
   "This is great news for Montana's military assets," Baucus said. "It's more important than ever that our top-notch military continues to receive the resources needed to serve and protect our country. That's why I was pleased to help ensure that Montana's military men and women receive the funding they need to do their jobs." 
   "This is a great start for Montana, and it's an investment that will make us stronger and safer," Tester said. "It's an honor for me to fight for projects that make Malmstrom a better place to live and work, and for projects that will help train our troops to remain the very best in the world."
   Baucus and Tester said the fiscal year 2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill includes funds for the following Montana projects:
   * $7 million: Community Activity Center at Malmstrom Air Force Base - Great Falls: The funding will be used to construct a new Community Activity Center, which will provide recreational activities that promote family well-being and enhance mental and physical fitness. The center will also provide a wing with a conference center for large and small groups. It will provide kitchen capabilities to cater functions anywhere on base. Currently, Malmstrom AFB does not have a CAC; it was closed in 1994 due to base space shortages.
   * $7.629 million: Army Reserve Center - Butte: The money will be used for land acquisition, construction of an ARC Training building, Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS), unheated storage building, and organizational parking.
   The senators said that the appropriations bill passed the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee today and is expected to go before the full Appropriations Committee before the end of the week.
