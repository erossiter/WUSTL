SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $500K FOR MONTANA
  Communities across Montana are going to be ganging up to help end youth violence, and protect victims of domestic violence thanks to $500,002 in grants, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The funds will be given to Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) programs, and to a domestic violence safe house.
   $95,002 for Browning: The funds will be given to the G.R.E.A.T. program on the Blackfeet reservation to help train officers to work with elementary and middle school students to warn about the dangers of gang violence. 
   $150,000 for Harlem: The funds will be given to the G.R.E.A.T. program on the Fort Belknap reservation to also help elementary and middle school students avoid gang violence. 
   $255,000 for Glendive: The funds will be used to help victims of domestic violence find permanent housing, including providing services such as transportation, counseling, child care, and helping with rental payments.
   "Kids belong in sports uniforms or drama costumes, not in gang colors, and these dollars will help to get kids off the street and into the classroom," Baucus said. "Unfortunately there will still be violence in our communities, and we need to make sure that victims have an oasis in the storm, and these grants will help make that happen."
   "No ten year old should be getting jumped into a gang, and we need to make sure they know there are better choices in life," Tester said. "And these funds will not only help prevent youth violence, it will also help those who have been victimized by acts of heinous violence."
   The funds were distributed through the Department of Justice.
