BAD NEWS FOR PREDATORS, GOOD NEWS FOR MONTANA RANCHERS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved more than $1 million to control predators on Montana's farms and ranches, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced today. 
   The Committee approved the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which includes $1,324,000 for Wildlife Services to continue assisting property owners with an increasing number of predators across Montana.
   Baucus and Tester said that without these funds Wildlife Services would be forced to cut employees who support landowners and drastically cut the operational budget for aerial predator control operations.
   "Montana ranchers face many obstacles today. These dollars are going to undoubtedly prevent losses to their property," said Baucus, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "Jon and I knew these funds would mean a great deal to the bottom-line for Montana producers. That's why we fought for them."
   "Production agriculture is in my blood and it's the number one industry in our state," Tester said. "This money will protect land and livelihoods. It was a priority for Max and me and we went to the mat to see it come through."
   The appropriations bill now goes before the full Senate for consideration.
