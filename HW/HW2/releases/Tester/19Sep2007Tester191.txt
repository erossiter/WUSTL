COUNSELING MONEY HEADED TO FORT PECK
  Innovative counseling for victims of crime will now be possible on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, thanks to a grant announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. 
  The $25,000 grant will provide support for a partnership between faith-based organizations, spiritual leaders, traditional healers and victim service programs. 
  "Counseling programs are essential for victims of crime," Baucus said. "Bringing people together, whether they are faith-based, spiritual, or traditional counselors, will be a great benefit to the Fort Peck Reservation."
  "The availability of a variety of types of counseling will allow folks to choose the kind of counseling they are most comfortable with," said Tester, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. "Providing options for those who have been victims of crime is a good investment of federal dollars."
  The 25,000 grant will come from the U.S. Department of Justice.
