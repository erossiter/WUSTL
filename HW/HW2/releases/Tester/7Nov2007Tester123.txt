SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER URGE PRESIDENT TO APPROVE NEARLY $200,000 FOR DEER LODGE, TWIN BRIDGES
  Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today urged President Bush to sign a bill that sets aside $180,000 to improve health care in Deer Lodge and education across Montana. 
   The money is part of the final Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill, which has passed both the Senate and the House and is now headed to President Bush's desk. Both Baucus and Tester requested funding for the projects earlier this year.
   The final appropriations bill passed by Congress includes:
   * $80,000 for the Northern Rockies Educational Service, based in Twin Bridges. The organization will help schools across the state implement the Taking Technology to the Classroom project, which helps Montana K-12 teachers better integrate technology into their classrooms. 
   * $100,000 for the Powell County Memorial Hospital in Deer Lodge. The hospital will use the money to upgrade its emergency room equipment and purchase new diagnostic computer programs. 
   "It's been incredibly difficult for our medical personnel in Deer Lodge to do their work with outdated equipment. This is going to make a significant difference," said Powell County Planner Ron Hanson, who noted that the Deer Lodge emergency room stays busy because of traffic along Interstate 90. "My thanks to Max and Jon for working hard to get this funding through Congress."
   "Working hard to get funding for things like education and good health care in Montana is something Jon and I take very seriously," Baucus said. "These are good projects and I look forward to seeing them go to work for the Big Sky State."
   "Making sure all rural communities have the same access to quality health care and education are top priorities for Max and me," Tester said. "That's why we worked closely together and with folks on the ground to get these dollars to Montana."
