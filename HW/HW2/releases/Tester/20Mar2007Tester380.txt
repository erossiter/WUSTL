SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE NEARLY $1 MILLION FOR RANGELAND RESTORATION
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced that $990,000 has been recovered for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Restoration at Montana State University.  
   The funds were lost when Congress didn't fund specific projects, also known as earmarks, in the fiscal year 2007 spending bill earlier this year. 
   Baucus and Tester set out to secure the dollars directly from the federal government, lobbying agency officials. Both men personally lobbied for the MSU funds. 
   "Research has become a pivotal component to agriculture in Montana," Baucus said. "That's why Jon and I fought to secure these dollars - so we can continue to move the ball forward for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities and be good stewards of the land at the same time." 
   "The work going on at the Joe Skeen Institute is critical to family farm and ranch agriculture," Tester said. "Sen. Baucus and I worked hard to make sure the folks at MSU can continue to find new ways to make Montana's rangeland and livestock sustainable for generations to come." 
   "The university is very pleased to have this support and grateful for the support of our Congressional Delegation," said Cathy Conover, spokeswoman for Montana State University. "These are worthy projects that certainly deserve the additional funding." 
   The institute's mission is to conduct research and education programs for the purposes of facilitating and expanding ongoing state-federal range management, animal husbandry, and agricultural research, education, and extension programs that enhance sustainable rangeland, livestock, and associated natural resources management systems to meet emerging and future needs of the western United States. 
   The Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Restoration program at Montana State University is a consortium of three institutions: Montana State University, New Mexico State University, and Texas A&M University.
