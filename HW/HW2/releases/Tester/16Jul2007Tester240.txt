  New innovative treatments for deadly diseases could be just around the corner thanks to a $2,122,257 grant for the University of Montana from the Department of Health and Human Services, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The grant will allow the University of Montana's Center for Environmental Health Science to expand research on environmental impacts on human health.
   "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," Baucus said. "And with these well-deserved funds, the Center for Environment Health Sciences can find ways for Montanans to live happier, healthier lives."
   "Whether it's the air we breathe, or the water we drink, the environment is critical to our health," Tester said. "And this grant will help us better understand how the world we live in affects the lives we lead."
   The grant was distributed through the National Center for Research Resources.
