SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MONEY FOR MONTANA CO-OPS
  Montana's co-ops are getting a little help, thanks to two grants announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester.  
  The Montana Cooperative Development Center, based in Great Falls, will receive $200,000 to aid in promoting and developing cooperatives to meet the economic and community needs of rural Montana. The Center works specifically to provide technical assistance to small, rural cooperatives.
  $75,240 will go to the Lake County Community Development Corporation to be used to continue funding the Mission Mountain Cooperative Development Center. The Center provides economic development resources for co-ops throughout Western Montana.
  "Rural cooperatives are an excellent way to maximize resources," said Baucus, who hosted his annual Economic Development Summit earlier this year in Butte. "Providing resources and technical assistance is one way to ensure the success of small cooperatives."
  "Cooperatives are a proven method in strengthening our economy, bringing good-paying jobs to our state, and making our communities better places to raise families," Tester said. "Helping folks work together in Great Falls and Lake County benefits everyone in Montana."
  The two grants will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
