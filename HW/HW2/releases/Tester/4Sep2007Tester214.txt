MSU-NORTHERN TO RECEIVE MORE THAN $500,000 FOR VETERANS UPWARD BOUND
  Montana State University-Northern students who served in the military are about to get a boost from the federal government, Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The U.S. Department of Education has awarded the Havre campus $542,529 for its Veterans Upward Bound program.
   Veterans Upward Bound provides services such as career counseling, academic advice, refresher courses and other opportunities for military veterans who pursue higher education.
   "The men and women who serve our country deserve a smooth transition when they decide to go to college," Baucus said. "The Veterans Upward Bound program will help a lot of Montanans in Havre and across Montana, giving them the resources they need to be successful in the future."
   "We owe our nation's vets a heck of lot. They deserve anything we can do to help them get the most out of college," said Tester, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. "Our vets fight for our country and for our freedom. It's an honor for us to fight for their success after they come home."
   There are currently 39 Veterans Upward Bound programs nationwide.
