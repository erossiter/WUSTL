SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE $75K GRANT TO JOB PLACEMENT PROGRAM
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester on Monday, Feb. 12, praised the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation for awarding $75,000 to Easter Seals-Goodwill Northern Rocky Mountain, allowing the organization to continue its alternative staffing program  
   Easter Seals-Goodwill Northern Rocky Mountain is based in Great Falls, Mont., and is affiliated with Easter Seals and Goodwill International. 
   "It's great to see these funds coming to Montana and I applaud the Mott Foundation for their efforts," Tester said. "This program gives those struggling to find employment the life skills that they need to do so and increases their wages once placed-all of this bodes well for Great Falls and Montana." 
   "My number one priority is to boost our state's economy and create more good-paying jobs," Baucus said. "This grant funding will help workers get back on their feet by getting the training and tools they need to find success in the work force." 
   This grant was distributed through the Charles S. Mott Foundation and will allow Easter Seals-Goodwill Northern Rocky Mountain to provide temporary employment for disadvantaged jobseekers while teaching them the skills necessary to find full-time employment.
