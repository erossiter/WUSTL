SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $300,000 FOR MONTANA STATE
  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester on Tuesday, Feb. 27, praised the Department of Homeland Security for awarding $315,326 to Montana State University to help improve emergency communication in rural areas.  
   The grant will be used to study the possibility of using mobile communication networks to help emergency first responders communicate with each other. 
   "Montana is a big state, with a lot of open space, and it's vital that our first responders can communicate with each other," said Baucus. "When first responders get called, it can mean life or death, and I'm pleased that Montana State got these dollars to figure out the best way for these folks to communicate with each other." 
   "I've spent my entire life in rural Montana and I know the difficulties and importance of communication between emergency responders," Tester said. "This grant will allow the folks at MSU to study and develop technology that will truly make communities safer." 
   The project will study possible technology to help first responders communicate in large, sparsely populated areas that have no communication infrastructure and difficult terrain.
