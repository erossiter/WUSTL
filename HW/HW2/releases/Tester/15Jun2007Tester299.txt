SENATORS: UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA TO RECEIVE $200,000 TO DEVELOP NEW PHYSICAL THERAPY EQUIPMENT
  Researchers at the University of Montana are getting a leg up in their quest to develop a new elliptical trainer to better suit physical therapy patients, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The three-year, $199,996 grant comes from the Disability and Rehabilitation Research Projects Program. UM researchers will use the money to develop a prototype of an affordable, Intelligently Controlled Assistive Rehabilitation Elliptical (ICARE) trainer to help physically challenged people regain their walking ability and physical fitness.
   Currently, most elliptical trainers do not accommodate users who suffer from weakness or joint pain.
   "The University of Montana is a symbol of excellence, and these dollars will only enhance their reputation for innovation and success," Baucus said. "And by creating this new trainer, potentially millions of people's lives will be enriched, it's a win-win."
   "This is an innovative idea that will improve lives and livelihoods for folks all across the world," Tester said. "This money will go a long way toward providing more opportunities for people with physical challenges, and I'm proud of the University of Montana for taking a lead role."
   The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Education.
