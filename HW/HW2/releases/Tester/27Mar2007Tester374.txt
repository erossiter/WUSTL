SENATORS ANNOUNCE $19,000 GRANT FOR SOUTHWEST MONTANA FIRE DISTRICT
  The Gallatin Canyon Consolidated Rural Fire District in Big Sky, Mont., is about to get a new radio repeater thanks to a federal grant, Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced this week.  
   The $19,000 grant comes from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program. The Gallatin Canyon Consolidated Rural Fire District's new repeater will improve radio communications between emergency crews in and around Big Sky. 
   "In an extraordinarily mountainous place like Big Sky, communications are always a great challenge," said Fire Chief Jason Revisky. "This grant is a really good thing for emergency services in our area." 
   The AFG Program regularly awards grants to fire departments and emergency medical service organizations across the country to help those agencies purchase equipment, vehicles, protective gear and training programs. 
   The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Grants and Training has administered the AFG Program with help from the U.S. Fire Administration since 2001.
