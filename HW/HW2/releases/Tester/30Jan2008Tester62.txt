SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE NEARLY $53,000 TO PROMOTE INTEREST IN LABORATORY SCIENCE
  High school students from the Missoula area and undergraduate students at The University of Montana are about to get a hands-on research opportunity thanks to a grant announced today by Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester.  
  The Center for Environmental Health Sciences at The University of Montana is receiving a $52,998 grant. The money will be used to fund a summer school project called "STEER: Summer Training Experiences in Environmental Research."
  Missoula-area high school students and UM undergraduate students are eligible to apply for the summer program. The program comes with a stipend and the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in one of the University of Montana's state-of-the art sciences laboratories. The STEER program is designed to get more students interested in environmental health sciences and provide them with training associated with the culture of lab-based science. 
  "Any program that allows students to gain hands-on experience in a laboratory is one that I am pleased to announce," Baucus said. "Promoting science to high school students is something that deserves federal funding."
  "Getting students interested in careers in environmental health is important to our future," said Tester. "And inspiring a new generation of scientists will benefit our state tremendously."
  The grant will be awarded by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.
