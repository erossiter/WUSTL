SEN. TESTER HIGHLIGHTS KEY COMPONENTS OF ENERGY BILL
  Innovative biofuels. Renewable Energy. "Clean and green" coal development. More energy efficient buildings. They're just some of Sen. Jon Tester's priorities in the 2007 Energy Bill, which is up for debate this week on Capitol Hill. 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Tester is taking a lead role in the energy debate. He outlined some of his priorities today during a conference call with Montana reporters.
   "The Energy Bill boils down to national security, better job opportunities in Montana, cleaner air and a sustainable future," Tester said. "There's no silver bullet to lower gas and energy prices, but there's a lot of options out there for the long term."
   Some of the major components of the 2007 Energy Bill include:
   * Biofuels: Tester is pushing for a much larger future for agricultural biofuels such as oilseed (biodiesel) and cellulosic ethanol. The 2007 Energy Bill gives an enormous boost to clean, renewable biofuel production by providing funding for research, technology and infrastructure. 
   * Renewable Energy: Tester supports including a national Renewable Electricity Standard in the Energy Bill that would require utilities to purchase 15 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power by the year 2020. 
   * 'Clean and Green' Coal: Tester supports "clean and green" development of Montana's vast coal reserves. The 2007 Energy Bill expands research and technology to capture and sequester carbon emissions caused by coal-powered energy production. 
   * Energy Efficiency: The 2007 Energy Bill will promote more efficient lighting, heating and cooling, and energy storage in public buildings. 
   The Senate is expected to debate the 2007 Energy Bill for the next two weeks. Last night senators voted unanimously (91-0) to begin debating the legislation.
