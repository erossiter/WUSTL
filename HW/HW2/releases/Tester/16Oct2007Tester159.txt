SENATE APPROVES NEW CRIMINAL TRACKING PROGRAM IN MONTANA
  The U.S. Senate voted today for a new system to keeping track of offenders who live in all corners of the Montana. 
   Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester requested $500,000 for the program as part of the 2008 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Bill. The Senate approved the measure today. 
   The program, called the Montana Offender Notification and Tracking System (MONTS), will track offenders using GPS technology. The project will be run by the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.
   "A little technology goes a long way when tracking offenders across the fourth-largest state in the country," said Bill Slaughter, former director of the Montana Department of Corrections and a lifetime member of the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. "Max and Jon have helped make a big and very important investment for Montana."
   MONTS focuses especially on rural Montana, where electronic monitoring has previously been unreliable. The system also notifies neighbors when offenders move to new communities.
   "We need the best technology available to keep tabs on our rural communities," Baucus said. "All Montanans deserve this money. It will go a long way in making our state a better place to live and work."
   "This money will make Montana's cities and towns safer by providing the resources needed to make sure all folks in Montana follow the law," Tester said. "This is a critical part of Montana's infrastructure that I'll continue fighting for in Washington every day."
   The measure approved today also includes $350,000 to boost Montana's drug courts.
   The Senate will vote on a final appropriations bill after merging it with the House version of the measure. It must then be signed into law by President Bush.
