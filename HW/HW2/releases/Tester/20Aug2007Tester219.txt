SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER ANNOUNCE MORE THAN $15,000 TO HELP RAVALLI COUNTY
  Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester today announced a $15,161 grant to help fight crime and prosecute criminals in Ravalli County.  
   The grant will be used to purchase digital recorders and cameras for Ravalli County law enforcement officers and detectives to photograph crime scenes. The money will also be used to purchase equipment for patrol vehicles to allow for hands-free communication. 
   "Having high-tech equipment at crimes scenes will help solve crimes more quickly," Baucus said. "This money will help keep officers safe while they are driving and help keep Ravalli County a safe place to live."
   "Helping our cops on the streets upgrade their technology will lead to better, more family-friendly communities across Ravalli County," Tester said. "Officers will be more efficient with digital equipment at the scene and in the patrol vehicles."
   The grant will be awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice.
