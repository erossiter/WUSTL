SENS. BAUCUS, TESTER SECURE $1.5 MILLION TO TAKE STING OUT OF BEE DISEASE
  A swarm of federal dollars dedicated towards finding out why bees are mysteriously dying passed a key Senate panel, Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today. 
   The Pollinators project received $1.5 million in an appropriations bill from the Senate Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. The Pollinators project is dedicated to finding the cause, and a cure, for the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder, which is decimating the bee population across the country.
   "There has been a lot of buzz recently about Colony Collapse disorder," Baucus said. "Bees are vital to agriculture in Montana, which is why Jon and I worked to get these dollars to figure out how to cure this deadly disorder."
   "As a farmer I know first-hand how important pollinating is to agriculture," Tester said. "And even though bees might not be the biggest critters, they play a big role in raising crops."
   The appropriations bill will now go before the full Senate Appropriations committee for its consideration.
