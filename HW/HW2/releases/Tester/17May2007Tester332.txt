SENATORS ANNOUNCE NEARLY $223K FOR MONTANA ORGANIZATION SERVING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
  A Montana organization that serves families and individuals with disabilities will receive $227,965 from the U.S. Department of Education to continue their work providing training to parents of children with disabilities, Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced today.  
   Parents, Let's Unite for Kids (PLUK) will receive this award under the Parent Training and Information Center Program. The funds will be used to assist families statewide and help them best understand their children's disabilities and their educational and developmental needs. 
   "Part of what makes us Montanans is working together, and helping out when we can," Baucus said. "Whether it's sound medical advice, or practical advice on day to day activities, these funds will help folks across Big Sky country." 
   "Montanans lend a helping hand to friends and neighbors in need. That's exactly what PLUK does," Tester said. "These dollars are going to be put to good work helping out folks in our cities and in our rural areas, which don't always have the assistance and expertise they need."
