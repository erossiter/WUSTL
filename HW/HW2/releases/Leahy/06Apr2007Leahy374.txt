To Turn Over    Documents  Information Being Withheld      Seeks Docs  Relevant Info That White House Relying On To Claim No    Wrongdoing   In Plan To Fire And Replace Prosecutors   Despite Troubling Evidence Gathered By Congressional Committees    WASHINGTON  Friday  April 6   Senator Patrick    Leahy  D Vt    sent a letter to White House Counsel Fred Fielding seeking    documents and relevant information relating to the firing and replacement of    several federal prosecutors  in particular any information that has led the    Administration to discount the troubling evidence uncovered already by the    investigating congressional Committees    Leahy  the chairman of the Senate Judiciary    Committee  and other House and Senate members  have been requesting this    information for several weeks as part of congressional investigations into    the dismissals of U S  Attorneys  The testimony of several of the fired    prosecutors that they were dismissed for improper political reasons has been    supported by documents released by the Department of Justice and the    testimony of current and former Department officials  White House    officials have publicly claimed nothing improper occurred  yet have refused    to provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with relevant documents and    information it has requested as part of its investigation     Despite the lack of cooperation  the    President and White House surrogates assert publicly that there was no    wrongdoing  Those assertions prompt me to ask for their basis  Leahy    wrote  On March 20  the President apparently based his assertion that no    one did anything improper on reviews by the White House staff  Earlier    this week the President asserted at another press conference that there has    been no credible evidence of any wrongdoing    The investigating Committees of the Congress    would benefit from the reviews and investigations the Administration has    conducted that have led the President to conclude that there has been no    wrongdoing   This is the third letter that Leahy has sent    to the White House in the past few weeks seeking cooperation     Below is the text of the    letter  A  is also available    April 5  2007  Fred Fielding  Esq    Counsel to the President   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  Fielding   I continue to await answers to two letters     The first is the March 22  2007 letter sent by 10 Members of the Senate    Judiciary Committee inviting the White House to agree to provide the    investigating Committees of the Congress  both House and Senate  with access    to witnesses  information and relevant documents  The second is the March    28  2007 letter I sent with House Judiciary Chairman Conyers asking the    White House to reconsider its take it or leave it approach with respect to    documents  There are documents that the White House appeared willing to    provide  and we urged those documents be provided without delay so as to    narrow the dispute and further the investigation  To date  we have received    no documents from the White House and no testimony of any White House    personnel    The President acknowledged at his press    conference on March 20th that Congress is examining these    questions and the role the White House played in the resignations of these    U S  attorneys  He said that he recognized the importance of our    understanding how and why this decision was made  He indicated that the    White House would be making the relevant White House staff available and    providing at least some of the relevant documents  as well  Despite his    saying that we would be provided with information from the White House  that    has not happened    Despite the lack of cooperation  the President    and White House surrogates assert publicly that there was no wrongdoing     Those assertions prompt me to ask for their basis  On March 20  the    President apparently based his assertion that no one did anything improper    on reviews by the White House staff  Earlier this week the President    asserted at another press conference that there has been no credible    evidence of any wrongdoing    The investigating Committees of the Congress    would benefit from the reviews and investigations the Administration has    conducted that have led the President to conclude that there has been no    wrongdoing  Please make prompt arrangements to provide us with the reviews    by the White House staff on which the President relied in his statements on    March 20 and all other Administration investigations and reviews into these    matters    Who was involved in conducting the reviews by    the White House staff  what did they examine  who did they interview  and    what documents did they review in arriving at the conclusion that no one did    anything improper  What other investigations and reviews has the    Administration undertaken into this matter  Who was involved in conducting    those investigations and reviews  what did they examine  who did they    interview  and what documents did they review in coming to the conclusion    that there is no evidence of wrongdoing  What evidence of wrongdoing has    the Administration rejected as not credible in the course of its    investigations and reviews into these matters    Please include any and all information    obtained or reviewed in the course of these reviews by White House staff and    all other investigations and reviews by the Administration that lead    the President to discount the evidence the investigating Committees have    gathered so far  including    The March 6  2007 testimony of four of     the fired U S  Attorneys before the Senate Judiciary Committee and six     of the fired U S  Attorneys before the House Judiciary Committee  that     they were fired for improper political reasons    The March 28  2007 testimony of D  Kyle     Sampson  former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General  that the     Attorney General and White House officials including Karl Rove and     former White House Counsel Harriet Miers were deeply involved in the     decision to fire and replace certain U S  Attorneys  who  according to     internal evaluations and performance reviews  had been doing their jobs     well    The testimony of Mr  Sampson  corroborated     by documents released by the Department  demonstrating that  contrary to     the Attorney Generals statements  Attorney General Gonzales had talked     to Mr  Sampson about the plan to fire prosecutors many times dating back     at least two years  beginning after the 2004 election when he was still     the White House counsel    Mr  Sampsons testimony that Karl Rove     complained to the Attorney General about U S  Attorneys not being     aggressive enough against voter fraud in three jurisdictionsincluding     in New Mexico where David Iglesias was U S  Attorneyand that those     three names were added to the list of U S  Attorneys targeted for     removal  with Mr  Iglesias remaining on the list and being fired     Documents and the testimony of Mr  Sampson     demonstrating that Mr  Iglesias was held in high regard and even     mentioned for possible promotion to the highest levels of the Department     in 2004 and 2005  until late in 2006 when Administration officials     received calls from New Mexico Republicans upset that Mr  Iglesias would     not hurry an investigation in order to indict Democrats before the 2006     elections    Mr  Sampsons testimony that he had     suggested to the White House that Patrick Fitzgerald be fired and     replaced in the middle of the investigation and prosecution in     connection with the leaking of Valerie Plames identity as an undercover     CIA agent  which led to the conviction of I  Lewis Libby  the former     Chief of Staff to the Vice President  for perjury  lying and obstruction     of justice    Documents showing that discussions began     at the highest levels of the Justice Department about the real problem     with Carol Lam  former U S  Attorney for the Southern District of     California  immediately following notice of the expansion of the public     corruption probe Ms  Lam was leading into the activities of Republican     Rep  Randy  Duke  Cunningham and other Republican officials     Documents and testimony showing that John     McKay  former U S  Attorney for the Western District of Washington  was     highly praised by Mr  Sampson and others in the Administration and     supported by them for a judgeship as late as the summer of 2006  but was     included in the list of people to fire later in 2006  Documents and Mr      McKays testimony suggest that Republicans were upset with Mr  McKay for     his decision not to intervene in connection with the close 2004     gubernatorial election in Washington    The recent testimony of FBI Director     Mueller to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not aware of any     voter fraud cases that should have been brought but were not  nor had     any FBI agents or officials brought such complaints to his attention       Deputy Attorney General Paul McNultys     testimony that former Easter District of Arkansas U S  Attorney H E      Bud Cummins  III was removed to make room for Tim Griffin  a former     aide to Karl Rove  and the documents that demonstrate this was done over     the objection of home state Senators and with the intent to circumvent     Senate confirmation     I understand that there is a joint Inspector    General and Office of Professional Responsibility inquiry recently begun at    the Department of Justice  Given that it has just recently begun  the    President could not have been relying on it in connection with his March 20    statement and I doubt that he was relying on it this week  I am not    requesting that investigation be provided at this time    I am deeply concerned regarding what appears    to be political influence in federal law enforcement  There remain several    obstacles to the ability of the investigating Committees to learn the truth    about what occurred with these firings and replacements  who was involved    and why  The selectivity and incompleteness of the highly redacted set of    documents we have received so far from the Department of Justice present one    set of obstacles  The refusal of the White House to provide relevant    documents and access to White House staff who played a role in these firings    and replacements are others    Providing information to the investigating    Committees regarding the investigations and reviews conducted by the    Administration would aid us in our goal of getting to the truth in this    matter    I look forward to your response     Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY   Chairman
