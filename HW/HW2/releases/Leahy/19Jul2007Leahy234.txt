       Senate Judiciary Panel passes Bipartisan Patent Reform Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Senate Judiciary Panel Passes      Bipartisan Patent Reform Bill     In 13 5 Vote       Judiciary Committee Overwhelmingly Supports      Long Overdue      Overhaul Of U S  Patent System      WASHINGTON  Thursday  July 19   The Senate Judiciary Committee     late Thursday      voted 13 5 to report out a bipartisan bill that represents the first      significant reforms to the nations patent system in several      decades    The Judiciary Committee today took an      important step to ensuring the continuing competitiveness of our      innovation economy       said Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    With the      thoughtfulness and care that characterizes the Committee at its      best  we have reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that our      Nations patent laws promote and protect the inventiveness of all of      our industries       Leahy cosponsored the bill with Senator Orrin Hatch       R Utah   a senior member of the panel    The Committee has been marking up the      comprehensive patent bill for the past several weeks  With the      Committees vote Thursday evening  the bill moves to the full Senate      for consideration  Earlier this week  the House Judiciary Committee      reported out a similar bipartisan reform bill    Among many important reforms  the bill      would create a pure first to file system to bring needed clarity      and certainty to the U S  patent system  The American system is the      only one in the world that still grants patents to the first      inventor rather than the first to file an application  The bill      also creates a more streamlined and effective way of challenging the      validity and enforceability of patents  Leahy said     Earlier this year  Leahy and Hatch      joined with Rep  Howard Berman  D Calif    chairman of the House      Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Courts  the Internet  and      Intellectual Property       and Rep  Lamar Smith  R Texas   ranking member of the House      Judiciary Committee  to introduce the bicameral  bipartisan Patent      Reform Act of 2007   A bill as complex as this one will      require further attention  and I am committed to working with every      member of the Senate  and ultimately with our colleagues in the      House of Representatives  to make certain that all inventors enjoy      the respect and support that our Constitution envisioned  Leahy      said                     Below is      background summary of the final managers amendment adopted by the      Committee today    Managers Amendment          Leahy Hatch Patent Reform Act Of 2007  S 1145      July 19  2007   1  Venue              Explanation       This amendment makes changes to the patent venue statute that were      contained in the last Managers Amendment  but which were      inadvertently omitted from Senator Specters venue amendment  The 1st      change expands the residency definition to include non incorporated      businesses  e g   LLCs  LPs  etc    The 2nd change      provides similar treatment for US subsidiaries of foreign      corporations     Change  On page      49  line 12  after incorporated insert or formed        On page 49  line 15 16  strike      is located and insert has its principal place of business or is      incorporated or formed  2  Willfulness             Explanation       As introduced  the bill contained a section codifying  and      improving  the doctrine of willful infringement  A clerical error      occurred in the 2nd Managers Amendment  when making      changes to a different section  Damages    Apportionment and Entire      Market Value Rule   the strike language inadvertently struck the      entire willfulness section as well  This change simply restores      that section to the bill         Change        At page 26  in between lines 6 and 7  insert the following      2  By      amending the second undesignated paragraph to read as follows     b      Willful Infringement                 1  Increased Damages    A      court that has determined that the infringer has willfully infringed      a patent or patents may increase the damages up to three times the      amount of damages found or assessed under subsection  a   except      that increased damages under this paragraph shall not apply to      provision rights under section 154 d           2  Permitted Grounds for      Willfulness    A court may find that an infringer has      willfully infringed a patent only if the patent owner presents clear      and convincing evidence that            A  after receiving written notice from the      patentee            i  alleging acts      of infringement in a manner sufficient to give the infringer an      objectively reasonable apprehension of suit on such patent  and         ii  identifying      with particularity each claim of the patent  each product or process      that the patent owner alleges infringes the patent  and the      relationship of such product or process to such claim         the infringer  after a      reasonable opportunity to investigate  thereafter performed one or      more of the alleged acts of infringement          B  the infringer intentionally copied the      patented invention with knowledge that it was patented  or         C  after having been found by a court to have      infringed that patent  the infringer engaged in conduct that was not      colorably different from the conduct previously found to have      infringed the patent  and which resulted in a separate finding of      infringement of the same patent         3  Limitations on      Willfulness     A  A court may not find that an infringer      has willfully infringed a patent under paragraph  2  for any period      of time during which the infringer had an informed good faith belief      that the patent was invalid or unenforceable  or would not be      infringed by the conduct later shown to constitute infringement of      the patent          B  An informed good faith belief within the      meaning of subparagraph  A  may be established by            i  reasonable reliance on advice      of counsel         ii  evidence that the infringer      sought to modify its conduct to avoid infringement once it had      discovered the patent  or        iii  other evidence a court may      find sufficient to establish such good faith belief          C  The decision of the infringer not to present      evidence of advice of counsel is not relevant to a determination of      willful infringement under paragraph  2           4       Limitation on Pleading    Before the date on which a court      determines that the patent in suit is not invalid  is enforceable       and has been infringed by the infringer  a patentee may not plead      and a court may not determine that an infringer has willfully      infringed a patent  The courts determination of an infringers      willfulness shall be made without a jury   and         3  in the third designated paragraph  by striking The      court and inserting  c       Expert Testimony    The court   3  Post Grant      Review  a       Applicability         Explanation       The PGR effective date is one year after the date of enactment of      the Act  Currently the bill provides that 2nd window  or      consented  petitions may be filed for all patents  regardless of      when they issue or when their corresponding applications were      filed  This change narrows that greatly  such that 2nd      window  or consented  petitions may only be filed for  i  patents      that issue on or after the PGR effective date  or  ii  patents that      issue before the PGR effective date based on an application filed      between November 29  1999 and the PGR effective date  This latter      category includes patents that would have been subject to inter partes      reexamination          Change       On page 44  strike lines 12 through 18  and insert and shall apply      to patents issued on or after that date  except that  in the case of      a patent issued before the effective date of this Act on an      application filed between November 29  1999 and the effective date      of this Act  a petition for post grant review under section 321 of      title 35  United States Code  may only be filed under paragraph  2       or  3  of section 322 of title 35  United States Code    b  Appeals        Explanation       Since its introduction  S  1145 provided that PGR Board decisions      are only appealable to the Federal Circuit  and not to district      court  i e   pursuant to 35 USC Sections 141 144    This is      consistent with appeals of inter partes reexamination  The 2nd      Managers Amendment inadvertently changed section number 144 to 145       This clerical error would allow PGR Board decisions to be challenged      in district court first  before then appealing to the Federal      Circuit  This would add significant unwanted delay to the PGR      process  This change corrects that clerical error         Change       At page 43  line 19  strike 145 and insert 144   c  Burden of proof        Explanation       There has been concern regarding the burden of proof for the 2nd      window of PGR  This change addresses that point           Change       At page 39  line 17  strike 322 and insert 322 1    At      page 39  line 18  after the period insert the following        For petitions filed under 322 2  or  3   the existence       authentication  availability and scope of any evidence offered to      establish invalidity shall be established by clear and convincing      evidence  if such predicate facts are so established  invalidity      shall be proven only if the persuasive force of such facts      demonstrates invalidity by a fair preponderance of the evidence   d  Amendments to      claims        Explanation       The intent of the bill is to allow for one motion to amend claims      throughout the proceeding  This technical change clarifies this      point     Change       At page 39  line 20  strike In response to a challenge in a      petition and insert During a post grant review proceeding    4  PTO Funding   Explanation       This change clarifies that the conforming amendment in subsection       d  of Section 9  PTO regulatory authority  does not have the effect      of negating other provisions in Public Law 108 447 by impacting      those other provisions effective date    Change       On p  55  change the existing  e  before the word Definitions to       f  and insert the new subsection  e  below         e  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any other      provision of Division B of Public Law 108 447  including section      801 c  of title VII of the Departments of Commerce  Justice and      State  the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act       2005
