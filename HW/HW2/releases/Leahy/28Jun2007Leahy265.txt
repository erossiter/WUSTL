       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Chairman  Senate Judiciary   Committee  On White House Claim Of Executive Privilege                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              WASHINGTON      Thursday  June 28   The White House on Thursday asserted executive     privilege in response to congressional subpoenas seeking information     relating to investigations into the firings of several U S  Attorneys     and politicization within the Department of Justice  Below is     Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahys comment on the White     Houses claim  as well as his remarks from the Committees business     meeting this morning    Comment  Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt   Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On White House Claim Of Executive Privilege     June 28  2007  This is a further shift by the Bush     Administration into Nixonian stonewalling and more evidence of their     disdain for our system of checks and balances  This White House cannot     have it both ways  They cannot stonewall congressional investigations     by refusing to provide documents and witnesses  while claiming nothing     improper occurred     Increasingly  the President and Vice     President feel they are above the law     in America no one is above     law                     Opening Statement Of     Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting    June 28  2007    As the Committee opens its Executive     Business meeting today  I note that the deadline has passed for the     White House and its former Political Director  Sara Taylor  to produce     documents from a subpoena issued on June 13    This Committees subpoena and a similar     subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee compelled the White     House to turn over documents related to our continuing investigation     into the firings of United States Attorneys around the country  The     Committees subpoena has been met not with compliance  but with Nixonian     stonewalling  This morning  I received a phone call and a letter from     White House Counsel Fred Fielding informing me that the President     intends to assert executive privilege in response to our subpoena   So now we know the truth about this White     Houses intentions all along  Even though the White House claimed that     Congress had all the information it needed  and the President insisted     publicly that nothing improper occurred  now Congress and the public     learn that this White House never intended to comply with our oversight     investigation    More than three months ago  we rejected     the White Houses take it or leave it offer of off the record      backroom interviews as unacceptable  Since that time  despite many     attempts to narrow the dispute and begin to obtain the information we     need  the White House has not made any effort to work with us on a     voluntary basis  Instead  since that time  and again today it has     merely restated its initial  unacceptable offer  Today  the White House     has ended its charade of empty proposals and revealed its disdain for     our system of checks and balances    I issued the subpoenas after three months     of exhausting every avenue of voluntary cooperation from this White     House  Evidence gathered by the investigating Committees in the House     and Senate shows that White House officials  including Karl Rove and     Sara Taylor  were heavily involved in these firings and in the Justice     Departments response to congressional inquiries about them  Yet  even     with a subpoena  the White House has not produced a single document or     allowed even one White House official involved in these matters to be     interviewed  The White House cannot have it both ways    it cannot     stonewall congressional investigations by refusing to provide documents     and witnesses  while claiming nothing improper occurred     This empty proposal from the White House     is not commensurate with our exercise of the broad investigatory power     of Congress  which the Supreme Court has described many times as     essential to our legislative function  The White House is trying to     block not only our investigation  but the ability of the American people     to learn the truth about these firings  Increasingly  the President and     Vice President feel they are above the law    in America no one is above     law    This is not an issue of whether they are     willing to provide answers on these oversight issues  but whether they     can dictate terms to another branch of government  They want to short     circuit the checks and balances that ensure real oversight and true     accountability   I will look at the Presidents broad claim     of executive privilege  Since we have heard so much testimony that the     President did not personally make these decisions on the firings and was     not personally involved  it is difficult to imagine that there is much     basis to these claims  They cannot have it both ways   I am disappointed that we had to resort to     issuing subpoenas in order to obtain information needed by the     Committees to learn the truth about these firings and the erosion of     independence at the Justice Department  I am even more disappointed now     by this Nixonian stonewalling  We will take the necessary steps to     enforce our subpoenas backed by the full force of law so that Congress     and the public can get to the truth behind this matter
