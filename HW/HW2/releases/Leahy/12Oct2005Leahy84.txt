subject of increasing       controversy in recent years  It has become the target of both       popular and academic criticism that alleges that the judicial       branch has usurped many of the prerogatives of other branches       and levels of government     Some of the       characteristics of this judicial activism have been said to       include    a  a       tendency by the judiciary toward problem solution rather than       grievance resolution    b  a       tendency by the judiciary to employ the individual plaintiff as       a vehicle for the imposition of far reaching orders extending to       broad classes of individuals    c  a       tendency by the judiciary to impose broad  affirmative duties       upon governments and society    d  a       tendency by the judiciary toward loosening jurisdictional       requirements such as standing and ripeness  and    e  a       tendency by the judiciary to impose itself upon other       institutions in the manner of an administrator with continuing       oversight responsibilities     UNITED STATES       SENATE       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY       NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES    CONFIDENTIAL
