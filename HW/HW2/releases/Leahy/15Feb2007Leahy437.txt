       Leahy Presses For Vote On Bipartisan Bill To Restore Checks And   Balances  GOP Objection Prevents Vote                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Presses      For Vote On Bipartisan Bill To Restore Checks And Balances      GOP Objection Prevents Vote  WASHINGTON       Thursday  February 15   Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt    today      attempted to have the Senate consider and pass a bipartisan bill      that would prevent the Bush Administration from circumventing the      Senate s constitutional role in confirming U S  Attorneys  The      bill  which won bipartisan support in the Senate Judiciary Committee      last week  would restore the previous system of checks and balances      that had been in place until the Bush Administration slipped in a      change to the law in the last Republican controlled Congress   Leahy  the      chairman of the Judiciary Committee and cosponsor of the bipartisan      bill  today moved to have the Senate pass the bill  A Republican      objection prevented a Senate vote on the bill    Below is Sen       Leahys statement  as prepared     Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On S  214  Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act Of      2007     U S  Senate Floor           February 15  2007  Last week  the Judiciary Committee      reached a bipartisan consensus to reverse recent changes to the law      governing appointments of interim United States attorneys  These      changes were made  with little transparency  during final      negotiations of the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act  Through      my staff  I had objected at the time  but to no avail  These      changes invited and abetted an apparent abuse of power by this      Administration that threatens to undermine the effectiveness and      professionalism of U S  Attorneys offices around the country        I continue to support Senator      Feinsteins efforts to combat these abuses  I thank Senator Schumer      for chairing our hearing into this matter last week and Senator      Specter for his active involvement  which helped lead to a      bipartisan solution  I urge the Senate to follow the Committees      lead and approve the Specter  Feinstein  Leahy substitute to S  214       the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007   During the Patriot Act Reauthorization      last year  checks on the authority of the Attorney General to      appoint interim United States Attorneys to fill a vacancy      temporarily were removed  The change to the law removed the 120 day      limit for such appointments and removed the district courts role in      making any subsequent interim appoints  This change in law       accomplished over my objection  allowed the Attorney General for the      first time to make so called interim appointments that could last      indefinitely    Regrettably  we do not have to imagine      the effects of this unfettered authority  We learned recently that      the Department of Justice has asked several outstanding U S       Attorneys from around the country to resign their positions  Some      are engaged in difficult and complex public corruption cases       Yesterday  one of the U S  Attorneys who has been told to resign       Carol Lam of the Southern District of California  announced two      indictments stemming from her offices investigation of      now convicted former Congressman Randall Duke Cunningham  A      federal grand jury handed up indictments of San Diego defense      contractor Brent R  Wilkes for bribery and of Wilkes and the former      number 3 official at the CIA  Kyle Dusty Foggo  for     conspiring to defraud      the United States  Apparently  Ms  Lams reward for her efforts at      rooting out serious public corruption is a pink slip   We also understand the Attorney      General has or is planning to appoint interim replacements for the      U S  Attorneys he is removing  raising a potential of avoiding the      Senate confirmation process altogether  This is an end run around      our system of checks and balances   Many Senators have raised concerns      about this practice  and several have asked the Attorney General      about the reasons for the interim appointments  The situation in      Arkansas highlights the troubling nature of this new authority and      its abuse  The Attorney General removed respected U S  Attorney Bud      Cummins and replaced him with the interim appointment of Tim      Griffin  a former political operative      for Karl Rove  This appointment was not made pursuant to an      agreement with the two home state Senators    In our hearing last week   Paul McNulty  the second in command at the      Department of Justice  testified that Mr  Cummins dismissal was not      related to how well he did his job  In fact  Mr  McNulty said he      had no performance problems  but was removed merely to give an      opportunity to Mr  Griffin  a person whom he admitted was not the      best person possible for the job and who is reported to      have been involved in an effort during the 2004 election to      challenge voting by primarily African American voters serving in the      Armed Forces overseas  This was not a vacancy      created by necessity or emergency  This was a vacancy created by      choice to advance a political crony    Since this Administration has been      creating these vacancies by removing U S  Attorneys as it chooses      for whatever reason  or no good reason    on a timeline it      dictates  how can it now claim not to have had time to fill spots      with Senate confirmed nominees  Why were agreed upon replacements      not lined up before creating these vacancies  Why were home state      Senators not consulted in advance  I would note that every one of      the U S  Attorneys who was asked to resign was someone chosen by      this Administration  while the Attorney General served as White      House Counsel  nominated by this President  approved by the home      state Senators and confirmed by the Senate  This is a problem of      the Administrations imagination and choosing  like so many others        With respect to the law that has      governed for the last few decades  the authority given to the      Attorney General to make a time limited interim appointment has not      proven to be a problem  For example  last Congress  the time from      nomination to confirmation of U S  Attorney nominations took an      average of 71 days  with only three taking longer than 120 days and      two of those only a few days longer   The Department opposes the District      Courts role in the law that existed prior to the changes enacted in      a Patriot Act Reauthorization conference  This was a conference in      which Democratic Members were excluded  The Department claims the      District Courts role in filling vacancies beyond 120 days to be      inconsistent with sound separation of powers principles  That is      contrary to the Constitution  our history and our practices  In      fact  the practice of judicial officers appointing officers of the      court is well established in our history and from the earliest      days  Morrison v  Olson      should have laid to rest the so called separation of powers concern      now being trumpeted to justify these political maneuvers within the      Justice Department  It is not just a red hearing but a bright red      herring  Certainly no Republicans now defending this Administration      voiced concern when a panel of judges appointed Ken Starr to spend      millions in taxpayer dollars going after President Clinton as a      court appointed prosecutor    I have heard not a word from the      apologists who seek to use the Constitution as a shield for these      activities about what the Constitution says  The Constitution      provides congressional power to direct the appointment power  In      Article II  the part of the Constitution that this Administration      reads as if it says that all power resides with the President  the      Presidents appointment power is limited by the power of Congress       Indeed  between its provisions calling for appointments with the      advice and consent of the Senate and for the Presidents limited      power to make recess appointments  the Constitution provides  But      the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior      officers  as they think proper  in the President alone  in the      courts of law  or in the Heads of Departments  Thus  the      Constitution contemplates exactly what our statutes and practices      have always provided  Congress is well within its authority when it      vests in the courts a share of the appointment power for those who      appear before them    Regrettably  this latest abuse of      power follows this Administrations politicization of U S  Attorneys      offices  A recent study of federal investigations of elected      officials and candidates shows that the Bush Justice Department has      pursued Democrats far more than Republicans  The study by Dr       Donald C  Shields  Professor Emeritus from the Department of      Communication  University of Missouri St  Louis  and Dr  John F       Cragan  Professor Emeritus from the Department of Communication       Illinois State University  found that between 2001 and 2006  79      percent of the elected officials and candidates who have faced a      federal investigation were Democrats and only 18 percent      Republicans  The Administrations track record is not good and it      again appears caught with its hand in the cookie jar   Before 1986  28 U S C  546  the law      governing the appointment of United States Attorneys  authorized the      district court where a vacancy exists to appoint a person to serve      until the President appointed a person to fill that vacancy with the      advice and consent of the Senate  When Congress changed the law in      1986 to allow the Attorney General to appoint an interim U S       Attorney  it carefully circumscribed that authority by limiting it      to 120 days  after which the District Court would make any further      interim appointment needed  I was pleased that Senator Feinstein      worked so hard with Senator Specter to craft a worthwhile consensus      measure to reinstate these vital limits on the Attorney Generals      authority and bring back incentives for the Administration to fill      vacancies with Senate confirmable nominees  This measure has      bi partisan support on the Committee  We reported it out 13 6 after      debating and voting down several amendments   United States Attorneys around the      country are the chief federal law enforcement officers in their      states  and they have an enormous responsibility for implementing      anti terrorism efforts  bringing important and often difficult      cases  and taking the lead to fight public corruption  It is vital      that those holding these vital positions be free from any      inappropriate influence and subject to the check and balance of the      confirmation process  The Specter  Feinstein  Leahy substitute to      S  214 is a measure that passed our Committee with bipartisan      support and I urge the Senate to take it up and pass it today so      that we can curb the abuses we have seen
