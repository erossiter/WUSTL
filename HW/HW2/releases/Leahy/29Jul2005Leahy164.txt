       Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Confirmation Hearing Schedule                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Ranking Democratic Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Confirmation Hearing Schedule     Senate Floor     Friday  July 29  2005  6 50 p m      Judiciary      Chairman Arlen Specter and Ranking Member Patrick Leahy Friday night      announced agreement on a schedule for the hearings on the nomination      of John Roberts to be a Justice on the U S  Supreme Court    The committees      hearings will begin on Tuesday  September 6    Long before this Supreme Court vacancy      and this nomination  Chairman Specter and I have worked      cooperatively to lay the groundwork for fair and full hearings to      prepare the Committee for when that day would arrive  We now have      announced the schedule for the hearings to begin  and I know that we      will continue to work with each other in good faith as this process      unfolds    Beginning the first week the Senate      returns to session after Labor Day is a brisk schedule  To meet      this schedule we need the cooperation of the Administration  The      Senate only today  Friday  is receiving the Presidents nomination      of Judge Roberts  The Senate has not received basic background      information on the nominee in answer to the Judiciary Committees      questionnaire  The Senate only today received updated      background check materials from the FBI  In advance of receiving      the nomination  Chairman Specter and I joined together earlier this      week in sending forward the initial request for information through      the Judiciary Committee questionnaire    The Democratic Members of the      Committee sent the White House a letter on Tuesday prioritizing the      documents from the nominees years of work in the Reagan White House      with White House Counsel Fred Fielding from among the documents the      Administration had indicated it was making arrangements to provide      to the Senate  Yesterday I shared with the Chairman a suggested      request for materials in connection with only 16 priority cases from      the hundreds considered during the years during which the nominee      was Ken Starrs political deputy at the Department of Justice  That      request also has been expedited and sent to the Administration this      week even before the President sent his nomination to the Senate   The President has said he hopes a new      justice can be confirmed by the start of the Courts next session on      the first Monday in October  I do  too  The Senate is already      cooperating to help achieve that goal  At this point there is no      reason to believe that this goal cannot be met  but we need the full      cooperation of the Administration  The Administration has weighed      in heavily with demands regarding the Senates schedule  What we      need more than the White House telling us when and how to do our job      is a White House willing to help us expedite our consideration by      making relevant materials available without delay so that we can      meet the Chairmans aggressive schedule     The President has extolled the      nominees credentials  including his years of work in three senior      Executive Branch posts during the presidencies of his father and      President Reagan  We are seeking a small number of the documents      evidencing his work in those policy positions  In order to be able      to fulfill its responsibilities to examine this nomination and      report to the Senate  the Judiciary Committee should be provided      these materials without delay so that we can perform our due      diligence   The White House this week said that      the Senate will have access to documents from the Reagan      Administration  but only after an elaborate screening process       Based on the White Houses own statements about the length of time      it will take to screen these documents  that will be four weeks from      now  and possibly longer  The date the Chairman is setting for      beginning the hearings emphasizes that to be able to review these      materials before the hearings requires quicker action than that       You need only a glance at the calendar to see that four weeks from      today is only 10 days before the hearings    This is a nominee who  if confirmed       could be serving on the Supreme Court until 2030 or beyond  well      past the term of the President who appointed him  and well past the      terms and perhaps even the lifetimes of Members of the Senate who      will make this decision  This is a decision that not only affects      every American alive today  but also our children and our      grandchildren  The Constitution gives the Senate and only the      Senate the responsibility of considering a Presidents nominations      to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court    The Constitution gives us the duty to      make this decision as capably as we can  not to do it as fast as we      can
