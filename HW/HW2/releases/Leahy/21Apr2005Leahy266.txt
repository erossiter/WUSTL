       Leahy  Democrats Oppose Brown Nomination  Panel Approves Nominee                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy  Democrats      Oppose Brown Nomination      Panel Approves Nominee      WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 21  2005   The Senate Judiciary      Committee  in a 10 8 party line vote  reported out the controversial      judicial nomination of Janice Rogers Brown on Thursday  All eight      Democratic members of the Committee voted against the nomination       which now moves to the full Senate  Brown is nominated to the      United States Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  the most      powerful court in the nation below the Supreme Court of the United      States  The Senate rejected Browns nomination last Congress  with      Democratic senators opposing the nomination based on Browns record      as an agenda driven judge with little regard for clear judicial      precedent  A statement from Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the      ranking Democratic member of the panel  opposing the nomination       follows  as well as background material on Browns record     Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy     On the Nomination of  Janice Rogers Brown  To the  United      States Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  Executive Business      Meeting  Senate Judiciary Committee     April 21  2005      Two and a half years ago I explained that I was voting against the      nomination of Janice      Rogers Brown to be a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for      the D C  Circuit  the most powerful appellate court in the country      below the Supreme Court of the United States  because her lengthy      record both on the bench and off raised a variety of concerns about      her judicial philosophy and fitness for this lifetime appointment       Not only has Justice Brown failed to resolve my concerns  but      Justice Browns opinions issued since that time reinforce and deepen      the most troubling patterns in her record  Accordingly  I will      again vote against her confirmation today       Justice Browns extreme record has earned her the opposition of      African American leaders  law professors  and newspapers around the      country  The list of the African American organizations and      individuals who oppose Justice Browns nomination is one of the most      troubling indications that this is another divisive  ideologically      driven nomination  The 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus      oppose Justice Brown  including the respected congressional delegate      from the District of      Columbia  Eleanor Holmes Norton  and such distinguished Americans as      Representatives Charles Rangel  Elijah Cummings and John Conyers       The nations oldest and largest association of predominantly      African American lawyers and judges  the National Bar Association       and its State counterpart  the California Association of Black      Lawyers  both oppose this nomination  The foremost national civil      rights organization  the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights      opposes this nomination  The women of Delta Sigma Theta oppose this      nomination  Dr  Dorothy Height  Dr  Joseph Lowery and Julian Bond      have spoken out against this nomination        Justice Browns views  both in speeches and in opinions issued from      the bench are so extreme that more than 200 law school professors      wrote to the Committee expressing their opposition prior to her      hearing two and a half years ago        After Justice Browns hearing  editorial pages across the country      came to the same conclusion  Justice Browns home state newspaper      The Los Angeles       Times  concluded she is a      bad fit for a key court  after finding that in opinions and      speeches  Brown has articulated disdainful views of the Constitution      and government that are so strong and so far from the mainstream as      to raise questions about whether they would control her decisions       The Detroit Free Press      concluded  Brown has all but hung a banner above her head      declaring herself a foe to privacy rights  civil rights  legal      precedent and even colleagues who dont share her extremist      leanings   I      come to my decision after reviewing Justice Browns record  her      judicial opinions  her speeches and writings    and considering her      testimony and oral and written answers provided to the Senate      Judiciary Committee  Because there has been no additional      development  no follow up hearing for her renomination  and no basis      offered for reconsidering the Senates refusal to grant consent to      this nomination  I expect the votes on this nomination to remain the      same   My      opposition is not about whether Justice Brown would vote like me if      she were a member of the United States Senate  I have voted to      confirm probably hundreds of nominees with whom I differ  Nor is      this about one dissent or one speech  This is about Justice Browns      approach to the law  an approach which she has consistently used to      promote her own ideological agenda  an extreme agenda that is out of      the mainstream  Her hostility both to Supreme Court precedent and      to the intent of the legislature does not entitle her to a lifetime      appointment to this very important appellate court     Jurisprudence Of      Convenience As      I said two and a half years ago    and as remains true today        Janice Rogers Browns      approach to the law can be best described as a jurisprudence of      convenience  Justice Brown has proven herself to be a      results oriented  agenda driven judge whose respect for precedent      and rules of judicial interpretation change depending on the subject      before her and the results she wants to reach        While Justice Browns approach to the law has been inconsistent       she has taken whatever approach she needs to in order to get to a      result she desires  the results which she has worked toward have      been very consistent  throughout her public record  At her hearing       Justice Brown attempted to separate her speeches from her role as a      judge  But on issue after issue    the protection of the elderly       workers  and consumers  equal protection  the takings clause       privacy rights  free speech  civil liberties  remedies  the use of      peremptory challenges  and many more    Justice Brown has inserted      her radical views into her judicial opinions  time and time again       In fact  Justice Browns comments to groups across the country over      the last 10 years repeated the same themes  sometimes even the same      words    as she has written in her opinions        Justice Browns disregard for precedent in her opinions in order to      expand the rights of corporations and wealthy property owners  at      the expense of workers and individuals who have been the victims of      discrimination  stands among the clearest illustrations of Justice      Browns results oriented jurisprudence       Justice Brown has also been inconsistent in the application of rules      of judicial interpretation  again depending on the result that she      wants to reach in order to fulfill her extremist ideological agenda        A Consummate      Judicial Activist      These legal trends  her disregard for precedent  her inconsistency      in judicial interpretation  and her tendency to inject her personal      opinions into her judicial opinions  lead to no other conclusion      but that Janice Rogers      Brown is    in the true sense of the words  a judicial activist            When it is needed to reach a conclusion that meets her own      ideological beliefs  Justice Brown stresses the need for deference      to the legislature and the electorate  But when the laws  as      passed by legislators and voters  are different than laws she      believes are necessary  she has shown no deference  presses her own      agenda  and advocates for judicial activism        One stark example springs to mind  In order to support her view      that judges should be able to limit damages in employment      discrimination cases  she concluded that creativity was a      permissible judicial practice and that all judges make law            Justice Browns approach to the law has led to many opinions which      are highly troubling  She has repeatedly and consistently advocated      turning back the clock 100 years to return to an era where worker      protection laws were found unconstitutional  She has attacked the      New Deal  an era which created Social Security and fair labor      standards  by saying it inoculated the federal Constitution with a      kind of underground collectivist mentality  President Bush      currently conveys a far different impression about programs like      Social Security as he travels the country on behalf of his agenda      for this vital program   It      is no small irony that this President  who spoke of being a uniter      but has used his position to send several judicial nominations that      have divided the Senate and the American people and that have      brought the Senate to the edge of a nuclear winter  His      divisiveness has continued  despite the confirmation of 205 out of      his 215 judicial nominees  And it is no small irony that this      President  who spoke with disdain of judicial activism  has      nominated several of the most consummate judicial activists ever      chosen by any President  None of the Presidents nominees is more      in the mold of a judicial activist than this nominee  I      oppose giving Justice Brown this lifetime promotion to the second      highest court in our land because the American people deserve judges      who will interpret the law fairly and objectively   Janice Rogers Brown is a confirmed and      committed judicial activist who has a consistent record of using her      position as a member of the court to put her views above the law       We must not enable her to bring her jurisprudence of convenience      to one of the most important federal courts in the Nation                 Background      Material on  Janice Rogers      Brown     JANICE ROGERS      BROWN      NOMINEE FOR THE D C  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS       Janice Rogers Brown said   There      are so few true conservatives left in        America that we probably should be included on the endangered      species list  Browns speeches and judicial opinions show that      she has consistently used her position as a member of the court to      advocate for her own extreme ideological agenda   If      she is confirmed to the D C  Circuit  her jurisprudence of      convenience will be brought to one of the most important courts in      the nation   A RESULTS ORIENTED       AGENDA DRIVEN JUDGE   Justice Brown has proven herself to be      a results oriented  agenda driven judge whose respect for precedent      and rules of judicial interpretation change depending on the subject      matter before her and the results she wants to reach   DISREGARD OF      PRECEDENT   Justice Brown wrote in one dissent   w e      cannot simply cloak ourselves in the doctrine of stare decisis       In her judicial opinions  Brown has repeatedly argued  in order to      get to a result she desired  that precedent does not need to be      followed  She has ignored precedent to expand the rights of      corporations at the expense of individuals  arguing for overturning      precedent to provide more leeway for corporations against attempts      to stop the sale of cigarettes to minors  prevent consumer fraud       and prevent the exclusion of women and homosexuals    ADVOCATES TURNING      BACK THE CLOCK 100 YEARS    Justice Brown has repeatedly and      consistently advocated returning to an era where worker protections      laws were found unconstitutional  She has described the year 1937       the year in which much of President Roosevelts New Deal legislation      took effect  as the triumph of our own socialist revolution    DISDAIN FOR      GOVERNMENT    Browns nomination is for the D C       Circuit  the court that oversees the actions of federal agencies      that are responsible for worker protections  environmental      protections  consumer safeguards  and civil rights protections      Janice      Rogers Brown has made no secret of her disdain for government  In      both speeches and judicial opinions  Brown has been critical of the      role government currently plays and she has argued for more limited      government wherever possible  In one speech  she said  Where      government moves in  community retreats  civil society      disintegrates  and our ability to control our own destiny      atrophies  The result is  families under siege  war in the streets       unapologetic expropriation of property  the precipitous decline of      the rule of law  the rapid rise of corruption  the loss of civility      and the triumph of deceit  The result is a debased  debauched      culture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue      contemptible    NOT QUALIFIED FOR      THE BENCH   The American Bar Association has given      Justice Brown a rating of partially not qualified to serve on the      D C  Circuit Court of Appeals  Similarly  Brown received a not      qualified rating from the California Judicial Commission when she      was nominated for the California Supreme Court in 1996 because of      her tendency to interject her political and philosophical views      into her opinions and complaints that she was insensitive to      established legal precedent  had difficulty grasping complex civil      litigation  lacked compassion and intellectual tolerance for      opposing views  misunderstood legal standards and was slow to      produce opinions     JANICE ROGERS BROWN  IN HER OWN WORDS Janice      Rogers Brown on American Government Some things are      apparent  Where government moves in  community retreats  civil

American constitutionalism over the next three quarters of a      century  Its effect was not simply to repudiate  both      philosophically and in legal doctrine  the framers conception of
