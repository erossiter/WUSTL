       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Senate s Failure To Proceed With   The Debate On The Immigration Reform Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Senates Failure To Proceed    With The Debate On The Immigration Reform Bill    June 28  2007 I supported keeping     the legislative process alive instead of punting these decisions farther     down the field  The chance of producing a sensible  workable and     comprehensive reform plan is better than the certainty of an immigration     system that isnt working  There were good solutions and bad solutions     in this bill  but pulling the plug now ends the hope of improving the     bill to make it better  Todays immigration treadmill isnt good for     anyone  including for Vermont dairy farmers  who have had to cope with     this broken system for far too long
