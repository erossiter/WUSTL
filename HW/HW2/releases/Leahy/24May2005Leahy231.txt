       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Bipartisan Agreement To Avert   Vote On The Nuclear Option                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Reaction Of Senator      Patrick Leahy      On The Bipartisan      Agreement To Avert Vote On The Nuclear Option      May 23  2005  With this agreement  the Senate      remains a viable check against an abuse of power and the Republican      majoritys bid for one party rule  The nuclear option has been      averted  preserving the crucial rights of the minority that have      been a hallmark of the Senate for more than 200 years  I appreciate      the hard work of the bipartisan group of 14 Senators who prevented      the Republican majority leader from pulling the trigger on the      nuclear option and forever changing the Senates constitutional      advice and consent role    I hope the White House will heed this      message from the Senate and consult with us in a meaningful way on      judicial nominations  This process starts with the President  If he      would work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to identify and      nominate consensus choices  we will easily add to the tally of 208      confirmations  If the White House will consult with us on important      vacancies we can make significant progress  and I hope we can      achieve that
