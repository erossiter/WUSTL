Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday authorized Chairman Patrick      Leahy  D Vt         in consultation with the Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa    to      issue subpoenas to 11 current and former Department of Justice      officials as part of the panels ongoing investigation into the      unprecedented firings      of eight prosecutors last year    Just a few weeks ago this      Administration s Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General failed      to tell Congress the whole truth about this matter while under      oath  Their explanations have not held up and now we have the      resignation    or firing    of the Attorney Generals Chief of      Staff  said Leahy  I hope they cooperate  but this is too important to      trust to hope  This is an Administration with a serious credibility      problem  By authorizing subpoenas  the Committee maintains the      flexibility it needs to move ahead with its investigation and pursue      the truth    We have asked for Administration      officials and now former officials to cooperate with the Committee       and I hope that they will  If they cooperate  we will not need to      issue subpoenas  But we did not start to get the truth from the      Department or the Administration until we put subpoena      authorizations on the Committees agenda  Leahy added  Through the Committees oversight work      so far  we now know some of the answers to many questions we have      been asking  and the answers are not good    The authorization approved Thursday      covers five Department of Justice officials and six fired U S       Attorneys  The Department of Justice officials are  Kyle Sampson       former Chief of Staff of the Department of Justice  Michael Elston       Chief of Staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty  William      Mercer  Acting Associate Attorney General  Monica Goodling  Counsel      to the Attorney General and White House Liaison  Michael Battle       former Director of

officials at its business      meeting next week  Those White House officials are  Karl Rove       Deputy Chief of Staff to the President  Harriet E  Miers  former      White House Counsel  and William Kelley  Deputy Counsel to the      President   Below is Chairman      Leahys statement from the Committees Executive Business Meeting      earlier today     Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On Authorization For Subpoenas For The U S  Attorney Investigation     March 15  2007   Over the last several months  the      Judiciary Committee has used the tools at its disposal    hearings       investigation and oversight    to uncover an abuse of power that      threatens the independence of U S  Attorneys offices around the      country and the trust of all Americans  We have probed the mass      firings of eight U S  Attorneys and are trying to get to the truth      in order to prevent these kinds of abuses from happening again        In the next few days  I hope the      Senate will finally debate and adopt the Feinstein Specter Leahy      substitute favorably reported by this Committee to the Senate last      month  Senator Feinstein entitled the bill Preserving United States      Attorney Independence Act of 2007  She was right  We need to      close the loophole exploited by the Department of Justice and the      White House that enabled this abuse to occur  For more than a      month  some have blocked consideration of this bill on the floor  We      sought consent to proceed on February 15th and there was      objection  Senator Feinstein even sought to offer it as an      amendment to S 4 but  again  there was objection    What we have learned this week in the      few documents we have seen from the Department of Justice shows that      officials at the Department and the White House chose to exploit      this authority to make an end run around the Senate  It is time to      roll back the change in law that has contributed to this abuse        But that is not the end of our job       Every time we learn more details about the ouster of these U S       Attorneys the story grows more troubling  Had we stopped asking      questions after the testimony of the Attorney General and other      Department officials  we would not know the truth   The White House and the Attorney      General have dodged Congresss questions and ducked real      accountability  In the past they have counted on a rubberstamping      Congress to avoid accountability  I trust that we will work      together in bipartisanship to get to the bottom of this   The Attorney General has admitted      mistakes were made  but he and the White House continue to stand      by their actions  which have done so much to undercut the      independence of federal law enforcement and to besmirch the      reputations of former Bush appointees  The President of the United      States and the Attorney General are not living up to their      responsibility for setting the moral standard for this      Administration    I made no secret during our      confirmation proceedings of my concern whether Mr  Gonzales could      serve as an independent Attorney General of the United States on      behalf of the American people and leave behind his role as counselor      to President Bush  The Department of Justice should serve the      American people by making sure the law is enforced without fear or      favor  It should not be a political wing of the White House   Where is the accountability  For six      years accountability has been lacking in this Administration       Loyalty to the President is rewarded over all else  That lack of      accountability  and lack of the checks and balances that foster it       must end  We do not need another commendation for the heckuva job      done by those who have failed in their essential duties to the      American people  True accountability means being forthcoming and      there being consequences for bad actions   The Department finally has provided      some limited factual information to us and our House Judiciary      counterparts  The factual record remains incomplete  however       despite our best efforts  We do not have an agreement on witnesses      and the incomplete set of documents we have received so far are      redacted  leaving us without highly relevant information about the      firings  We have received no documents or assurances that witnesses      would be produced by the White House  The Justice Department and      the White House have worn out the benefit of the doubt after so many      shifting explanations and excuses and a lack of accountability or      acknowledgement of the seriousness of this matter  It erodes      credibility and undermines accountability when an Administration so      cavalierly handles its responsibility to provide honest oversight      answers to the Legislative Branch and to this Committee     On Tuesday  we witnessed the Attorney      General himself claiming lack of personal knowledge and the need for      an investigation to get to the bottom of this affair  Of course his      pronouncement came almost two months after he had testified under      oath before this Committee rather definitively that there was no      cause for concern  The Senate Judiciary Committee opened the door      to the truth by beginning this investigation and performing real      oversight  I thank Senator Schumer for chairing our hearings  As I      have said over the last few days  the Committee will summon whoever      is needed to get to the bottom of this   We have asked for Administration      officials and now former officials to cooperate with the Committee      and I hope that they will  If they cooperate  we will not need to      issue subpoenas  But we did not start to get the truth from the      Department or the Administration until we put subpoena      authorizations on our agenda last week    Just a few weeks ago this      Administration s Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General failed      to tell Congress the whole truth about this matter while under      oath  Their explanations have not held up and now we have the      resignation    or firing    of the Attorney Generals Chief of      Staff  I hope they cooperate  but this is too important to trust to      hope  This is an Administration with a serious credibility problem       By authorizing subpoenas  the Committee maintains the flexibility      it needs to move ahead with its investigation and pursue the truth        Through the Committees oversight work      so far  we now know some of the answers to many questions we have      been asking  and the answers are not good    We have asked why the Administration      has removed U S  Attorneys and not had nominees lined up to replace      them  We have asked why home state Senators were not consulted in      advance  We have asked why there are now 22 districts with acting      or interim U S  Attorneys instead of Presidentially appointed       Senate confirmed U S  Attorneys  This includes the districts of all      eight of the U S  Attorneys fired recently without cause  Yet the      White House has nominated only three people for these 22 spots        We have learned that most of the U S       Attorneys that were asked to resign were doing their jobs well and      were fired for not bending to the political will of some in      Washington  Apparently  their reward for their efforts at rooting      out serious public corruption is an unprecedented pink slip          So many critical questions remain  Why were these women and men      replaced when several had significant achievements in office and      glowing performance reviews  And why have their reputations been      stained by those seeking to justify these firings as performance      related  Were they simply too independent for this Administration       What were the real motivations for their firings  Who within the      Administration were the moving forces behind the mass firings and      who was involved  What involvement did the White House have in the      legislative process that allowed this abuse of power to occur   I hope all Senators share the desire      to get answers to these questions and many others as soon as      possible  The progress we have made has only come since we put      subpoenas on the agenda last week  We should authorize the subpoena      authority we need to follow through and get to the bottom of the      matter  Given the revelations in the press over the past few days      we have added the Attorney Generals successor as White House      Counsel  her associate White House Counsel and Karl Rove  the      Presidents deputy chief of staff  to the authorizations  I hope to      obtain their cooperation and all relevant information without having      to utilize subpoenas  Having the authority from the Committee to      proceed  as needed  will be helpful in that regard
