       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Executive Business Meeting    Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting     Immigration Reform     March 27  2006  We will turn our attention this      morning to the fundamental issue of whether our bill will include a      path toward earned citizenship for the many undocumented immigrants      in the country  This should be the focus of the Committees      attention today  and we should seek to make progress and vote  The      peaceful demonstrations around the country over the last several      days indicate the need for us to recognize the human dignity of all      and do the right thing   It will be a difficult debate today      because some do not want resolution of this matter  nor do they want      a comprehensive approach to immigration  Democrats have long      supported effective enforcement  I was among those who pushed for      added enforcement along the Northern Border as well as our Southern      Border over the last several years and have voted to provide the      resources necessary to make those commitments a reality  It is the      Bush Cheney Administration that has at times been the impediment to      the hiring and training of the additional Border Patrol agents we      have sought to require legislatively  It is striking and      disappointing just how distant the President and his Administration      have been in these days as congressional Republicans have resisted      comprehensive immigration reform  I have not seen or heard from      them and they have not weighed in to make their early rhetoric a      reality    Many members of this Committee have      said the right things  We have already talked about the dangers of      creating a permanent underclass and the need to avoid that  We have      agreed that those undocumented immigrants already in the country do      not get to cut to the front of the line but  in accordance with the      bipartisan plan that Senator  Kennedy has offered  will need to pay      fines  pay taxes  work hard  and wait in line for green cards and      earn their way on a path to adjusted status and citizenship  Today      we need to adopt that proposal in a bipartisan way  Democrats will      not be able to do it alone  We need to provide an orderly system      for immigration that is consistent with traditional American      values  We have already shown our willingness to toughen border      security  Immigrants who are here working and paying taxes and not      committing crimes are ready to abide by the rules  Immigrants serve      on active duty in our Armed Forces  We need to fix our immigration      system  We need a comprehensive solution to a national problem  We      need a fair  realistic and reasonable system    I am here to join in what I hope will      be a bipartisan effort to make real progress on the fundamental      issues that need to be considered if we are to have comprehensive      immigration legislation this year  The President has talked about a      guest worker program for years  but there has been no action by the      Republican Congress  Farmers in  Vermont and across the country need      help  Immigrants are hopeful that we will reaffirm the promise that      America has long represented with our Statue of Liberty and its      inspiring words of hope and comfort to the oppressed and      downtrodden    I am disappointed that the Republican      leader has decided to circumvent the Committee  Recently  The New York Times      included an editorial entitled Immigrations Moment  in which it      quite rightly noted that this is a pivotal week in the search for      answers for the nations immigration problems  This is the pivotal      day and pivotal morning in that search  I ask that a copy of that      editorial be included in the record    Mr  Chairman  I hope that this morning      we follow through on the discussion we signaled and began at our      earlier meetings  You said  and I believe you  that you do not want      to create a permanent underclass  Many of us have spoken about the      need to bring people out of the shadows  Today is the day for us to      amend the Committee bill to make those purposes a reality  for      Republicans and Democrats to join together in achieving that goal       Thousands are watching and listening  and thousands more depend on      our following through on those commitments
