       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary   Committee  Eminent Domain Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Eminent Domain Hearing     September 20  2005 Mr  Chairman       Vermont was the first state to include a takings clause in its      Constitution  so we Vermonters stand second to none in our respect      for private property rights   The language of      the Vermont Constitution  and our U S  Constitution  make clear      there are times when private property can appropriately be used for      public purposes  so long as the taking is for a truly public use      and so long as the owners receive just compensation  The most      difficult question is what constraints and procedures should control      the exercise of this significant power  But even      where the justification is widely understood    for example  to      build a needed highway    that will not alleviate the pain felt by      property owners who are in the path of that highway  Multiply that      pain over and over again when families are displaced from their      homes  Ms  Kelo  I am      one of probably millions of Americans who were distressed when we      learned your story and who are concerned about what happened to      you   I intend to work      with others on this Committee to fashion some solutions  some      better  fairer and more sensible ways for local governments to use       and not use  the significant powers they have over property owners        It has been said      that tough cases make bad law  It could also be said that bad law      can lead to bad remedies  As we work on solutions  we must use care      and caution and foresight  as well as hindsight   I have heard      about legislative proposals to address this decision which could      potentially benefit land speculators wanting to make a quick buck or      major corporations wanting to gain more power to seize private      property to install pipelines  create utility rights of way  or even      to build privately owned for profit facilities such as baseball      stadiums   I am also      concerned about people like Ms  Kelo even when their land is taken      for completely legitimate public uses  The distress a family      suffers from having their home condemned can be just as painful if      it is taken to build a road or a school  The Uniform      Relocation Act  which applies to federal use of eminent domain      powers  contains some useful ideas that could improve fairness and      help affected families   I have one final      point  Mr  Chairman  When Congress exercises its power to impose      new conditions on local and state governments in areas that local      and state governments have traditionally handled  we should move      cautiously to prevent unintended consequences   I know that many       many states are already acting to impose additional restrictions and      establish new procedures governing the use of the eminent domain      power  As we act in Congress  we should do so with respect for and      awareness of the remedies the states are also considering  I want      to thank the members of this panel   I hope that      Professor Merrill of Columbia University Law School  Mayor Perez of      Hartford  Connecticut  and Professor Eagle of George Mason      University will help the Committee in figuring out solutions to the      problems which will be highlighted by other members of the panel
