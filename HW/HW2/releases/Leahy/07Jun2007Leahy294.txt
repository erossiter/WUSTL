       Bipartisan Coalition Of Senators And Representatives Asks President To    Unlock  Hometown Heroes Benefits                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Bipartisan Coalition Of Senators And    Representatives   Asks President To Unlock Hometown Heroes Benefits    In Three And A Half Years Since Act Became Law  Only 6 Claims Approved WASHINGTON  June 7   A    bipartisan group of 101 Members of Congress  led by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      and Rep  Bob Etheridge  D N C    Thursday asked President Bush to direct    the Department of Justice to award benefits authorized by Congress under the    Hometown Heroes Survivor Benefits Act  More than three and a half years    after the bill    first introduced by Etheridge in the House and Leahy in    the Senate    became law  the Justice Department has approved only six    claims out of nearly 260 applications   We find it unacceptable that this situation remains    unresolved  especially since many of these claims have been held up for more    than three years  said Leahy  It is time for the President to direct the    Department of Justice to award the families of brave public safety officers    who die from heart attacks or strokes their rightful benefits under the law    by expediting all of the outstanding claims  The bureaucratic    foot dragging must end  Despite the clearly expressed intent of Congress     the U S  Department of Justice has only approved six claims under the    Hometown Heroes law  said Etheridge  Our first responders face stressful    and strenuous situations everyday as they work to protect our communities     They deserve no less than our full support in ensuring their families are    cared for when they make the ultimate sacrifice  In their letter to the    President  25 senators and 76 representatives ask the President to direct    his Administration to expedite all outstanding claims and ensure that    benefits are awarded in line with the intent of Congress  Leahy  Etheridge     Rep  John Conyers  D MI  and Rep  Bennie Thompson  D MS  sent a similar    letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in April  The law extends federal    survivor benefits to the families of firefighters  police officers and    emergency workers who die of heart attack or stroke in the line of    duty  Many families have been waiting for a decision from the department on    their claims since the bill became law in December 2003  In 2004     then Attorney General John Ashcroft mandated that Public Safety Officer    Benefit claims be processed in 90 days  The legislation was intended to create a presumption    that the heart attack or stroke was caused by work in the line of duty     unless there was clear evidence to the contrary  The Justice Department    instead has placed an unnecessary burden on applicants by requesting volumes    of paperwork  including 10 years of medical history  The lawmakers are    concerned that the Department of Justice may be intentionally    misinterpreting the direct  expressed intent of Congress and the President  Heart attacks and strokes account for nearly half of    firefighter deaths each year  A study published by the Harvard School of    Public Health on March 22 found that firefighters face a much higher risk of    death from a heart attack than the general population  up to 100 times    greater when battling a fire  Leahy and Etheridges original legislation    has the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police  the American    Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  the International    Association of Fire Fighters  the International Union of Police    Associations  and the Congressional Fire Services Institute
