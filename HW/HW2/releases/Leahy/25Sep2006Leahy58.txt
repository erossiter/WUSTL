       Judiciary Panel Considers Provisions Limiting Habeas Corpus In Military   Tribunal Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                    Judiciary Panel Considers Provisions    Limiting Habeas Corpus In Military Tribunal Bill     Leahy Urges Against Rubberstamping Controversial Measure       WASHINGTON  Monday  Sept  25     Below is the statement of Senator     Patrick Leahy   D Vt    from todays Judiciary Committee hearing on the     provisions included in the latest military tribunal bill to limit     Guantanamo detainees access to habeas corpus review  a cornerstone of     Americas legal and constitutional system  At the hearing  Leahy     highlighted the historic consequences of such measures  and urged     Congress not to rush through consideration of these sweeping and     profound proposals         Today  we are belatedly addressing the single most consequential     provision of this much discussed bill  a provision that can be found     buried on page 81 of the proposed bill  This provision would perpetuate     the indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals against whom the     Government has brought no charges and presented no evidence  without any     recourse to justice whatsoever  That is un American  and it is contrary     to American interests  Leahy said at the hearing   Also  Leahy  the ranking Democratic member     of the panel  sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales     inquiring about the 2002 rendition of Maher Arar  a Canadian and Syrian     citizen  from the United States to Syria  While held for 10 months in     Syria Arar was tortured  A Canadian commission recently concluded that     Arar was falsely labeled as a threat by Canadian officials and that U S      officials placed Mr  Arar on the terrorist watch list unnecessarily    The text of Leahys letter is below  A     is     available                Statement of Senator     Patrick Leahy    Ranking Member      Judiciary Committee   Hearing on Examining     Proposals to Limit Guantanamo Detainees Access to Habeas Corpus Review    September 25  2006    I     commend the Chairman for holding this hearing today on the provisions in     the proposed military commissions bill that would eliminate for     detainees the writ of habeas corpus  a cornerstone of our legal and     constitutional system  I wish this hearing could have taken place at a     time when more Senators could attend and when witnesses  Senators  and     staffs could have had time to prepare  This issue carries serious     consequences and deserves to be considered carefully     For     weeks now  politicians and the media have breathlessly debated the fine     points and political implications of the so called compromise on     proposed trial procedures for suspected terrorists  In doing so  we     have ignored a central and more sweeping issue  Important as the rules     for military commissions are  they will apply to only a few cases  The     Administration has charged a total of 10 people in the nearly five years     since the President declared his intention to use military commissions      and it recently announced plans to charge 14 additional men  But for     the vast majority of the almost 500 prisoners at Guantanamo  the     Administrations position remains as stated by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld     three years ago  It has no interest in trying them          Today we are belatedly addressing the single most consequential     provision of this much discussed bill  a provision that can be found     buried on page 81 of the proposed bill  This provision would perpetuate     the indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals against whom the     Government has brought no charges and presented no evidence  without any     recourse to justice whatsoever  That is un American  and it is contrary     to American interests         Going forward  the bill departs even more radically from our most     fundamental values  It would permit the President to detain     indefinitely  even for life  any alien  whether in the United States     or abroad  whether a foreign resident or a lawful permanent resident      without any meaningful opportunity for the alien to challenge his     detention  The Administration would not even need to assert  much less     prove  that the alien was an enemy combatant  it would suffice that the     alien was awaiting  a  determination on that issue  In other words      the bill would tell the millions of legal immigrants living in America      participating in American families  working for American businesses  and     paying American taxes  that our Government may at any minute pick them     up and detain them indefinitely without charge  and without any access     to the courts or even to military tribunals  unless and until the     Government determines that they are     not enemy combatants    Detained indefinitely  and unaccountably      until proven innocent  Like Canadian citizen Maher Arar  As the     Canadian Government recently concluded in a detailed and candid report      there is no evidence that Mr  Arar ever committed a crime or posed a     threat to U S  or Canadian security  Yet  while returning home to     Canada from a family vacation  he was detained  interrogated  and then     shipped off to a torture cell in Syria by the Bush Cheney     Administration While the Canadian Government has now documented that     the wrong thing was done to the wrong man  the Bush Cheney     Administration has  as usual  evaded all accountability by hiding behind     a purported state secrets privilege   The     Administrations defenders would like to believe that Mr  Arars case is     an isolated blunder  but it is not  Numerous press accounts have quoted     Administration officials who believe that a significant percentage of     those detained at Guantanamo have no connection to terrorism  In other     words  we have been holding for several years  and intend to hold     indefinitely without trial or any recourse to justice  a substantial     number of innocent people who were picked up by mistake in the fog of     war    The most important purpose of habeas     corpus is to correct errors like that  It is precisely to prevent such     abuses that the Constitution prohibits the suspension of the writ of     habeas corpus unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public     Safety may require it  I have no doubt that this bill  which would     permanently eliminate the writ of habeas for all aliens within and     outside the United States whenever the Government says they might be     enemy combatants  violates that prohibition  And I have no doubt that     the Supreme Court would ultimately conclude that this attempt by the     Bush Cheney Administration to abolish basic liberties and evade     essential judicial review and accountability is unconstitutional       It would be utterly irresponsible for     Congress to neglect our oath to the Constitution and the American people     and pass this unconstitutional legislation in the hope that the Court     will ultimately rescue us from our folly  Doing so would only undermine     the War on Terror by prolonging the legal limbo into which the     Administration has dragged the entire regime of military detentions   We     should have put military detentions on a solid legal footing and     established military tribunals four years ago  I introduced a bill in     2002 to authorize military commissions  So did Senator Specter  But     the White House and the Republican leadership ignored us  choosing     instead to roll the dice and hope that it could prevail on its radical     go it alone theories of presidential power      The     Bush Cheney Administration got a rude awakening earlier this year in the    Hamdan case  The Supreme     Court    which happens to include seven Republican appointees in its     nine Justices    affirmed what we had told it all along  when the     terrorists brought down the Twin Towers on 9 11  they did not bring down     the rule of law on which our system of Government is founded  They did     not supplant our republican form of Government with one in which an     unaccountable Executive can imprison people forever without trial or     judicial review      On     its way to losing that case  the Administration wasted four years      Actually  it did more than waste four years  Just yesterday the press     reported what the Administration has been misrepresenting to the     American people and what was apparently confirmed in a National     Intelligence Estimate  that the invasion and continuing U S  military     presence in Iraq has created a new generation of anti American     terrorists  that the terrorist threat against the U S  has grown and      according to intelligence officials that the Iraq war has made the     overall terrorism problem worse  Meanwhile  having failed to try a     single detainee  and having failed to secure a conviction of a single     terrorist offense  the Administration is demanding that we pass a bill     it drafted last week before the end of this week    The     Administrations sudden and belated haste to move ahead makes no sense      other than as a matter of crass electoral politics  We are taking a     first look at a bill that the Administration claims is central to the     decisive ideological battle of the 21st Century  a bill that     would suspend habeas corpus for the first time since the Civil War  and     a bill that  if enacted  will almost certainly be used by Americas     enemies as a pretext for the torture and indefinite detention without     judicial review of Americans abroad      If     the Administration and the Republican leadership of the Senate believe     that suspending the writ is constitutional and justified  they should     grant the joint request that Chairman Specter and I made last week for a     sequential referral of the bill  Constitutional issues involving the     writ of habeas corpus are at the center of this Committees     jurisdiction  We can and should review this legislation thoroughly  and     if a few habeas petitions are filed in the meantime  we will not lose     the War on Terror as a result of those filings  If this Congress votes     to suspend the writ of habeas corpus first and ask questions later      liberty and accountability will be the victims                     Below     is a letter Senator Leahy sent to Attorney General Gonzales regarding     the case of Canadian citizen Maher Arar   September 22  2006  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales    Attorney General    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW      Washington      DC 20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   I write to inquire again about the     rendition of Maher Arar  a Canadian and Syrian citizen  from the United     States to Syria in 2002  I have made several inquires to your     predecessor and other officials in the Bush Administration about Mr      Arars case over the years  with no satisfactory response    In 2002  Mr  Arar was stopped by     immigration officials at John F  Kennedy International Airport as he was     attempting to change planes on his flight home to Canada from vacation     in Tunisia  Press reports at the time indicated that Mr  Arar was not     provided legal counsel because he was not an American citizen  Mr  Arar     also repeatedly told U S  officials that he feared he would be tortured     if returned to Syria  After being held for two weeks in a federal     detention center  Mr  Arar was handed over to U S  intelligence     officials who then flew him to Jordan and transported him to Syria  He     was released in 2003 and returned to Canada  after more than 10 months     of imprisonment in Syria  Syrian officials found no evidence that he     had any connection to terrorism    As you know  earlier this week a Canadian     commission charged with investigating Mr  Arars deportation to Syria      concluded that Canadian intelligence agents falsely labeled Mr  Arar as     a threat and that U S  officials placed Mr  Arar on the terrorist     watchlist unnecessarily  The commission found in its report that     while he was detained in Syria for more than 10 months  Mr  Arar was     interrogated  tortured and held in degrading and inhumane conditions     to such a degree that he falsely confessed to attending a terrorist     training camp in Afghanistan    Furthermore  public reports indicate that     the United States refused to cooperate with the commission and denied     requests for documents and testimony surrounding the case     The Department of Justice has declined to     answer my prior inquiries about Mr  Arars case other than to say that     the matter was the subject of ongoing litigation  and the Department     could not comment    However  in light of the report from     Canadas Arar Commission  you recently publicly commented on this     matter  During a press conference earlier this week  when asked if the     Department of Justice owes Mr  Arar an apology  you responded    We     were not responsible for  Mr  Arars  removal to Syria  Im not aware     that he was tortured  and I havent read the Commission report  Mr      Arar was deported under our immigration laws  He was initially detained     because his name appeared on terrorist lists  and he was deported     according to our laws   A clarification was quickly issued     Wednesday by the Justice Department  saying that you had  your      timeline mixed up  and that you forgot that at the time of Mr  Arars     deportation  such matters were still handled by the Immigration and     Naturalization Service  not the Department of Homeland Security where     deportation matters are currently held  according to news reports       You also said in your press conference     that Mr  Arars transfer to Syria was a deportation  not a rendition   And     even if it was a rendition  we understand as a government what our     obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this     government to another country  and that is that we seek to satisfy     ourselves that they will not be tortured   And if in fact he had been     rendered to Syria  we would have sought those same kind of assurances      as we do in every case   Since you have spoken publicly about this     matter  I trust that you will now be able to provide a complete     explanation for the United States governments actions in relation to     Mr  Arar  I request that you please provide detailed answers to the     following questions   1      If  in fact  Mr  Arar was deported  as you     have asserted  why was it necessary to deport him  since he had a     Canadian passport and was on his way back to Canada   2      You said that this was a deportation  not     a rendition  If so  given that Mr  Arar  a Canadian citizen  resides in     Canada and was traveling home to Canada when he was detained at the     airport  why did United States officials choose not to turn him over to     Canadian authorities or deport him to Canada  Why was Mr  Arar deported     instead to Syria  which makes less sense  is more logistically     difficult  and costs more   3      Was Mr  Arar denied access to an attorney     while in United States custody  as he has alleged  Was he given access     to Canadian consular officials while in United States custody   4      The Canadian commission examining this     case found that the Canadian intelligence labeling Mr  Arar a threat was     faulty and that he was unnecessarily placed on our governments     terrorist watchlist  On what intelligence and what authority was Mr      Arar originally held  Has the Justice Department reviewed the     intelligence that provided the basis for holding him  What was the     result of any such review   5      Under U S  law  non citizens who express     concerns about torture if removed are entitled to an evaluation of their     claim before being removed  Under the specific regulations that were     likely applied to Mr  Arars removal  there is an explicit prohibition     against returning someone to a country where there are substantial     grounds for believing he would be subjected to torture  Did Mr  Arar     tell United States officials  as he has claimed  that he would be     tortured if taken to Syria  Was that claim evaluated  What were the     results of any such evaluation  What process was used  if any  to     determine the likelihood that Mr  Arar would be subject to torture if     removed to Syria   6      Were any assurances in fact given by Syria     that it would not torture Mr  Arar  If so  what were they   7      Canadas Arar Commission concluded that he     was tortured in Syria and held in degrading and inhumane conditions      Has the United States attempted to determine whether these conclusions     are correct   8      Why did the United States government     apparently choose not to cooperate with Canadas investigation   9      If the commissions conclusions are     correct  then any assurances given by Syria that it would not torture     Mr  Arar were dishonest  and Syrias conduct was consistent with its     past record of engaging in torture  What steps has the United States     government taken to ensure that others who are the subject of rendition      or deportation  will not be tortured  regardless of any assurances given     by governments with a history of torturing prisoners   10   Please provide a full explanation of the     United States governments conduct in connection with the arrest      detainment  rendition  and or deportation of Mr  Arar  along with any     investigation the government has conducted about the case and any     cooperation the United States government has provided  or declined to     provide  to foreign governments investigating the case   Thank you for your prompt answers to these     questions   Sincerely   _______________________  PATRICK J  LEAHY
