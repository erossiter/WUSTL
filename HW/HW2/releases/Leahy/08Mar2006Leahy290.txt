       New Bill By Leahy And Others Seeks To Restore Privacy And Civil   Liberties Protections To PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          New Bill By Leahy And Others Seeks To      Restore     Privacy And Civil Liberties Protections To PATRIOT Act  Bipartisan Bill Takes Aim At Measures     Pushed By Bush Administration That Weakened Key Protections   WASHINGTON  Wednesday  March 8        Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the ranking Democratic member of the      Judiciary Committee  has joined in writing and introducing a bill to      restore key privacy and civil liberties protections to the      just passed PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill   Leahy  who coauthored the      original USA PATRIOT Act in 2001  teamed up with leading Democratic      and Republican senators including Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen      Specter  R Pa    John Sununu   R N H   and Russell Feingold  D Wis        on a bill that would strengthen civil liberties protections weakened      as a result of changes pushed by the Bush Cheney Administration       including a provision that delayed any judicial review of gag orders      for one year  Leahys bill would eliminate the mandatory one year      waiting period before challenging a gag order in court   The senators introduced the bill       S  2369  on Monday   Reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act      was a far more difficult and painful process than it should have      been because of the partisan tactics and unchecked and unbalanced      changes pushed by the Bush Administration  said Leahy  This      bipartisan bill makes commonsense improvements to key provisions in      the PATRIOT Act that weakened privacy and civil liberties      protections that every American has the right to expect  Leahy was one of 10 senators who      voted against the recent reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act because      of provisions that weakened these key protections  Other features of the bipartisan      improvement bill include   n     Changing the standard for      obtaining secret court orders under section 215 so that the      government is required to show a connection to a suspected terrorist      or spy before obtaining private  confidential information such as      library and medical records   n     Restoring the pre PATRIOT Act      rule  adopted by the Senate  that notice of   sneak and peek        searches may be delayed for no more than 7 days unless extended  n     Adding a 4 year sunset to the      National Security Letter authorities created in the conference      report               Leahys Statement      on Introduction of the Bill   Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On The PATRIOT Act Reauthorization     And Introduction Of PATRIOT Act Improvement Bill     March 6  2006 Mr  President  the PATRIOT Act      reauthorization legislation that the Senate voted on last week has      serious flaws and troubling omissions  I have spent several months      working closely with Members from both parties in an attempt to      improve these defects  Even after the Bush administration and      congressional Republicans hijacked the House Senate conference  I      tried to get this measure back on the right track  Working with a      bipartisan group of Senators  we were able to achieve some      improvements  I regret that the final package is not better and that      the intransigence of the administration has prevented a better bill      with better protections for the American people   I remain committed to working to      provide the tools that we need to protect the American people  That      includes working to provide the oversight and checks needed on the      uses of Government power and to improve the current reauthorization      of the PATRIOT Act  I am therefore pleased to join Senators Specter       Sununu  Craig  Feingold and others in introducing a bill to improve      the reauthorization legislation in several important respects       Most importantly  the Specter Leahy      bill corrects one of the most egregious   police state   provisions      regarding gag orders  The Bush Cheney administration used the last      round of discussions with Republican Senators to make the gag order      provisions worse  in my view  by forbidding any court challenge for      1 year  There is no justification for this mandatory waiting period      for judicial review  and our bill eliminates it  Our bill also      eliminates provisions that allow the Government to ensure itself of      victory by certifying that  in its view  disclosure   may   endanger      national security or   may   interfere with diplomatic relations       These un American restraints on meaningful judicial review are      unfair  unjustified  and completely unacceptable   I sought to make these changes to      the gag orders provisions in an amendment I filed to Senator      Sununus bill  S  227l  which modified the conference report in      various respects  Senator Feingold filed other amendments aimed at      bringing the conference report more in line with the bipartisan      reauthorization bill that every Member of the Senate approved last      year  Regrettably  the majority leader chose to prevent any effort      to offer amendments to S  227l and effectively stifled open debate       In addition to fixing the gag order      provisions  the Specter Leahy bill adopts the Senate passed standard      for obtaining secret court orders under section 215 of the PATRIOT      Act  Under this standard  the Government can obtain private       confidential records such as library and medical records only if      there is some connection between those records and a suspected      terrorist or spy  The Specter Leahy bill also restores the pre       PATRIOT Act rule  adopted by the Senate  that notice of   sneak and      peek   searches may be delayed for no more than 7 days unless      extended  The conference report sets a 30 day rule for the initial      delay  more than three times what the Senate  and pre  PATRIOT Act      courts  deemed appropriate  Finally  the Specter Leahy bill adds a 4      year sunset to the national security letter authorities created in      the conference report  This sunset provision  like those included in      the original PATRIOT Act at the insistence of myself and House      Majority Leader Dick Armey  would facilitate oversight and ensure      accountability for the use of these administrative subpoena      authorities   Reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act      has been a more difficult and far more painful process than it      should have been  Under the leadership of Chairman Specter  the      Judiciary Committee managed in just a few weeks to produce a      bipartisan bill that passed the Senate unanimously  The House Senate      conference took a different course and produced a bill that Members      on both sides of the aisle found unacceptable  It has been improved       but critical problems remain  The Specter Leahy bill corrects the      worst of these problems  and I will work with the chairman to enact      these commonsense reforms before the end of the year
