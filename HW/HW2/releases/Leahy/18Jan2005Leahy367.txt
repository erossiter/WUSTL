       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Written Replies By Attorney   General Nominee Alberto Gonzales                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Comment         Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt           Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         On The Written Replies        By Attorney General Nominee Alberto Gonzales        To Committee Members Confirmation Hearing Questions        Tuesday  January 18  2005  This was another missed opportunity for        straight answers and accountability  I regret seeing Judge Gonzales fall        into the same pattern of stonewalling and non cooperation that we have seen        far too often from this Administration and from the current attorney        general    I gave Judge Gonzales many questions well in        advance of the hearing so there would be no surprises  and he still        declined to give straight answers to most of them  His answers during the        hearing were largely unresponsive  Now his answers to written questions        after the hearing  with few exceptions  again are either vague         unresponsive or AWOL    I will carefully review his written answers        and decide how to proceed  Judge Gonzales gives the impression that he        feels that he does not have to substantively answer questions before his        confirmation  even though he wants to be Attorney General of the           United States  That is unfortunate  because the most important question        hanging over this nomination is the question of accountability
