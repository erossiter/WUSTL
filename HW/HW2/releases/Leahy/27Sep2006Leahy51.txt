       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy About Retiring Sen  Jim Jeffords                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Remarks Of Sen  Patrick     Leahy  D Vt      About Retiring Sen  Jim Jeffords  I Vt      Senate Floor    September 27  2006 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I have listened to my friend     Jim Jeffords  the Senator from     Vermont speak here this morning  I couldn t help but think as I heard     Senator Jeffords speak with wit and     clarity  and you might say even some emotion  that    Jim Jeffords  given the opportunity     to make a speech  and many of us will do so on this Senate floor as we     leave  did it being true to himself  with his own good nature  his own     sense of history  and his own justifiable pride in what he has     accomplished   I have known Jim Jeffords from     his days as a State senator in Rutland  I have known his wonderful wife      Liz Daley Jeffords  They are both dear friends of mine and my wife     Marcelle  Mrs  Jeffords was referred to as a great lady the other night     by the anchor of our State s largest TV station   Some of us who have known Jim for     years would say she gets that greatness for putting up with him for all     these years  But we Vermonters found no difficulties in putting up with    Jim Jeffords  He has been elected     overwhelmingly to the offices he has held and he has done it with     support from Republicans  Democrats  and Independents alike  He has     gotten these votes the old fashioned way  he earned them   We came here together 32 years ago  I like to talk about the Leahys     coming to Vermont in the 1850s  Jim     reminds me his family came to Vermont a century before  We both live in     small towns in Vermont  we have had that sense of Vermont  He has never     lost it  He has been a good friend   His career highlights are legendary  Let me tell you why he is     supported so  First and foremost  Senator     Jeffords is known as an environmental champion  In Vermont  they     say  If you scratch a Vermonter you scratch an environmentalist  no     matter the party   He has done it in the great tradition of Senator Bob Stafford      Senator Bob Stafford is also from the same county as    Jim Jeffords  actually    Jim grew up near him  He mentioned     Bob today   He carved out a legend on education and the environment when he was     here  But then Jim Jeffords had done     that as attorney general and as a State senator in our State  For the     past three decades he has left his fingerprints on nearly every     environmental law enacted  from the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water     Act to the Superfund program to acid rain reduction   In fact  when others in his position would be thinking about where     are the papers going and how will we retire  just a matter of months ago     he offered the boldest solution to combat global climate change this     body has ever considered   He has championed legislation to strengthen our Nation s education     system and increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities      In 1975  as a brandnew Member of the House of Representatives  as he     said  coming in with a neck brace  the walking wounded from an election     where both of us ran in Vermont  he coauthored what would later be known     as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA  It was     strongly supported by his colleagues here in the Senate and before that     in the House  It has provided equal access to education for millions of     students with disabilities  students who otherwise would have been     shunted aside and this country would not have had the value of their     achievements   As chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pension Committee  he     worked tirelessly on education  job training  and disability     legislation  Most recently  his leadership in the Senate Environment and     Public Works Committee was essential to the passage of the highway bill      Of course  Vermont and the rest of the country will benefit from that      I might say there has been no greater leader for Vermont s dairy     industry than Senator Jeffords  In     his work on the Northeast Dairy Compact and the milk programs  he has     fought tough battles for Vermont dairies  and won  He actually knows as     much about our dairy industry as most dairy farmers   It is what he has done for future generations  All of us can talk     about what we do here  It is what we leave for our children and our     grandchildren that counts  Future generations of Vermonters will honor    Jim s legacy when they see the work     that he began as attorney general and continued throughout the     Senate  helping to restore Lake Champlain to its brilliance  its     magnificence  or witness the bald eagles abounding in the wilderness     areas  thanks to Jim   I applaud him for this statement as he takes leave of the     Senate  although it seems this year we will never know when we leave      None of us are getting our final airplane reservations yet  But he has     done it with his usual grace and good humor  I applaud him for that and     I hope all of us when we come to leave  whenever that may be  will have     the opportunity to show that same grace  He served Vermont well and      just as importantly  he served the Senate well   After a long career I might violate the rules somewhat  addressing my     friend and colleague directly  For a long career     Jim  you can leave with your head     held high  You have served Vermont and your Nation proudly   I yield the floor
