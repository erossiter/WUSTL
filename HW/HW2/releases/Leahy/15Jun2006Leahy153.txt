       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Kenneth Wainstein   To Be Assistant Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of  Kenneth Wainstein To Be      Assistant Attorney General For The National Security Section      Executive Business Meeting       June 15  2006  Today we consider a nominee for       the new position of Assistant Attorney General for the National       Security Division  All too often  in the Bush Cheney       Administration  national security has been cited as a       justification for overriding the rule of law and for imposing       unprecedented secrecy  With the acquiescence of the       Republican controlled Congress  this Administration may be the       most unresponsive in history and the most unaccountable   Ken Wainstein is President Bushs       selection to be the first Assistant Attorney General for       National Security  a new position created by Congress  I will       not oppose this nomination in the hope that Mr  Wainstein will       work with us and be responsive to the Senators on this       Committee    I have concerns about this       Administrations unilateral approach to national security       issues  Four years ago  the Office of Legal Counsel at the       Justice Department issued a secret legal opinion concluding that       the President of the United States had the power       to override domestic and international laws outlawing torture        The memo sought to redefine torture and asserted that the       President enjoys complete authority over the conduct of war       and asserted that application of the criminal law passed by       Congress prohibiting torture in a manner that interferes with       the presidents direction of such core war matters as the       detention and interrogation of enemy combatants would be       unconstitutional  It seemed to assert that the President could       immunize people from prosecution for violations of United States       criminal laws that prohibit torture  This Justice Department       memo was withdrawn only after it became public because it could       not withstand public scrutiny    We have learned through the media       of warrantless wiretapping and datamining conducted by this       Administration  This  despite the Foreign Surveillance       Intelligence Act and its express provisions and the actions on       the Senate in voting to curtail the datamining programs by       Admiral Poindexter at the Defense Department  We have yet to be       provided with a convincing legal justification for these       programs  We have yet to be able to investigate or hold the       Administration accountable  Instead  every effort at oversight       and accountability have been obstructed or curtailed by the       Administration  The Administration refuses to follow the law       and submit matters to the FISA court and claims state secrets to       force court challenges to be dismissed  The Administration       tells the Senate when  what and how it may investigate  The       Department of Justices own  internal Office of Professional       Responsibilitys probe of whether or not lawyers at the       Department violated ethical rules in justifying these activities       was shut down by the Attorney General and the White House         As this Administration continues       to expand its power  the Department of Justice should be       advising the President to obey the law and respect the Congress       and the courts  not just helping to rationalize actions and       forestall oversight    In theory  this new position might       help Department of Justice attorneys to act responsibly on       national security issues  rather than just to do the White       Houses bidding  It should put national security issues into       the hands of experts  not political cronies  In fact  the WMD       Commission recommended in March of last year that the different       components of the Departments dealing with national security        terrorism  counterintelligence  and foreign intelligence       surveillance be combined to eliminate deficiencies and       inefficiencies in the Departments national security efforts        Congress acted to create the post  This new Assistant Attorney       General position can only serve a useful role if the person who       occupies it is willing to think independently  This       Administration has consistently prized loyalty over independence       and expertise    Mr  Wainstein has some experience       as a prosecutor  but he has also been a loyal official of this       Administration for some time now  I hope that he will be able       to look at the crucial national security issues to be handled by       this new office with a critical eye and a view toward respecting       law and the Congress  If he does  he will be a breath of fresh       air in the Bush Cheney Administration    Recently the Chairman and I       received a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police  The FOP       endorsed Mr  Wainstein in order to facilitate his departure       from the U S  Attorneys Office  They criticized him for being       unwilling to perform the function of investigating and       prosecuting an alleged attack on a police officer  That is not       what I would term high praise for his judgment  I ask that a       copy of the letter be included in the record
