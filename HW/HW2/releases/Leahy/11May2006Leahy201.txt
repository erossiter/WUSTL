       Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Executive Business Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting      May 11  2006         Oversight  Domestic Spying  The USA Today Report          We did not accomplish much in the way of oversight this week        Despite the Attorney Generals continuing refusal to answer my      questions and others about the Governments collective massive      databases on ordinary Americans  we now are beginning to learn      the truth  USA TODAYs      front page headline reads  NSA has massive database of      Americans phone calls  This secret collection of phone call      records of tens of millions of Americans includes ordinary      Americans not suspected of any crime or any contact with al      Qaeda  The President concealed the NSA eavesdropping program      when he reassured all Americans that when this Administration      talks about a wiretap that requires a court ordered search      warrant  We now know that he had been having the NSA engage in      warrantless wiretaps Americans since October 2001  So while the      Administration has tried to reassure us about the NSA domestic      spying activities by characterizing them in the most narrow and      self serving terms  as if they were merely listening to Osama      bin Laden calling into the United States  I have had my      doubts  We need truthful answers to the questions we asked of      the Attorney General back in February  We need him to explain      his subsequent letter recasting his testimony  We need to know      what our Government is doing in its activities that spy upon      Americans  The Republican controlled Congress has failed in its      oversight responsibilities to the American people        Also today we learn that the Administration has shut down the      Department of Justice investigation into the NSA wiretapping      program that was to be conducted by the Office of Professional      Responsibility  Reports are that the White House will not allow      Justice Department investigators the security clearances they      need to do their job  This is an internal government      investigation that is being stymied by the White House  This      further complicates the nomination of Steven G  Bradbury  the      acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal      Counsel  and the person currently responsible for legal opinions      of the Attorney General and giving advice to the White House      Counsel and other Government agencies         What little we were able to accomplish this week came when Mr       Kavanaugh finally admitted that Karl Rove played a role in the      selection of judicial nominees        We need to do more in the way of oversight and to begin to hold      the Bush Cheney Administration accountable  I hope that with      these developments this Committee will finally have had enough      stonewalling and be ready to consider more effective action to      obtain the information we need  I will support it and I think      the Democratic Members of the Committee will support getting      answers to our questions  Joining together  Republican and      Democratic Members could insist upon responsive answers and      needed information to fulfill our constitutional      responsibilities to the American people  I hope that we will      follow through on these important matters and thoroughly      investigate what powers the President has secretly claimed and      how he has secretly used them to spy on Americans   Voting Rights    This week we proceeded with two      more hearings on our bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Voting      Rights Act  We should conclude our supplemental hearings next      week and proceed to report out the Voting Rights Act      reauthorization bill  S 2703  before Memorial Day  Our bill      already has 34 bipartisan cosponsors       Yesterday our House partners successfully reported the companion      bill  H R  9  from the House Judiciary Committee by a vote of 33      to 1  I predicted that some would attempt to undercut our      bicameral  bipartisan efforts and I worried that some might seek      to undermine the remedial provisions in Section 203 that help      language minorities achieve full participation in our      democracy  I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner  Representative      Conyers and the bipartisan membership of the House Committee for      rejecting amendments that would have gutted voter language      assistance   Yesterday we heard from witnesses      about the continuing importance of Section 203 to language      minorities  including testimony from a representative of the      Bush Administrations Justice Department emphasizing its efforts      in this regard and how valuable those provisions are  President      Bush has said that he wants to make sure the Voting Rights Act      is strong and capable and that it ought to be extended       Attorney General Gonzales has listed extending the Voting Rights      Act as one of the Department of Justices 2006 priorities and      said we will push for reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act       one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation      in our history  This is an important matter on which there is      bipartisan agreement     There are few things as critical      to the fabric of our Nation  and to American citizenship  as      voting  The right to vote and to have your vote count is a      foundational right because it secures the effectiveness of other      protections  The legitimacy of our government is dependent on      the access all Americans have to the political process  The      continuing need for the expiring provisions cannot be      overstated  Although there is sharp disagreement on the other      side of the aisle concerning immigration reform legislation  I      hope that we can all agree to reauthorize Section 5 and Section      203 to continue progress and inclusion of citizens from our      language minorities who add so much to American life      Immigration       It is my hope that we can  through the same sort of bipartisan      coalition  return to and enact fair and comprehensive      immigration legislation that strengthens our border enforcement      while providing a path to earned citizenship for so many who      work hard and want to contribute to our diversity and      productivity as a nation  I know that the Senate leaders have      been working on an agreement  I hope that we will turn to this      matter next week and use the next two weeks to make real      progress toward enacting a bill much like that reported by this      Committee several weeks ago     Gas Prices and Legislation   Two weeks ago we were able to      report to the Senate the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of      2006   S 2557   I had hoped that following completion of the      emergency supplemental appropriations bill  the Senate would      turn its attention to legislation like ours that seeks to help      alleviate the burdens on ordinary  hardworking Americans by the      record high prices for gas  Regrettably  that is not happening       Indeed  during consideration of the emergency supplemental the      Republican leadership refused to allow votes on energy related      initiatives    Although the bill that the      Republican leadership is promoting has been termed silly and      stupid by other Republicans  there are proposals that do make      sense and can make a difference  I wish there were a way to      have them considered     When President Bush took office       Americans could fill their cars on gasoline that cost  1 45 per      gallon  In less than six years  fuel prices have skyrocketed      more than 100 percent  more than doubled  The end is nowhere in      sight  unless we do something to help keep costs down  Over the      years I have warned about a gallon of gasoline costing  2 50 or       3  I fear  4 a gallon gasoline will be upon us all by summer         Health Care  Like gas prices  the cost of      health care and health insurance has also skyrocketed during the      past six years  Unfortunately  instead of considering proposals      to help those injured by medical errors or to bring      accountability and competition  we are again being prevented      from offering proposals by way of amendment on the Senate      floor  Much of last week and this have been spent in quorum      calls and morning business rather than working on serious      amendments and proposals to make a difference  Yesterday the      Majority leader filled the tree on another bill thereby      effectively preventing any votes on any amendments  I was eager      to propose our bill to bring federal antitrust laws to bear on      medical malpractice insurers in order to lower the costs of that      insurance  Those costs have been rising while payouts have      not  My proposal was to end the special interest protection for      big insurance and make them subject to our federal antitrust      laws and competition  In my view that antitrust exemption is      misguided and the sooner it ends the better for consumers and      those who purchase insurance  Senate Republicans continue to      forestall action on my proposal    Another proposal being blocked      would afford our seniors more time and assistance in examining      the prescription drug provisions that have frustrated so many       Seniors did not grow up in the computer age and many are not      trained accountants who can sift through the confusion  They      should not be penalized by an arbitrary cut off date which could      easily be extended
