       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On President Uribe s Visit And On   Funding For Plan Colombia                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Subcommittee On State And Foreign Operations     On President Uribes Visit And On Funding For Plan Colombia    Wednesday  May 2  2007   Sen  Patrick Leahy is the author of the annual certification     requirements attached to a portion of U S  military aid to Colombia and     chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that handles the Senates work in     putting together the annual State Department and foreign operations     budget  including spending for Plan Colombia  Leahy met Tuesday     with Mario Iguaran  Colombias Prosecutor General  and he will attend     Wednesdays Senate meeting with President Uribe  hosted in the Capitol     by Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell     We give more than a quarter of a billion U S  tax dollars to the     Colombian military each year  Three fourths of that aid is     provided with no conditions  Before the remaining fourth can be     released  the Secretary of State must certify that the Colombian     government and military are meeting several human rights conditions      These annual requirements have played a role in the progress we have     seen in Colombia on human rights  On April 5 Secretary Rice made     the most recent certification   I have withheld the release of those funds because I  and other     Members of Congress  are concerned about reports of paramilitary     infiltration of the Colombian government and military  as well as     extrajudicial executions by the military  These reports are not     new  but more information has recently surfaced  There are even     reports that the chief of the Army  General Montoya  commanded troops     who collaborated with paramilitaries  I do not know if these     reports are accurate  but we have an obligation to assure ourselves that     they are not  We do not want our aid to go to anyone with links to     paramilitaries  Uncovering the truth is important  and so is     acting on the truth   I have supported President Uribe for five years  I continue to     support him  and I want him to succeed  He has done much good for     his country  But that does not mean I agree with everything he     says or does  Nor does it mean that  as chairman of the     Appropriations panel that provides more than half a billion dollars to     Colombia each year  I am going to rubber stamp these funds the way the     previous Congress did   The Administration and the Congress have a fiduciary responsibility     to American taxpayers to use these dollars wisely and to take care that     U S  military aid is part of the solution  instead of perpetuating     Colombias problems   When Plan Colombia began  we were told it would cut by half the     amount of cocaine in five years  Six years and  5 billion later      it has not had any measurable effect on the amount of cocaine entering     our country  We need to assess what has worked  what has not     worked  and what we can reasonably expect to accomplish  We want     to support Colombia  and we will  But the new Congress is not     going to write a blank check the way the last Congress was
