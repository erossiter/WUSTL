       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Leslie Southwick To   The Fifth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Leslie Southwick To The Fifth Circuit    Executive Business Meeting     August 2  2007     Today I have put back on     the Committees agenda the controversial nomination of Leslie Southwick     to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  As     I have noted previously  I took the Southwick nomination off the agenda     at the request of Republican Senators  I refused to ambush Mr      Southwick the way Republicans ambushed Ronnie White in 1999 when they     voted him down  Instead  I alerted the White House and Senate     Republicans to the opposition and have tried to be constructive in     consulting with the White House  All of my good faith efforts in that     regard have been rejected   I had been waiting patiently  but in vain  to hear     back from interested Republican Senators and  in particular  those who     requested delay in the consideration of Mr  Southwicks nomination      Instead  several Republican Senators have complained publicly about the     delay that they themselves requested   This nomination has engendered significant     opposition  Those opposing this nomination include  the Leadership     Conference on Civil Rights  the Human Rights Campaign  the Mississippi     State Conference of the NAACP  the NAACP Legal Defense Fund  Lambda     Legal  the National Employment Lawyers Association  the Magnolia Bar     Association  the National Organization of Women  the National Urban     League  the AFL CIO  the Congressional Black Caucus  and many more  A     number of other Members of this Committee have shared with me their     concerns and doubts about this nomination  as well   I have given careful consideration to Mr      Southwicks record  With respect to the Richmond case  which has     been so much discussed  I note that Judge Southwick provided the     deciding vote  In my view  the Mississippi Supreme Court did the right     thing in reversing that decision and I commend them  There is no place     for the n word in the workplace or in use by a supervisor to and about     an employee  None   If  as Mr  Southwick now says  his view of the     Richmond case was the narrow  technical  legalistic one that he says     justifies his providing the deciding vote to the majority opinion  he     could have said so back then in a separate opinion  He could have noted     that he felt such use of the n word was inexcusable  but that he felt     constrained by his limited role on appeal to apply a standard of review     that compelled him to reverse Judge Graves of the Circuit Court and     reaffirm the Employee Appeals Boards reinstatement of the offending     supervisor with back pay  That is not what he did  however  In the     face of a cogent dissent  he provided the deciding vote to uphold the     decision excusing that remark   Likewise in the case of S B  v  L W  my     concern is not just that Judge Southwick joined the majority opinion but     that he went out of his way to sign on to a concurring opinion that     suggested that sexual orientation is an individual choice and an     individual must accept that losing the right of custody over ones child     is one of the consequences flowing from the free exercise of such     choice  I also have concerns about his approach in some     cases involving allegations of race discrimination in jury selection      such as his opinion in a 1997 case  Brock v  Mississippi     upholding a criminal conviction where the prosecution struck an African     American juror  purportedly because he lived in a high crime area  The     dissenting judge criticized Judge Southwicks opinion for accepting a     strike which on its face appears geared toward a racially identifiable     group  In another case involving jury discrimination  Bumphis v      State  1996   three judges criticized Judge Southwicks majority     opinion for establishing one level of obligation for the state  and a     higher one for defendants on an identical issue   His legal writing also points to a narrow view of     the role of the federal courts in upholding protections against race     discrimination  In one article  he found compelling a statement of a     Mississippi Supreme Court Justice that the judiciary is not the avenue     to effectuate the removal of the Confederate battle flag from public     property   I have questions whether he would be balanced in     protecting the rights of employees given the overwhelming number of     cases  160 out of 180 written decisions    in which he has offered a     narrow interpretation of the law to favor protecting business and     corporate interests at the expense of the rights of workers and     consumers  In one 1999 case  Dubard v  Biloxi  H M A       Judge Southwick authored a dissent expressing the virtues of a legal     doctrine that would allow employers to fire employees for any reason      even though such an analysis was not relevant in the case before him      My concerns about his bias are heightened by a law review article he     wrote characterizing litigation against tobacco companies led by former     Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore as destabilizing and posing     separation of powers concerns  I have thought long and hard about this nomination     and this is not a decision I come to easily  I take seriously the     strong support of Senator Cochran and Senator Lott and I have expressed     my concerns directly to them as well as to the White House  I also take     seriously Mr  Southwicks answers to my questions and to those of others     in connection with his hearing  I was glad to see that he acknowledged     the offensiveness of the racial epithet used in the Richmond case     and also that human rights law has evolved since 2001 when he joined the     decision in the child custody case   Still  I share the deep disappointment of members     of the African American and civil rights communities that this     Administration continues to renege on a reported commitment to appoint     an African American to the Mississippi federal bench  In more than six     years  President Bush has failed to do so  He has appointed only 20     African American judges to the federal bench  compared to 52     African American judges appointed by President Clinton in his first six     years in office   With an ever growing number of outstanding     African American lawyers in Mississippi  the state with the highest     percentage of African Americans in the country  it is not as if there is     a dearth of qualified candidates  Nonetheless  President Bush has now     submitted 10 nominees to the federal bench in Mississippi  seven at the     district level and three to the United States Court of Appeals for the     Fifth Circuit  and none of these nominees has been African American      Our nations diversity is one of its greatest strengths  and I am     disappointed that the President has missed yet another opportunity to     reflect this great strength in our federal courts  This process begins     with the President  and he has the ability to unite the nation and the     Senate in the choices he makes  or to divide us  This is a divisive     choice  When viewed against his record on the bench  the     importance of this seat on the Fifth Circuit  and the troubling lack of     diversity on that court  I am not convinced that he is the right nominee     for this vacancy at this time  I shall vote no
