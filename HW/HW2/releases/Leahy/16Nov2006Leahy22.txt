       Leahy Leads Bipartisan Effort To Protect Rural Consumers From Losing   Satellite TV Service Options                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy Leads      Bipartisan Effort     To Protect Rural Consumers     From Losing Satellite TV Service Options   Introduces Bill      To Preserve Satellite Service For 800 000 Rural TV Subscribers      Including In Windham and Bennington Counties  WASHINGTON  Thursday  Nov  16        Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   is leading a bipartisan effort to      protect home satellite television customers in Vermont and across      the country from losing access to some of the most popular      television networks   Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee  and the panels incoming chairman for      the 110th Congress  Thursday introduced the Satellite Consumer      Protection Act  joined by Senators Daniel Inouye  D Hawaii   Olympia      Snowe  R Maine   Wayne Allard  R Colo    Jay Rockefeller  D W V         Robert Byrd  D W V    Ken Salazar  D Colo    Hillary Clinton  D N Y        Pat Roberts  R Kan    Mark Pryor  D Minn   and Michael Enzi  R       Wy    Leahy over the last decade has co authored two laws that      have expanded home satellite service to millions of viewers in      Vermont and nationwide  One of the earlier Leahy initiatives has      fostered local into local satellite service  enabling Vermonters and      others to receive local channels in their home satellite program      packages    Leahys new bill would preserve      satellite television service for roughly 800 000 EchoStar consumers      around the country  and in Vermont  who are expected to lose it      December 1 as a result of a federal court injunction  EchoStar is      expected to suspend service to these consumers following a ruling      that it violated federal law by providing distant signals to areas      that did not need satellite to receive that programming   The bill strikes a balance between      consumer protection and tough enforcement against EchoStar for      violating the law  The legislation requires EchoStar to deposit  20      million to be used to cover any future violations   This is a reasonable solution that      penalizes Echostar for violating the law  while protecting the      people who are the real victims of this serious problem  the      consumers who are paying for these services  said Leahy     The bipartisan bill provides a      targeted solution by permitting the service to continue under      specific criteria  including    n     Where      local stations are not available from a satellite provider  EchoStar      could bring in a distant network station if it compensates the local      station     n     In areas      that do not have affiliates of all four networks  ABC  CBS  FOX       NBC   EchoStar could bring in a distant signal of the missing      network affiliate because no local station would be harmed    n     Stations      from neighboring that are considered significantly viewed by the      Federal Communications Commission  and generally treated as local      stations  could be carried  such as the Albany  N Y   stations which      serve Vermonts Bennington County and the Boston area stations       which serve Windham County                       Below is Senator      Leahys statement on the introduction of The Satellite Consumer      Protection Act    Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Introduction Of The Satellite Consumer Protection Act      November 16  2006  Today I am pleased to introduce the      Satellite Consumer Protection Act of 2006  and I am proud that      Senators Inouye  Snowe  Allard  Rockefeller  Byrd  Salazar  Clinton       Pryor  Roberts and Enzi are among those joining me in sponsoring      this important bill  I regret the necessity of this legislation       but I am determined to protect consumers  especially consumers in      rural areas such as Vermont   This is a pro consumer  bipartisan      bill that addresses a problem that soon will face millions of      Americans who subscribe to satellite TV services  I realize full      well that this bill may not please the major corporations affected      by this remedy  but its intent is not to help them  but to help home      satellite viewers    A federal court recently found that      EchoStar willfully  flagrantly and repeatedly violated federal law       and I believe that EchoStar should be held to account for its decade      of illegal activity  The situation is ultimately quite complicated       but the simplest version is this  EchoStar has been bringing      distant network signals to areas that did not need satellite to      provide access to that programming  But the penalty for such      actions is harsh  and the court that heard the lawsuit had no      choice  EchoStar will be required to stop retransmitting any      distant signals  EchoStar flouted the law  but it is consumers who      will suffer  Unless we pass this bill  many rural subscribers      around the country will lose access to news and entertainment      programming from the free  over the air broadcast networks     The Satellite Consumer Protection Act      is a practical  narrow  and    most importantly    pro consumer      solution to a problem of EchoStars creation  The court issued      injunction  set to take effect December 1  will prohibit EchoStar      from providing any distant network stations to any of its      customers  Under the Satellite Consumer Protection Act  the      injunction will apply to the roughly 95 percent of the country where      EchoStar provides residents their local  over the air stations  Our      legislation would only permit EchoStar to bring in distant network      stations in three situations  First  where local stations are not      available from a satellite provider  EchoStar could bring in a      distant network station if it compensates the local station       Second  in areas that do not have affiliates of all four networks       EchoStar could bring in a distant signal of the missing network      affiliate because no local station would be harmed  Third  stations      from neighboring localities that are considered significantly      viewed by the Federal Communications Commission  and are generally      treated as local stations  could be carried   This legislation would not be complete      without an enforcement provision that will truly curb EchoStars      practice of illegally providing copyrighted content  The Satellite      Consumer Protection Act therefore imposes real monetary penalties      for violating the Act and requires EchoStar to put sufficient funds      in escrow with the copyright office to cover any future violations        This bipartisan bill respects the      legitimate interests of broadcasters who have been harmed by      EchoStars actions  while it serves the interests of the people who      are the innocent bystanders and the real victims of this emerging      problem  the consumers who are paying for these services
