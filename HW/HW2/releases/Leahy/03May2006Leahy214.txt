       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of A Bill To   Reauthorize And Reinvigorate The Temporary Provisions Of The Voting Rights Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Introduction Of A Bill To Reauthorize And Reinvigorate            The Temporary Provisions Of The Voting Rights Act      May 3  2006  I am pleased to join the Chairmen       of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees  the Ranking       Member of the House Judiciary Committee  the Democratic and       Republican leaders of both the Senate and the House of       Representatives  and members of Congress from both parties to       introduce a bill to reauthorize and reinvigorate the temporary       provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  The       bicameral  bipartisan introduction of this bill reflects not       only its historic importance as a guarantor of the right to vote       for all Americans  but also the broad consensus that the       expiring provisions must be extended this year without delay          The Voting Rights Act Transformed      America  There are few things as critical       to our Nation  and to American citizenship  as voting  Like the       rights guaranteed by the First Amendment  the right to vote is       foundational because it secures the effective exercise of all       other rights  As people are able to register  vote  and elect       candidates of their choice  their interests and rights get attention   The very legitimacy of our       government is dependent on the access all Americans have to the       political process    The Voting Rights Act of 1965       was the result of an historic struggle for civil rights led by       such American heroes as Dr  Martin Luther King Jr   Coretta       Scott King and Rosa Parks  who refused to be treated as       second class citizens  That struggle reached a crucial turning       point on March 7  1965  on the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma        Alabama  when state troopers brutally attacked John Lewis and       his fellow civil rights marchers who were fighting for their       right to vote    The events of that day  now known       as Bloody Sunday  were captured in newspapers and on       televisions across the country  and those powerful images marked       a crucial turning point in securing the right to vote for all       Americans  A few days after the violence of Bloody Sunday        President Lyndon Johnson outlined the proposed Voting Rights Act       of 1965  before a joint session of Congress        Within months  Congress passed it so that the Constitutions       guarantees of equal access to the electoral process  regardless       of race  would not be undermined by discriminatory practices   The enactment of the Voting Rights       Act in 1965 transformed the landscape of political       inclusion  Prior to the Act  minorities of all races faced       major barriers to participation in the political process        through the use of such devices as poll taxes  exclusionary       primaries  intimidation by voting officials  language barriers        and systematic vote dilution  We have made great gains since       that time  but our work is not finished  The record established       in 10 hearings in the House of Representatives indicates that       the tools provided by the expiring provisions of the Voting       Rights Act remain necessary for protecting the voting rights of       minority Americans in this country          Extending The Protections Of Section   5  Among the Acts most critical       protections are the pre clearance provisions of Section  5  which prevent discriminatory laws from going into       practice  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments       Act of 2006 would extend these protections for 25 years        retaining the most effective measures to fight certain kinds of       pervasive and recurring discrimination   The insidious discriminatory       tactics that led to the original Voting Rights Act were deeply       rooted  In the annals of our Nation  this fight dates back       almost 100 years  to the ratification of the 15th       Amendment in 1870  the last of the post Civil War Reconstruction       amendments  It took implementation of the Voting Rights Act of       1965 for people of all races in many parts of our country to       gain the effective exercise of rights guaranteed 95 years       earlier by the 15th Amendment  The pre clearance       provisions were one of the primary reasons this Act succeeded       where earlier attempts had failed  Section 5 requires certain       covered jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to       pre clear all voting changes with either the Department of       Justice or the U S  District Court for the District of       Columbia  In doing so  Section 5 combats the practices in these       jurisdictions of shifting from one invalidated discriminatory       tactic to another  which had undermined earlier efforts to       enforce 15th Amendment guarantees    We have made significant progress       toward a more inclusive democracy over the past four decades       since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965        However  I fear that if we fail to reauthorize the expiring       provisions of the Voting Rights Act  our country is likely to       backslide  We must make sure those gains do not suffer the same       fate as the gains in voting rights made during Reconstruction         After the Civil War  the       Reconstruction Act promised that the guarantees of the 15th       Amendment would be realized  Between 1870 and 1900  22 African       Americans served in the United States Congress  In 1868        Louisiana elected an African American Lieutenant Governor  Oscar       Dunn  and 87 African Americans held seats in the South Carolina       legislature  However  these Reconstruction era gains in       African American voting and representation proved to be       short lived  Following the end of Reconstruction  the rights of       African Americans to vote and to hold office were virtually       eliminated in many areas through discriminatory legal barriers        intimidation  and violence  The changes were swift  systematic       and severe  By 1896  Representative George White of North       Carolina was the only African American remaining in the U S        Congress  and it would take 72 years after Representative White       left Congress for African American voters in the South to elect       another candidate of their choice to Congress   In Mississippi  the       percentage of African American voting age men registered to vote       fell from more than 90 percent during Reconstruction  to less       than 6 percent in 1892  Between 1896 and 1900  the number of       African American voters in Louisiana was reduced from 130 000 to       a mere 5 000  Unlike their short lived gains made during       Reconstruction  African American voters exclusion from the       ballot box was persistent  Only 3 percent of voting age       African American men and women in the South were registered to       vote in 1940  only 1 percent in Mississippi  just 1 percent        These numbers are staggering  and they provide a history lesson       we should not ignore    Extending       Protection Of Language Minorities  As part of the Voting Rights Act       reauthorization in 1975  Congress added Section       203  which requires bilingual voting assistance for certain       language minority groups  This provision was enacted pursuant       to congressional power to enforce the 14th and 15th       Amendments  Section 203 has been a key factor to expanding the       inclusiveness of democracy to all citizens and has led to       extraordinary gains in representation and participation made by       Asian American and Hispanic American citizens  Like Section 5        Section 203 is expiring in 2007  The Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 would extend these       critical protections for 25 years    Hispanic American populations have       been one of the primary minority language groups to benefit from       the protections of the bilingual provisions of the Voting Rights       Act  For example  effective implementation of the bilingual       provisions in San Diego County  California  helped       increase voter registration by more than 20 percent  And voter       turnout among Hispanic Americans in New Mexico rose 26 percent       between 2000 and 2004 after television and radio spots in       Spanish educated listeners about voter registration and absentee       ballots    Voting rights belong to       people who are American citizens  They are trying to vote but       many of them are struggling with the English language due to       disparities in education and the incremental process of       learning  It is imperative that all citizens be able to fully       exercise their rights as citizens  particularly a right as       fundamental as the right to vote  Renewing the expiring       language provisions of the Voting Rights Act will continue to       help make that a reality          Reinvigorating The Act  Rather than merely extending the       Voting Rights Act  Congress now has an opportunity to       reinvigorate the Act  strengthening and improving its remedies        The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006       does so by clarifying certain parts of Section 5       to give clear guidance to the Courts and to restore the original       understanding of the Act  Two recent Supreme Court decisions       have significantly narrowed Section 5 s effectiveness and       undermined the purposes of the Act    The Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 remedies the Supreme       Courts holding in Reno v        Bossier Parish  by making clear that a voting rule       change motivated by any discriminatory purpose violates Section      5  Under the holding in  Reno v  Bossier Parish        certain voting rule changes passed with the intent to       discriminate against minorities could pass Section 5 muster        Because such an interpretation is inconsistent with purposes of       the Voting Rights Act to eliminate discriminatory tactics that       undermine the guarantees of the 15th Amendment  the       Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act fixes this       inconsistency by clarifying that a voting rule change motivated       by any       discriminatory purpose also cannot be pre cleared   The Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 also remedies the       Supreme Courts holding in       Georgia v  Ashcroft  Under the test established in      Georgia       for assessing a jurisdictions challenge to denial of Section 5       pre clearance  the court can give greater weight to numerous       undefined considerations than to the ability of a minority       community to elect a candidate of its choice  This test is as       difficult to administer as it is contrary to the purposes of the       Act  This act fixes both of these problems       by restoring the original understanding that the purpose       of the Voting Rights Act is to protect the minority communitys       ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice and by       setting forth defined factors    In addition to restoring the Acts       original meaning  this Act makes changes to the expiring Federal       examiners and observers provisions to better allocate resources       for combating discrimination in voting  The Voting Rights Act       provides for Federal examiners to ensure that legally qualified       persons are free to register for Federal  State  and local       elections and that observers to observe whether citizens who are       eligible to vote are able to exercise the right to vote        Federal observers are the most frequently used federal oversight       tool in voting and the only Federal officials authorized to       enter polls and places where votes are tabulated  This Act       eliminates Federal examiners because they have not been       appointed to jurisdictions certified for coverage in more than       20 years  and other laws such as the Help America Vote Act now       address the concern of voting rolls  At the same time  the bill       strengthens the observers provisions to allow the assignment of       federal observers upon finding that there is a reasonable belief       that a violation of the 14th or 15th       Amendments will occur  without having to first certify federal       examiners    The Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendment Act also removes an impediment to       effective protection of voting rights by authorizing the prevailing       party in a lawsuit brought under Section 2 to recover expert       costs as part of the attorney fees already authorized  This       will have a significant impact on the ability of litigants to       successfully combat discrimination in court    Bicameral        Bipartisan Process For Reauthorization  The process of reauthorization       began in the House of Representatives  where Representatives       Nadler  Chabot and Watt presided over 10 hearings on the       effectiveness and continuing need for the expiring provisions of       the Voting Rights Act  Last week  the distinguished House       Judiciary Chairman and Ranking Member appeared before the Senate       Judiciary Committee and introduced the extensive record from       those hearings  I am grateful for the hard work that has been       done in the House  and I want to thank Chairman Specter for       agreeing to move forward promptly with Senate Judiciary       Committee hearings on the expiring provisions     Congress has reauthorized and       revitalized the Act four times  each time with overwhelmingly       bipartisan support  As I noted last week in welcoming the House       Judiciary Chairman and Ranking Member  we are repeating the       bicameral and bipartisan process of the 1982 reauthorization        In 1982  Chairman Specter and I were both Members of the       Judiciary Committee  along with Senators Kennedy  Biden  Hatch       and Grassley  Under the chairmanship of Senator Strom Thurmond        reauthorization was reported by the Judiciary Committee and       passed both houses of Congress  I am hopeful that our Committee       can accomplish the work that needs to be done and report this       bill to the full Senate before the Memorial Day recess          Conclusion  The Voting Rights Act of 1965       is one of the most important laws Congress has ever passed        helping to usher the country out of a history of discrimination       and into the greater inclusion of all Americans in the decisions       about our Nations future  Our democracy and our nation have       been better and richer for it  While I hope some day these       extraordinary remedies are not needed  I urge the Senate to       build on the work done in the House of Representatives to extend       the expiring provisions so that we can eliminate recurring       discrimination and make sure that the gains we have made are not       lost  I am heartened that this is not a partisan issue       benefiting one party or another  Rather  as demonstrated by the       bicameral and bipartisan process we continue for reauthorizing       and revitalizing the Acts expiring provisions  this is about       making our democracy reflect the will of all of the American       people
