       Pressure On President By Leahy And Jeffords And Coalition Results In  Another  1 M  To Help Vermont Families Stay Warm                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT        WASHINGTON      Tuesday  Feb  1   Senator Patrick Leahy spoke out against the     nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be attorney general Tuesday     morning as the Senate opened debate on the nomination  Leahy  who     is the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  led off     Democrats in what is expected to be an intense debate on the     controversial nomination  The panel voted out the nomination last     week  with all Democratic members opposing it  In his remarks on     the floor  Leahy cited Gonzales lack of accountability and his     refusal at every turn to provide straight answers on his involvement     in formulating the White Houses policies regarding torture and the     treatment of prisoners in  U S  custody overseas  Leahys     remarks follow                 Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy       On The Nomination Of Alberto R  Gonzales       To Be Attorney General Of The United States       February 1  2005    MR  LEAHY  Today we begin debate on the nomination of Alberto     Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States   When I first heard of this nomination last November  I was     hopeful  I saw this nomination as a chance for some long missing     accountability on some of the most pressing issues facing our     nation  I noted at the time that I like and respect Judge Gonzales      I met with him soon after his designation and wrote to him      following up on that meeting  to inform him in advance of his     confirmation hearing about issues that would be raised about several     key issues  I listened carefully to him during our confirmation     hearing   The road he has traveled from being a 12 year old boy selling     soft drinks at football games  all the way to the State House in     Texas and to the White House  is a tribute to him and to his family      In spite of our disagreements on issues  I have sought to maintain a     cordial personal working relationship with Judge Gonzales during his     years as President Bushs counsel  As Senator Kennedy has said  I     dearly wish that we could vote for that compelling story  and not     for the nominee whose record is before us   It saddened me to call Judge Gonzales last week and tell him that     I could not in good conscience vote to confirm his nomination to be     Attorney General  the chief law enforcement officer of the Nation      He is not the person for this job   My reasons for voting against Judge Gonzales arise from the need     for accountability and derive from the nominees involvement in the     formulation of a number of policies that have tarnished our     countrys moral leadership in the world and put American soldiers     and American citizens at greater risk   When President Bush announced this nomination he said that he     chose Judge Gonzales because of his sound judgment and role in     shaping the Administrations policies in the war on terrorism  Based     on the glimpses of secret policy formulations and legal rationales     that have come to light  I believe his judgments not to have been     sound  On the contrary  several of this Administrations legal     policies have been exceedingly harmful to our national interests      As Attorney General  the nominees judgment about our laws would     be of enormous consequence  Judge Gonzales has championed policies     that are in fundamental conflict with decades of our laws  sound     military practice  international law and human rights  He remained     silent for almost two years about a deeply flawed and legalistic     interpretation of our nations torture statute  He also accepted a     patently erroneous interpretation of the torture convention and     apparently believes that the President  when acting as Commander in     Chief  is above the law   When I asked Judge Gonzales if he agreed with the Bybee memos     very narrow reading of the law  he replied  I dont recall today     whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis  but I     don t have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the     Department  This is the memo which concludes that physical pain     amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain     accompanying serious physical injury  such as organ failure      impairment of bodily function  or even death  Even the Justice     Department repudiated this legal memorandum  once it became public      Under his restrictive redefinition such practices as threatening     a prisoner with a firearm in a mock execution  waterboarding a     person to make him experience the suffocating effects of drowning      and  as Senator Kennedy noted  perhaps even cutting off a persons     fingers one joint at a time would not amount to torture  But     surely we consider these practices torture when done to a member of     the U S  military or to an American citizen   Perhaps most disturbing of all as a legal matter is the nominees     positing of the President as above the law  Nothing is more     fundamental about our constitutional democracy than our basic notion     that no one is above the law  Yet at his June 2004 news conference     and again in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee he     indicated that he views the President to have the power to override     our law and  apparently  to immunize others to perform what would     otherwise be unlawful acts  This is about as extreme a view of     Executive power as I have ever heard  I believe it is not only dead     wrong as a constitutional matter but extremely dangerous  The rule     of law applies to the President  even this President   Ironically  it was the Administration of this Presidents father     that urged the Senate to ratify the torture convention  It did so to     make clear that the United States condemns torture and to protect     Americans from this barbaric practice  But if the U S  President     does not feel bound by the torture convention  then neither will     other foreign leaders   Ultimately  the Attorney Generals duty is to uphold the     Constitution and the rule of law  not to work to circumvent it      Both the President and the nation are best served by an Attorney     General who gives sound legal advice and takes responsible action      without regard to political considerations  not one who develops     legalistic loopholes to serve the ends of a particular     Administration   The Attorney General appointed by the Presidents father     remarked  Nothing would be so destructive to the rule of law as to     permit purely political considerations to overrun sound legal     judgment  Judge Gonzales demonstrates a lack of independence from     the President  something that we cannot have in the chief law     enforcement officer in the nation  He cannot interpret our laws to     mean whatever the President wants them to mean  To do so would deny     us the constitutional protections upon which this nation was     founded  The Attorney General is supposed to represent all of the     American people  not just one of them   We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second     fiddle to the Presidents political agenda  This Administration has     taken one untenable legal position after another regarding the rule     of law in the war against terror  It will not admit to making     mistakes  It takes action only after mistakes are made public and     become politically indefensible  Given the Republican leadership in     Congress  the Federal courts have provided what little check there     has been on this Presidents claims of unfettered Executive power      Judge Gonzales nomination initially seemed like a breath of     fresh air  I have noted how much I personally like Judge Gonzales      But as I told the nominee when we met within days of the     announcement of his nomination  these confirmation proceedings     matter   The confirmation proceedings matter because it is the     responsibility of this Senate to explore his judgment and actions in     connection with the tragic legal and policy changes formulated in     secret by this Administration and still cloaked from congressional     oversight and public scrutiny  Americas troops and citizens are at     greater risk because of those actions and the terrible repercussions     throughout so much of the world  Americas moral standing and     leadership have been undercut  The searing photographs from Abu     Ghraib have made it harder to create and maintain the alliances we     need to prevail against the vicious terrorists who threaten us      including those who struck America nine months into this Presidents     first term  Those abuses serve as recruiting posters for the     terrorists  and that is why this process matters  And the process     has shown us that Judge Gonzales is the wrong man for this job   At his recent inaugural address President Bush spoke eloquent     words about the United States historic support for freedom  To be     true to that vision  we need a Government that leads the way in     upholding human rights not one secretly developing legalistic     rationalizations for circumventing them  To reclaim our moral     leadership in the world  to become a true messenger of hope instead     of a source of resentment  we need to acknowledge wrongdoing and     show accountability for mistakes that this Administration has made      We have seen departures from our countrys honorable traditions      practices and established law in the use of torture  originating at     the top ranks of authority  and emerging at the bottom  At the     bottom of the chain of command  we have seen a few courts martial      At the top  we have seen medal ceremonies  pats on the back and     promotions   Between these two dissonant images there is a growing     accountability gap  and the Administrations handling of this     confirmation process  which could have helped to narrow the gap  has     served to widen it   I believe in redemption in public life  as in spiritual life  But     to get to redemption  first there has to be accountability  This     Administration has a large and growing accountability deficit  Judge     Gonzales  who could have become a part of the solution  remains a     part of the problem   Now more than ever  the country needs a person to be Attorney     General who will serve all Americans  There is much that has gone     wrong that this Administration has stubbornly refused to admit or     correct  For this democratic republic to work  we need greater     openness and accountability  It is with those critical     considerations in mind that I must vote against this confirmation
