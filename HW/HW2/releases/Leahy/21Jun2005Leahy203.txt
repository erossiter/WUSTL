       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy on NOPEC Amendment To H R  6  The   Energy Policy Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         The Senate on      Tuesday evening adopted an amendment to the Energy Policy Act      sponsored by Senators Mike DeWine  R Ohio   Herb Kohl  D Wisc         Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and others that would hold OPEC accountable      for its anti competitive behavior by making the oil cartel subject      to anti trust laws  The NOPEC amendment  based on a bipartisan      bill approved by the Judiciary Committee earlier this year  passed      the Senate on a voice vote  Immediately following the vote Tuesday       Senator Pete Domenici   R  N M   the chairman of the Energy and      Natural Resources Committee  warned that the provision would not      survive House and Senate negotiations on a final bill  Below is      Leahys statement on the passage of the amendment    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On NOPEC Amendment To HR 6  The Energy Policy Act Of 2005     June 21  2005 I am proud to      cosponsor this amendment  as I have been glad to cosponsor the No      Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  which we have been working      to pass since 2001  I commend our lead sponsors Senators DeWine and      Kohl   I wish that we      could have considered and passed this bill  S  555  on its own       This bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee with overwhelming      support earlier this year  I have repeatedly called for its      consideration by the Senate over the last several months    In the face of      crude oil prices over  55 a barrel and gas prices at historic and      sustained high levels  and in the face of determined inaction by the      White House  we must seize whatever opportunity presents itself       It is long past      time for the Congress to hold OPEC accountable for its      anti competitive behavior  This amendment will prevent the U S       from being at the mercy of the OPEC cartel by making them subject to      our anti trust laws  It will allow the federal government to take      legal action against any foreign state  including members of OPEC       for price fixing and other anticompetitive activities  In March of      2004  more than a year ago  I wrote Senator Hatch to request a      hearing about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline  In that letter  I      raised concerns that this increase was largely due to market      manipulation by OPEC  and I cited the high average price for a      gallon of gasoline  which at the time was around  1 74  Many of us      would today consider that price a bargain  having been forced to pay      over  2 00  and even more this year  At that hearing  witnesses      told us what we had suspected to be true  The price of crude oil       determined by OPECs artificial production quotas  is the factor      that most explains the price Americans pay at the pump  The artificial      pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us  This week       Vermonters were paying  2 10 for a gallon of regular gasoline  just      three cents below the national average  These prices affect      everyone  Higher fuel prices can add thousands of dollars in yearly      costs to a 100 head dairy operation in the Northeast  And as our      summer months approach  many families are going to find that OPEC      has put an expensive crimp in their plans  Some are likely to stay      home  others will pay more to drive or to fly so that they can      visit their families or take their well deserved vacations  Rising interest      rates are also adding to the burden felt by working Americans      Pension insecurity is another catastrophe for some and a      looming specter for too many others  Millions of Americans who      trusted that the pensions they were promised by their employers      would be there for them when they retired are being shocked by      rulings in bankruptcy cases that let their employers off the hook      and turn their pension security into a hollow promise   Congress needs      to do more  The administration needs to do more  Authorizing action      against illegal oil price fixing and taking that action without      delay is one thing we can do without additional obstruction or      delay   Last month  as      some Republicans were pushing this body to the brink of the      so called nuclear option  Americans were thinking not about the      handful of controversial judicial nominees on which the Senate was      fixated  but about the pinch they feel at the pump every time they      fill up their cars  A survey by the Pew Research Center for the      People  the Press showed that Americans were following news about      gasoline prices more closely than any other story  including the      ongoing conflict in Iraq  It is long passed the time for walking      hand in hand with Saudi princes and exchanging kisses with those who      are responsible for the artificially high prices that are gouging      American working families at the pump  The Presidents      solution to high gasoline prices this summer is to open the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge  pristine wilderness area  to oil      drilling  The only catch is drilling in ANWR will not provide any      new oil for at least seven to 12 years  ANWR drilling will do      absolutely nothing to help my constituents who have sticker shock at      the gas pump or are will be facing record high home heating prices      in a few months  This amendment      will provide law enforcement with the tools necessary to fight      OPECs anti competitive practices immediately  and help reduce      gasoline prices now  rather than waiting for another decade       Again  I am      pleased to support this amendment and urge my colleagues to maintain      it in the final version of the bill  After the years of Judiciary      consideration  including a hearing on this topic  after twice      reporting the measure to the Senate  it is time for Senators to      finally say No to OPEC
