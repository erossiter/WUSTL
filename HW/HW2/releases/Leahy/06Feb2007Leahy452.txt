       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Republican Leaders  Efforts To Stall A   Debate On The War In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Republican Leaders Efforts     To Stall A Debate     On The Presidents Planned Escalation     Of The War In Iraq     Tuesday  Feb  6  2007   It is regrettable      that the Bush Administration pushed the partisan button to derail      the first real Senate debate on the Iraq war in four years  This is      a debate that  if anything  is four years overdue      Last fall the      American people spoke loudly and clearly that they wanted to end      Congresss rubberstamping ways  The Republican leaderships efforts      to prevent this debate reveal remaining vestiges of the rubber stamp      that has so poorly served the nation  There is strong bipartisan      disagreement in Congress and in the country with the Presidents      escalation of the war in Iraq  By blocking this debate  Senate      Republican leaders are tacitly supporting President Bushs      escalation plan  I hope the American people will let it be known      that they want the Congress to have this debate
