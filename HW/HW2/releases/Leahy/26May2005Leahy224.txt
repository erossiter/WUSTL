       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of John Bolton To   Be U S  Ambassador To The United Nations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of John Bolton     To Be U S  Ambassador To The United Nations     May 26  2005 Mr  President  I      have been privileged to have served under both President Clinton and      President George W  Bush as one of the two Senate delegates to the      United Nations  and there is no doubt that the United States      Permanent Representative to the U N  is one of the most important      diplomatic posts in the U S  government   The Permanent      Representative is the public face  voice  and vote of the United      States at the worlds only body charged with maintaining      international peace and security  Therefore  it is essential that      this individual be someone with indisputable integrity and      extraordinary diplomatic abilities  After listening to John      Boltons confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations      Committee  I feel confident in saying that John Bolton is not that      person  Most troubling to      me are allegations from senior U S  intelligence officials         including a senior Bush Administration appointee    of Mr  Bolton      trying to intimidate and even remove intelligence analysts simply      because they did not share his political views  Mr  Bolton even      went so far as to get in his car and go out to the CIA to seek the      removal of one intelligence officer  At any time  but especially in      the wake of the massive intelligence failures associated with the      decision to invade Iraq  efforts by Administration officials to      shape intelligence to conform to a particular preconceived view is      unacceptable  It is essential that dissent be tolerated and even      encouraged in the intelligence community and not distorted to fit a      particular ideology or political agenda  Second  I have      strong concerns that Mr  Boltons pattern of inflammatory statements      about the U N  will make it difficult for him to effectively advance      U S  security interests in New York and to build support for      much needed reforms at the U N  The last thing we want is for      countries to make Mr  Bolton an excuse for resisting reform  Taking      a tougher approach to the U N  through constructive criticism is one      thing  disregarding its value and belittling its very existence is      another  We need someone in New York who is unafraid to shake      things up and challenge the status quo  but that person must also      have the credibility  temperament  and diplomatic skills to work      with other nations  form coalitions  and advance U S  interests       The only tool in Mr  Boltons toolbox appears to be a hammer  Third  I am      disturbed by some of the contradictions in Mr  Boltons recent      testimony  For example  Mr  Bolton pledged to the Foreign Relations      Committee that he has not and will not make statements that are not      approved by the Administration  Yet  his own testimony about Iran      appeared to do just that    using language rejected by the      Administration more than a year ago  There are other instances of      this behavior during the hearings  where our Ambassador to South      Korea has disputed what Mr  Bolton said  Finally  there is      a tone and temperament issue with Mr  Boltons nomination       According to respected officials who have worked with him  Mr       Bolton bullies  belittles and undermines those who do not agree with      him  We all lose our cool from time to time  Disagreements are      part of human discourse  But  there is a pattern with Mr  Bolton      that goes beyond appropriate behavior  a disturbing trait for      someone seeking to become our chief diplomat at a place where people      come together to resolve disagreements   When Mr  Bolton      was nominated to be Undersecretary of State in 2001  I strongly      opposed and voted against his nomination  At that time  I had      serious reservations about his experience  diplomatic temperament       and his poor track record on non proliferation and arms control       Over the last four years  Mr  Bolton has proved me right  As the      top proliferation official at the State Department  Mr  Bolton has      been ineffective in his current responsibilities and the world has      become more dangerous under his watch  The Bush Administration s      record on proliferation  from Pakistan to Iran to North Korea  has      been poor  at best  After much      debate  the Foreign Relations Committee was not able to support Mr       Boltons nomination and  rather  reported it out without      recommendation  Secretary Powells Chief of Staff has said that Mr       Bolton would be an abysmal Ambassador to the U N  I might not put      it as strongly as that  but I will be opposing the nomination of Mr       Bolton
