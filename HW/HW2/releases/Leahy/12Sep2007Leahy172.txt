       Leahy  Grassley  Durbin  Specter Sponsor Bipartisan Bill To Protect   Taxpayers Against Fraud                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy  Grassley  Durbin  Specter     Sponsor Bipartisan Bill     To Protect Taxpayers Against Fraud   WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Sept  12   Senators Chuck Grassley  R Iowa      and Dick Durbin  D Ill   introduced new legislation in response to     recent federal court decisions that threaten to limit the scope and     applicability intended by Congress with its highly successful 1986     update of the False Claims Act  which has recovered  20 billion for the     U S  Treasury that would otherwise be lost to fraud   The False Claims Act Correction Act of 2007 has the support and     cosponsorship of Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and     Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa    Companion legislation will be     introduced in the U S  House of Representatives by Rep  Howard Berman      Grassley and Berman were the sponsors of the 1986 amendments to the     False Claims Act  Those amendments breathed new life into what is known     as Lincolns Law by empowering qui tam relators to act as private     attorneys general and file suit against those who defraud the federal     government   Its been proven time and again that without the courage and     willingness of these individual citizen whistleblowers  the federal     government would not have known what was going on or been able to pursue     successful cases against those who defrauded the government  including     contractors and state and local governments  These settlements have     returned tens of billions of dollars that would otherwise be lost and     gone forever  Grassley said  Our new legislation works to make sure     recent court decisions wont weaken the governments ability to recover     tax dollars lost to fraud  whether its in health care  defense or     another areas of spending   President Lincoln signed the False Claims Act into law in 1863 to     prevent war profiteers and others from defrauding the government and the     nations taxpayers  Sadly  144 years later  Lincolns Law is still     needed  Durbin said  This bipartisan bill modernizes and strengthens     the False Claims Act  and will help Lincolns Law continue to serve as     an effective tool against fraud    This bipartisan bill strengthens and restores the False Claims Act     as one of our most powerful and effective tools for combating fraud      waste  and abuse in government  said Senator Leahy  These protections     are more important than ever as unscrupulous contractors in Iraq and     elsewhere have defrauded American taxpayers of billions of dollars and     undermined our troops fighting overseas    Leahy has also introduced separate legislation  the War Profiteering     Prevention Act of 2007  S  119   to crack down on the widespread     contracting fraud  waste and abuse in Iraq  The bill was reported out of     the Judiciary Committee earlier this year    This legislation is as important today as it was when it was enacted     during the Civil War in 1863  stated Senator Specter  We must continue     to combat fraud and abuse of government programs and waste of taxpayer     dollars  One way to do that is to encourage and protect employees who     step forward to identify fraud  This legislation would ensure that the     law continues to do both    President Abraham Lincoln sought the False Claims Act during the     Civil War in response to war profiteering that defrauded U S  taxpayers      The 1986 updates to the law are today the governments most effective     weapon against fraud   The False Claims Act Correction Act of 2007 would make the following     corrections to the False Claims Act    Makes corrections to 31 U S C    3729 removing the requirement      that false claims be presented to a government employee  This      section corrects longstanding problems with the requirement that      false claims be presented directly to government employees  instead      applying liability directly to any false claim regarding government      money or property  This correction ensures that any government money      lost to fraud  waste  or abuse can be recovered using the FCA      regardless of whether the individual making the false claim directly      represents such a claim to a government employee  This problem arose      following the D C  Circuit Court of Appeals decision in U S  ex rel       Totten v  Bombardier Corp  380 F 3d 488  2004  which held that false      claims to government grantees  here Amtrak  were not presented to      a government employee and barred government recovery of government      funds lost to fraud   Amends the FCA to clarify the dismissal of parasitic claims      filed based upon publicly disclosed information  Commonly referred      to as the public disclosure bar  the FCA currently allows for the      dismissal of FCA cases brought based upon publicly disclosed      information unless the relator is the original source of the      public information  This complex area of FCA law was further      complicated when the Supreme Court decided Rockwell Intl Corp  et      al  v  United States  549 U S  _  2007   This decision held that the      public disclosure bar requires a qui tam relator to be an original      source for all claims that are ultimately settled or upon which a      verdict is rendered  Absent this original source  a relator is      barred from recovery  This decision dramatically limits the FCA by      restricting legitimate qui tam relators who often bring fraud to the      attention of DOJ with information DOJ expands and ultimately settles      on other grounds  This correction also clarifies it is the exclusive      right of DOJ to dismiss relator claims on public disclosure grounds       and not a jurisdictional defense of those who defraud the      government   Clarifies that false or fraudulent claims against non U S       Government funds under the trust and control of the U S  Government      are subject to recovery under the FCA  This clarification would      ensure funds administered by the U S  Government on behalf of third      party nations or other entities are protected from fraud  waste  or      abuse by extending FCA liability to those funds  This clarification      addresses concerns raised by the Federal District Court for the      Eastern District of Virginia in United States ex rel  DRC  Inc  v       Custer Battles  LLC  2006 WL 2388790  E D  Va  Aug  16  2006        dismissing a jury verdict finding FCA violations for funds allocated      to contractors operating on Iraqi funds administered by the U S       Government   Clarifies a split between Circuit Courts of Appeal as to when a      government employee may act as a qui tam relator under the FCA  This      clarification would explicitly state in statute the original      legislative intent of the 1986 amendments to the FCA allowing      government employees to act as qui tam relators in limited      circumstances when they have reported activities up the chain of      command  to the Inspector General  to the Attorney General  and only      if no action was taken after 12 months   Makes technical and clarifying amendments to the statute of      limitations in FCA cases  as well as technical edits to the Civil      Investigative Demands authorized under the current FCA
