       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Passage Of The Child Soldiers   Accountability Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On The Passage Of S  2135  The Child Soldiers      Accountability Act Of 2007  December 18  2007        I am pleased that the Senate today will pass S  2135  the Child      Soldiers Accountability Act of 2007  I commend Senator Durbin and      Senator Coburn for their leadership on this important legislation to      combat the unconscionable practice of using children as soldiers in      violent conflicts  and I was proud to join as a co sponsor of this      bill  I am glad that Senators Durbin and Coburn worked with me and      others on the Senate Judiciary Committee to produce a consensus bill      and to move it through Committee and the Senate  The United States      should do all it can to prevent and punish this conduct which is so      contrary to our values              This bill creates a tough new criminal provision aimed at those who      recruit or conscript children under the age of 15 into armed      conflict  It extends U S  jurisdiction to perpetrators of this      crime who are present in the United States  regardless of their      nationality and where the crime takes place  so that those who      commit human rights violations cannot come to this country as a      sanctuary from prosecution  The bill also amends immigration law to      allow those who have used children as soldiers to be barred or      removed from the United States         This bill is another example of the good      work of the Judiciary Committees new Subcommittee on Human Rights      and the Law  I am glad that the efforts Subcommittee Chairman      Durbin and I have made to make this Subcommittee a force for change      and to bring focus on these important issues is resulting in      legislative action  as well as providing a forum to put a spotlight      on important issues  This is an area in which I have worked for      many years as the Chair and ranking member of the Foreign Operations      Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee          During the last five years  Americas      reputation has suffered tremendously  Some of our ability to lead      on human rights issues has been needlessly and carelessly      squandered  Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo and torture have tarnished that      role and that tradition The secret prisons that the President      confirmed last year  this Administrations role in sending people to      other countries where they would be tortured  and recent revelations      of the destruction of videotapes showing cruel interrogations by the      CIA have led to condemnation by our allies  to legal challenges  and      to possible criminal investigations      I was proud to work with Senator Durbin to      create the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee      This subcommittee will continue to closely      examine some of the important and difficult legal issues that are      now a focus of the Judiciary Committee and will work to reverse and      correct the damaging policies established by this administration      over the last six years  The Subcommittee has already      spearheaded the Genocide Accountability Act  which will soon provide      a powerful new tool in Americas efforts to prevent and punish      genocide  and has made further progress with hearings and      legislation dealing with human trafficking and other vital issues             The conduct prohibited by the Child Soldiers Accountability Act is      appalling but happens all too often throughout the world  We should      do everything we can to stop this offense to human rights and human      dignity  which exacts such great costs from too many of the worlds      children  I commend the Senate for passing this important      legislation today
