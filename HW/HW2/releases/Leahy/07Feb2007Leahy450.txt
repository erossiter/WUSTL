       Senate Guard Caucus Leaders Propose Bill To Repeal Insurrection Act   Changes That Facilitate Federalizing The National Guard                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Senate Guard Caucus Leaders     Propose Bill  S  513     To Repeal Insurrection Act Changes    That Facilitate Federalizing The National Guard     WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Feb  7   Backed by the nations governors and     the National Guard community  the co chairs of the Senates National     Guard Caucus Wednesday took the first step to repeal a new law that     makes it easier to federalize the National Guard for domestic law     enforcement purposes during emergencies  even over governors     objections   Sen      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo    the co chairs of the     80 member Senate National Guard Caucus  introduced their bill to repeal     the changes made late last year to the Insurrection Act  Those changes      included in the Defense Authorization Bill  ease the ability of a     President to declare martial law and assume control of the National     Guard  The Insurrection Act governs when the military  including the     National Guard  can be used for domestic law enforcement without the     consent of a governor  Last years changes discard what Leahy terms a     useful friction in the law which has helped make such presidential     takeovers rare  making it easier now to invoke the Insurrection Act     after events including natural disasters  disease outbreaks and     terrorist attacks  The new Leahy Bond bill would restore the Act to its     original form      Expanding the Presidents powers under the Insurrection Act was a     sweeping  ill considered and little noticed grant of authority to the     Executive Branch  at the expense of the National Guard and the     governors  said Leahy  That change in longstanding law treads heavily     across basic constitutional issues relating to the rights of the people      the separation of powers  and state and local sovereignty  The National     Guard is most effective when it can respond immediately to the needs of     the communities it serves  and that is best done when the response is     organized as close to the local emergency as possible   As a former     Governor who has called upon the National Guard in crisis  I am very     concerned with this imprudent change in law  Not only do our nation s     governors now have less control over their Guard units  the President is     also provided with unnecessary and unprecedented power to invoke martial     law  Our bill will provide a critical fix to legislation that was     pushed through Congress without the consultation or advice of the     governors  said Bond  Last     August  the National Association of Governors sent a letter to     then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and to the leadership of both the     House and Senate  opposing the Insurrection Act changes  The new     Leahy Bond repeal legislation has the support of the National Guard     Association  the Adjutants General of the United States  and the     Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  in     addition to the governors association
