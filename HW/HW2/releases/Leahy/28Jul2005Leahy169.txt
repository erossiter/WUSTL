       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Habeas Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      On Habeas Legislation  S 1088      Executive Business Meeting     July 28  2005 Mr  Chairman  I      strongly object to proceeding today on the habeas legislation       S 1088  We held our one and only hearing on this bill just two      weeks ago  I would have hoped that we would have at least one or      two more before launching into another wholesale rewriting of      federal habeas corpus law  There is no crisis here  no reason to      rush into an exercise that would require our courts and prosecutors      once again to untangle what Congress has done on this subject  and      no reason to shortcut our deliberative process on a bill with such      serious implications for the administration of justice and the basic      rights of the American people  We have not heard      fully from the Judicial Conference  In a letter to the Committee      dated July 13  2005  the Judicial Conference said that it opposes      three provisions of S 1088 based on previously adopted positions       but the Conference made clear that it has not had sufficient      opportunity to consider and comment on the bills remaining      provisions  The letter concludes   During the past decade  a body of      case law has been carefully developed to implement the objectives of      the AEDPA to streamline the procedures for federal habeas review       The proposed legislation may complicate the task of resolving many      federal habeas cases by creating additional procedural issues that      will undoubtedly be litigated in the federal courts  Such      development might lead to more  rather than less  litigation  The Committee      received another letter recently from a distinguished group of      former federal and state court judges  including two who also served      as FBI Directors  These former judges expressed grave concerns      about S 1088  which they say would prevent federal courts from      granting many petitions  even in cases of actual innocence  They      say the bills exception for innocence is so narrow that it will      cover virtually no one  They call the bills      jurisdiction stripping provisions radical and inconsistent with      the long history of our American legal system  They end by urging      a study  by the Judicial Conference or another independent body  to      determine whether there is any need for new legislation to decrease      delays  Another letter      came in this week from former prosecutors  law enforcement officers       and Justice Department officials  They call the bill      counterproductive to our goals of ensuring public safety and      fairness  and express concern that it would slow things down rather      than speed them up  to the detriment of crime victims and their      families  We also received      letters from several prominent conservatives    John Whitehead       David Keene  former Congressman Mickey Edwards  and former      Congressman Bob Barr  All question the need for this legislation      and urge further study  Congressman Barrs letter is of particular      interest  as he helped write the AEDPA in 1996  Calling the      evidence for S 1088 largely anecdotal and limited to cases within      the Ninth Circuit and California in particular  Congressman Barr      cautions against enacting sweeping national changes to address what      appears to be a localized issue  Other letters      continue to pour in from organizations and individuals who are      alarmed that S 1088 will eliminate safeguards and increase the risk      of executing the innocent  These include letters from the Federal      Judges Association  the U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops  and      numerous practitioners from law firms across the country  Habeas corpus is      a highly complicated body of law    mostly because we made it      complicated nine years ago    but also because of the overlay of      dozens of Supreme Court cases  We should proceed cautiously here       and with great care  lest we create more problems than we solve  We      should be cautious rather than speed things up and increase the risk      that innocent people will be executed  Before I turn to      the specifics of S 1088  I would like to note a point of history       In the past 10 years  we have enacted two important pieces of      legislation affecting the administration of the death penalty  the      major revisions of the AEDPA in 1996  and the much more modest  but      important  reforms of the Innocence Protection Act  IPA  last year       The AEDPA was the culmination of years of congressional attention to      various proposals for habeas corpus reform  The IPA was also the      product of a lengthy congressional process  including multiple      hearings in this Committee and in the House  Our departure from      that process to rush ahead with a bill whose objective is to rush      ahead with executions is as unseemly as it is unwise  Now let me turn      to the bill  the so called Streamlined Procedures Act  That is a      good label  Im for that label  We all probably are  Who could be      against streamlined procedures  But regrettably  our jobs on this      committee and in the Senate are more difficult than that  Our job      here is not to vote for labels  but for legislation   Abraham Lincoln      once asked a man  How many legs would a dog have if you called his      tail a leg   Five  the man      replied  No  said      Lincoln  he would still have four  Calling his tail a leg does not      make it so  Calling this bill      the Streamlined Procedures Act does not make it so  This bill      would do nothing to streamline habeas corpus proceedings  To the      contrary  the radical changes it proposes would further and      unnecessarily complicate the law  spawning another decade of      litigation and confusion in the federal courts  Just when the      courts had finally sorted out the many questions raised by the AEDPA       they would be back to square one  Let us be candid      about what this bill proposes  In the words of John Whitehead       President of the Rutherford Institute  S 1088 is radical      legislation which would effectively gut federal habeas corpus review      where states have imposed a death sentence  as well as in      non capital cases  Its primary tool is to strip federal courts of      jurisdiction to hear most constitutional claims  I am aware that      the Chairman may propose a substitute amendment  and I will address      that in due course  The substitute is less drastic than S 1088  but      would still inflict serious damage to habeas review  More to the      point  it would do so for no good reason  The Senator from      Arizona has argued that the delays in federal habeas corpus are far      worse than when Congress acted in 1996  He says statistics show a      sharp increase in the number of habeas petitions pending before in      the U S  District Courts  In fact  the statistics he cites show the      number of petitions commenced  not pending  and so they tell us      nothing about how long it takes to process cases in federal court       The AEDPA was never meant to  and could not have hoped to    reduce      the number of petitions filed  There are two      other problems with the Senator from Arizonas numbers  First  they      are a bit inflated in that they include petitions filed by      federal prisoners under 28 U S C  2255  Second  and more      importantly  they fail to account for the explosion in the State      prison population over the past decade  When you adjust for these      problems  you see that the number of habeas petitions per capita has      decreased steadily since we passed the AEDPA   This chart gives      us a snapshot  but hardly a complete picture  We need entirely      different information before we can conclude that federal courts      move these cases too slowly  For example  how many habeas petitions      are dismissed summarily  How many require evidentiary hearings       What is the average processing time for these cases  If there are      delays  where in the process are they occurring  why  and is the      problem systemic or is it limited to a few courts or regions  That      sort of information is not currently available  I do not want to      legislate in the dark  I need meaningful data  we all do  At the      appropriate time  I intend to offer a substitute amendment that      would begin the data gathering process  Let me briefly      address two other arguments that have been made to justify the need      for this bill   First  the      Senator from Arizona has noted that California takes a long time to      execute people  That is true  but it does not tell us a lot about      whether AEDPA is working  Much of the delay in California occurs in      the state courts  not in federal habeas proceedings  Death row      inmates must often wait many years before a lawyer is appointed for      the automatic appeal  Then  Californias process for appellate and      post conviction review creates a bottleneck in the California      Supreme Court  which is required to review every capital judgment       and which also handles every post conviction proceeding as part of      Californias unitary review procedure  So far this year  the      California Supreme Court has issued 12 automatic appeal opinions       The judgments in these cases were rendered in the trial courts      between December of 1990 and March of 1995  ten to fifteen years      ago  In short  California has problems  but they are not problems      that would be ameliorated by the proposed bill  Second  we are      told that the AEDPA is not working because no State has been able to      take advantage of its special procedures for capital cases  The      AEDPA provides for expedited resolution of habeas cases in States      that opt in to its provisions  To opt in  a State must establish      procedures for the appointment  compensation  and payment of      reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State      post conviction proceedings brought by indigent prisoners whose      capital convictions and sentences have     become final for State      law purposes  To date  no State      has fully opted in  Many have not even tried or have conceded      that they do not meet the requirements  Others have tried  but      without success  Only one State  Senator Kyls home state    has      been found to qualify for opt in status  That was three years ago       in the Spears case  Arizona did not get the benefits of      opt in status in that case because the defendant went through state      post conviction proceedings before Arizona put its system in place       But for future cases  Arizona presumptively is an opt in      jurisdiction  Why havent more      states opted in  Not because Chapter 154 has failed to work as      intended  rather  the States have simply refused to institute the      sort of basic procedural safeguards that Chapter 154 was intended to      encourage  Instead of diluting the standards we set in 1996  we      should be helping states live up to those standards by fully funding      the counsel program we enacted just last year in the Innocence      Protection Act  I have addressed      some of the justifications for this bill  We have also heard      anecdotes about cases that have dragged on for many years  Let me      address one in particular  which Senator Kyl has mentioned a number      of times  The Fornoff case in Arizona  As Senator Kyl has noted       the defendant in that case filed his federal habeas petition in      1992  The AEDPA was enacted four years later  and applies only to      petitions filed after April 1996  Thus  the Fornoff case sheds no      light whatever on the effects of the AEDPA  the statute Senator Kyl      wants to amend   What the Fornoff      case does show is the danger of legislating by anecdote  We should      not approve the radical changes proposed by S 1088 based on a few      isolated cases about which we have incomplete knowledge  But since      we have started down that road  I would like to describe some cases      myself  These are just a few  representative examples of situations      in which federal courts granted relief under existing law  based on      clear and often egregious constitutional violations  but which      federal courts would be prevented from even considering if the      jurisdiction stripping provisions of S 1088 were enacted  I have      chosen cases in which the defendant was under sentence of death  but      I could just as well have chosen any number of non capital cases       since the bill would affect all federal habeas cases  capital and      non capital alike   Ricardo Aldape Guerra Ricardo Aldape      Guerra was sentenced to death for the 1982 shooting death of a      Houston police officer  In state post conviction      proceedings counsel sought relief based on numerous instances of      police and prosecutorial misconduct  The trial court  without      holding a hearing or making findings of fact  recommended denying      the petition  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals accepted the      trial courts recommendation and denied relief  The federal      district judge  an appointee of President Reagan  conducted an      extensive evidentiary hearing  He concluded that Mr  Aldape Guerra      was innocent and had been the victim of police and prosecutorial      misconduct  This is from the courts opinion   The police officers and the      prosecutors actions     were intentional  were done in bad faith       and are outrageous  These men and women  sworn to uphold the law       abandoned their charge and became merchants of chaos      Their      misconduct was designed and calculated to obtain a conviction and      another notch in their guns despite the overwhelming evidence that       another man  was the killer and the lack of evidence pointing to  Aldape       Guerra  The Fifth Circuit      affirmed the district courts decision unanimously  and Mr  Aldape      Guerra    who had maintained his innocence throughout    was      released  Prosecutors conceded that  without the evidence tainted      by State misconduct  they lacked a sufficient basis for prosecuting      him  Scott Atlas  a      lawyer for Mr  Aldape Guerras lawyer  has written to the Committee      in opposition to S 1088  According to Mr  Atlas  if section 9 of      the bill had applied to Aldape Guerras case  he would have been      executed long ago  That is because section 9 eliminates federal      court jurisdiction in death penalty cases except for prisoners who      raise claims based on a retroactive new rule of law and those who      offer clear proof of actual innocence based on evidence that could      not have been discovered earlier through the exercise of due      diligence  Mr  Aldape Guerra raised no new rule of law  and the      evidence he offered could have been discovered with due diligence      but was not because counsel was ineffective   Ernest Willis Ernest Willis      went to Texass Death Row in 1987  He was convicted of causing the      deaths of two young women  who died as a result of a night time fire      in a private home  Like the victims  Mr  Willis was a guest in the      home at the time of the fire  he narrowly escaped death himself in      the same incident  He was more than 40 years old and had never been      charged with  much less convicted of  a violent crime   At trial  the      State presented a circumstantial case  using poorly trained and      largely unqualified fire investigators to portray the blaze as      having been arson  based on their interpretation of the physical      evidence  Mr  Willis guilt was largely inferred from his presence      at the scene and by his impassive demeanor  which was induced by      drugs given to him by his jailers  The jury convicted Mr  Willis of      capital murder and sentenced him to death  After Mr  Willis      was convicted the lead prosecutor boasted to the press  We are just      tickled pink  We didnt have any eyewitnesses  We didnt know what      type of flammable material was used  It was all circumstantial      material  Represented by      new volunteer attorneys  Mr  Willis pursued a new trial in state      post conviction proceedings  The same judge who had presided over      Mr  Willis original trial heard new evidence in hearings that      lasted several days  At the conclusion of those hearings  in June      of 2000  the judge entered findings of fact detailing the ways in      which Mr  Willis right to a fair trial had been violated       Ultimately  the original trial judge recommended that Mr  Willis      should receive a new trial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct      and his own trial attorneys ineffective performance  However  the      Court of Criminal Appeals reversed  Its order was six pages long       unpublished  and was rendered without the benefit of substantive      briefing or oral argument  Mr  Willis turned      to the federal courts  In 2004  a district judge issued an order      granting Mr  Willis a new trial  Without taking any new evidence       the judge found that the original trial judges findings were      correct  that Mr  Willis rights had been grossly violated  and that      the Court of Criminal Appeals had unreasonably refused to remedy      those violations  The judge issued an order granting Mr  Willis a      new trial  and the State of Texas made the rare choice not to      appeal  On remand  the      local prosecutor was troubled by the thin evidence in the case and      decided to have it re examined before deciding how to proceed  This      time  the job was assigned to two extensively qualified arson      experts  They concluded that the fire was accidental  They      explained that the original verdict of arson was based on      misunderstandings about the significance of certain physical      evidence  advances in fire science in the 1990s made clear that the      original investigators had mistaken certain features as indicating      an intentionally set fire   Based on their      report  the District Attorney dismissed all charges against Mr       Willis  A little over a month later  he signed a Certification of      Actual Innocence stating that the record shows the actual      innocence of Mr  Willis  It concluded  In behalf of the State of      Texas  I extend my apologies to Mr  Willis and best wishes to Mr       Willis and his family   If the changes in      federal habeas law contemplated by S 1088 had been in effect when      Mr  Willis case was wrongly rejected by the Texas Court of Criminal      Appeals  the federal district court would have had no jurisdiction      to review the case or to correct the extraordinary injustice      originally identified by the state trial judge  No new evidence or      new facts were developed after Mr  Willis case was denied by      Texass highest court  the factual record was complete once the      original trial judge had finished hearing evidence  Thus  under      section 9 of S 1088  there would have been no jurisdiction for      federal habeas review  and Ernest Willis would have been executed   Ronald Keith  Williamson Ronald Keith      Williamson was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and      murder of a young woman in Ada  Oklahoma  Following direct appeal       he filed a petition for state post conviction relief  The trial      court denied the petition and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals      affirmed  finding that all of his claims were procedurally barred       Mr  Williamson      then petitioned for a writ of federal habeas corpus  The district      court granted the writ on a variety of grounds  including trial      counsels ineffective performance in not seeking a competency      hearing  The district court held that the state procedural bar      regarding the competency claim was not independent  and therefore      the Court could reach the merits of this claim  The Court of      Appeals affirmed  holding that counsels ineffectiveness had led to      the trial of a person who may have been mentally incompetent  Mr       Williamson also prevailed in both federal courts on another of his      claims  that trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to      investigate the many leads suggesting that he was actually innocent      and that the crime had actually been committed by his chief accuser       Glen Gore  Prior to his retrial  Mr  Williamson  now with the      assistance of competent counsel    was exonerated by DNA testing       The charges against him were dismissed and Glen Gore  who indeed      turned out to be the real culprit  was convicted of the crime and      sentenced to death  Barry Scheck  who      worked on the Williamson case  testified at our hearing  He said if      section 4 of S 1088 had been in effect when Mr  Williamson filed his      federal habeas petition  it would have stripped the federal courts      of jurisdiction to hear any of the claims found barred by the      Oklahoma state courts  There would have been no retrial  and Mr       Williamson would have been executed despite his innocence   Conclusion Our hearing      earlier this month only highlighted the extent of our collective      ignorance about the issues S 1088 purports to address  We do not      know how widespread post conviction delays are  We do not know to      what extent those delays are attributable to federal habeas corpus       which S 1088 would radically curtail  or to state post conviction      proceedings  which it entirely ignores  We do not know how      effective the AEDPA has been  or how effective it will be now that      the courts have finally clarified what it means  at reducing      post conviction delays  And we do not know what the federal      judiciary  which actually administers the AEDPA  and whose      jurisdiction would be profoundly affected by the bill  might tell us      about the effectiveness of the AEDPA and the real world implications      of S 1088  We know none of these things  And the proponents of      S 1088 want us to pass their legislation fast  before we can find      out  There are       however  things that we do know  We do know that federal habeas      corpus is not merely a bastion of liberty in some abstract sense       It has saved innocent lives from execution  it is one of the bedrock      rights that belong to the American people  it has revealed profound      injustices that violate fundamental constitutional rights  and it      has led to the re opening of cases which in turn has led to the      capture and imprisonment of those who are truly guilty  We do know      that if enacted  S 1088 would represent a dramatic curtailment of      the Great Writ  And we do know that under S 1088  federal court      doors would have been shut to inmates whose innocent lives have been      saved by federal habeas proceedings  In short  we know this  A      vote for S 1088 is a vote to substantially increase the probability      that innocent people will be executed  Before the Committee adopts      a measure with such drastic consequences  we should at least know      what problems we are supposed to be addressing
