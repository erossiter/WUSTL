       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  S J  Res  1  Marriage Protection   Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      S J  Res  1  The Marriage Protection Amendment     June 7  2006      This morning we will be voting on whether to proceed to a proposed      amendment to the Constitution  I strongly oppose this divisive      exercise  At a time when      the Senate should be addressing Americans top priorities  including      ways to make America safer  the war in Iraq  rising gas prices       health care and health insurance costs  stem cell research  the      erosion of Americans privacy and the reauthorization of the Voting      Rights Act  the Presidents political strategists and the Republican      Senate leadership  instead  try to divide and distract from fixing      real problems by pressing forward with this controversial proposed      constitutional amendment   Rather than seek      to divide and diminish  the Senate could be working against      discrimination  I was honored to sponsor the Mychal Judge Police      and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers  Benefit Act of 2002 to      ensure that the survivors of 9 11 were treated fairly regardless of      sexual orientation  If we really want to do something that the      Senate can do  we should join together in a bipartisan way to pass      the hate crimes bill that would help stamp out and punish violent      crimes against those attacked because of the color of their skin or      their nationality or sexual orientation  If we really want to do      something worthy of the Senate we should debate and pass legislation      to end discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation  If      we want to recognize the dignity and worth of others we should      consider S 1278  the Uniting American Families Act  a bill I      introduced to bring fairness to our immigration laws   The      Constitution is too important to be used for partisan political      purposes  It is not a billboard on which to hang political posters      or slogans seeking to stir public passions for political ends   I      want all Americans to appreciate that if this proposed amendment      became part of our Constitution it would represent a dramatic      departure from this Nations history of expanding freedom and      individual rights  We have only amended the Constitution seventeen      times since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791  None of these      amendments has served to limit the rights of an entire class of      Americans  Furthermore  none of these amendments has dictated to      the States how they should interpret their own Constitutions  This      proposal not only enshrines discrimination in the Constitution  it      usurps what has always been the function of the States with regard      to defining marriage  When each of us became Senators we swore an      oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States       I will honor that oath by opposing this effort to inject      discrimination into the Constitution        This attempt will once again fail to garner the necessary votes to      proceed  But that should not excuse the Republican leaderships      turning away from the legislative agenda of the Senate for this      election year adventure  I hope that the American people will      object to this misuse of the Senates time and authority the way      they did when the Senate injected itself into the Schiavo matter not      so long ago  The American people want their leaders to unite this      country and to solve real problems that they face every day  This      constitutional amendment is a divisive political effort to shore up      sagging poll numbers  I believe the American people will not be      fooled and will see through this exercise   I      look forward to moving on to the Nations real priorities  The      Senate should return to a place where we consider solutions to the      problems that plague hardworking Americans  from soaring gas prices      and high health care costs to corporate and government corruption       from national security to effective fiscal and trade policies  We      might consider taking action to preserve and improve rather than      pollute the environment  Someday this chamber might even debate the      ongoing pandemic of AIDS or protect against the impending pandemic      from bird flu  We might join in effective action seeking to halt      the genocide in Darfur or oversight of the allegations of Government      violations of the rights of Americans  I look forward to that time
