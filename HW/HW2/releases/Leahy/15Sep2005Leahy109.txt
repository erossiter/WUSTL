       Senate Passes Leahy Measure To Relieve Local Police From Requirement Of  Having To Pay To Replace Defective Bulletproof Vests                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT           Senate Passes Leahy Measure To     Relieve Local Police    From Requirement Of Having To Pay To Replace    Defective Bulletproof Vests  WASHINGTON      Thursday  Sept  15   Local police departments would not have to     pay to replace the defective body armor they obtained through a     federal program  under legislation sponsored by Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt   that passed the Senate Thursday  The Leahy measure would     help local police departments that bought defective Zylon based body     armor from private manufacturers  using grants from his Bulletproof     Vest Partnership  BVP  Partnership Grant Program  which was created     seven years ago under earlier Leahy legislation  A recent Justice     Department study confirmed that Zylon vests lack the minimum     standards of protection and resistance  and many law enforcement     agencies need to replace them  Leahys bipartisan amendment to the     annual budget bill for the Justice Department and other agencies      the Commerce  Justice  Science  CJS  Appropriations Act for Fiscal     Year 2006  facilitates the replacements by waiving the BVP     programs matching funds requirement  The bill also provides  27     million for next years vest purchases  The Justice Department     already has added  10 million to this years  23 6 million program     budget to help in the replacement of Zylon based body armor  The     budget bill now goes to conference with the Houses version of the     bill  which does not include the Leahy provision  In August Vermont     police departments received  90 000 in grants under the program to     buy vests for their officers  and the Leahy program by now has been     used to secure 2622 vests for Vermont officers since 1999  Leahys     Congressional Record statement describing his amendment follows               Statement of Senator Patrick     Leahy    On Amendment Number 1694  as Modified  to Waive the Match     Requirement Under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program for     Purposes of Replacing Defective Vests    September 14  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am pleased that the     Senate has agreed to include in the Commerce  Justice and Science     Appropriations Act  H R  2862  an amendment proposed by myself      Senator Shelby and Senator Specter to waive the match required under     the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 for law     enforcement agencies that received funds under that Act  used them     to purchase Zylon based body armor  which has recently been shown by     the Department of Justice to be defective  and now want to replace     those faulty vests with funds awarded by that Act  This waiver     would be granted only if those agencies can present documentation to     prove that they purchased Zylon based body armor with funds awarded     to them under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act  I thank     my friends Senator Shelby  the chairman of the CJS Appropriations     Subcommittee  and Senator Specter  the chairman of the Judiciary     Committee  for cosponsoring this amendment and for their leadership     on this issue  I was proud to partner with our former     colleague Senator Campbell to author and shepherd into law the     Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998  which was     reauthorized by the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 2000 and     most recently as part of the State Justice Institute Reauthorization     Act of 2004  to create the Bulletproof Vest Partnership grant     program as a means of helping law enforcement agencies purchase body     armor for their rank and file officers  We wrote that Act  in part      in response to a situation that became apparent in the tragic Carl     Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont New Hampshire border  in which     two state troopers who did not have bulletproof vests were killed      The Federal officers who responded to the scenes of the shooting     spree were equipped with life saving body armor  but the state and     local law enforcement officers lacked protective vests because of     the cost  Bulletproof vests remain one of the foremost     defenses for our uniformed officers  Since their introduction more     than 30 years ago  body armor has saved more than 2 700 lives  From     1999 through 2005  over 11 500 jurisdictions have participated in     the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program  with  118 million in     federal funds committed to support the purchase of an estimated     450 000 vests  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program funds up to     50 percent of the cost of each vest purchased or replaced by law     enforcement agency applicants  Under law  the program is required     to fully fund the 50 percent of requested vest needs for     jurisdictions under 100 000 in population  Remaining funds are     distributed to jurisdictions of over 100 000 in population  Concerns from the law enforcement community     over the effectiveness of body armor surfaced nearly two years ago     when a Pennsylvania police officer was shot and critically wounded     through his relatively new Zylon based body armor vest  Responding     to requests that Senator Campbell and I made  as well as from law     enforcement officials  Attorney General Ashcroft launched the Body     Armor Safety Initiative  The National Institute of Justice  NIJ      was directed to initiate an examination of Zylon based     bullet resistant armor  both new and used  to analyze upgrade kits     provided by manufacturers to retrofit Zylon based bullet resistant     armors  and to review the existing program by which bullet resistant     armor is tested to determine if the process needs modification  On August 24  2005  the Justice Department     announced that test results indicate that used Zylon containing body     armor vests may not provide the intended level of ballistic     resistance  Unfortunately  an estimated 200 000 Zylon based vests     have been purchased  many with Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program     funds  and now need to be replaced  The Justice Department has     adopted new interim requirements for its body armor compliance     testing program  It has also added an additional  10 million to the      23 6 million already available for the current fiscal year to law     enforcement through the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program to     assist agencies in their replacement of Zylon based body armor     vests  Before concerns on Zylon based vest safety     arose  DOJ and NIJ had set voluntary compliance testing protocols to     assess whether models of ballistic resistant body armor comply with     a certain minimum standard of protection and resistance  All models     of ballistic resistant body armor that complied with those standards     were eligible for funding under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership     Grant Act  As it turns out  those standards were not rigorous     enough and the certification process was not onerous enough  thereby     subjecting our nations law enforcement officers to severe safety     risks  Across our nation  law enforcement agencies are     struggling over how to find the funds necessary to replace defective     vests that are less than five years old with ones that will actually     stop bullets and save lives  Vests cost between  500 and  1 000     each  depending on the style  The extra  10 million released by the     Justice Department is only a drop in the bucket and these officers     are being forced to dip into their own pockets to pay for new vests     unless the Federal government offers more help  The amendment by     Senator Shelby  Senator Specter and me that has been included in the     CJS Appropriations Act will help ease the burden faced by officers     and their families and further our mission to provide every police     officer who needs a safe vest with the means to purchase one
