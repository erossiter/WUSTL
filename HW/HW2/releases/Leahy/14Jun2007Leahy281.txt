       Key Panel OKs Leahy Stevens Amendment To Mandate Delay Of  Border Crossing Card                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Key Panel OKs   Leahy Stevens Amendment  To Mandate Delay Of Border Crossing Card WASHINGTON  Thursday  June 14   The Senate   Appropriations Committee Thursday approved an amendment by Sen  Patrick   Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska  to halt the launch of a plan   for a new border crossing card for at least 17 months  to give the   Departments of State and Homeland Security more time to fix its problems  The Leahy Stevens Amendment mandates at least a   17 month shift in the launch of the land and sea components of the Western   Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     from next January  to June 1  2009    That phase is by far the projects largest  Leahy cited current passport   processing backlogs  caused by recent implementation of the smaller air   travel phase of WHTI  that have snarled thousands of Americans travel plans   in recent weeks  He said todays disruptions are a hint of worse chaos to   come if the Administration holds to its current schedule  The amendment was included in the managers package of   amendments to the annual Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  after Leahy   and Stevens lined up a formidable bipartisan coalition of support  The bill   goes next to the full Senate  Sen  Larry Craig  R Idaho  and Sen  Pete   Domenici  R N M   also are cosponsors of the Leahy Stevens Amendment  The Leahy Stevens Amendment reflects growing   frustration that the two departments have refused to take the extra time   Congress gave them last year  in an earlier Leahy Stevens Amendment  to iron   out the programs problems  Administration officials tried to thwart the   Leahy Stevens Amendment and insist they will be ready this coming January    despite mounting evidence to the contrary  The Leahy Stevens Amendment   enacted last fall gave the two departments a choice in using 17 more months   to work out WHTIs problems  Their new amendment doesnt give the   departments a choice  The amendment also includes the same seven   requirements that must be certified as met before the land and sea phase can   be launched   Leahy said  Senator Stevens and I believe we should   fix these problems before this plan is imposed on travelers  instead of   trying to clean up the mess afterward  The Administration is walking   blithely toward a cliff with this program  and theyre threatening to take   millions of Americans with them  Their competence in being able to get this   right was already in question  and when they keep insisting theyll be ready   in six months  so is their judgment   Stevens said  Senator Leahy and I have followed this   issue for nearly three years because theres a real chance our states will   be adversely impacted if these requirements are implemented in haste    Thousands of travelers must pass through Canada by road or by cruise ship   each year in order to reach Alaska  Federal agencies need this extra time    theyre already struggling to keep up with an extreme increase in passport   applications  and the full implementation of this initiative will generate   even more requests  Without careful and thoughtful planning  the WHTIs   land and sea provisions could cripple the ability of Alaskans and others to   travel to and from our state  In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and   Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff  Leahy and Stevens earlier   this week asked the departments to voluntarily delay implementation for 17   months   The letter is posted on the Leahy website  leahy senate gov  The certification requirements require the two   departments to  1  Ensure that the technology for any Passport Card    PASS Card  meets certain security standards   and that the National   Institutes of Standards and Technology certify the technology chosen by DHS   and State  2  Share the technology with the governments of Canada   and Mexico  3  Justify the fee set for the PASS Card   4  Develop an alternative procedure for groups of   children traveling across the border under adult supervision with parental   consent  5  Install all necessary technological infrastructure   at the ports of entry to process the cards and train U S  agents at the   border crossings in all aspects of the new technology   6  Make the PASS Card available for international land   and sea travel between the United States and Canada  Mexico  or the   Caribbean and Bermuda  7  Establish a unified implementation date for all sea   and land borders
