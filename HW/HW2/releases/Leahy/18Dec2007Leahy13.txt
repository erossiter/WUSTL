       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On FY 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On FY 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill   December 18  2007          LEAHY   Mr  President  the fiscal year 2008 omnibus appropriations      bill is the product of more than nine months of work by the Senate      and House Appropriations Committees  It meets the Presidents      arbitrary budget ceiling  and for that reason it short changes many      key programs        But it is far preferable to another continuing resolution at fiscal      year 2007 levels  which the government has been operating under      throughout this year  Another continuing resolution would mean      lay offs  short falls  program cut backs and terminations that would      have repercussions throughout the government and across this      country  That is what will happen if the President does not sign      this bill       There are ample reasons for him to sign it  As Chairman of the State      and Foreign Operations Subcommittee  I can say that the portion of      this omnibus bill that I and Senator Gregg and Congresswoman Lowey      and Congressman Wolf agreed to contains a balanced allocation of the      funds we were given        This is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill  It is a      bipartisan bill that attempts to address the myriad of foreign      policy  national security  and domestic needs of this country       Other subcommittees worked just as hard and in a similar bipartisan      manner  None of us are completely happy with the outcome  We had to      make exceedingly difficult cuts to get to the Presidents number       But that is the nature of this process        It is ironic that a President who said he would veto this bill      unless it was within his self proclaimed budget ceiling because he      wants to keep a lid on spending  is asking Congress for another  70      billion in emergency funding to continue the war in Iraq       Those dollars do not score against the budget  so the White House      can espouse the fiction that the President is being fiscally      responsible at the same time that he piles on the debt for future      generations  Of course  he never threatened to veto any of the      appropriations conference reports during the past six years        It is a political ploy after inheriting a balanced budget and      tripling the national debt  but it is going to be hard felt by the      American people  Cuts in funding for education  health care  public      infrastructure  homeland security  environmental protection       transportation  no part of the federal budget was exempted except      defense       The State and Foreign Operations portion of the bill is  2 billion      below the Presidents budget  A full  1 3 billion of that cut was      the result of the Presidents veto threat  It means fewer      children will receive vaccinations in the poorest countries  less      money for international peacekeeping  less for HIV AIDS prevention       care and treatment  less for non proliferation and anti terrorism      programs  less for disaster relief  less for education  environment       energy and agriculture programs  But  if the President gets      his way  there will be tens of billions of dollars more to keep our      troops bogged down in Iraq  while the Iraqi Sunnis and Shiites      continue to fight among themselves       Despite that  this omnibus bill is a far  far better outcome than      continued spending at the fiscal year 2007 levels  and the dire      consequences that would bring  The State and Foreign      Operations portion totals  35 1 billion in discretionary budget      authority including  2 4 billion in emergency spending       Without emergency spending  the bill totals  32 8 billion  which is       2 billion below the Presidents regular fiscal year 2008 request      and  1 52 billion above the fiscal year 2007 level       Here are some of the highlights        We provide  6 5 billion for global health programs  including  345      million to combat malaria   150 million for tuberculosis  and  5      billion for HIV AIDS        We provide  546 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS       Tuberculosis and Malaria  Added to funds in the Labor  Health and      Human Services bill  this omnibus bill provides a total of  841      million for the Global Fund  an increase of  115 million above last      years level        It includes  446 million for child and maternal health  which is      almost  100 million above last years level        We provide  1 69 billion for United Nations peacekeeping   550 of      which will support the desperately needed UN African Union force in      Darfur       The bill provides  1 billion to assist the worlds refugees  and       100 million to help Jordan cope with the hundreds of thousands of      Iraqi refugees that have flooded that country  which is already home      to tens of thousands of Palestinians        The bill provides the requested funds for Israel  Egypt  Pakistan       Afghanistan  the West Bank  Lebanon  and other needy countries        It provides  1 54 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation       which is  344 million above the Senate passed level        It provides  501 million for Educational and Cultural Exchange      Programs  an increase of  55 million above the fiscal year 2007      level       The bill does not include the so called Mexico City language      concerning international family planning which would have led to a      Presidential veto  It is regrettable that the President would rather      score political points than support private organizations that would      use our funds for voluntary family planning services       The bill provides  968 million for embassy security  which is  190      million above the fiscal year 2007 level       There are several other important provisions in the State and      Foreign Operations portion of this omnibus bill  One would      make long overdue reforms to current law by allowing thousands of      persecuted refugees  barred because they were members of armed      groups that were allied with the U S   or who were forced to offer      food  shelter or other services to terrorist groups  to seek asylum      here  This change was worked out by myself and Senator Kyl       and would provide relief to such Vietnam era allies as the Hmong  MUNG       tribesman of Laos and the Montagnards  MON TEN YARDS  of Vietnam       and for child soldiers and others who were forced against their will      to provide support to terrorist groups        These people were there for us when we needed them  and we should      not turn our backs when they need the safety of our shores  It is an      affront to our values and to our reputation as a safe haven for      victims of persecution        The changes we are making will also provide relief for Iraqi      refugees  some of whom have been barred for paying ransom to secure      the release of a family member who was kidnapped by insurgents        This change will not raise the number of refugees admitted to the      United States  but it will bring our laws back in line with our      values        This bill contains other provisions  some proposed by Democrats       some by Republicans  which make important improvements in our      foreign assistance programs       We provide  300m for safe drinking water and sanitation programs       consistent with the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act        There are funds set aside for reconciliation and people to people      coexistence programs in the Middle East  as well as in other      countries divided by ethnic  religious  or political conflict        There are new provisions which address the problem of corruption and      governance in countries that receive U S  assistance       There are new provisions to improve monitoring of U S  military aid      to countries that have human rights problems  and to address the      problem of child soldiers       Mr  President  these are only a few of the items supported by both      Democrats and Republicans in this omnibus bill  and they are only      within the State and Foreign Operations portion  There are thousands      of other important domestic programs funded by each of the other      subcommittees whose bills make up this omnibus  I understand      there will be amendments having to do with funding for the war in      Iraq  and the outcome of those amendments will be important to every      Senator  I would hope that we can debate those amendments and      go to final passage on this bill by mid afternoon
