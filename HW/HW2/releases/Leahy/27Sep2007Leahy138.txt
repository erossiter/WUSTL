       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Children s Health Insurance   Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On The Childrens Health Insurance Program    September 26  2007    Mr      President  I wish to express my strong support for the reauthorization     of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  When we talk about the work     of this Congress  I believe the extension of CHIP will stand out as one     of the great accomplishments of this body  This bill is a clear     statement of the priorities of the Majority in this Congress   In passing this legislation we state clearly that     the health of our Nations children is an issue too important to be     dealt with in a business as usual fashion   This is a program that represents the best of what     can happen when members from both sides of aisle come together to forge     a consensus  The outcome is a solid compromise on a vital issue  more     health insurance coverage for millions of kids  Unfortunately  the     President seems to have completely missed the boat  From his initial     proposal    which was so modest that kids currently on the program would     lose their health care    to his recent veto threats  the President is     just plain wrong on this issue  The choice is clear  Either you     support childrens health care or you do not  Either it deserves to be     a high priority on our agenda  or it does not  And frankly  I do not     see this as a choice at all  This is a matter of priorities  and few     issues are as important as caring for our kids  Instead of helping more     families that are struggling to afford basic health care for their kids      the President would cut thousands in Vermont who have coverage right     now  He is failing to lead  so Congress again is stepping in to realign     our priorities   If we can find the money to fund the war in Iraq     for 41 days    the same amount that would pay for ten million children     to have health insurance for a year    we can pay for this bill  I have     heard some argue that this bill should be opposed because it raises     taxes on tobacco  just tobacco  Anyone who opposes the bill on these     grounds is choosing Big Tobacco over childrens health   I support this bill because I believe it is a     travesty that in the richest  most powerful country in the world  there     are more than 47 million people without health insurance  That is an     absolutely shocking number  It represents roughly one in six people who     are going without regular trips to the doctor and forgoing needed     medications  and who are forced to use the emergency room for care     because they have nowhere else to turn  These are our friends  our     neighbors  and millions of our children  The legislation before us will     extend and renew health care coverage for ten million children  After     years of increased numbers of uninsured Americans in this country  that     is a solid step in the right direction  No one is arguing that this     bill is the solution to our health care crisis   There are many of us in this body that would like     to see this legislation go even farther in covering more children  But     this bill represents progress  It covers four million more kids  and     has sparked a national discussion on how to begin reforming our health     care system   In my home state of Vermont  we have been a     national leader on childrens health care  Even before the creation of     CHIP  we knew that this was the right thing to do  Because of our early     action  Vermont has one of the lowest rates for uninsured kids in the     country  making our state a leader and an example to the rest of the     Nation  This bill will bring us closer still to the goal of covering all     the kids in our state  The provisions in this bill also will reverse     Bush Administration policies to cut kids off the program and will ensure     that thousands of Vermont kids will still have basic health care   We are faced with many choices here in the Senate      For me  the choice on this bill is clear  This is a must pass bill that     is worthy of our support  I urge all my colleagues to stand for the     children of this country and support this bill  and I urge the President     to abandon his ill advised threats  and to sign it into law
