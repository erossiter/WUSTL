       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Rising Crime In The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Rising Crime In The United States     Examining The Federal Role     In Helping Communities Prevent And Respond To Violent Crime     May 23  2007   Violent crime in the United States is a     problem that affects us all  and the rise in violent crime rates is an     alarming trend that Congress must address  I thank Senator Biden for     holding this important hearing       Like my colleagues  I have been extremely concerned that violent crime      which had been declining through the 1990s  has once again been on the     rise  I worry that the previous Republican led Congress and the current     Administration may have contributed to this trend by cutting funding to     local law enforcement  which has always been our best resource in     preventing violent crime       We have seen a steady and significant decline in the funds appropriated     and spent for the Community Oriented Policing Services Program  The COPS     program increased police presence on the streets  and by all accounts     aided in the steady decline in the national crime rate in the 1990s      Beginning with President Bushs first year in office  the Administration     has proposed consistent cuts  and in fact has proposed to completely do     away with the COPS program       In 2005  the GAO recognized that the COPS program had been effective in     reducing violent crime  Between 1994 and 2001  violent crime dropped by     29 percent  State and local law enforcement officers have consistently     appreciated the program  Since the Administration and the Republican     Congress began cutting this program  however  the rate of violent crime     has once again been steadily climbing  as statistics for 2005 and the     first half of 2006 show  Yet  the President continues to propose cuts in     the COPS program and the Byrne grant program  another important program     to fund local law enforcement       We have been trying to reverse this trend  This Congress and this     Committee have been taking important steps to show our support for our     nations law enforcement officers  In March  the Senate Judiciary     Committee voted to report the COPS Improvement Act of 2007  which I     joined with Senator Biden to introduce  Despite tremendous support for     this legislation  a Republican objection to passing the House version of     this bill has prevented this important legislation from passing the     Senate  I hope the objection is soon withdrawn       This legislation would reauthorize and expand the ability of the     Attorney General to award grants aimed at increasing the number of cops     on the streets and in our schools  In Vermont  for example  passage of     the COPS Improvement Act would likely mean that 110 new officers would     be put on the beat  Additionally  the COPS Improvement Act would     authorize funds for district attorneys to hire community prosecutors and     for law enforcement technology grants  The COPS program has been a     resounding success  and the proposed improvements to the program would     help our State and local law enforcement agencies cope with the     substantial reductions in funding they have endured in recent years       I am also a longtime supporter of the Edward Byrne Memorial Assistance     Grant Program  which has been targeted for elimination by this     Administration  Byrne funding is the backbone of counter drug     enforcement and prosecution efforts in Vermont  Over the years  Vermont     has been able to support a broad spectrum of projects within     corrections  courts  training  forensics  and domestic violence and     victim services as a result of the Byrne grant program  In March  this     Committee agreed to report reauthorization of Byrne grants  as well       We must do what we can to reverse the alarming trend of rising crime in     this country  We must give local law enforcement the resources they     need  and we must make sure that the Federal Government is doing its     part  We must fund and encourage more prevention programs  particularly     for young people  which can reach kids before they turn to crime and     keep all of us safer  I look forward to the insights of todays     distinguished witnesses  including leaders of important law enforcement     entities about how best to address our crime problem
