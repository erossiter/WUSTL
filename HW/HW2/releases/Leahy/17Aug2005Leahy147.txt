Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  to release 478 pages of documents relating to the Supreme      Court nomination of John G  Roberts Jr  In a letter to Leahy  the      librarys director agreed to process the documents in redacted form       granting a request Leahy made on Tuesday  in which he noted that      the documents would be publicly released in that form anyway if      requested under the Freedom of Information Act  As part of the      process  the redacted documents now must be vetted through the      current Bush Administration and a representative of President Reagan      before being released to the Judiciary Committee    The      Judiciary Committee and the Senate need and deserve a complete      record on this important nomination to ensure

Leahy     Senate Committee on the Judiciary     Washington  D C  20510 6275   Dear Senator Leahy  This is in response to your letter of August      16  2005  with regard to the documents released by the Reagan      Library on that day       As you noted  in order to produce as many records as quickly as      possible  the Library conducted an expedited review and  in most      cases  withheld entire pages instead of redacting or segregating the      exempt information  We have begun are review of the 478 pages of      Reagan Presidential records that were withheld pursuant to      exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act  5 V S C         S52  and will complete that process as soon as possible  The 478      pages were withheld under the following FOIA exemptions  18 pages      under  b  1   national security   1 page under  b  3  other      statute   459 pages under  b  6  clearly unwarranted invasion of      personal privacy   10 pages that are closed under  b  6  are also      closed under  b  7  c   unwarranted invasion of personal privacy in      a law enforcement record        Prior to release to the Senate however  we are required to notify      both the incumbent President and the representative of former      President Reagan in accordance with the Presidential Records Act       PRA   44 D S C    2204 c   and Executive Order 13233  The PRA and      Executive Order provide them both with an opportunity to review the      records for the purpose of deciding whether to assert a      constitutionally based privilege  Be assured that we will do      everything possible to expedite this process so that we can provide      you with the redacted records as soon as possible  As we have informed your staff  the Archivist      of the United States has asked NARA s Inspector General to      investigate the matter of the missing Affirmative Action      Correspondence folder from the Staff Member Office Files of John      Roberts  In attempting to reconstruct the missing      folder  Library staff considered several factors  including the      notes of the Administration reviewer  From the notes  the Library      staff learned that the file contained a memorandum from John Roberts      urging that the White House not respond to a letter on a proposed      executive order on affirmative action until the policy had been      resolved within the administration  The Library staff then conducted      two searches in the White House Office of Records Management  WHORM       C track electronic data base  One search put in the term      executive order and the code that corresponded to Roberts  the      other search used the term affirmative action and the code for      Roberts  Both searches produced the same results  Memo  John G  Roberts to Dianna G  Holland re      Executive Order 11246  Affirmative Action  Correspondence  April 10       1986 ID   342097  1page  Memo  John G  Roberts to Dianna G  Holland re      Executive Order 11246  Affirmative Action  Correspondence  Apri110       1986 ID   350544  1 page  No other documents were found in the search of      the electronic data base that matched the relevant terms  Library archivists retrieved these two case      files from the WHORM subject records  The contents of the case files      matched the description of the missing folder obtained from the      Administration reviewer  In both instances  the case file contained      a White House Correspondence Tracking Sheet  the April 10  1986 memo      from Roberts to Dianna G  Holland re Executive      Order 11246  Affirmative Action  Correspondence  a copy of      an incoming letter regarding proposed changes to Executive Order      11246  One case file also contained a White House memorandum from      Dianna G  Holland to FFF  In addition  from their review of the Roberts       files  Library archivists determined that Roberts  subject files      generally contained a White House Correspondence Work Sheet      requesting a response to a letter  Further  the Library archivists      determined that Roberts  assistant generally labeled the subject      folder with information from the subject line of the memorandum in      the file  Thus  the missing folder Affirmative Action      Correspondence matched the subject line of the April 10  1986      memorandum  Executive Order      11246  Affirmative Action  Correspondence  The staff also was able      to locate the April 10  1986memorandum in the chronological file      maintained by Roberts  Reagan Library archivists believe that they      have been able to reconstruct the likely contents of the missing      folder labeled Affirmative Action Correspondence through a search      of the electronic WHORM data base combined with their extensive      knowledge of the structure of the Roberts  files  While it is      possible that the missing folder also contained a copy of the draft      executive order that draft executive order is available in other      open files  Please be assured that NARA is doing everything      possible to investigate this matter and to respond to the      committee s request in a timely manner  Sincerely  R  Duke Blackwood     Director     Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
