       Leahy Urges Relief For Vermonters At The Gas Pump As Oil Companies   Report Record Profits                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy      Urges Relief For Vermonters At The Gas Pump      As Oil Companies Report Record Profits        High Fuel Costs Continue To Hit Vermonters And Other Americans     Struggling To Heat Their Homes This Winter        WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Feb  1   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the      ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  on Wednesday      pushed for Congress to provide relief to consumers and families      struggling with record high fuel prices     Leahy      has been pivotal in securing funds for   the Low Income Home      Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  that helps struggling families in      Vermont and other states with heating costs during the cold winter      months  On Wednesday  as the  Senate Judiciary Committee held a      hearing on the Consolidation in the Energy Industry  Raising Prices      at the Pump   Leahy urged passage of other measures to help      Vermonters and other consumers afford gas and home heating oil at a      time when prices are soaring     Leahy      also criticized executives from big oil firms from declining to      testify at Wednesdays hearing  Chairman Arlen Specter  R Pa   said      he intends to call a second hearing  in which the executives again      will be expected to appear and testify    In his      hearing statement  Leahy especially pushes for passage of a   windfall profits tax that      would recapture record profits and return them to the American      people  as well as a Leahy backed bill taking aim at monopolistic      practices by  allowing the U S  Department of Justice      and the Federal Trade Commission to file antitrust lawsuits against      foreign states  such as members of the Oil Producing and Exporting      Countries  OPEC   for price fixing and other anticompetitive      activities     Below is      Leahys statement from the hearing          Statement of Senator Patrick        Leahy       Hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee     Consolidation in the Energy Industry  Raising Prices at the Pump        February 1  2006     The day before yesterday  the big oil      companies posted their year end profit reports for 2005       The five biggest  ExxonMobil  ChevronTexaco  ConocoPhillips  BP       and Shell    trumpet raking in record profits for the year  In fact       ExxonMobil  with  36 7 billion in profit last year  turned the      highest yearly profit in U S  history for any business    Even more striking is how these      profits compare with years past  Since 1999  oil refiners have seen      a 334 percent increase in yield made on each gallon of gasoline      refined  These same companies have more than doubled their control      over oil production  The oil companies claim that their increased      costs justify gouging the consumers filling their gas tanks and      heating their homes  This is obscene    We will not be hearing from these      companies today because they have declined to appear at this      hearing  I am disappointed by their decision  Boycotting this      hearing will not stifle our questions or the need for their      accountability to Congress and American consumers     I say it is time to invest in the      American people  We applaud this hearing as part of a real move to      investigate excessive market concentration in the oil industry that      is stifling competition  constricting supply  and ultimately harming      consumers  But once we understand it  we need to do something about      it   I am trying to do my part  I have      called for a windfall profits tax that would recapture record      profits and return it to the American people  I have introduced the      bipartisan NOPEC bill  and I have worked with my colleagues to      secure funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP       that brings much needed heat during the cold winter months to low      income families in places like Vermont that cant afford to pay      record breaking fuel prices  I urge my colleagues to stand up to      the power of the oil companies in defense of the American public        I was glad to hear the President      sounding like a Democrat on energy last night in his State of the      Union speech  I can only hope that his words mean that he has      finally abandoned the failed policy of the Cheney energy task force      that had worked in secret with Ken Lay and other energy industry      bigwigs  Had we adopted the Democratic energy proposal on which      Senator Bingaman and others have worked so hard over the last      several years  we would be much farther along  Nonetheless  we      welcome the President and  I hope  some congressional Republicans to      the Democratic emphasis on alternative and renewable fuels  After      all that the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership has      done to advance the interests of the oil companies  including the      attempts by House Republican leadership to insert special interest      provisions in conference reports to give oil companies immunity for      the environmental and health damage they cause  this reversal of      position would be a good development for the American people        Along with conservation  renewable      energy is a key to a cleaner  more efficient energy future  If the      President would work with us and follow through with sensible      proposals  we can forge a bipartisan partnership  working together       we can do better to make this a safer more energy efficient and more      prosperous country  I along with the rest of America      will be watching to see if these statements are reflected in the      Presidents policies and budget request  however    As I said last night  I agree that we      need to relieve Americas dependence on foreign oil       Although the Mideast is not the source of the majority of our      energy  its share has grown during this Administration  I also urge      the President and the Republican leadership of Congress to work with      us to relieve our dependence on foreign investors and on borrowing      from Social Security to finance the record deficits and growing debt      that their policies have created
