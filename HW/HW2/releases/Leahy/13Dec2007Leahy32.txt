       Judiciary Committee Passes Bill To Reauthorize Funding For National   Center For Missing And Exploited Children                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Judiciary Committee Passes       Bill To Reauthorize Funding       For National Center For Missing And Exploited Children      Leahy Hatch Legislation       Authorizes Funding For Critical National Center     WASHINGTON  Thursday  Dec  13        2007   The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday unanimously       reported legislation sponsored by Committee Chairman Patrick       Leahy  D Vt   and Committee member Orrin Hatch  R  Utah  to       reauthorize funding for the nations premier center for the       protection and rescue of missing and exploited children  The       bipartisan Protect Our Children First Act was introduced in July       by Leahy and Hatch       The bill reauthorizes funding for       the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC         which is slated to expire in 2008  Leahy and Hatch have been       longtime advocates for the NCMEC  and in 2003 sponsored       legislation to keep the Center funded  The Center has worked on       more than 127 700 cases since it opened in 1984  and has helped       rescue more than 110 200 children  The Center is funded under       the Department of Justice  and works in conjunction with DOJs       Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention         The Department of Justice       estimates that more than 2 000 children are reported missing       every day  said Leahy  A central responsibility of our       government is to protect its citizens  and particularly its       children  The National Center for Missing and Exploited       Children has worked effectively to protect some of our most       vulnerable citizens  I have worked with Senator Hatch over the       years to ensure that this important Center receives the       necessary support to continue its operations  and I hope the       Senate will quickly pass this vital legislation       With the dangers of online       predators  children are subject to threats nowadays that we       never could have imagined when we first founded the National       Center  Hatch said  The goals and activities of this great       organization are a critical line of defense in protecting those       who otherwise cannot defend themselves  I appreciate Senator       Leahys leadership and his bipartisanship on this issue and look       forward to celebrating this bills final passage with him when       Congress eventually gets it to President Bushs desk       The Protect Our Children First Act       will reauthorize NCMEC through 2013  and makes several       improvements to the Centers ability to collaborate with       federal  state and local law enforcement agencies by     Providing analytical and        technical support to assist law enforcement agencies in        searching public databases to identify missing children and        to locate abductors     Facilitating the deployment of        the National Emergency Child Locator Center to assist in        locating children in times of natural disasters      Tracking the incidence of        attempted child abductions to report any links or patterns        to law enforcement agencies         The Committee Thursday also       unanimously approved two additional pieces of legislation to       protect children from predators  the Keeping the Internet Devoid       of Sexual  KIDS  Predators Act and the Internet Safety Education       Act                           Statement Of Chairman Patrick Leahy  On S        1829  The Protect Our Children First Act Of 2007     Senate Judiciary       Committee  Executive Business Meeting  December 13  2007     Today we consider three important       pieces of child safety legislation  We can all agree that we       should do everything we can to protect our children from being       victimized by predators  I am pleased that we have before us       three bills that take important steps toward this goal  the       Protect Our Children First Act  the Internet Safety Education       Act  and the KIDS Act        I am delighted that Senator Hatch       agreed to join with me as the lead cosponsor to introduce the       Protect Our Children First Act  which reauthorizes the National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children  Senator Hatch and I       have worked together many times over the years on legislation to       protect the safety and welfare of our children  and I thank him       for his continued leadership  I am disappointed that we could       not pass this bipartisan  consensus bill out of Committee last       week because of an anonymous hold  but I am pleased that we can       move it today        It pains us all to see on TV and       in the newspapers photo after photo of missing children from all       around our country  As a father and grandfather  I can imagine       that an abducted child is any parents worst nightmare        Unfortunately  it is a nightmare that happens all too often        Indeed  the Justice Department estimates that 2 200 children are       reported missing each day  There are approximately 114 600       attempted stranger abductions every year  with 3 000 to 5 000 of       those attempts succeeding  These families deserve the       assistance of the American people and a helping hand from       Congress and from federal agencies        As the Nation s top resource       center for child protection  the National Center for Missing and       Exploited Children spearheads national efforts to locate and       recover missing children and raises public awareness about ways       to prevent child abduction  molestation and sexual       exploitation  Further  NCMEC works to make our children safer       by acting as a national voice and advocate for those too young       to vote or speak up for their own rights        The Center operates under a       congressional mandate and works in cooperation with the U S        Department of Justice s Office of Juvenile Justice and       Delinquency Prevention to coordinate the efforts of law       enforcement officers  social service agencies  elected       officials  judges  prosecutors  educators  the United States       Marshals Service  and the public and private sectors to break       the cycle of violence that historically has perpetuated these       needless crimes against children  Child advocates like John       Walsh  who was supportive of the Congresss work to enact the       National Centers charter  also continue to support the Centers       vital mission         The Center s professionals have       busy jobs  They have worked on more than 127 700 cases of       missing and exploited children since its 1984 founding  helping       to recover more than 110 200 children  The Center raised its       recovery rate from 64 percent in the 1990s to 96 percent today        It has set up a nationwide  toll free  24 hour telephone hotline       to take reports about missing children and clues that might lead       to their recovery  a National Child Pornography Tipline to       handle calls from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation       of children through the production and distribution of       pornography  and a CyberTipline to process online leads from       individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children  The       Center has taken the lead in circulating millions of photographs       of missing children  and it serves as a vital resource for the       17 000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the Nation in       the search for missing children and in the pursuit of adequate       child protection       The National Center for Missing       and Exploited Children manages to do all of this good work with       an annual DOJ grant  which is set to expire after fiscal year       2008  We must act now to extend its authorization so that it       can continue to help keep children safe and families intact       around our Nation       The Internet Safety and Education       Act recently introduced by Senator Menendez also makes important       strides in teaching our children about internet safety  The       grant program created under this bill will give educators and       parents the tools necessary to teach proper online interactions       and promote safe Internet usage to their students and children       in an age appropriate manner  At a time when more and more       youth are using the Internet to communicate  it is essential       that we utilize programs that teach our children how to use the       Internet safely        I have also been glad to work with       Senator Schumer on the KIDS Act  He has worked in good faith to       make improvements to the bill and I appreciate all he has done       on the legislation  I look forward to consideration of this       bill and the other important child protection bills on the       Agenda this week
