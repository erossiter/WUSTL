       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Jennifer Walker   Elrod To The Fifth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Jennifer Walker Elrod To The Fifth Circuit     Executive Business Meeting     September 20  2007  Today we consider the     nomination of Jennifer Walker Elrod for a lifetime appointment to the     Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  one of the Nations powerful     federal appeals courts   The progress we have     made this year in considering and confirming judicial nominations is     often lost amid the partisan sniping over this Presidents most     controversial nominations   This session of Congress  the Committee has already     reported out 33 lifetime appointments to the federal courts and the     Senate has already confirmed 29 of them  That is seven more confirmed     by the middle of September this year than were confirmed in all of 2005     when the Senate  with a Republican majority  was considering the     nominees of this Republican President  It is 12 more confirmations than     were achieved during the entire 1996 session when Republicans stalled     consideration of President Clintons nominations   We have confirmed three     circuit court nominees so far this year  That is the same as the number     of President Clintons circuit court nominations confirmed by this time     in 1999 with a Republican led Senate and three more than the     Republican led Senate confirmed in the entire 1996 session  That     was the session in which not a single circuit court nominee was     confirmed  Judge Elrods nomination  if reported out today  would be     the fifth circuit court nomination reported out by the Committee  The Senate has confirmed 20 circuit court     nominations and 129 federal judicial nominees while I have presided in     my two years as Judiciary Chairman  During the Bush Presidency  more     circuit judges  more district judges    more total judges    have     been confirmed during the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary     Chairman than during the 2 year tenures of either of the two Republican     Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities      I do not intend to pocket filibuster more than 60     of this Presidents judicial nominees  as the Republican majority did     with President Clintons judicial nominees  Indeed  although I did not     support the nomination  I scheduled a hearing and Committee     consideration for Judge Southwick before this Committee  I do not     recall that happening when the Senate was controlled by Republicans and     a Democratic President occupied the White House      Today  we consider a nominee to the Fifth Circuit      During the Clinton Administration several outstanding nominees to the     Fifth Circuit were pocket filibustered  They included Judge Jorge     Rangel of Texas  Enrique Moreno of Texas and Alston Johnson of     Louisiana  They were pocket filibustered without a hearing or Committee     consideration   Next year the Thurmond     rule will kick in until after a new President is inaugurated  I find it     inexplicable that this White House chose not to work with Democratic and     Republican home state Senators on several recent nominations    The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts lists     47 judicial vacancies  The President has sent us only 24 nominations     for these remaining vacancies  Twenty three of them  almost half      have no nominee  Of the 19 vacancies deemed by the Administrative     Office to be judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us     nominees for eight of them  more than a third  Of the 16 circuit court     vacancies  six    more than a third    are without a nominee  If the     President had worked with the Senators from Michigan  Rhode Island      Maryland  California  New Jersey  and Virginia  we could be in a     position to make even more progress  I would rather see us work     together in the selection of nominees so that we can confirm judges     rather than fight about them   Of the 23 vacancies without any nominee  the     President has violated the timeline he set for himself at least 15 times        15 have been vacant without so much as a nominee for more than 180     days  The number of violations may in fact be much higher since the     President said he would nominate within 180 days of receiving notice     that there would be a vacancy or intended retirement rather than from     the vacancy date itself  We conservatively estimate that he also     violated his own rule 11 times in connection with the nominations he has     made  That would mean that with respect to the 47 vacancies  the     President is out of compliance with his own rule more than half of the     time   We have helped reduce the circuit vacancies from a     high mark of 32 in the early days of this Administration  to as few as     13  Contrast that with the Republican led Senates lack of action on     President Clintons moderate and qualified nominees that resulted in     increasing circuit vacancies during the Clinton years from 17 to 26      During those years  the Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous and     successful efforts under the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in     anticipation of a Republican President   More than 60 percent of current circuit court     judges were appointed by Republican Presidents  with the current     President having appointed more than 30 percent of the active circuit     judges already   This Committee and this Senate has made progress     towards filling longstanding judicial vacancies  I intend to do what I     can to ensure that the federal judiciary remains independent and able to     provide justice to all Americans
