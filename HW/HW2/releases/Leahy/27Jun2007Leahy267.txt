       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy In Support Of The Baucus Tester   Amendment To The Immigration Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   In Support Of The Baucus Tester Collins Leahy Amendment   To The Immigration Bill   June 27  2007 MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am pleased to offer my    support for the Baucus Tester Collins Leahy amendment to strip the    references to the problematic REAL ID program from the underlying    immigration bill  We may agree or disagree about the merits of the actual    REAL ID program  but as hearings in the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland    Security and Government Affairs Committee have shown  REAL ID is far from    being ready for prime time   While the Department of Homeland Security has not even    released final regulations directing the States on REAL ID implementation     REAL ID licenses are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID card  since you    will need one to enter courthouses  airports  federal buildings  and  if    this bill passes  workplaces all across the country  With roughly 260    million drivers in this country  I do not see how we could have the massive    national databases required by REAL ID and this immigration bill up and    running by the 2013 deadline set in this bill  Moreover  REAL ID raises    multiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges could delay final    implementation for years   In addition to numerous privacy and civil liberties    concerns  REAL ID is a massive drivers tax that could cost Americans    taxpayers more than  23 billion  Opposition spans the political spectrum     from the right to the left  and a large number of States have expressed    concerns about the mandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and    resolutions that oppose REAL ID  Georgia  Washington  Oklahoma  Montana     South Carolina  Maine  and New Hampshire have gone so far as to pass binding    legislation that says they intend to refuse to comply with REAL ID  The    National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors    Association have expressed serious reservations about the costs imposed on    the States  and the structure of the poorly drafted grant program in the    underlying bill  The Center for Democracy and Technology and the ACLU have    expressed serious concerns about the lack of privacy and civil liberties    protections within the REAL ID program  The reaction to the unfunded    mandates and lack of privacy standards in the REAL ID Act is a good example    of what happens when the Federal government imposes a unilaterally devised    and ill considered mandate rather than working to meet goals through    cooperation  bipartisanship  and partnership   For any new immigration measures to be effective  they    must be well designed  Forcing employers  employees  and the States to use    this troublesome national ID card will slow down the hiring process  stifle    commerce  and not serve as an effective strategy  In addition  the States    have already told us that they will not all have their new license programs    up and running by the 2013 deadline called for in this bill  On top of    that  I have gone through this bill several times  and I have found money    for border fences  money for surveillance technologies  money for border    patrol agents  and money for detention facilities  but I cannot find any    hard money that actually goes into REAL ID implementation  So doing away    with this poorly drafted grant program will not take one dollar away from    the  4 4 billion in enforcement money contained in this bill   As a result  Mr  President  I do not believe that we    should jeopardize the future success of the immigration reforms sought in    this bill by tying REAL ID too closely to it  Instead of mandating REAL ID    licenses for employment verification  I think we should support the    Baucus Tester Collins Leahy amendment to strip REAL ID from this bill and    put together a workable employment verification system that does not    needlessly burden every legal job seeker in this country with the onerous    and problematic requirements of REAL ID
