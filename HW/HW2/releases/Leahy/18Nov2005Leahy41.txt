                VERMONT             As Thanksgiving And Ski Season       Arrive       Vermonts       Skiers  Ski Visitors And Snow Sports Businesses  Wont Be Caught With Their Ski       Pants Down   Leahy       And Jeffords Win Extension      Of Quota Exemption For High Quality   Skiwear   WASHINGTON  Friday  Nov  18        With       Thanksgiving and the traditional opening of the new ski season       just around the corner  Vermonts skiers  ski equipment       distributors and retailers got a shot of good news this weekend       as Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         and Jim Jeffords  I Vt         announced success in their efforts to end permanently a       problem causing import quota on high quality  synthetic ski       pants from China    Leahy and Jeffords earlier this       fall won an exemption from the quota through 2005  in a       recent textile agreement with China        The Vermont duo now has won a permanent extension through 2008        the life of the authority to impose quotas for these products       under U S  law  In a letter to Leahy and Jeffords  U S  Trade       Representative Rob Portman informed Leahy and Jeffords of the       Administrations agreement to their request  The victory will       allow Vermont ski       distributors and retailers to  offer       advanced  high quality gear no longer made in the United States       to skiers in and out of      Vermont during this       years busy ski season        and beyond    Let       it snow    were ready for a great season  said Leahy  This       is a victory for skiers  and its also a relief for our       snow sports industries        Vermont firms       that supply ski equipment       can now stock their shelves       without interruption    I am pleased       Vermonts retailers will have an ample supply of ski pants  not       just this year  but in the near future  said Jeffords  This       textile agreement will help ensure profitable and enjoyable       winters that are so critical to Vermonts economy and way of       life    The Vermont      senators       led a bipartisan effort to  convince Bush   Administration      trade       negotiators  to exempt ski       pants from the U S  imposed quota on apparel and textile goods       imported from China  No domestic manufacturers currently       produce this advanced skiwear  and  Leahy and Jeffords had emphasized       that the quota       created substantial supply problems for the snow sports       industry        The quotas are       designed to protect American firms from potentially unfair       international competition        but the       ski pants quota only served to hurt American ski gear       distributors  In October  the Committee on the Implementation       of Textile Agreements  CITA   a  unit       of the Commerce Department  responded to the senators efforts       by announcing that ski pants will be exempt from the quota that       applies to man made fiber trousers through 2005   The       textile agreement extended the exemption through the next two       years        There       is no authority for the import quota after 2008  making the       exemption for ski pants  now   permanent        for all practical purposes    Vermonts       ski supply venders  like       Bogner of America and Burton Snowboards  immediately hailed       the importance of the breakthrough in the business   the exemption       will bring to their venders    Bogner of       America is extremely pleased with the agreement exempting       man made fiber ski pants from quota  said Josh Noble   Bogners import export      administrator        With       no domestic production of man made fiber ski pants  it is       crucial to our operations that we are able to freely import this       product  Bogner of America thanks       Senator Leahy       and Senator Jeffords for their efforts on our behalf    Exempting       man made ski pants imported from China from quotas through 2008       will help the snowboarding market offer the products our       consumers demand  says John Lacy   director       of mens      apparel       at Burton Snowboards  The snow sports industry has built very       strong relationships with manufacturers in China to meet the       quality we require for our innovative products  This is great       news for our industry    Leahy and       Jeffords  who were joined by Sens  Judd Gregg  R  N H    Olympia       Snowe  R Maine   and Orrin Hatch  R Utah  in their efforts        first wrote to Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez in July            raising       concerns       about the problems the quotas created for the  U S    ski industry        and       Leahy and Jeffords also initiated another letter   in September       urging the exemption    The textile       agreement with China  also   does not limit       the export of man made fiber ski jackets        another staple of the industry  which bodes well for continued       imports of those items
