       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Iraq Reconstruction Failures                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Ranking Member  Senate Appropriations      Subcommittee     On State  Foreign Operations And Related Programs      On Iraq Reconstruction Failures     July 31  2006 Mr  President  we learned this past week of the      latest example of the colossal waste  fraud and abuse in the      Administrations reconstruction program in Iraq   Documented in the Special Inspector Generals      report released last Friday is the fiasco of the Basra Childrens      Hospital  yet another casualty on the long list of U S  financed      infrastructure projects in Iraq to face cost overruns       mismanagement  delays and potential cancellation   Back in 2003  Congress allocated  50 million      for the construction of a 94 bed state of the art childrens cancer      treatment hospital in southern Iraq  Despite repeated calls from      humanitarian organizations and experts at the United States Agency      for International Development to instead work with the Iraqis to      rebuild their primary health system  the Bush Administration      promoted this high profile  glitzy project championed by the White      House  Nearly three years later  due to gross      mismanagement  the hospital is only 35 percent complete  out of      money and teetering on the verge of collapse  The cost overruns are      so significant that the project will cost between  120 and  160      million to complete and is not expected to be finished until      December 2007  over a year later than planned  Meanwhile  Iraqis      continue to suffer from low quality and poor access to basic health      services  USAID is at fault for not properly accounting      for all the costs of constructing the hospital and should have      consulted with Congress when they knew about cost overruns and      scheduling delays  But press reports have ignored the fact that      from the beginning  USAID wisely opposed this costly  misguided      infrastructure project in a dangerous and corrupt environment       knowing of the likelihood that these problems could arise   Bechtel  the lead government contractor for the      Basra Hospital project and the same contractor for the flawed Boston      Big Dig tunnel project  has once again been dismissed from a      large scale project due to incompetence  Sadly  this is not the      first nor is it likely to be the last instance of waste  fraud and      abuse in the reconstruction of Iraq under the negligent leadership      of the Bush Administration   The Office of the Special Inspector General for      Iraq Reconstruction has been the watchdog for the billions of      dollars appropriated for Iraq reconstruction programs and      operations  The creation of the office was initially opposed by the      White House and by some in Congress who would prefer that the      appalling blunders of the Iraq reconstruction program not be exposed      to the light of day   By all accounts  the Special Inspector General      has done an excellent job under difficult and dangerous conditions      by uncovering numerous instances of waste and fraud and there are      dozens of investigations and prosecutions under way   The picture provided by the Special Inspector      General is in stark contrast to the rhetoric coming from the      Administration that reconstruction is moving forward at a rapid      pace  Thanks to the persistent leadership of Senator Feingold  and      with support from Senators Warner and Levin  we were able to include      a Feingold Leahy Amendment to the Senate version of the fiscal year      2007 Defense Authorization bill to extend the life of the Special      Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and ensure continued and      necessary audits of the very programs the Special Inspector General      was created to oversee  It is crucial that this provision be      retained in the final version of the bill   Mr  President  the tragedy of the Basra      Childrens Hospital project speaks volumes about this      Administrations Iraq policy  It is a legacy of arrogance  squander      and incompetence  Just throw money at the problem and hope for the      best  Use expensive American contractors rather than Iraqis who are      unemployed or underemployed and could do the work for a fraction of      the cost  And then try to shut down the office that exposes the      waste  It is shocking  it is tragic and it is inexcusable
