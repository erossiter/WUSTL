       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Reports Of The Resignation Of Attorney   General Alberto Gonzales                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Reports Of The Resignation    Of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales    August     27  2007 Under this Attorney General     and this President  the Department of Justice suffered a severe crisis     of leadership that allowed our justice system to be corrupted by     political influence  It is a shame  and it is the Justice Department      the American people and the dedicated professionals of our law     enforcement community who have suffered most from it   The obligations of the     Justice Department and its leaders are to the Constitution  the rule of     law and the American people  not to the political considerations of this     or any White House  The Attorney Generals resignation reinforces what     Congress and the American people already know    that no Justice     Department should be allowed to become a political arm of the White     House  whether occupied by a Republican or a Democrat   The troubling evidence     revealed about this massive breach is a lesson to those in the future     who hold these high offices  so that law enforcement is never subverted     in this way again  I hope the Attorney Generals decision will be a     step toward getting to the truth about the level of political influence     this White House wields over the Department of Justice and toward     reconstituting its leadership so that the American people can renew     their faith in its role as our leading law enforcement agency
