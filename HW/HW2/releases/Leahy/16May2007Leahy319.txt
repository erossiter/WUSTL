       Leahy Presses White House To Cooperate With Panel s Probe Into U S    Attorney Firings                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy Presses White House To     Cooperate    With Panels Probe Into U S  Attorney Firings      Warns White House Counsel Continued Refusal    Could Lead To Committee Subpoenas  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  May     16   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   today     pressed the White House to cooperate with the panels ongoing     investigation into the mass firings and replacement of U S  Attorneys or     face congressional subpoenas    I have reached out to you many times     during the past two months seeking voluntary cooperation from the White     House with the Judiciary Committees investigation into the mass firings     and replacements of U S  Attorneys  To date the White House has not     produced a single document or allowed even one White House official     involved in these matters to be interviewed  Leahy wrote in a letter to     White House Counsel Fred Fielding    Evidence gathered by the Committee through     several hearings  interviews with current and former Justice officials      and reviews of limited documents produced by DOJ  the Committee has     learned that White House officials played a significant role in     developing and implementing the plan for the dismissals  Leahy noted       The Committee has authorized Chairman     Leahy to issue subpoenas for several White House officials as well as     documents in its custody related to the panels investigation     There is evidence that White House     officials were deeply involved in what appears to be an effort to impose     political influence on federal law enforcement  If the White House     continues its refusal to provide information to the Senate Judiciary     Committee on a voluntary basis  I will have no choice but to issue     subpoenas to try to get to the truth in this matter  Leahy said    The text of the letter     is below        May 16  2007  Fred Fielding  Esq     Counsel to the President    The White House    1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20500    Dear Mr  Fielding   I have reached out to you many times     during the past two months seeking voluntary cooperation from the White     House with the Judiciary Committees investigation into the mass firings     and replacements of U S  Attorneys  To date the White House has not     produced a single document or allowed even one White House official     involved in these matters to be interviewed    It appears from the evidence gathered by     the Committee in five hearings  eight interviews with current and former     officials from the Department of Justice  and review of the limited     documents produced by that Department that White House officials played     a significant role in developing and implementing the plan for the     dismissals  Indeed  the plan seems to have originated in the White     House and was formulated by and with coordination of the White House     political operation    Along with nine other Members of the     Senate Judiciary Committee  I sent you a letter on March 22  2007      explaining why your take it or leave it offer of off the record     backroom interviews was unacceptable because it would constrain the     Committees and the publics access to key information and prejudge the     outcome of the investigation  Republican Members of the Committee have     publicly and privately recognized that such off the record meetings are     inadequate  as well  In a letter I sent with Chairman Conyers dated     March 28  2007  I tried to work with you to find ways to narrow our     dispute by gaining access to documents you had offered to provide as a     way to further our investigation  Your response has been to restate     your initial  unacceptable take it or leave it offer   We learned from press accounts that the     White House cannot account for the e mails of almost two dozen people at     the White House  including some the Judiciary Committee has asked to     question in connection with its ongoing investigation  The White House     has since admitted that these officials utilized e mail accounts      addresses and equipment provided by the Republican National Committee     and Republican campaigns to communicate about the plan to replace a     number of United States Attorneys       To date there has been no production of     relevant e mails to the investigating Committees  I have since learned     that the White House has requested that any e mails relevant to the     Committees investigation that are in the custody  control or possession     of the Republican National Committee  be turned over to the White House     rather than directly to the Judiciary Committee  The Republican     National Committee has apparently agreed    The refusal of the White House to provide     relevant documents and access to White House staff who played     significant roles in these firings and in the encroachment of politics     into law enforcement presents an obstacle to the ability of Congress and     the public to get to the truth  The Committee has learned in documents     and then heard in the testimony of Attorney General Gonzales  his former     Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson  and other high ranking Department of     Justice officials  that Karl Rove  Mr  Roves deputies Sara Taylor and     Scott Jennings  former White House Counsel Harriet Miers  and Deputy     White House Counsel William Kelly  were involved   In fact  White House officials have been     involved at every step of the plan to replace the U S  Attorneys        We have learned that Karl Rove and      then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales were involved from the      beginning in plans to remove U S  Attorneys  According to documents      obtained from the Department and Mr  Sampsons testimony  Mr       Sampson discussed the plan with then White House Counsel Gonzales      not long after President Bushs re election in late 2004  A January      9  2005 e mail released by the Department shows that Karl Rove      initiated inquires as to how we planned to proceed regarding U S       Attorneys  whether we were going to allow all to stay  request      resignations from all and accept only some of them  or selectively      replace them  etc  In his response to queries from David Leitch  a      White House official  Mr  Sampson expressly deferred to the      political judgment of Mr  Rove as to whether to proceed with plans      for the replacement of U S  Attorneys  writing  I f Karl thinks      there would be political will to do it  then so do I     Mr  Sampson  who has testified that he      aggregated the list of U S  Attorneys to be fired  was apparently      in frequent contact with White House officials about multiple      versions of proposed lists of possible U S  Attorneys for dismissal      and potential replacements over the course of nearly two years        According to documents and testimony       Ms  Taylor  the head of the White House political operation and      deputy of Mr  Roves  and Mr  Jennings  another aide to Mr  Rove       were involved in the discussions and planning that led to the      removal of Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate confirmation process      to install Tim Griffin  another former aide to Mr  Rove  as U S       Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas  They were part of a      group that discussed using the Attorney Generals expanded authority      under the Patriot Act reauthorization to avoid the opposition of the      Arkansas Senators by appointing Mr  Griffin as interim      indefinitely  In fact  in one email  Mr  Sampson described Mr       Griffins appointment as important to Harriet  Karl  etc     Mr  Sampson testified that Ms  Taylor      was upset when the Attorney General finally rejected this use of      the interim authority    a month after telling Senator Pryor he was      committed to finding a Senate confirmed U S  Attorney     The evidence gathered so far also      shows significant White House involvement    including by Mr  Rove         in the decision to dismiss David Iglesias as U S  Attorney for      the District of New Mexico  We have learned from the testimony of      the Attorney General and Mr  Sampson that Mr  Rove talked to the      Attorney General about concerns that prosecutors were not      aggressively pursuing voter fraud cases in districts in      Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  and New Mexico  One of these districts was      that of Mr  Iglesias  who was added to the list of U S  Attorneys to      be replaced  We have also learned that Mr  Roves aide  Mr       Jennings  set up a meeting between White House Liaison Monica      Goodling and New Mexico Republican officials in June 2006 to talk      about the U S  Attorney situation in New Mexico  describing it as      sensitive     We also know  through press accounts      and testimony  that after the midterm election  Mr  Rove discussed      the performance of Mr  Iglesias with Senator Domenici  who himself      had called Mr  Igelisias before the election to ask whether he was      bringing indictments against a Democratic official in the lead up to      the election  According to Allen Weh  Chairman of New Mexico s      Republican party chairman  when he asked Mr  Rove during a holiday      party in 2006 is anything ever going to happen to that guy          referring to Mr  Iglesias    Mr  Rove responded  Hes gone     The concern by White House officials      with purported voter fraud extends beyond New Mexico  We have      learned that Mr  Rove sent Mr  Sampson a packet of information      related to Wisconsin  According to his testimony  Mr  Sampson gave      this packet to another Department official  Matthew Friedrich  and      also asked him to look into the voter concerns in districts relayed      by Mr  Rove to the Attorney General  The packet apparently sent by      Mr  Rove contains a 30 page report concerning voting in Wisconsin in      2004 and also handwritten notes suggesting a concern with      prosecution in numerous districts    John McKay  former U S  Attorney for      the Western District of Washington  testified that when he met with      Ms  Miers and her deputy Mr  Kelley to interview for a federal      judgeship  he was asked to explain criticism that I mishandled the      2004 governor s election after which Republicans were upset with      him for not intervening in that closely contested election   Since the firings of these U S       Attorneys for political reasons became public  there has been an      effort to hide the role of White House officials  According to      documents and the testimony of Mr  Sampson  the Attorney General was      upset after the February 6  2006  testimony of Deputy Attorney      General Paul McNulty because Mr  McNultys testimony put the White      House involvement in the firings into the public domain  The      Administrations February 23  2007  response to a letter from      Senators Reid  Schumer  Durbin and Murray regarding the firings      stated  I am not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the AGs      decision to appoint Griffin  Earlier e mails indicate that the      appointment of Mr  Griffin  another former deputy to Mr  Rove  was      important to Mr  Rove  The White House apparently signed off on      this letter  Many parts of this letter have since been retracted       Recent reports indicate that among the e mails withheld from the      investigating Committees are e mails indicating that White House      officials were consulted about that misleading letter     According to the testimony of      Department officials  Mr  Rove and other White House officials      attended a meeting at the White House on March 5  2007    the day      before Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General William Moschella      testified before the House Judiciary Committee    to go over the      admin position on all aspects of the US atty issue      Even though the White House has not     provided a single document or witness  the President and others speaking     for the Administration continue to state that nothing improper has     occurred and that there is no credible evidence of wrongdoing  I     continue to await an answer to my April 5  2007  letter to you asking     for the reviews by White House staff that led the President to     conclude as of March 20  2007  that there was no wrongdoing  including     any information that has led the President to discount the mounting     evidence of impropriety revealed as the investigation continues   The White House cannot have it both     waysit cannot withhold the documents and witnesses and thereby     stonewall the investigation and  at the same time  claim that it knows     of nothing improper  The involvement of Mr  Rove was initially denied     but must now be conceded  as it was by the Attorney General and by the     Attorney Generals former chief of staff during their Senate Judiciary     Committee testimony   The strong  and bipartisan  concern and     sadness about this affair and the damage that has been done to the     integrity of the Department of Justice was only deepened after the     Attorney Generals testimony  At the Senate Judiciary Committees April     19  2007  hearing with the Attorney General  Senators from both sides of     the aisle saw their questions go unanswered and witnessed the Attorney     Generals failures to recall what he did and what others did in     developing and implementing the Administrations plan to fire United     States Attorneys who had not shown sufficient fealty to their political     aims    This appeared to be part of an effort to     minimize admissions of the involvement of and direction received from     the White House  There is evidence that White House officials were     deeply involved in what appears to be an effort to impose political     influence on federal law enforcement  If the White House continues its     refusal to provide information to the Senate Judiciary Committee on a     voluntary basis  I will have no choice but to issue subpoenas to try to     get to the truth in this matter     Sincerely         PATRICK LEAHY          Chairman
