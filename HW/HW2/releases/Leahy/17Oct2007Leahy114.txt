        On The Nomination Of Michael B  Mukasey                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                      VERMONT               Opening     Statement Of Chairman Patrick Leahy     Hearing On The Nomination Of Michael B  Mukasey    To Be Attorney General Of The United States    Senate Judiciary Committee  October 17  2007 Early this     year  as we began our consideration of the United States Attorney firing     scandal  I observed that we faced the most serious threat to the     effectiveness and professionalism of the United States Department of     Justice since the days of the Saturday Night Massacre  when President     Nixon forced the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox  I noted     that unlike during Watergate  this time there was no Elliot Richardson     or William Ruckelshaus around to defend the independence of federal     prosecutors  Instead  high officials at the Department and their staffs     were complicit with White House political operatives  Now  the entire     senior leadership and their staffs have resigned  as have Karl Rove and     his two top aides at the White House   The crisis     of leadership that led to these resignations has taken a heavy toll on     the tradition of independence that had long guided the Department of     Justice and protected it from political influence  The firing of the     U S  Attorneys  who are the chief federal law enforcement officers in     their districts  sent a message to all U S  Attorneys and the career     prosecutors working in those offices that only loyal Bushies would     keep their jobs or advance in their careers  This crisis has taken a     heavy toll in morale at the Department and in confidence among the     American people  As a former prosecutor I know that the dismay runs     deep  from the career attorneys at Justice and in our U S  Attorney     offices  straight down to the cops on the beat   I start this     hearing as I did the hearing this Committee held on the last Attorney     General nomination  hoping to be able to support the nominee  After     that hearing in 2005  I decided that I could not vote for the     confirmation of Alberto Gonzales  I did so noting  as Justice James     Iredell had in 1792  that the person who serves as Attorney General is     not called Attorney General of the President  but Attorney General of     the United States  There is good reason why the rule of law requires     that we have an Attorney General and not merely a Secretary of the     Department of Justice  This is a different kind of Cabinet position      distinct from all the others  and it requires greater independence  The     departing Attorney General never understood this  Instead  he saw his     role as a facilitator for this White Houses overreaching policies and     partisan politics   Restoring     the Department of Justice begins by restoring integrity and independence     to the position of Attorney General of the United States  The Attorney     Generals duty is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law  not     to work to circumvent it  Both the President and the Nation are best     served by an Attorney General who gives sound advice and takes     responsible action  without regard to political considerations  not one     who develops legalistic loopholes to serve the ends of a particular     administration  The Attorney General cannot interpret our laws to mean     whatever the current President wants them to mean  The Attorney General     is supposed to represent all of the American people  not just one of     them  Regrettably      the former Attorney General enabled this Administration to continue     policies that are in fundamental conflict with American values  decades     of law  sound military practice  international law  and human rights      We see it demonstrated  yet again  in the recent revelation that even     after waging and losing a public battle to resist congressional efforts     to outlaw torture and honor our obligations  this Administration      enabled by the Justice Department  apparently secretly doubled back to     redefine torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment to allow     the very conduct Congress had outlawed   We have seen     departures from this countrys honorable traditions  practices  and     established law in connection with interrogation methods that we condemn     when they are used by others  Likewise  we have seen political     influence corrupt the Department of Justice when it has departed from     its longstanding practices and tradition  practices that historically     serve to insulate it from partisanship in law enforcement  This     lawlessness led to Abu Ghraib  Haditha  and Blackwater  And valuing     loyalty over competence and accountability led to the bumbling aftermath     of Hurricane Katrina  the failure to care for wounded veterans at Walter     Reed  and the purge among U S  Attorneys   There is     much that has gone wrong that this Administration has stubbornly refused     to admit or correct  When President Bush ascribed Attorney General     Gonzales resignation to supposed unfair treatment and having his     good name       dragged through the mud for political reasons  he     mischaracterized the clear facts about a U S  Attorney firing scandal     that has decimated morale at the Department of Justice  To reclaim our     moral leadership  we need to acknowledge wrongdoing  These hearings are     about a nomination  but these hearings are also about accountability      We need a     new Attorney General  We need someone who understands that the     responsibilities and duties of that office are not to act as a     mouthpiece or validator for the Administration  or as the chief defense     lawyer for the White House  We are reminded by the examples of Elliot     Richardson and William Ruckelshaus from the Watergate era    and more     recently the examples of James Comey  Jack Goldsmith  and Alberto Mora        that law enforcement officials must enforce the law without fear or     favor to their benefactors at the White House or their political party      We have now seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle     to a Presidents policy agenda and the partisan desires of political     operatives   We are the most powerful Nation on earth  the most     powerful Nation the world has ever known  a country that cherishes     liberty and human rights  a Nation that has been a beacon of hope and     freedom to the world  We face vicious enemies  and we need the     confidence and the resolve to understand that we can and must defeat     them without sacrificing our values and stooping to their level   This is a     job interview for a big job that has become even bigger  Along with     helping keep Americans safe  protecting their rights  combating crime     and enforcing the law  and managing more than 100 000 employees and a     budget extending into the tens of billions of dollars  the next Attorney     General must regain public trust and begin the process of repair and     restoration   This nomination can begin the repair process  I     hope all Members of the Judiciary Committee  Democrats and Republicans     alike  will join to restore the constitutional checks and balances that     have been systematically eroded by this Administration  and I hope that     we can begin that process this week  I welcome the nominee and urge him     to answer our questions so that we can join together in restoring the     Department of Justice to be worthy of its name  The American people     expect   and deserve   no less                   Judge Michael Mukaseys opening statement is available online
