       Leahy  Feinstein Press Justice Department On U S  Attorney Vacancies                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy  Feinstein Press Justice      Department On U S  Attorney Vacancies         WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Oct  31  2007   Senate Judiciary Committee      Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Committee Member Dianne Feinstein       D Calif   Wednesday sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Peter      D  Keisler expressing concerns about the more than 20 U S  Attorney      vacancies nationwide and asking whether the Administration is      working with home state Senators to identify nominees to fill each      of these positions                Of the 93 U S  Attorneys across the country  23 positions remain      vacant  The Administration has not yet sent nominees to the Senate      Judiciary Committee for 21 of the 23 vacancies  including for ten      districts where the terms of interim U S  Attorneys have expired or      are about to expire  The Judiciary Committee earlier this year      began examining the Administrations mass firings of U S  Attorneys       a scandal which contributed to the resignation of former Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales  Earlier this year  Congress closed a      loophole exposed by the investigation when it passed legislation       now enacted  that has restored a 120 day time limit on the Attorney      Generals appointment of interim U S  Attorneys               When it comes to the U S  Attorneys in our home states  Senators      have a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in order to      insulate the federal law enforcement function from untoward      political influence  Leahy and Feinstein wrote  The law and the      practice have always been that these appointments require Senate      confirmation  The advice and consent check on the appointment power      for U S  Attorneys is a critical function of the Senate               The text of the letter follows                     October 31  2007              The Honorable Peter D  Keisler       Acting Attorney General       United States Department of Justice        950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W        Washington  DC 20530              Dear Mr  Keisler               We remain concerned about the extraordinary number of vacancies for      United States Attorney positions  We understand that there are      currently 23 districts out of 93 overall with acting or interim U S       Attorneys instead of Senate confirmed  Presidentially appointed      United States Attorneys  Twenty one of those districts do not have      a nominee  We write to inquire whether you and the Administration      are working with the Senators whose States encompass each of those      districts to identify and nominate strong and independent U S       Attorneys                In the course of the Committees investigation into the      unprecedented mass firings of U S  Attorneys by those in the      Administration that appointed them  we uncovered an effort by      officials at the White House and the Justice Department to exploit      an obscure provision enacted during the Patriot Act reauthorization      to do an end run around the Senates constitutional authority to      confirm U S  Attorneys                This loophole was closed on June 14  with the enactment of S 214       the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007       This law  which passed the Senate in March by an overwhelming vote      of 97 0  restored the 120 day term limit for Interim U S  Attorneys      appointed by the Attorney General  Accordingly  the terms of nine      interim United States Attorneys appointed during the time the      loophole was in place expired on        October 12  These include interim United States Attorneys in the      District of Alaska  the District of Arizona  the Northern and      Southern Districts of California  the District of Columbia  the      Northern District of Iowa  the Western District of Michigan  the      District of Puerto Rico  and the Southern District of West      Virginia  The term of another interim appointment  in the Southern      District of Illinois  is set to expire next week               Three of these interim appointees  for the Southern District of      Illinois  the District of Puerto Rico and the Southern District of      West Virginia  along with those in two other districts  were      appointed to be interim United States Attorneys after serving a      210 day term as Acting United States Attorney under the Vacancies      Act  Acting under the guidance of what we believe to be an      erroneous opinion of the Justice Departments Office of Legal      Counsel  the Administration has been employing this misguided      approach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the advice      and consent of the Senate  This approach runs afoul of      Congressional intent and the law                When it comes to the U S  Attorneys in our home states  Senators      have a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in order to      insulate the federal law enforcement function from untoward      political influence  The law and the practice have always been that      these appointments require Senate confirmation  The advice and      consent check on the appointment power for U S  Attorneys is a      critical function of the Senate                Sincerely                      PATRICK LEAHY      DIANNE FEINSTEIN        Chairman      United States Senator
