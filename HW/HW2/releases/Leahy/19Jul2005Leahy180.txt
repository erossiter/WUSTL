       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Reauthorization Of   The Violence Against Women Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Hearing On The Reauthorization Of The Violence Against Women Act     July 19  2005 The enactment of      the Violence Against Women Act over a decade ago marked an important      national commitment to survivors of domestic violence and sexual      assault  The bipartisan legislation on which we will hear testimony      today  S  1197  will further our goal of ending domestic violence       dating violence  sexual assault and stalking  I am proud to join      Senators Biden  Hatch  Specter and others as an original cosponsor      of this important measure  I want to especially recognize Senator      Biden for his continued commitment to ending violence against women      and children  Along with the      Chairman  I welcome today an extraordinary panel of witnesses  With      us is Diane Stuart  Director of the Office on Violence Against Women      at the Justice Department and a number of leading advocates  They      make VAWA work and a reality in the lives of women and children      across the country  I thank them and salute them  A number of us      fought for a long time to create OVW as an independent office within      the Department of Justice  I am happy to note that  once given the      opportunity  the office has thrived as an independent entity within      the Department   Earlier in my      career as a county prosecutor in Vermont  I witnessed the      devastating effects of domestic violence  Violence and abuse affect      people of all walks of life every day and regardless of gender       race  culture  age  class or sexuality  Such violence is a crime      and it is always wrong  whether the abuser is a family member       someone the victim is dating  a current or past spouse  boyfriend       or girlfriend  an acquaintance or a stranger  The National      Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691 710 non fatal       violent incidents committed against victims by current and former      spouses  boyfriends or girlfriends  also known as intimate partners         during 2001  Of those incidents  85 percent were against women       The rate of non fatal intimate partner violence against women has      fallen steadily since 1993  when the rate was 9 8 incidents per      1 000 people  In 2001  the number fell to 5 0 incidents per 1 000      people  nearly a 50 percent reduction  but still unacceptably high       Tragically  however  the survey found that 1 600 women were killed      in 1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend  while in 2000      some 1 247 women were killed by their intimate partners  Our Nation has      made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in recognizing that      domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes  We have responded      with better laws  social support and coordinated community      responses  Millions of women  men  children and families  however       continue to be traumatized by abuse  leading to increased rates of      crime  violence and suffering  The Violence      Against Women Act has provided aid to law enforcement officers and      prosecutors  helped stem domestic violence and child abuse       established training programs for victim advocates and counselors       and trained probation and parole officers who work with released sex      offenders  Over the next few months  Congress has the opportunity      to reauthorize VAWA and make improvements to vital core programs       tighten criminal penalties against domestic abusers  and create new      solutions to other crucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual      assault  This is an opportunity to help treat children victims of      violence  augment health care for rape victims  hold repeat      offenders and Internet stalkers accountable  and help domestic      violence victims keep their jobs  Included in VAWA      2005 are reauthorizations of two programs that I initially sponsored      that are vital to helping rural communities battle domestic violence      in a setting in which isolation can make it more difficult for both      victims and law enforcement  In a small  rural state like Vermont       our county and local law enforcement agencies rely heavily on      cooperative  interagency efforts to combat and solve significant      problems  That is why I sought to include the Rural Domestic      Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program as part      of the original VAWA  This program helps make services available to      rural victims and children by encouraging community involvement in      developing a coordinated response to combat domestic violence       dating violence and child abuse  Adequate resources combined with      sustained commitment will bring about significant improvements in      rural areas to the lives of those victimized by domestic and sexual      violence  The Rural Grants      Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and expands the existing      education  training and services grant programs that address      violence against women in rural areas  This provision renews the      rural VAWA program  extends direct grants to state and local      governments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include      community collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or      expansion of additional victim services  This provision includes      new language that expands the program coverage to sexual assault       child sexual assault and stalking  It also expands eligibility from      rural states to rural communities  increasing access to rural      sections of otherwise highly populated states  This section      authorizes  55 000 000 annually for 2006 through 2010  which is an      increase of  15 million per year  The second grant      program initiative on which I have focused is the Transitional      Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence  Dating      Violence  Sexual Assault or Stalking  This program  which became      law as part of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the      Exploitation of Children Today  PROTECT  Act of 2003  authorizes      grants for transitional housing and related services for people      fleeing domestic violence  sexual assault or stalkers  At a time      when the availability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows       transitional housing for victims is especially needed  Today more      than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children      fleeing domestic violence  We have a clear problem that is in dire      need of a solution  This program is part of the solution  Transitional      housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving violence in      their homes and becoming self sufficient  Our bill  VAWA 2005       amends the existing transitional housing program by expanding the      current direct assistance grants to include funds for operational       capital and renovation costs  Other changes include providing      services to victims of dating violence  sexual assault and stalking       extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match that      used by Housing and Urban Development transitional housing programs       and updating the existing program to reflect the concerns of the      service provision community  The provision would increase the      authorized funding for the grant from  30 000 000 to  40 000 000       The Violence      Against Women Act passed the Senate in 1994  We declared that the      United States takes the problem of violence against women      seriously  The law declared that  a ll persons within the United      States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence      motivated by gender  and we enacted meaningful reform       Regrettably  in United States v  Morrison  the Supreme Court      struck down portions of the Act  That case involved a young woman      who was allegedly raped by two classmates while attending college       Our law allowed a victim of violence to seek civil remedies when the      violence was motivated by gender based animus  Congress showed in      its findings that justice is too often denied to women and a      majority of states supported our law and the civil remedy it      provided   By a narrow 5 to 4 vote  the Supreme Court struck down      this portion of the Violence Against Women Act and second guessed      the judgment of Congress on this remedial cause of action    This is a stark      reminder of what is at stake as we soon consider a nomination to      fill the current vacancy on the United States Supreme Court       Consistent with our oaths of office and allegiance to the      Constitution  a majority of the United States Senate  the House of      Representatives  the President of the United States and four of the      nine Justices on the Supreme Court thought the remedial action we      provided to victims of violence constitutional  Sadly  it was not      enough to save this important aspect of our legislative program from      a declaration of unconstitutionality by an activist Supreme Court  Now it is time to      strengthen the prevention of violence against women and children and      its devastating costs and consequences  This legislation is an      important part of our efforts to increase awareness of the problem      of violence  to save the lives of battered women  rape victims and      children who grow up with violence and to continue progress against      the devastating tragedy of domestic violence  I urge prompt action      on this legislation
