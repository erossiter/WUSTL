       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Passage Of The OPEN Government Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Passage Of The OPEN Government Act     U S  Senate Proceedings     August 3  2007  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am      pleased that the Senate has passed the  Leahy Cornyn  Openness Promotes Effectiveness in      our National Government Act  the OPEN Government Act        S 849  before adjourning for the August recess  This important      Freedom of Information Act legislation will strengthen and      reinvigorate FOIA for all Americans    For more than four decades  FOIA has      translated the great American values of openness and accountability      into practice by guaranteeing access to government information  The      OPEN Government Act will help ensure that these important values      remain a cornerstone of our American democracy    I commend the bills chief Republican      cosponsor  Senator John Cornyn  for his commitment and dedication to      passing FOIA reform legislation this year  Since he joined the      Senate five years ago  Senator Cornyn and I have worked closely      together on the Judiciary Committee to ensure that FOIA and other      open government laws are preserved for future generations  The      passage of the OPEN Government Act is a fitting tribute to our      bipartisan partnership and to openness  transparency and      accountability in our government    I also thank the many cosponsors of      this legislation for their dedication to open government and I thank      the Majority Leader for his strong support of this legislation  I      am also appreciative of the efforts of Senator Kyl and Senator      Bennett in helping us to reach a compromise on this legislation  so      that the Senate could consider and pass meaningful FOIA reform this      legislation before the August recess   But  most importantly  I especially      want to thank the many concerned citizens who  knowing the      importance of this measure to the American peoples right to know       have demanded action on this bill  This bill is endorsed by more      than 115 business  public interest  and news organizations from      across the political and ideological spectrum  including the      American Library Association  the U S  Chamber of Commerce       OpenTheGovernment org  Public Citizen  the Republican Liberty      Caucus  the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press      Association  The invaluable support of these and many other      organizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around      and support this legislation    The First FOIA      Reforms in More Than a Decade  As the first major reform to FOIA in     more than      a decade  the OPEN      Government Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of      excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help      to restore the publics trust in their government  This      bill will also improve transparency in the Federal Governments FOIA      process by     Restoring       meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA      Imposing real       consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day       statutory deadline     Clarifying that       FOIA applies to government records held by outside private       contractors     Establishing a       FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies  and     Creating a FOIA       Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a       meaningful alternative to costly litigation     Specifically  the OPEN Government Act      will protect the publics right to know  by ensuring that anyone who      gathers information to inform the public  including freelance      journalist and bloggers  may seek a fee waiver when they request      information under FOIA  The bill ensures that federal agencies will      not automatically exclude Internet blogs and other Web based forms      of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA fees  In addition  the      bill also clarifies that the definition of news media  for purposes      of FOIA fee waivers  includes free newspapers and individuals      performing a media function who do not necessarily have a prior      history of publication   The bill also restores meaningful      deadlines for agency action  by ensuring that the 20 day statutory      clock under FOIA starts when a request is received by the      appropriate component of the agency and requiring that agency FOIA      offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate agency component within      10 days of the receipt of such requests  The bill allows federal      agencies to toll the 20 day clock while they are awaiting a response      to a reasonable request for information from a FOIA requester on one      occasion  or while the agency is awaiting clarification regarding a      FOIA fee assessment  In addition  to encourage agencies to meet the      20 day time limit  the bill prohibits an agency from collecting      search fees if it fails to meet the 20 day deadline  except in the      case of exceptional circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute    The bill also addresses      a relatively new concern that  under current law       federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA      requests until just before a court decision that is favorable to a      FOIA requestor  The Supreme Courts decision in  Buckhannon Board and Care Home       Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of Health and Human Resources       532 U S  598  2001   eliminated the catalyst theory for attorneys      fees recovery under certain federal civil rights laws  When applied      to FOIA cases  Buckhannon      precludes FOIA requesters from ever being eligible to recover      attorneys fees under circumstances where an agency provides the      records requested in the litigation just prior to a court decision      that would have been favorable to the FOIA requestor  The bill      clarifies that Buckhannon  does not apply to FOIA cases  Under the bill  a FOIA requester      can obtain attorneys fees when he or she files a lawsuit to obtain      records from the government and the government releases those      records before the court orders them to do so  But  this provision      would not allow the requester to recover attorneys fees if the      requesters claim is wholly insubstantial    To address concerns      about the growing costs of FOIA litigation  the bill also creates      an Office of Government Information Services in the National      Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency level FOIA      disputes  In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency      will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer  who will monitor the agencys      compliance with FOIA requests  and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be      available to FOIA to resolve FOIA related disputes    Finally  the bill does several things      to enhance the agency reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA       Tracking numbers are not required for FOIA requests that are      anticipated to take ten days or less to process  The bill creates a      tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of the public      and the media  The bill also establishes a FOIA hotline service for      all federal agencies  either by telephone or on the Internet  to      enable requestors to track the status of their FOIA requests        In addition  the      bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are      held by outside private contractors  no matter where these records      are located  And  to create more transparency about      the use of statutory exemptions under FOIA  the bill ensures that      FOIA statutory exemptions that are included in legislation enacted      after the passage of this bill clearly cite the FOIA statute and      clearly state the intent to be exempt from FOIA    OPEN Government Is      An American Value  The Freedom of Information Act is      critical to ensuring that all American citizens can access      information about the workings of their government  But  after four      decades this open government law needs to be strengthened  I am      pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act will      ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that it works more effectively      for the American people    I am also please that       by passing this important reform legislation today  the Senate has      reaffirmed the principle that open government is not a Democratic      issue or a Republican issue  But  rather  it is an American issue      and an American value  I commend all of my Senate colleagues  on      both sides of the aisle  for unanimously passing this historic FOIA      reform measure  I hope that the House of Representatives  which      overwhelmingly passed a similar measure earlier this year  will      promptly take up and pass this bill and that the President will then      promptly sign it into law
