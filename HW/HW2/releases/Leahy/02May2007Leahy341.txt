Karl Rove E Mails      Compels Attorney General To Provide E Mails To Judiciary Committee    In Connection With Panels Probe Of U S  Attorney Firings And     Politicization Within Dept  Of Justice  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  May 2   Senator     Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Wednesday     issued a subpoena to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales compelling the     Department of Justice to provide all Karl Rove e mails in its possession     related to the panels ongoing investigation into the mass firings of     federal prosecutors    Rove  a senior political advisor to     President Bush  and the White House political operation    which Rove     heads  have been linked to the project that resulted in the     unprecedented firings of several well performing federal prosecutors      according to information gathered by the Committee through documents      interviews and testimony  Several of the dismissed prosecutors have     testified under oath and said in public that they were unaware of     performance problems and believe political influence was a factor in     their firings    Leahy requested the e mails first at the     Committees oversight hearing with the Attorney General on April 19  2007  and then again in a letter to the Attorney General on April     25  2007  The Attorney General has failed to respond to those earlier     requests    Included below and as a                                        May 2  2007  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales    Attorney General    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W       Washington  DC 20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   At the hearing last Thursday and again in     a letter dated April 25  2007  I asked you whether you would provide     Karl Roves e mails in the possession of the Justice Department to the     Committee without a subpoena  His lawyer stated publicly that these     emails  many of which have been reported lost  were turned over to     U S  Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald as part of the investigation into the     leak of the identity of a covert CIA officer by officials in the     Administration that led to the conviction of I  Lewis Scooter Libby      You responded at the hearing that you did not know but would check and     get back to me  I have not heard back from you since in response to my     question or the letter    Attached please find a subpoena compelling     the Department by May 15 to produce any and all emails and attachments     to emails to  from  or copied to Karl Rove related to the Committees     investigation into the preservation of prosecutorial independence and     the Department of Justices politicization of the hiring and firing and     decision making of United States Attorneys  from any  1  White House     account   2  Republican National Committee account  or  3  other     account  in the possession  custody or control of the Department of     Justice  This subpoena includes any such emails that were obtained by     Mr  Fitzgerald as part of the Plame investigation   I continue to hope that the Department     will cooperate with the Committees investigation  but it is troubling     that significant documents highly relevant to the Committees inquiry     have not been produced  such as a confidential order revealed yesterday     by the press that you issued in March 2006 delegating to two of your     aides  former Chief of Staff D  Kyle Sampson and former White House     Liaison Monica Goodling  authority over the hiring and firing of most     political employees of the Justice Department   Indeed  despite multiple requests for the     Department to produce documents voluntarily related to the Committees     investigation into the mass firings of U S  Attorneys and politicization     at the Department  the Departments production of documents has been     selective and incomplete  Many documents have been withheld or redacted     without any legal basis being set forth  In addition  to date  the     Department has yet to provide the Committee with the precise scope of     the production  any assurance that a preservation order was issued to     prevent the loss or destruction of documents  and a complete privilege     log that provides the basis for withholdings and redactions  In     document productions and interviews with Department employees  the     Department continues to insist on providing information within only a     highly limited scope inconsistent with the Committees inquiry and over     the Committees objection   I look forward to your compliance with the     Judiciary Committees subpoena by the May 15 return date  I also ask     for an immediate response to and full compliance with the outstanding     requests for information by the Committee and its members to avoid     further subpoenas   Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY     Chairman               Text of     Subpoena       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Gonzales    Attorney General    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  DC 20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   At the hearing last Thursday  I asked you     to provide Karl Rove s e mails in the possession of the Justice     Department  You responded that you did not know but would check and get     back to me  I have not heard back from you since   Please respond to my questions about Mr      Rove s e mails  whether they are in the custody of the Department of     Justice  and whether they will be provided without a subpoena   Sincerely      PATRICK LEAHY    Chairman                       Excerpt of     CQ Transcript of Chairman Leahy questioning during 4 19 07 SJC Oversight     Hearing w  Attorney General Gonzales      LEAHY  Mr  Attorney General      late last week  the White House spokesperson claimed an unknown number     of e mails  including those of Karl Rove  from both White House accounts     and apparently those sent or received using political Republican     National Committee accounts  were lost    And Mr  Rove s attorney  in     the investigation that led to Scooter Libby s conviction for lying     suggested that U S  Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald  a part of the     Department of Justice  obtained all of Mr  Rove s e mails as part of the     investigation into the leak of the identity of a covert CIA operative       If that is the case  those     e mails would be in your possession or in the possession of the     Department of Justice    What do we have to do to     obtain Mr  Rove s e mails relevant to the development and implementation     of the plan to replace U S  attorneys and the committee s investigation     into that matter       GONZALES  Senator  I was not aware that    I didn t see that article  I     wasn t aware that Mr  Fitzgerald had that information or if  in fact      the department still has that information    So     I d have to go back and look to see what  in fact  the facts are       LEAHY  If he does have the information  and it involves e mails relevant     to the development and implementation of the U S  attorneys plan         GONZALES  Senator  I believe that those    well  I don t have the answer     to that  Senator  I know that they re of interest to the committee  and     obviously the department wants to be cooperative with the committee       There may be White House     equities here that need to be considered  and so         LEAHY  We re not talking about e mails from the president  In fact  the     president doesn t use e mail  as I understand    Am I right       GONZALES  As far as I know that s correct  sir  But the fact that they     may have been communications over an RNC account doesn t mean that     they re not presidential records  If in fact relates to government     business  and they re transmitted over an RNC account  they could     nonetheless be presidential records  And so there would be a     governmental interest    a White House interest in those records       LEAHY  These are records supposedly that were lost  though       GONZALES  Senator  I don t know         LEAHY  Are they there or aren t they there       GONZALES  What I m saying is  is if in fact they exist         LEAHY  Well  what was    let me ask you this  The White House Counsel s     office is responsible for the establishment and oversight of these kind     of internal rules  conduct   When you served as the White     House counsel  you were there four years  What was the policy and     practice with regard to Karl Rove and other political operatives at the     White House using Republican National Committee e mail accounts to     conduct official government business       GONZALES  Well  of course  Senator         LEAHY  That d be a policy set by your office    What was the policy       GONZALES  Senator  there were a few people in the White House  as I     recall  who had    who use non governmental communications equipment      That was done actually  quite frankly  for legitimate reasons in terms     of not wanting to violate the Hatch Act and using government facilities     for political activity that is permitted under the Hatch Act for certain     individuals in the White House       LEAHY  But how many    but what was the policy    Could they conduct official     business on those        GONZALES  I think the intent of the policy as I recall  Senator  is     that those e mails were to be used primarily for non governmental     purposes  but in fact    but if there was governmental communications     communicated over these non governmental communications equipment  that     there ought to be some kind of effort to preserve that communication if     in fact it was a presidential record       LEAHY  There ought to be  or was your policy that there had to be       GONZALES  I think the policy    I have to go back and look at    the     policy was that it should be preserved  Printed out  or somehow     forwarded to a government computer       LEAHY  Are we talking about two or three computers  or a number of     computers      GONZALES Senator  I don t recall the number       LEAHY  If the White House spokesperson said as many as 50 past  current     White House officials had these separate RNC or other outside e mail     accounts to conduct official business  would that sound accurate      GONZALES  Sir  I d have no way of knowing       LEAHY  Well  as White House counsel  did you conduct any audit or     oversight of the use of non governmental e mails by White House     personnel       GONZALES  Senator  I don t recall there being an audit  We provided     guidance  but I don t recall such an audit       LEAHY  Is anyone investigating this issue now    GONZALES  At the Department     of Justice or at the White House       LEAHY  Are you aware of anyone investigating this issue now      GONZALES  Senator  from what I understand in the papers  is that I think     the Counsel s Office is looking to see what happened here  I don t know     if that s what you mean by an investigation    I think there is an effort      but I haven t spoken to the Counsel s Office about this issue as to     whether or not they re doing an investigation to see what happened       LEAHY  And you re not doing any investigation from the Department of     Justice       GONZALES  Senator  I m not aware that there is an investigation that s     ongoing with respect to this issue                         Associated Press clip of Roves Attorney  emphasis added       April     13  2007 Friday 8 42 PM GMT          Lawyer for top White House official says Rove did not delete e mails     sought in prosecutors firing probe    By     LAURIE KELLMAN  Associated Press Writer     The lawyer for Karl Rove  chief political adviser to President George W      Bush  dismissed the notion Friday that Rove intentionally deleted his     e mails from a Republican sponsored server   Rove mistakenly     believed that the communications were being preserved in accordance with     the law  attorney Robert Luskin said   The issue arose     because the White House and Republican National Committee have said they     may have lost e mails from Rove and other administration officials      Democratically chaired congressional committees want those e mails for     their investigations into the firings of eight federal prosecutors   The mystery of the     missing e mails is just one part of a furor over the firings of eight     U S  prosecutors that has threatened Attorney General Alberto Gonzales      job and thrown his Justice Department into turmoil   For now  Bush is     standing by his longtime friend from Texas  who has spent weeks huddled     in his fifth floor conference room at the Justice Department preparing     to tell his story to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday   Rove s     understanding starting very  very early in the administration was that     those e mails were being archived  said Rove attorney Luskin       The prosecutor probing the Valerie Plame spy case saw and copied all of     Rove s e mails from his various accounts after searching Rove s laptop      his home computer  and the handheld computer devices he used for both     the White House and Republican National Committee  Luskin said       The prosecutor  Patrick Fitzgerald  subpoenaed the e mails from the     White House  the committee and Bush s re election campaign  he added       There s never been any suggestion that Fitzgerald had anything less     than a complete record  Luskin said   Any e mails Rove     deleted were the type of routine deletions people make to keep their     inboxes orderly  Luskin said  He said Rove had no idea the e mails were     being deleted from the server  a central computer that managed the     e mail   On Thursday  one     Democratic committee chairman said his understanding was that the     committee believed Rove might have been deleting his e mails and in 2005     took action to preserve them in accordance with the law and pending     legal action   New documents     released Friday by the Justice Department may shed additional light  but     their release prompted Gonzales  one time chief of staff  Kyle Sampson      to postpone a closed door interview with congressional investigators   The missing e mails     posed some of the weightiest questions of a sprawling political and     legal conflict between the Bush administration and Democrats in     Congress   Democrats are     questioning whether any White House officials purposely sent e mails     about official business on the RNC server then deleted them  in     violation of the law to avoid scrutiny   White House     officials say they can t rule that out  but that the administration is     making an honest and aggressive effort to recover anything that was     lost  We have no indications that there was improper intent when using     these RNC e mails  spokeswoman Dana Perino said Friday   Luskin said Rove     didn t know that deleting e mails from his RNC inbox also deleted them     from the RNC s server  That system was changed in 2005       Rove voluntarily allowed investigators in the Plame case to review his     laptop and copy the entire hard drive  from which investigators could     have recovered even deleted e mails  Luskin said   As the     investigation was winding down  Luskin said  prosecutors came to his     office and reviewed all the documents including e mails he had collected     to be sure both sides a complete set   Luskin said he has     not heard from Fitzgerald s office and said that  if Fitzgerald believed     any e mails were destroyed  he would have called  Fitzgerald s office     declined comment   The White House did     not immediately respond to Luskin s comments   Separately  the     White House was confronted with unrelated questions about the possible     loss of e mails from aides  government accounts   Perino said she     could not rule out that millions of White House e mails could have been     lost when staffers  accounts were converted to Microsoft Outlook from     Lotus Notes  It was a rolling process  she said  which occurred in the     first couple of years of the administration  which took office in     January 2001   I wouldn t rule     out that there were a potential 5 million e mails lost  she said      There was no intent to have lost them       Associated Press writers Matt Apuzzo and Pete Yost contributed to
