       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy At The Conclusion Of The Hearings On The   Nomination Of Judge Samuel Alito                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comments Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       At The Conclusion Of The Hearings      On The Nomination Of Judge Samuel Alito      To The U S  Supreme Court      Friday  January 13  2006  For the public and for a nominee        the hearings are the one accountability moment before a lifetime       on the Supreme Court  After these hearings many question marks       remain about Judge Alito    Judge Alito responded to numerous       questions  but he fell short of adequately answering far too       many of them   At this stage  the concerns that I       had at the start of the hearings have not gone away    about his       views on the importance of the courts role as an effective       check on overreaching presidential power  and on government       intrusion into the lives and the privacy of Americans  More       concerns have arisen during the hearings  such as his refusal       Thursday to flatly agree that Congress cannot take away the       Supreme Courts ability to protect Americans First Amendment       rights  It is troubling  and frankly  astonishing  that a       nominee to our highest court would refuse to give that basic       assurance about protecting some of Americans basic rights        freedom of speech  religion  assembly and of the press  The       Constitution clearly makes the Supreme Court  not Congress  the       ultimate protector of our constitutional rights  and Congress       should not be able to take them away by passing a law   As I did after the hearings for       Chief Justice Roberts  I will review my notes and in some cases       the transcript and will make my decision before the committee       votes
