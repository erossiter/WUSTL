       Closing Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Voting Rights Act   Reauthorization Act  H R  9                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Closing Statement of Senator        Patrick Leahy        Chief Democratic Cosponsor And Floor Manager  On The        Specter Leahy Voting Rights Act Reauthorization Bill       Thursday  July        20  2006  As the Senate completes       consideration of this important legislation    the culmination       of many months of legislative activity to reauthorize the Voting       Rights Act    I welcome the President s statement of support       today  It was a long time in coming  and the long way round        but he got there  The President is right to have spoken of       racial discrimination as a wound not fully healed  We all want       our revitalization of the Voting Rights Act we consider today to       help in that healing process and in guaranteeing the fundamental       right to vote    I was reminded today of when the       President spoke dramatically last September from New Orleans       Jackson Square and pledged to confront poverty with bold       action  I look forward to that bold action  He spoke then of       helping our people overcome what he called deep  persistent       poverty  poverty with roots in a history of racial       discrimination  which cut off generations from the opportunity       of       America  I agree with him  We must  as the President said       that night  rise above the legacy of inequality  That is a       shameful legacy that still exists and still needs to be       overcome  The President is right that the wounds of racial       discrimination need to be fully healed  In my judgment  based       on the record before this Senate  the reauthorization of the       Voting Rights Act is needed to ensure that healing     I also welcome the support of       others who have come recently to this cause and struggle  I       welcome our Senate bill cosponsors who joined us after the       companion House bill had already won 390 votes and even those       who joined after the Senate bill was successfully voted out of       our Committee  18 0  It is never too late to join a good cause        and protecting the fundamental right to vote and have Americans        votes count is just such a cause    Someone who was not late to the       struggle but who has been at its forefront since his election to       the Senate in 1962 is the senior Senator from  Massachusetts  He       worked to pass the original landmark Voting Rights Act in 1965        On this issue he is the Senate s leader  It has been an honor       to work beside him in this important effort  And work he did        To assemble the record required work  He came to our hearings        helped organize them  helped assemble the witnesses  and when       Senators from the majority were unavailable  he and I proceeded       with the permission of our Chairman to chair those hearings  We       would not be passing this bill without the overwhelming support       that it will have if it had not been for Senator Kennedy   Of course  we are also honor the       senior Senator from  Hawaii who likewise voted for the       Voting Rights Act of 1965 and each of its reauthorizations  His       leadership in these matters is greatly appreciated by this       Senator and  I believe  by the Senate    I also thank the Democratic leader       for his help  Senator Reid stayed focused on making sure this       essential legislative objective was achieved  He worked with       us and the Republican leader throughout  He is a lead sponsor       of the legislation and was a key participant at our bicameral       announcement on the steps of the Capitol on May 2  Throughout       the process of developing the bill  developing the legislative       record and considering the bill  he has never failed to go the       extra mile to ensure the success of this effort     I thank our Chairman and lead       Senate sponsor  As I pushed and cajoled and urged action he       heard me out  Together with the other active members of the       Judiciary Committee  we worked to assemble the necessary record       and consider it so that our bill is on a solid factual  legal       and constitutional foundation  I thank each of our cosponsors       and  in particular  those who joined us early on  those on the       Judiciary Committee  and the Republican leader     There are too many others who       deserve thanks  They include Senator Salazar for his       contributions throughout and for his thoughtful initiative to       broaden those for whom this bill is named by including Cesar       Chavez  I look forward to working with him to make that a       reality  To all who have supported this effort I say thank you       and know that your real thanks will be in the fulfillment of the       promise of equality for all Americans in the years ahead     I wholeheartedly thank the members       of the civil right community  Led by Wade Henderson and  Nancy Zirkin       at the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and by Bruce Gordon       and Hilary Shelton of the NAACP and by lawyers like Ted Shaw and       Leslie Proll and all the voting rights attorneys who have made       the cause of equal justice their lives  work  they have been       indispensable to this effort and relentless in their commitment       to what is best about America  I express my appreciation and       admiration for all they do to make Congress and America measure       up to the promise of our Constitution and the vision that Fannie       Lou Hamer  Rosa Parks  Coretta Scott King and Cesar Chavez had       for America
