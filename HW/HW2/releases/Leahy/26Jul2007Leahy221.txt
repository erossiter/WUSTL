       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy In Opposition To The Alexander Collins   REAL ID Funding Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    In Opposition To The Alexander Collins REAL ID Funding Amendment    July 26  2007 Mr  President  the REAL ID Act was legislation     forced through Congress as an add on to the emergency supplemental bill     passed in May 2005  without any Senate hearings or debate  but the     implications of the Act are enormous  In addition to numerous privacy     and civil liberties concerns  REAL ID is an unfunded mandate that could     cost the States in excess of  23 billion   As hearings in the Judiciary Committee and Homeland     Security and Government Affairs Committee have shown  REAL ID is far     from being ready for primetime  In fact  the Department of Homeland     Security has not even released final regulations directing the States on     REAL ID implementation  With 260 million drivers in this country  I do     not see how we could have the massive national databases required by     REAL ID up and running in the next five years  much less in fiscal year     2008   On top of that  even though they are not even in     production yet  REAL ID cards are rapidly becoming a de facto national     ID card  since they will be need to enter courthouses  airports      federal buildings  and now workplaces all across the country  In my     opinion  REAL ID raises multiple constitutional issues whose legal     challenges could delay final implementation for years  and we should not     support the Alexander Collins amendment   In May  the Department of Homeland Security Data     Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee expressed concern over several     items in the REAL ID proposed regulations and said that they pose     serious risks to individual privacy by         Failing to establish a standard for protecting the storage     of personally identifiable information         Failing to provide methods for Americans to inquire or     complain about the collection  storage  and use of personal information     and remedy errors         Failing to require notifying consumers of information     collection and use by the state         Failing to require that individuals have a choice over     secondary use of that information  and        Failing to assure that the information collected for a     specific purpose is used only for that purpose  Congress should not fund the REAL ID program until     the Department of Homeland Security makes fundamental reforms to the     program and stops forcing such onerous provisions on the States  In     addition  with this amendment offset by an across the board cut from all     DHS program  I dont think we should be robbing from other critical     Homeland Security accounts    where we have seen real gains in securing     our country    to pay for just one percent of the floundering REAL ID     program   Mr  President  REAL ID is not popular in our     States  and opposition spans the political spectrum  from the right to     the left  A large number of States have expressed concerns with the     mandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and resolutions in     opposition    Seventeen States have enacted statutes or      resolutions against REAL ID  including Hawaii  Washington  Idaho       Nevada  Montana  North Dakota  Colorado  Nebraska  Oklahoma       Missouri  Illinois  New Hampshire  Maine  Arkansas  Tennessee       Georgia  and South Carolina   Washington  Georgia  Oklahoma  Montana  South      Carolina  New Hampshire  and Maine have gone so far as to indicate      that they intend to refuse to comply with REAL ID   Ten States have had statutes or resolutions      pass one chamber of their legislature  including Oregon  Utah       Arizona  New Mexico  Wyoming  Minnesota  Louisiana  West Virginia       Pennsylvania  and Vermont   And another ten States have had statutes or      resolutions introduced in their legislatures  including Alaska       Texas  Wisconsin  Michigan  Kentucky  Ohio  New York  Massachusetts       Rhode Island  and Maryland    The reaction to the numerous privacy concerns and     unfunded mandates of the REAL ID Act is a good example of what happens     when the Federal government imposes itself rather than working with the     States to build cooperation and partnership  Since so many States have     risen up in opposition to REAL ID  we should not fund this failed     program  and I urge a NO vote on this amendment
