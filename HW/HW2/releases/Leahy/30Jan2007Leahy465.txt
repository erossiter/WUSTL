       Leahy  Specter Question Bush Administration s Views On Congress s Power   To End War                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy  Specter Question      Bush Administration s Views      On Congress s Power To End War       WASHINGTON  Tuesday  January 30   Senate Judiciary Committee      Chairman Patrick Leahy   D Vt    and Ranking Member Arlen Specter        R Pa         Tuesday to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales      seeking the Bush Administrations views on Congresss constitutional      authority to end a war  The bipartisan request was sent the same      day the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the issue      Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing on Exercising Congresss Constitutional Power to End a War           January 30  2007   Today  this Committee holds a hearing      on the constitutional powers of the Congress with respect to war   Of course  the Constitution reserves      to the Congress the power to declare war in Article I  section 8       In addition to the so called power of the purse  the Constitution      provides a number of specific powers to Congress  In particular  the      Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to provide      for the common Defence  to define and punish       Offenses      against the Law of Nations  to make Rules concerning Captures on      Land and Water  to raise and support Armies  to provide and      maintain a Navy  to make Rules for the Government and Regulation      of the land and naval Forces  to provide for calling forth the      Militia to execute the Laws of the Union       and repel Invasions       to provide for organizing  arming  and disciplining the Militia       and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the      Service of the United States  and to make all Laws which shall be      necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing      Powers  and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the      Government of the United States or in any Department or Officer      thereof    Contrast these extensive provisions      and powers with that of the President  who is designated the      Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States  and      of the Militia of the several States  when called into the actual      Service of the United States  Indeed  Senator Specter made the      point over the weekend that the express congressional power to      raise and support Armies and to appropriate funds for their use is      further circumscribed by the Constitution in order to require      congressional action periodically by limiting such funding to no      longer than two years    Last week the Senate Majority Leader      moved to proceed to a resolution reported by the Senate Foreign      Relations Committee regarding the Presidents plan to send more      Americans into the conflicts in Iraq  When Republican objections to      proceeding to consideration of the Senate resolution of disapproval      for escalating the war are overcome  the Senate will proceed to that      debate  Congressional authority with respect to war is part of this      debate  Today  the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing      on these legal and constitutional matters    Today  Senator Specter and I are      writing the Attorney General asking for the Bush Cheney      Administrations views on these legal and constitutional issues  We      ask  What constitutional authority do you recognize resides with      the Congress with respect to war  How do you believe Congress can      exercise its authorities  What limits to you believe exist on those      authorities  We also request legal analyses and the opinions of the      Office of Legal Counsel  which represent the official legal position      of the Executive  on these matters  We look forward to the Attorney      Generals prompt and thorough response  As the Republican Leader      has said  there is no more important issue than the Iraq war   In a recent column in  The New York Times  Adam      Cohen recalled the observation of James Madison that the Executive      is the branch of power most interested in war  and most prone to it      and that it was to counteract this danger that the Constitution      with studied care  vested the question of war in the Legislature       Mr  Cohen goes on to recall the case of the Flying Fish in 1799  the      Steel Seizure case in 1952  and the Hamdan case in 2006  all      of which circumscribed presidential action  He recalls the capping      of the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam in the      Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 and the provisions of the Lebanon      Emergency Assistance Act of 1983  He concludes  The Constitutions      text  Supreme Court cases and history show  however  that Congress      can instead pass laws that set the terms of military engagement   Almost two years ago  during this      Committees hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to be Chief      Justice of the United States  my first questions to the nominee were      about these very matters  I posed the hypothetical whether there      was any doubt that Congress could declare the end to war by enacting      a law doing so  and overriding a presidential veto if necessary       Ours is a constitutional government in which the Constitution vests      lawmaking power in the Congress  The President is not above the law      but is commanded by the Constitution to take Care that the Laws be      faithfully executed   I thank and commend Senator Feingold       the Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee  for organizing and      chairing this important hearing  I join him in welcoming our      distinguished panel of witnesses and thank them for sharing their      insights with us and the Senate
