       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The President s Program To Wiretap   Americans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      The President s Program To Wiretap Americans Without A Warrant     And The Cover Up Of The Full Extent Of Illegality     February 15  2006  Last week        the Judiciary Committee held an important hearing  That hearing       should be the beginning of the process of congressional       oversight into what has been called the Presidents program        This is a domestic spying program into emails and telephone       calls of Americans without a judges approval  apparently       conducted by the National Security Agency  Having participated       in the hearing and reviewed the transcript of the Attorney       Generals testimony  I understand the fear that this       Administration is engaged in an elaborate cover up of       illegality  I urge them to come clean with us and the American       people   Perhaps       their recent change of course and briefings with the full       Intelligence Committees of the Senate and House will be a       start  We need the whole truth not self serving       rationalizations  Since our hearing the Bush Administration has       had to adjust its course  That is good  They have had to       acknowledge that they cannot simply ignore Congress and keep us       in the dark about this illegal spying program  The classified       briefings of the Intelligence Committees are a first step but       cannot be used to cover up the facts through secrecy and       arbitrary limitations  That is unacceptable  This domestic       spying program has raised serious concern  not only among       Democrats and Republicans here in Congress  but also among the       federal judges providing oversight over terrorist surveillance       and even high ranking Justice Department officials   I commend       Chairman Specter for beginning this investigation  He and I       have a long history of conducting vigorous bipartisan oversight       investigations  If the Senate is to serve its constitutional       role as a real check on the Executive  thoroughgoing oversight       is essential  Today  Chairman Specter has announced a second       Judiciary Committee hearing will be held on February 28  We       expect by then to have received answers to the written questions       that have already been sent to the Attorney General   The       question facing us is not whether the Government should have all       the tools it needs to protect the American people  Of course it       should  The terrorist threat to Americas security remains very       real  and it is vital that we be armed with the tools needed to       protect Americans security  That is why I co authored the       PATRIOT Act five years ago  That is why we have amended the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act five times since 9 11 to       provide more flexibility  And that is       why within days of the despicable attacks we passed the       Authorization for the Use of Military Force on September 14        2001  to send the United States Armed Forces into Afghanistan to       get those who planned and carried out the vicious attacks on       September 11   We all       agree that we should be wiretapping al Qaeda terrorists        Congress has given the President authority to wiretap legally        with checks to guard against abuses when Americans       conversations and email are being monitored  But instead  the       President has chosen to proceed outside the law  without those       safeguards  He has done so in a way that is illegal and       illogical  It remains confusing that the Attorney General       testified last week that the Bush Administration has limited       the Presidents program of illegal wiretaps to calls with an       international component   The       Administrations rationale is not limited to calls and emails       with an international component or to known al Qaeda       operatives   It sounded       at our hearing as if what the Bush Attorney General and former       White House counsel was saying is that this particular program       is limited because they were afraid of public outrage  The       Attorney General said as much to Senator Kohl and confirmed to       Senator Biden that the Bush Administration does not suggest that       the Presidents powers are limited by the Constitution to       foreign calls  Their descriptions of the Presidents program       seem to have more to do with public relations than anything       else  It was even branded with a new name in the last few days       after have been known for years as simply the Presidents       program   Senator       Feinstein was right to observe after the Attorney General dodged       and weaved and would not directly answer her questions  I can       only believe  and this is my honest view  that this program is       much bigger and much broader than you want anyone to know  The       Attorney Generals strenuous efforts to limit the hearing to       those facts the President has publicly confirmed and the       program that I am here testifying about today suggest that all       of us must be skeptical about the secret games the Attorney       General was playing through controlling the definition of the       program to include only what he understood to exist at the       beginning of last week  Senator Feinstein was not fooled  None       of us should be  Such limiting definitions are what the Bush       Administration used to redefine torture in order to say that       we do not engage in torture as they redefined it  These are       the word games of cover up and deception        It is not al Qaeda that is surprised that our Government       eavesdrops on its telephone calls and emails  Al Qaeda knows       that we eavesdrop and wiretap  It is the American people who       are surprised and deceived by the Presidents program of secret       surveillance on them without a judges approval for the last 5       years   especially  after the Attorney General  the Justice       Department  the head of the NSA and the President have all       reassured the American people over and over that their rights       are being respectedwhen they are not  I wish the       President had effectively utilized the authority Congress did       grant in the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in       September 2001 to get Osama bin Laden and those responsible for       the terrible attacks on September 11  That resolution was what       it said it was  authorization to send troops to Afghanistan to       get those responsible for 9 11  President Bush should have       gotten Osama bin Laden when Congress authorized him to use our       military might against al Qaeda in 2001 in Afghanistan  Instead       of pursuing him to the end  he pulled our best forces out of the       fight and diverted them to preparing for his invasion of Iraq        Last week       the Attorney General left key questions unanswered and left       impressions that are chilling  Under his approach  there is no       limit to the power the President could claim for so long as we       face a threat of terrorism  That is a real threat  which we       have long faced and will continue to face for years if not       decades to come  The Attorney Generals testimony only hinted       at the full dimensions of the Bush Administrations illegality        He would not reassure us that Americans domestic calls  emails        or first class mail have not been illegally spied upon   He sought       to choose his words carefully to say that he was only willing to       speak about the Presidents program as it existed that day        That means we do not yet know the full dimensions of the       program as it has evolved over time from 2001 to today  That       means we do not know what other illegal activities the Bush       Administration is still endeavoring to hide from us    Along with       other Senators I asked about the lack of any limit to the legal       rationale the Bush Administration has embraced  Their       rationalization for their actions is rationalization for any       action  Under their view of the Presidents power  he can order       houses and businesses searched without a warrant  Americans can       be detained indefinitely  Detainees can be tortured  Property       could be seized  Their rational is a prescription for       lawlessness and the opposite of the rule of law         Regrettably  the Attorney Generals testimony last week left       much to be desired  He did not provide convincing answers to       basic questions  relevant information or the relevant underlying       documents  Facts are a dangerous thing in a cover up  They are       seeking to rewrite history and the law and control the facts       that Congress can know   The Bush       Administrations refusal to provide the contemporaneous evidence       of what the Congress and the Bush Administration were indicating       to each other regarding what the Authorization for the Use of       Military Force was intended to mean  speaks volumes  Does       anyone think that if they had any evidence in support of their       after the fact rationalization they would hesitate to provide       it  to trumpet it from the highest media mountain  Of course       not   Their       failure to provide the information we asked for is not based on       any claim of privilege  nor could it be  It is just a       deafening  damning silence  So what is       so secret about precisely when they came to this legal view        this rationalization of their conduct  Could it have come after       the illegal conduct had been initiated  Could it have come       after the President sought to immunize and sanitize the illegal       conduct  Could it have come months or years later than the       impression Attorney General Gonzales is attempting to create        Is that why       the Bush Administration is also refusing to provide to us the       formal legal opinions of our Government  the binding opinions of       the Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 and 2004 that we have also       requested   Would       review of those opinions show that the after the fact legal       rationalizations changed over time and in 2001 were not those       that the Attorney General has repackaged for public consumption       in their current public relations campaign   Now that we       know of the existence of the years old secret domestic spying       program that has included the warrantless wiretapping of       thousands of Americans  the Bush Administration says that we       should just trust them  That is a blind trust  this       Administration has not earned  We have seen this       Administrations infamous and short lived Total Information       Awareness program and know how disastrous the FBIs Carnivore       and Trilogy computer programs have been   I have read       recent reports of a secret Pentagon database containing       information on a wide cross section of ordinary Americans        including Quakers meeting in Florida and Vermont  and have       gotten no satisfactory explanation of the Defense Departments       Counterintelligence Field Activities that spy on law abiding       Americans  I read about a secret Homeland Security database and       datamining activities  as well  Today we ready about another       database with the names of more than 325 000 terrorists but are       do not know how many are Americans  how many are listed       incorrectly or how the mistakes will be corrected  There are       new and disturbing reports that the Defense Department and the       FBI have been monitoring U S  advocacy groups working on behalf       of civil rights or against the continuing occupation of Iraq        This is all       too reminiscent of the dark days when a Republican President       compiled enemies lists and eavesdropped on political opponents       and broke into doctors offices and used the vast power of the       executive branch to violate the constitutional rights of       Americans  That President resigned in disgrace after articles       of impeachment were reported in the House of Representatives        I was first       elected to the Senate in the aftermath of Watergate and the       White House plumbers and the illegality that led to the       impeachment inquiry of President Nixon  The Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978 as part of the       reform and reaction to those abuses  It was enacted after       decades of abuses by the Executive  including the wiretapping of       Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  and other political opponents of       earlier government officials   It was       enacted after the White House horrors of the Nixon years        during which another President asserted that whatever he did was       legal because he was the President   The law has       been extensively updated in accordance with the Bush       Administrations requests in the aftermath of 9 11 and has been       modified further in the last four years  It is the governing       law  The rule of law and freedoms we enjoy as Americans are       principles upon which this Nation was founded and what we are       defending and fighting for abroad  This type of covert spying       on American citizens and targeted groups on American soil       betrays those principles and it is unacceptable   What       happens to the rule of law if those in power abuse it and only       adhere to it selectively  What happens to our liberties when       the government decides it would rather not follow the rules       designed to protect our rights  What happens is that the       terrorists are allowed to achieve a victory they could never       achieve on the battlefield  We must not be intimidated into       abandoning our fundamental values and treasured freedoms  We       cannot let them scare us into giving up what defines us as       Americans   There can       be no accountability unless the Republican Congress begins to do       its job and joins with us to demand real oversight and real       answers  Senators take an oath of office  too  We swear to       support and defend the Constitution of the United States  to       bear true faith and allegiance to it  and to faithfully       discharge our duties so help us God  Let each Senator fulfill       that pledge and the Senate can resume its intended place in our       democracy   Let us       protect our national security and the national heritage of       liberty for which so many have given so much
