       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Situation In Nepal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Situation In Nepal     November 18  2005  It may seem strange that on a day when      the Congress is debating the budget resolution I would be asking the      Senate to turn its attention for a moment to the remote and tiny      nation of Nepal  I do so because      for the past several years a ruthless Maoist insurgency and a      corrupt  repressive monarchy have brought that impoverished but      breathtakingly beautiful country to the brink of disaster  It is      important for the Nepalese people to know that while they may live      half a world away  the difficulties they are facing have not gone      unnoticed by the United States Congress   It has been      almost nine months since Nepals King Gyanendra dismissed the      multi party government  suspended civil liberties  and arrested the      Prime Minister along with other opposition political leaders  human      rights defenders  pro democracy student activists  and journalists       The Kings      explanation was that democracy had failed to solve the Maoist      problem  He said that he would take care of it himself and then      restore democracy after three years   It is true that      Nepals nascent democracy had not solved the Maoist problem       Neither had the King  In the four and a half years since King      Gyanendra assumed the throne and became Commander in Chief of the      Nepalese army  the Maoists have grown from a minor irritant to a      national menace  While the Maoists use threats and violence to      extort money and property  and they abduct children from poor      Nepalese villagers  the army often brutalizes those same people for      suspicion of supporting the Maoists  Like most armed conflicts       defenseless civilians are caught in the middle   What the Nepalese      people desire most is peace  Despite the Kings autocratic      maneuvers on February 1  many would have given him the benefit of      the doubt if he had a workable plan to quickly end the conflict       Nine months later it is clear that he does not  One can only      wonder why King Gyanendra thought that he could defeat the Maoists      by dissolving the government  curtailing civil liberties  and      surrounding himself with a clique of elderly advisors from the      discredited  feudalistic Panchayat era   The United      States  Great Britain  and India criticized the Kings actions and      have urged him to negotiate with Nepals political parties to      restore democratic government  Unfortunately  although he has      released most political prisoners and reinstated some civil      liberties  the King has increasingly behaved like a despot who is      determined to consolidate his own power  In the meantime       the Maoists declared a ceasefire  The violence has reportedly      decreased  although abductions and extortions have continued apace       Whether the ceasefire is a sinister ploy or a sincere overture for      peace may never be known  however  because it is due to expire next      month and neither the King nor the army has indicated a willingness      to reciprocate  Against this      disheartening backdrop the Congress  on November 10  2005  approved      my amendment to impose new restrictions on military aid for Nepal       On November 14  President Bush signed it into law  I want to      briefly review what we did  and why  The amendment      says that before the Nepalese army can receive U S  aid  the      Secretary of State must certify that the Government of Nepal has      restored civil liberties  is protecting human rights  and has      demonstrated  through dialogue with Nepals political parties  a      commitment to a clear timetable to restore multi part democratic      government consistent with the 1990 Nepalese Constitution  This builds on an      amendment that was adopted last year  which required the Secretary      of State to certify that the Nepalese army was providing unimpeded      access to places of detention and cooperating with the National      Human Rights Commission  NHRC  to resolve security related cases of      people in custody  Unfortunately  the Secretary was not able to      make the certification  Not only were the NHRCs members replaced      through a process that was contrary to Nepals Constitution  the      International Committee of the Red Cross suspended its visits to      military detention centers because it was denied the free access it      requires  The Nepalese      Government objects to any conditions on U S  aid  arguing that the      army needs help to fight the Maoists  The army does need help  but      it also needs to respect the law and the rights of the Nepalese      people  The Congress took this action only after it could no longer      ignore the pattern of arbitrary arrests  disappearances  torture and      extrajudicial killings by the army  The armys abusive conduct       coupled with the Kings repressive actions since February 1  have      contributed to a political crisis that threatens not only the future      of democracy but the monarchy itself  Economic aid to      support health  agriculture  hydropower  and other programs through      nongovernmental organizations is not affected by my amendment  If      the situation changes and the Secretary of State certifies that the      conditions in U S  law have been met  military aid can resume  But      that alone will not solve the Maoist problem  The Maoists are      expert at intimidating the civilian population and carrying out      surprise attacks and melting back into the mountains  While they do      not have the strength to defeat the army  neither can they be      defeated militarily   The only feasible      solution is through a democratic political process that has the      broad support of the Nepalese people  Perhaps seeking to placate      his critics  the King  without consulting the political opposition      parties  announced municipal elections for February 8  2006  Not      surprisingly  the parties say they will not participate in an      electoral process dictated by the palace  and when the army and the      Kings handpicked representatives have taken control of local      affairs and are unlikely to relinquish power  The U S  Embassy      is skeptical of the Maoists intentions and has publicly discouraged      the political parties from forging an agreement with the Maoists       This is understandable  since the Maoists have used barbaric tactics      that should be universally condemned  But this conflict cannot be      won militarily and the King has rejected a political accommodation      with the countrys democratic forces  He is imposing new      restrictions on the media and civil society  and he has spurned      offers by the international community to mediate  Nepals younger      generation  who see no role for the monarchy in Nepals future  are      taking to the streets  It may not be long before the army is faced      with a fateful choice  Will it continue to side with the palace      even if it means turning its weapons on pro democracy protesters      and facing international censure  Or will it cast its lot with the      people   It is a choice      that we may also have to make  For the better part of a year  the      United States and others friends of Nepal  as well as many brave      Nepalese citizens  have tried to nudge the King back toward      democracy  It has not worked  With the King increasingly imperious      and isolated and the political parties already making overtures to      the Maoists  what is to be lost by calling for the Maoists to extend      the ceasefire  for the army to reciprocate  for international      monitors to verify compliance  and for representatives of all      sectors of society who support a democratic  peaceful Nepal to sit      down at the negotiating table   There are no      guarantees  but it would test the Maoists intentions and it might      create an opening for agreement on a democratic process  with the      support of international mediation  that can finally begin to      address the poverty  corruption  discrimination and other social      ills that have fueled the conflict  The people of Nepal  who for      generations have suffered far more than their share of hardship and      injustice  deserve no less
