       Judiciary Chairman Leahy Issues Subpoenas To White House Officials Rove   And Jennings In U S  Attorney Probe                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Judiciary      Chairman Leahy Issues Subpoenas      To White House Officials Rove And Jennings In U S  Attorney Probe    Judiciary Panel Compels White      House Political Operatives     Karl Rove And J  Scott Jennings     To Provide Testimony And Information In Connection With      Investigations     Of U S  Attorney Firings And Politicization Within Dept  Of Justice     WASHINGTON  Thursday       July 26  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt         in consultation with Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa    issued      subpoenas Thursday compelling White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl      Rove and Deputy Director White House Political Affairs J  Scott      Jennings to provide testimony and related information as part of      ongoing congressional investigations into the mass firings of      federal prosecutors and politicization of hiring and firing within      the Department of Justice    Rove  a senior political      advisor to President Bush  and the White House political operation         which Rove heads  have been linked to the project that resulted      in the unprecedented firings of several well performing federal      prosecutors  according to information gathered by the Committee      through documents  interviews and testimony  Jennings  who works in      the White House political office as a deputy to Rove  has also been      linked to the project  Several of the dismissed prosecutors have      testified under oath and in public statements that they were unaware      of performance problems and believe political influence was a factor      in their firings    The evidence shows that      senior White House political operatives were focused on the      political impact of federal prosecutions and whether federal      prosecutors were doing enough to bring partisan voter fraud and      corruption cases  It is obvious that the reasons given for the      firings of these prosecutors were contrived as part of a cover up      and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of      that same effort  Leahy said  The Bush Cheney White House      continues to place great strains on our constitutional system of      checks and balances  Not since the darkest days of the Nixon      Administration have we seen efforts to corrupt federal law      enforcement for partisan political gain and such efforts to avoid      accountability    There is a cloud over      this White House and a gathering storm  I hope they will reconsider      their course and end their cover up so that we can move forward      together to repair the damage done to the Department of Justice and      to the American peoples trust and confidence in federal law      enforcement  he said    The deadline for the      testimony and documents is August 2 at 10 a m    Below is Chairman Leahys      statement and the text of cover letters sent to Karl Rove and Scott      Jennings    Subpoena Packet For      Karle Rove     Subpoena Packet For J       Scott Jennings                Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Subpoenas Issued To Karl Rove And J  Scott Jennings     July 26  2007 Today  the Senate Judiciary Committee is      issuing subpoenas to political operatives at the White House for      documents and testimony related to the Committees ongoing      investigation into the mass firings of U S  Attorneys and      politicization of hiring and firing within the Department of      Justice  This is not a step I take lightly  For over four months       I have exhausted every avenue seeking the voluntary cooperation of      Karl Rove and J  Scott Jennings  but to no avail  They and the      White House have stonewalled every request  Indeed  the White House      is choosing to withhold documents and is instructing witnesses who      are former officials to refuse to answer questions and provide      relevant information and documents             We have now reached a point where the      accumulated evidence shows that political considerations factored      into the unprecedented firing of at least nine United States      Attorneys last year  Testimony and documents show that the list was      compiled based on input from the highest political ranks in the      White House  including Mr  Rove and Mr  Jennings  The evidence      shows that senior officials were apparently focused on the political      impact of federal prosecutions and whether federal prosecutors were      doing enough to bring partisan voter fraud and corruption cases  It      is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived      as part of a cover up and that the stonewalling by the White House      is part and parcel of that same effort  Just yesterday during his      sworn testimony  Mr  Gonzales contrasted these firings with the      replacement of other United States Attorneys for legitimate cause         The White House has asserted blanket      claims of executive privilege  despite testimony under oath and on      the record that the President was not involved  The White House      refuses to provide a factual basis for its blanket claims  The      White House has instructed former White House officials not to      testify about what they know and instructed Harriet Miers to refuse      even to appear as required by a House Judiciary Committee subpoena       The White House has withheld relevant documents and instructed other      witnesses not to produce relevant documents to the Congress but only      to the White House    Last week  the White House did much to      substantiate the evidence that it is intent on reducing United      States Attorneys and federal law enforcement to merely another      partisan political aspect of its efforts when it dispatched an      anonymous senior official to take the position that the U S       Attorney for the District of Columbia would not be permitted to      follow the statutory mechanism to test White House assertions of      Executive privilege by prosecuting contempt of Congress  In essence      this White House asserts that its claim of privilege is the final      word  that Congress may not review it  and that no court can review      it    Yesterday  during an oversight hearing      with Mr  Gonzales  the senior Senator from Pennsylvania  the Ranking      Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee rightly asked         Mr       Attorney General  do you think constitutional government in     the United States can survive if the president has the unilateral     authority to reject congressional inquiries on grounds of executive     privilege and the president then acts to bar the Congress from      getting     a judicial determination as to whether that executive privilege is     properly invoked   There can be no more conclusive      demonstration of this Administrations partisan intervention of      federal law enforcement than if this Administration were to instruct      the Justice Department not to pursue congressional contempt      citations and intervene to prevent a United States Attorney from      fulfilling his sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the      laws and proceed pursuant to section 194 of title 2 of the United      States Code  The President recently abused the pardon power to      forestall Scooter Libby from ever serving a single day of his      30 month sentence for conviction before a jury on multiple counts of      perjury  lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice       Stonewalling this congressional investigation is further      demonstration that this Administration refuses to abide by the rule      of law    This stonewalling is a dramatic break      from the practices of every administration since World War II in      responding to congressional oversight  In that time  presidential      advisers have testified before congressional committees 74 times      voluntarily or compelled by subpoenas  During the Clinton      Administration  White House and Administration advisors were      routinely subpoenaed for documents or to appear before Congress       For example  in 1996 alone  the House Government Reform Committee      issued at least 27 subpoenas to White House advisors  The veil of      secrecy this Administration has pulled over the White House is      unprecedented and damaging to the tradition of open government by      and for the people that has been a hallmark of the Republic   The investigation into the firing for      partisan purposes of United States Attorneys  who had been appointed      by this President  along with an ever growing series of      controversies and scandals have revealed an Administration driven by      a vision of an all power Executive over our constitutional system of      checks and balances  one that values loyalty over judgment  secrecy      over openness  and ideology over competence    What the White House stonewalling is      preventing is conclusive evidence of who made the decisions to fire      these federal prosecutors  We know from the testimony that it was      not the President  Everyone who has testified said has said that he      was not involved  None of the senior officials at the Department of      Justice could testify how people were added to the list or the real      reasons that people were included among the federal prosecutors to      be replaced  Indeed  the evidence we have been able to collect      points to Karl Rove and the political operatives at the White      House    A former political director at the      White House made a revealing admission in her recent testimony      before the Senate Judiciary Committee when she refused to answer      questions citing the oath she took to the President  In this      constitutional democracy  the oath taken by public officials is to      the Constitution  not any particular President of any particular      party  The Constitution itself provides the oath of office of the      President  Every President since George Washington has shown to      preserve  protect and defend the Constitution of the United      States  The oath for other federal official is prescribed by      Congress through statute and provides that every federal officers      duty is not to support and defend any particular President or      Administration but to support and defend the Constitution of the      United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to our      founding principles and law   I pointed out to Ms  Taylor that the      oath I have been privileged to take as a United States Senator is      likewise to the Constitution  I proudly represent the people of      Vermont  I know it is a privilege to serve as a temporary steward      of the Constitution and the values and protections for the rights      and liberties of the American people that it embodies  My oath is      not to a political party and not even to the great institution of      the United States Senate  but to the Constitution and the rule of      law  As a former prosecutor  I feel strongly that independent law      enforcement is an essential component of our democratic government       and that no one is above the law    Despite the constitutional duty of all      members of the Executive branch to take Care that the Laws be      faithfully executed  the message from this White House is that      the President  Vice President  and their loyal aides are above the      law  No check  No balance  No accountability    The law says otherwise  The criminal      contempt statute  2 U S C     194  provides that if a House of      Congress certifies a contempt citation  the United States Attorney      to whom it is sent has a duty and shall bring it before the      grand jury for its action  For this White House to threaten to      intervene in an effort to preempt further investigation  cover up      the truth and avoid accountability is an insult to the rule of law       This law was duly passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by a      duly elected President of the United States  It is derived from law      that has been on the books since 1857  for 150 years    The Bush Cheney White House continues      to place great strains on our constitutional system of checks and      balances  Not since the darkest days of the Nixon Administration      have we seen efforts to corrupt federal law enforcement for partisan      political gain and such efforts to avoid accountability    Given the stonewalling by this White      House  the American people are left to wonder  What is it that the      White House is so desperate to hide  As more and more stories leak      out about the involvement of Karl Rove and his political team in      political briefings of what should be nonpartisan government      offices  I think we have a better sense of what they are trying to      hide  We have learned of political briefings at over 20 government      agencies  including briefings attended by Justice Department      officials  This week  the news was that Mr  Rove briefed diplomats      on vulnerable Democratic districts before mid term elections  Why       Senator Whitehouse properly asked at our hearing yesterday  were      members of our foreign service being briefed on domestic political      contests  Mr  Gonzales had no answer  Similarly  why were political      operatives giving such briefings to the Government Services      Administration  which rents government property and buys supplies       In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  the former      political director at the White House ultimately had to concede that      her briefings included specific political races and particular      candidates being targeted    In this context  is anyone surprised      that the evidence in our investigation of the firings of U S       Attorneys for political purposes points to Mr  Rove and his      political operations in the White House  Despite the initial White      House denials  Mr  Roves involvement in these firings is indicated      by the Department of Justice documents we have obtained and from the      testimony of high ranking Department officials  This evidence shows      that he was involved from the beginning in plans to remove U S       Attorneys  E mails show that Mr  Rove initiated inquires at least      by the beginning of 2005 as to how to proceed regarding the      dismissal and replacement of U S  Attorneys  The evidence also      shows that he raised political concerns  including those of New      Mexico Republican leaders  about New Mexico U S  Attorney David      Iglesias that may have led to his dismissal  He was fired a few      weeks after Mr  Rove complained to the Attorney General about the      lack of purported voter fraud enforcement cases in his      jurisdiction    We have learned that Mr  Rove raised      similar concerns with the Attorney General about prosecutors not      aggressively pursuing voter fraud cases in several districts and      that prior to the 2006 mid term election he sent the Attorney      Generals chief of staff a packet of information containing a      30 page report concerning voting in Wisconsin in 2004  This      evidence points to his role and the role of those in his office in      removing or trying to remove prosecutors not considered sufficiently      loyal to Republican electoral prospects  Such manipulation shows      corruption of federal law enforcement for partisan political      purposes   Documents and testimony also show that      Mr  Rove had a role in the shaping the Administrations response to      congressional inquiries into these dismissals  which led to      inaccurate and misleading testimony to Congress and statements to      the public  This response included an attempt to cover up the role      that he and other White House officials played in the firings   Despite the stonewalling and      obstruction  we have learned that Todd Graves  U S  Attorney in the      Western District of Missouri was fired after he expressed      reservations about a lawsuit that would have stripped many      African American voters from the rolls in Missouri  When the      Attorney General replaced Mr  Graves with Bradley Schlozman  the      person pushing the lawsuit  that case was filed and ultimately      thrown out of court  Once in place in Missouri though  Mr  Schlozman      also brought indictments on the eve of a closely contested election       despite the Justice Department policy not to do so  This is what      happens when a responsible prosecutor is replaced by a loyal Bushie      for partisan  political purposes   Mr  Schlozman also bragged about      hiring ideological soulmates  Monica Goodling likewise admitted      crossing the line when she used a political litmus test for career      prosecutors and immigration judges  Rather than keep federal law      enforcement above politics  this Administration is more intent on      placing its actions above the law    With our service of these subpoenas  I      hope that the White House takes this opportunity to reconsider its      blanket claim of executive privilege  especially in light of the      testimony that President was not involved in the dismissals of these      U S  Attorneys  I hope that the White House steps back from this      constitutional crisis of its own making so that we can begin to      repair the damage done by its untoward interference      with federal law enforcement  That interference has threatened our      elections and seriously undercut the American peoples confidence in      the independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement  Mr  Rove      and the White House must not be allowed to continue manipulating our      justice system to pursue a partisan political agenda  Apparently       this White House would rather precipitate an unnecessary      constitutional confrontation than do what every other Administration      has done and find and accommodation with the Congress  If there are      any cooler or wiser heads at the White House  I urge them to      reconsider the course they have chosen             There is a cloud over this White House      and a gathering storm  I hope they will reconsider their course and      end their cover up so that we can move forward together to repair      the damage done to the Department of Justice and the American      peoples trust and confidence in federal law enforcement              July 26  2007  Mr  Karl Rove     Deputy Chief of Staff     The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  Rove     Four months ago  Senator Specter and I      sent you a letter seeking your voluntary cooperation with the Senate      Judiciary Committees ongoing investigation of the mass firings and      replacements of U S  Attorneys and politicization at the Department      of Justice  We received no response to that letter  Similar      letters to the White House Counsel from the Committee have also      failed to elicit cooperation   Indeed  the White House has chosen to      precipitate a needless constitutional confrontation  The evidence      gathered by our Committee and the House Judiciary Committee shows      that you and other White House officials were involved in these      firings and in the Justice Departments response to congressional      inquiries about them  Yet  the White House has responded to      requests for cooperation by stonewalling and to subpoenas with      unprecedented  blanket assertions of executive privilege  It has      even reached beyond matters under its control to stop or try to stop      former White House officials involved in these matters from meeting      their legal obligation to testify in compliance with congressional      subpoenas    I am issuing the enclosed subpoenas to      provide the Committee with documents in your possession  custody  or      control related to the Committees investigation and for you to      appear to testify under oath before the Committee on August 2       2007   I have issued this subpoena after      exhausting every avenue for voluntary cooperation from you and the      White House  I hope that the White House takes this opportunity to      reconsider its blanket claim of executive privilege  especially in      light of the testimony that the President was not involved in the      dismissals of these U S  Attorneys  I am left to ask what the White      House is so intent on hiding that it cannot even identify the      documents  the dates  the authors and recipients that they claim are      privileged   We have learned from the limited      documents released by the Department of Justice  and from the      testimony of high ranking Department officials  that you were      involved from the beginning in plans to remove U S  Attorneys       E mails show that you initiated inquires at least by the beginning      of 2005 as to how to proceed regarding the dismissal and replacement      of U S  Attorneys  The evidence also shows that you raised      political concerns  including those of New Mexico Republican      leaders  about New Mexico U S  Attorney David Iglesias that may have      led to his dismissal  He was fired a few weeks after you complained      to the Attorney General about the lack of purported voter fraud      enforcement cases in his jurisdiction    We have learned you raised similar      concerns with the Attorney General about prosecutors not      aggressively pursuing voter fraud cases in several districts and      that prior to the 2006 mid term election you sent the Attorney      Generals Chief of Staff a packet of information containing a      30 page report concerning voting in Wisconsin in 2004  This      evidence raises serious concerns about your role in removing or      trying to remove prosecutors not considered sufficiently loyal to      Republican electoral prospects  an unacceptable manipulation and      subversion of law enforcement   Documents and testimony also show that      you had a role in shaping the Administrations response to      congressional inquiries into these dismissals  which led to      inaccurate and misleading testimony to Congress and statements to      the public  This response included an attempt to cover up the role      that you and other White House officials played in the firings   The evidence of untoward White House      interference with federal law enforcement threatens our elections      and has seriously undercut the American peoples confidence in the      independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement    Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY

Political Affairs      The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  Jennings     Four months ago  Senator Specter and I      sent you a letter seeking your voluntary cooperation with the Senate      Judiciary Committees ongoing investigation of the mass firings and      replacements of U S  Attorneys and politicization at the Department      of Justice  We received no response to that letter  Similar      letters to the White House Counsel from the Committee have also      failed to elicit cooperation   Indeed  the White House has chosen to      precipitate a needless constitutional confrontation  The evidence      gathered by our Committee and the House Judiciary Committee shows      that you and other White House officials were involved in these      firings and in the Justice Departments response to congressional      inquiries about them  Yet  the White House has responded to      requests for cooperation by stonewalling and to subpoenas with      unprecedented  blanket assertions of executive privilege  It has      even reached beyond matters under its control to stop or try to stop      former White House officials involved in these matters from meeting      their legal obligation to testify in compliance with congressional      subpoenas    I am issuing the enclosed subpoenas to      provide the Committee with documents in your possession  custody  or      control related to the Committees investigation and for you to      appear to testify under oath before the Committee on August 2       2007   I have issued this subpoena after      exhausting every avenue for voluntary cooperation from you and the      White House  I hope that the White House takes this opportunity to      reconsider its blanket claim of executive privilege  especially in      light of the testimony that the President was not involved in the      dismissals of these U S  Attorneys  I am left to ask what the White      House is so intent on hiding that it cannot even identify the      documents  the dates  the authors and recipients that they claim are      privileged   We have learned from the limited      documents released by the Department of Justice  and from the      testimony of high ranking Department officials  that you were      involved in the discussions and planning that led to the removal of      Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate confirmation process to install      Tim Griffin  a former aide to Mr  Karl Rove  as U S  Attorney in the      Eastern District of Arkansas  You were also part of a group that      discussed using the Attorney Generals expanded authority under the      Patriot Act Reauthorization to avoid the opposition of the Arkansas      Senators by appointing Mr  Griffin as interim indefinitely     In addition  we have also learned that      you set up a meeting between the Departments White House Liaison       Monica Goodling  and New Mexico Republican officials in June 2006 to      talk about the U S  Attorney situation in New Mexico  describing      it as sensitive  Mr  Iglesias  the U S  Attorney for the District      of New Mexico  was fired months later based at least in part       according to the evidence  on political complaints raised by these      officials    Finally  documents and testimony show      that you had knowledge of the plan for firing multiple U S       Attorneys on December 7  2006  and were involved in shaping the      Administrations response to congressional inquiries into these      dismissals  which led to inaccurate and misleading testimony to      Congress and statements to the public  This response included an      attempt to cover up the role you and other White House officials      played in the firings   The evidence of untoward White House      interference with federal law enforcement threatens our elections      and has seriously undercut the American peoples confidence in the      independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement     Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     Chairman                 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA        Congress of the United States        ToJ       Scott Jennings  Special
