       Leahy Presses For Passage Of FOIA Reforms  Urges Secret Hold On Bill Be   Lifted                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Presses For Passage Of FOIA Reforms    Urges Secret Hold On Bill Be Lifted  WASHINGTON  Thursday  May 24   Senate Judiciary     Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   on Thursday called on the     Senate to pass bipartisan reforms to strengthen the Freedom of     Information Act before adjourning for the Memorial Day recess   Following up on their efforts last Congress  Leahy     and Senator John Cornyn  R Texas  teamed up again this year to introduce     the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act  the OPEN Government Act  S 849  The bill  which has broad     bipartisan support  won the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee     in April  but its passage in the full Senate is being delayed by an     anonymous hold   It is both unfortunate and ironic that this     bipartisan bill  which promotes sunshine and openness in our government      is being hindered by a secret and anonymous hold  This is a good     government bill that Democrats and Republicans alike  can and should     work together to enact  said Leahy   The OPEN Government Act would   Restore meaningful deadlines      for agency action under FOIA   Impose real consequences on      federal agencies for missing statutory deadlines   Clarify that FOIA applies to      agency records held by outside private contractors   Establish a FOIA hotline      service for all federal agencies  and  Create a FOIA Ombudsman as an      alternative to costly litigation     Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On The OPEN Government Act  S 849    May 24  2007  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am deeply     disappointed that the Senate may not consider the  Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our     National Government Act  the OPEN Government Act   S 849     before it adjourns for the Memorial Day recess  The Judiciary Committee     favorably reported this bipartisan bill  We have filed a Committee     report on this important legislation  Regrettably  an anonymous     Republican hold is stalling this important Freedom of Information Act  FOIA      legislation  needlessly delaying long overdue reforms to strengthen FOIA     and to protect the publics right to know   It is both unfortunate and ironic that     this bipartisan bill  which promotes sunshine and openness in our     government  is being hindered by a secret and anonymous hold  This is a     good government bill that Democrats and Republicans alike  can and     should work together to enact  I hope that the Senator placing the     secret hold on this bill will come forward  so that we can resolve any     legitimate concerns  and the full Senate can promptly act on this     legislation   The OPEN Government Act is cosponsored by     10 Senators from both sides of the aisle  This bill is also endorsed by     more than 100 business  public interest  and news organizations from     across the political and ideological spectrum  including  the American     Library Association  Conservation Congress  the Liberty Coalition      OpenTheGovernment org  the Sunshine in Government Initiative  the     Republican Liberty Caucus and Public Citizen   I thank all of the cosponsors of this bill     and commend Senator Cornyn as our lead Republican sponsor   I also     thank the many open government organizations that are working tirelessly     to encourage the Congress to enact this bill this year  This measure is     cleared for passage on the Democratic side  It should be passed without     further delay   The OPEN Government Act promotes and     enhances public disclosure of government information under FOIA  by     helping Americans to obtain timely responses to their FOIA requests and     improving transparency in the federal governments FOIA process  During     the recent hearing that the Judiciary Committee held on this     legislation  we learned that  although FOIA remains an indispensable     tool in shedding light on bad policies and government abuses  this open     government law is being hampered by excessive delays and lax FOIA     compliance  Today  Americans who seek information under FOIA remain     less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIAs 40 year     history  This bill would help to reverse this trend and to restore the     publics trust in their government   Senator Cornyn and I both know that open     government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue  It is an     American issue  It is in this spirit that I urge the removal of the     anonymous hold placed on this bill  I also urge all Members of the     Senate to join me in supporting this important open government     legislation   We have received numerous letters of     support from such organizations as the American Library Association  the     National Press Club  Pubic Citizen  Sunshine in Government Initiative     and OpenTheGovernment org  I ask unanimous consent that a letter is     support sent to the Majority and Republican leaders of the Senate and     endorsed by more than 100 organizations from across the political     spectrum be included in the record                        Openness Promotes Effectiveness    in our National Government Act of 2007     OPEN Government Act of 2007   Leahy Cornyn     Section by Section Analysis  Sec  1  Short Title     The Open Government Act of 2007   Sec  2  Findings      The findings reiterate the intent of Congress upon enacting the Freedom     of Information Act  FOIA   5 U S C  552 as amended  and restate FOIAs     presumption in favor of disclosure   Sec  3  Protection of     Fee Status for News Media  This section amends 5     U S C  552 a  4  A  ii  to make clear that independent journalists are     not barred from obtaining fee waivers solely because they lack an     institutional affiliation with a recognized news media entity  In     determining whether to grant a fee waiver  an agency shall consider the     prior publication history of the requestor  If the requestor has no     prior publication history and no current affiliation with a news     organization  the agency shall review the requestors plans for     disseminating the requested material and whether those plans include     distributing the material to a reasonably broad audience    Sec  4  Recovery of     Attorney Fees and Litigation Costs  This section  the     so called Buckhannon fix      amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  E  to clarify that a complainant has     substantially prevailed in a FOIA lawsuit  and is eligible to recover     attorney fees  if the complainant has obtained relief through a judicial     or administrative order or if the pursuit of a claim was the catalyst     for the voluntary or unilateral change in position by the opposing     party  The section responds to the Supreme Courts ruling in  Buckhannon Board and Care Home  Inc  v      West Virginia Dept of Health and Human Resources  532 U S      598  2001   which eliminated the catalyst theory of attorney fee     recovery under certain Federal civil rights laws  FOIA requestors have     raised concerns that the holding in     Buckhannon could be extended to FOIA cases  This section     preserves the catalyst theory in FOIA litigation   Sec  5  Disciplinary     Actions for Arbitrary and Capricious Rejections of Requests      FOIA currently requires that when a court finds that agency personnel     have acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to withholding     documents  the Office of Special Counsel shall determine whether     disciplinary action against the involved personnel is warranted   See 5 U S C  552 a  4  F       This section of the bill amends FOIA to require the Attorney General to     notify the Office of Special Counsel of any such court finding and to     report the same to Congress  It further requires the Office of Special     Counsel to report annually to Congress on any actions taken by the     Special Counsel to investigate cases of this type    Sec  6  Time Limits     for Agencies to Act on Requests  The section     clarifies that the 20 day time limit on responding to a FOIA request     commences on the date on which the request is first received by the     agency  Further  the section states that if the agency fails to respond     within the 20 day limit  the agency may not then assert any FOIA     exemption under 5 U S C  552 b   except under limited circumstances such     as endangerment to national security or disclosure of personal private     information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974  unless the agency can     demonstrate  by clear and convincing evidence  good cause for failure to     comply with the time limits   Sec  7  Individualized     Tracking Numbers for Requests and Status Information      Requires agencies to establish tracking systems by assigning a tracking     number to each FOIA request  notifying a requestor of the tracking     number within ten days of receiving a request  and establishing a     telephone or Internet tracking system to allow requestors to easily     obtain information on the status of their individual requests  including     an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the     request   Sec  8  Specific     Citations in Exemptions  5 U S C  552 b   3  states     that records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute are exempt     from FOIA  This section of the bill provides that Congress may not     create new statutory exemptions under this provision of FOIA unless it     does so explicitly  Accordingly  for any new statutory exemption to     have effect  the statute must cite directly to 5 U S C  552 b   3       thereby conveying congressional intent to create a new  b   3      exemption    Sec  9  Reporting     Requirements  This section adds to current reporting     requirements by mandating disclosure of data on the 10 oldest active     requests pending at each agency  including the amount of time elapsed     since each request was originally filed  and requires additional     breakdowns depending on the length of delay  This section further     requires agencies to calculate and report on the average response times     and range of response times of FOIA requests   Current requirements     mandate reporting on the median response time   Finally  this section     requires reports on the number of fee status requests that are granted     and denied and the average number of days for adjudicating fee status     determinations by individual agencies    Sec  10  Openness of     Agency Records Maintained by a Private Entity  This     section clarifies that agency records kept by private contractors     licensed by the government to undertake recordkeeping functions remain     subject to FOIA just as if those records were maintained by the relevant     government agency   Sec  11  Office of     Government Services  This section establishes an     Office of Government Information Services within the Administrative     Conference of the U S  Within that office will be appointed a FOIA     ombudsman to review agency policies and procedures  audit agency     performance  recommend policy changes  and mediate disputes between FOIA     requestors and agencies  The establishment of an ombudsman will not     impact the ability of requestors to litigate FOIA claims  but rather     will serve to alleviate the need for litigation whenever possible    Sec  12  Accessibility     of Critical Infrastructure Information  This section     requires reports on the implementation of the Critical Infrastructure     Information Act of 2002  6 U S C  133  Reports shall be issued from the     Comptroller General to the Congress on the number of private sector      state  and local agency submissions of CII data to the Department of     Homeland Security and the number of requests for access to records  The     Comptroller General will also be required to report on whether the     nondisclosure of CII material has led to increased protection of     critical infrastructure   Sec  13  Report on     Personnel Policies Related to FOIA  This section     requires the Office of Personnel Management to examine how FOIA can be     better implemented at the agency level  including an assessment of     whether FOIA performance should be considered as a factor in personnel     performance reviews  whether a job classification series specific to     FOIA and the Privacy Act should be considered  and whether FOIA     awareness training should be provided to federal employees
