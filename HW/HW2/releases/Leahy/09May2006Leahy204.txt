       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Nomination Of Brett   Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh      May 9  2006  Today marks the fifth anniversary       of the day that this President announced his first group of       judicial nominees and began his court packing efforts  I went       to the White House in good faith that May five years ago to try       to work with the President to fill the scores of vacancies left       open when Republican Senators stalled more than 60 of President       Clintons nominees  Thereafter  first as Chairman of the Senate       Judiciary Committee and later as its Ranking Member  I worked       hard to treat those nominees more fairly than Republicans had       treated President Clintons nominees  We were able to join       together to move nominations expeditiously  including the       confirmation of five of the nine judges confirmed from the       Presidents initial list who were among the 17 circuit court       nominees the Senate confirmed in my 17 months as Chairman  I       afforded hearings to a number of controversial nominees        something my Republican predecessor as Chairman refused to do        I voted for some and  in good conscience  voted against Senate       consent for others    All but one of those initial       nominations has run their course  With regard to that one  the       President should heed the call of North Carolina Police       Benevolent Association  the North Carolina Troopers       Association  the Police Benevolent Associations from South       Carolina and Virginia  the National Association of Police       Organizations  the Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics of       North Carolina  as well as the advice of Senator John Edwards        and withdraw his ill advised nomination of Judge Terrence       Boyle  Law enforcement from  North Carolina and law enforcement       from across the country oppose the nomination  Civil rights       groups oppose the nomination  Those knowledgeable and       respectful of judicial ethics oppose this nomination    Since President Bush took office       in January 2001  the Senate has confirmed 240 of his judicial       nominees  including two Supreme Court Justices  One hundred of       those judges were       confirmed during the 17 months when there was a Democratic       majority in the Senate compared to 145       judges in the other 45 months under Republican control        Unfortunately  as demonstrated by the       recent withdrawals of several nominationsClaude Allen among       them   all too often this White House       seems more interested in rewarding cronies and picking political       fights  rather than being       thorough in selecting lifetime appointments of judicial officers       who are entrusted with protecting the rights of Americans         The difficult and controversial       nomination and re nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle and that of       the nominee before us today are further signs that the       Bush Cheney Administration and its allies in the Senate are more       interested in picking election year fights rather than       well qualified judges    At a time when the Senate should       be addressing Americans top priorities  including ways to make       America safer  the war in Iraq  rising gas prices  health care       costs  stem cell research  comprehensive immigration reform and       the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  the President and       his Senate allies  instead  try to divide and distract from       fixing real problems by pressing forward with controversial       nominations   The siren call of the special       interest groups on the right is urging the Senate Republican       leadership toward confrontation over controversial judicial       nomination  again  The Senates job is to fulfill our duty       under the Constitution so that we can assure the American people       that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments to the       highest courts in this country are being appointed to be fair       and protect their interests rather than to advance a political       agenda    The Senate Republican leadership       is ready to cater to the extreme right wing and special interest       groups agitating for a fight over judicial nominations  These       are the same narrow interest groups that opposed the nomination       of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and forced the President       to withdraw her nomination after he said that he would never do       so    With burgeoning scandals       throughout the Administration  with word last week of yet       another investigation  this one into poker parties at the       Watergate and limousine services and who knows what else  with       reports of lucrative government contracts being steered to       cronies  with the investigations arising from the criminal       convictions of Jack Abramoff  Michael Scanlon  and Duke       Cunningham  we meet today to hear from a White House loyalist       and insider    With the sudden resignation last       Friday of the Presidents hand picked head of the CIA   America witnessed another       heck of a job accolade to an Administration insider leaving a       critical job undone  What is desperately lacking throughout       this Administration is accountability  A Republican controlled       Congress has not provided a check and has made it all the more       important for the courts to be that check to preserve our rights       and way of life  to check the Governments overreaching     This hearing gives this young man       another chance to show his independence  Unless he demonstrates       that capacity  I will oppose this nomination  I hope that he       will start by using this opportunity to correct his testimony       from his 2003 hearing and testify straightforwardly about the       Administrations resistance to compensating the 9 11 families       when I insisted that be part of the legislation granting the       airlines special benefits    Last year  when the President       nominated Harriet Miers  a woman who had not gone to Ivy League       schools but had a more impressive background of legal experience       than this nominee  Republicans questioned her qualifications and       demanded answers about her work at the White House and legal       philosophy  They defeated her nomination before allowing her a       hearing  It appears that Republicans are back to their       rubberstamping routine with every Senate Republican ready to       approve this nomination without question or deliberation    I had hoped  as we discussed in       open session last Thursday  the Committee would hear from  ABA representatives today       on why they took the unusual step of lowering Mr  Kavanaughs       initial ABA rating after two years  The White House had put out       the word  falsely  that this was merely the result of a change       in the membership of the ABA evaluation committee  We now know       that was not correct  In fact  three quarters of those who       continue on the Committee    who voted previously on this       nomination    downgraded the nomination based on the recent       interviews and review  One judge who presided over a case       involving Mr  Kavanaugh said his argument was less than       adequate and described him as sanctimonious and as someone       who demonstrated experience on the level of an associate        Others interviewed by the ABA raised concerns about Mr        Kavanaughs ability to be balanced and fair given his many years       in partisan positions working to advance a political agenda        Mr  Kavanaugh was described by interviewees as insulated and       immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on       some issues  These are not qualities that make for a good       judge    His work for the past six years at       the White House leads to many questions that require answers       before we can proceed  What matters is he familiar with at the       White House that he will recuse himself from as a judge  if       confirmed  Will he protect the rights of the American people to       know about their Government given the secrecy policies of this       Administration  which he helped design  How did he exercise       good judgment while serving in the important Staff Secretary       position  And  as I have said  where is the demonstration of       his independence from the policies of this Administration  I       look forward to answers to these questions and others as this       Committee seeks to fulfill its responsibilities to the Senate       and the American people
