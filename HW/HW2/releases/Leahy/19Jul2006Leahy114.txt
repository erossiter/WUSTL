       Vermont  Mom And Pop  Store Owner Tells Leahy Panel Of Struggles  Confronting Small Businesses In The Face Of Escalating Credit Card Fees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Vermont      Mom and Pop Store Owner Tells Leahy Panel Of      Struggles Confronting Small Businesses      In The Face Of Escalating Credit Card Fees    Steady Rise      In Hidden Fees Are Squeezing Small Business Owners     And      Consumers In Vermont And Across The Nation    WASHINGTON  Wednesday  July 19        Kathy Miller  the mom from the mom and pop grocery in Elmore       Vt   told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that her      family run business is being steadily squeezed by the continuing      rise in hidden fees charged to businesses by large credit card      companies    In poignant testimony  Miller  a      fifth generation Vermonter and co owner of The Elmore Store       told the panel that these hidden fees present a real and growing      financial burden especially on small  independent businesses      like the one she has run with her husband Warren  a Vermont      state representative  and her daughter Kelly  for the last 24      years  Miller was appearing before the Judiciary Committee at      the invitation of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the panels      ranking Democratic member    I would like to ask you on your      next ride home to look and see how many vacant store fronts      there are in your small downtowns  Miller told the committee       Just this last winter alone four closed within a 50 mile radius      of us  Some days I feel like I should just turn in my keys       but too many people count on us  Elmore is a town of 850      people  We are the hub of the community  when someone needs      something  who do you call  Mom or Pop at the Elmore Store       We are just trying to keep our doors open    The controversy involves charges      of anti competitive and anti consumer practices of the two      largest credit card companies and banks in assessing these      interchange rates  said Leahy  These interchange rates  which      the banks affiliated with Visa and MasterCard charge for every      credit card transaction  are secretly set by the banks  and      retailers are not allowed to negotiate over the fees  These      rates also are hidden from public view  though they are paid by      retailers on each credit card transaction that consumers make        Last year alone  American      consumers paid Visa and MasterCard around  30 billion in      interchange fees  according to Miller    Below is Senator Leahys opening      statement from the hearing and Millers testimony                      Statement Of      Sen Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Hearing On Credit Card Interchange Fees  Antitrust Concerns      July 19  2006  First  I must thank Vermont State      Representative  Warren Miller  and his wife  Kathy  for making      the trek down from Elmore  Vermont  in order to be here today       I am always glad to see Vermonters here  and especially so when      they are able to help us on the Committee as we struggle with      the problems confronting businesses and individuals across the      country  Kathy  I look forward to hearing from you  and know      that you are speaking for many of the small businesses that make      Vermont prosper   Few of us outside the business and      banking communities had probably heard much about interchange      fees until recently  Those fees  which retailers pay to the      banks that process credit card transactions  are ultimately paid      by consumers  We are here today because questions are being      raised over whether those fees are too high  and whether they      are too high because the associations of banks that handle      credit cards are behaving unfairly in the marketplace  Just      this week  the European Unions Competition Authority announced      that unless Visa and MasterCard change those fees  they will      face an antitrust action  This is not an issue that we can      ignore   Retailers tell me that interchange      fees represent an increasingly large portion of their costs of      doing business  They tell me that they are compelled to raise      their prices  and shift some of that cost burden onto their      customers  They tell me that all of their customers are harmed       whether they pay by cash or check or debit or credit card       because of the fees that force them to raise prices  They tell      me that they have no choice but to accept credit cards  and the      fees that go along with them  as more and more customers expect      to be able to charge their purchases  And they tell me that the      entire fee process is utterly opaque  they have not seen the      rules for the interchange systems  and cannot decipher the      complicated billing schemes of the credit card companies    Credit cards do bring many      benefits to both retailers and consumers  greater access to      consumer purchasing power  more rapid payments  and increased      payment options for consumers  And certainly  interchange      services are necessary  valuable  and worth paying for  But we      need to be sure that the cost of accepting credit and debit      cards does not outweigh the many possible benefits businesses      and consumers should be enjoying  We need to bring more      transparency to the entire system  We need to take a closer      look   The livelihood of many Vermonters      depends greatly on the success of our small businesses  I do      not want interchange fees to force smaller businesses  like the      village grocery store run by the Millers in Elmore  to take a      net loss in order to both accept credits cards and sell the ice      cream cones  and cups of Green Mountain Coffee that have helped      make their store a Vermont treasure                  Testimony      of Kathy Miller  co owner of The Elmore Store     Kathy      Miller  Co Owner      The Elmore Store  Elmore  Vermont     Senate Judiciary Committee      Credit Card Interchange Rates  Antitrust Concerns       July 19  2006  Mr  Chairman  Senator Leahy and      Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Good morning  I      would like to say thank you for allowing me to testify today  My      name is Kathy Miller and I  along with my husband Warren and      daughter Kelly  am the owner of the Elmore Store in Elmore  VT       I am also here today as a past chair of the Vermont Grocers      Association and on behalf of the Food Marketing Institute which      represents our nations supermarkets and grocery stores   We appreciate you holding this      hearing and for the opportunity to provide testimony on credit      card interchange fees and the antitrust issues they raise  We      are pleased that light is finally being shed on the      anti competitive and anti consumer practices of the credit card      companies   This is the store that we have      owned and operated now for 24 years  I am a 5th      generation Vermonter with deep roots in Elmore  VT  I am the      Mom part of the operation  Warren  sitting behind me  is      Pop  Warren was elected to the state legislature in Montpelier      4 years ago  We are not only committed to our store  but our      community and the state of Vermont as well   You may wonder why we do what we      do  7 days a week  96 hours a week  364 days a year  to be      honest  some days we ask ourselves  But we believe that we can      and do make a difference to the people and community that depend      on us  My concern as a small independent store may seem small to      you  but it is a huge burden for us and very real  Credit card      fees are collectively set by the card associations and we have      no control over them  They are not negotiable and cannot be      added on to the consumers bill  We cannot set minimum amounts      to swipe credit and debit cards  that is against the Visa and      MasterCard operating rules  I am told  The fees keep increasing      to us and our profit margin sinks down even lower   Last year in our store  2005  we      did  58 500 worth of plastic transactions  The credit card fees      to us  out of pocket  were  4 400  Each time a customer swipes      their card it costs us  2 65    20 cents per sale  For example       if we sell  10 worth of gas  we make 49 cents and pay credit      card fees of 26 5 cents   20 cents  Or if a bicyclist stops for      a bottle of water  it costs 23 cents to swipe the card  You do      the math  it hurts   In our store  we have 2 gas pumps      that we own  not subsidized by any big petroleum company  When      the price of gas goes up  so does the amount of interchange we      pay  Because the fee is a percentage rate plus a flat fee  the      banks make more and I must pay more  even though their costs for      processing the transaction are still the same     Last year alone  American      consumers paid Visa and MasterCard around  30 billion in      interchange fees  These fees are set collectively  in secret  by      VISA and MasterCard member banks  who then charge them to      merchants  These fees are not negotiable  It doesnt matter      which bank issues the card  the fee is the same and the retailer      has no choice but to pay it  Of course  consumers dont realize      they are paying the fee because merchants are effectively      prohibited from informing their customers about them  These fees      are reflected in the price of every product purchased at the      front end of our store whether or not the customer pays with a      credit card  FMI members have seen their costs for these fees      rise on average 700 percent in the past 10 years  These      increases have occurred despite the fact that the technology      infrastructure is already in place and the volume of      transactions has grown exponentially  providing economies of      scale  In other areas of my business or any business  as      technology advances and volume increases  prices go down  or at      least remain stable  But that is not the case with interchange      fees because there is no competition    Since I told my customers I was      going to Washington  DC to testify on this issue  I cant even      tell you how many of my customers were unaware of the hidden      fees  They swipe their cards and think all is free because      there is no charge to them at all  Obviously we lose money on      many small transactions and too much on others  so we have to      raise prices  because we cant absorb it all  In the grocery      business  we compete by lowering prices  not raising them  I am      not a lawyer  but I know this is a huge problem that retailers      across the U S          large and small         are facing  so I ask that you look into this matter seriously       We have streamlined our business to reduce costs as best we can       maintenance doesnt get done as it should  less money goes out      in payroll  but we just cant keep absorbing these fees and      survive   But those rules dont seem to      apply to VISA and MasterCard and to the banks that issue cards       One reason is that  MasterCard and VISA have undisputed market      power  with over eighty percent of the card marketplace  To the      extent they compete with each other  it is a perverse      competition  They compete to get banks to issue their cards  The      way they do that is by providing them with higher interchange      fees  by raising prices      In fact  the member banks get to decide collectively      on the level of the interchange fee    Since merchants and ultimately      consumers have no choice but to pay the fees  there is no      constraint on this cycle of increasing fees  As a result  in the      plastic card world  the normal competitive model does not exist       In the plastic card world  as costs go down  fees are driven      continually upward without explanation  Interchange fees in this      country are among the highest in the developed world  You will      hear from other witnesses about what antitrust authorities      elsewhere have concluded about interchange  But we dont need      someone in the European Union or the United Kingdom or Australia      to tell us that something is clearly wrong with the functioning      of this market and it needs to be corrected   Plastic has become the predominant      currency in the U S  economy  More than half the transactions in      U S  stores are paid with a credit or debit card and card      companies have positioned themselves to get a percentage of      every one of these transactions   The average supermarket industry      profit margin last year was 1 16 percent  That means a profit of       1 16 on a  100 transaction  The interchange paid to the bank      that issued the card on that same transaction is more than that       And when the price of food or gas goes up  so does interchange       Because the fee is a percentage rate   a flat amount  the banks      make more  even though their costs are still the same  There is      something wrong with this picture   The reality is that interchange is      used to subsidize VISA and MasterCards expensive marketing      programs and promotional schemes that benefit only the most privileged few  These include gold plated reward      programs that only the elite consumers qualify for  a blizzard      of direct mail offers pushing cards on those who already have      them or those who do not want them  and multi million dollar      event sponsorships designed to push consumers into using the      most expensive forms of plastic payment   Every consumer       including those paying with cash  pay for these programs without      knowing it   In conclusion  interchange fees in      this country reflect a market in which the normal  competitive      forces are not working  This flawed market results in      interchange  fees that are not cost related  and which are      intentionally kept hidden from consumers  As a result  consumers      do not have the information they need to make sound economic      decisions about their payment choices   I would like to ask you on your      next ride home to look and see how many vacant store fronts      there are in your small downtowns  Just this last winter alone      four closed within a 50 mile radius of us  Some days I feel like      I should just turn in my keys  but too many people count on us       Elmore is a town of 850 people  We are the hub of the community       when someone needs something  who do you call  Mom or Pop      at the Elmore Store  We are just trying to keep our doors open   I thank this Committee for shining      some light on anti competitive interchange fees and the impact      they have on our business and on consumer prices  I would be pleased to answer your questions      Thank you                Elmore Store  Lake Elmore Vermont
