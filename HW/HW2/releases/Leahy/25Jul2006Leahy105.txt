                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of Jerome A  Holmes       To The Court Of Appeals For The Tenth Circuit       July 25  2006  Today  the Senate considers the       nomination of Jerome A  Holmes for a lifetime appointment to the       Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit  Just last week we       confirmed another nominee to the Tenth Circuit  the fifth to be       appointed by this President    This progress       comes in stark contrast to the seven years in which a       Republican led Senate failed to confirm a single new judge for       that court  Indeed  when I moved forward with the nominations       of Harris Hartz of New Mexico  Terrence O Brien       of Wyoming and Michael McConnell of Utah  it broke       a longstanding partisan barricade that had been maintained by       Republicans        Among the victims of the Republican obstruction were outstanding       lawyers President Clinton nominated such as James Lyons and       Christine Arguello  who were never even granted hearings by the       Republican majority  Judge Lyons was among the many Clinton       nominees voted unanimously  Well       Qualified       by the American Bar Association who were never granted hearings        and Ms  Arguello is a talented Hispanic attorney whose       nomination had significant  widespread and bipartisan support       from her community and state  They were among the       more than 60 qualified  moderate judicial nominees of President       Clinton that Republicans pocket filibustered and defeated       without hearings or votes of any kind    Just last Thursday  Democratic       Senators joined in the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch  an       extremely conservative nominee  and three others  Working       together we confirmed two Circuit Court nominees and two federal       trial court nominees in a matter of minutes  We brought the       total number of judicial nominees confirmed during this       Presidents term to 255  which exceeds the total       for the last five and one half years of the Clinton       Administration  It brought the total number of judges confirmed       over the last 18 months to 50  Of course  during the 17 months       I chaired the Judiciary Committee the Senate confirmed 100       lifetime judges  twice as many in less time  Last weeks       success demonstrates again how we can make progress in filling       vacancies by working together  Senator Salazars support for       Judge Gorsuch was a critical factor in our ability to act       swiftly  Senator Lincolns and Senator Pryors support for       confirming Judge Shepherd to the Eighth Circuit likewise made a       real difference   Regrettably  this nomination we       consider today is not without controversy and concern  Mr        Holmes initially was nominated to fill a district court seat in      Oklahoma  The White House withdrew that       nomination and renominated him to the Circuit Court after Judge       James H  Payne asked the President to withdraw his nomination        That withdrawal came after public reports that Judge Payne had       ruled on a number of cases in which he had a conflict of       interest  While the Committee never had a chance to hear       directly from Judge Payne about the reported conflicts  these       types of conflicts are a violation of federal law as well as       canons of judicial ethics and have no place on the federal       bench  Certainly  they should not be rewarded with a promotion  Before Mr  Holmes hearing  I       raised concerns about the many controversial letters and columns       he has written on such topics as juror racial bias  affirmative       action  discrimination  and school vouchers  In these writings        Mr  Holmes derided opposing points of view and those who held       them  I asked Mr  Holmes to address my concerns about how he       might rule on civil rights issues and how he would treat       litigants as a judge  Regrettably  Mr  Holmes stock answers to       my questions that he would follow Supreme Court precedent have       not reassured me that he would be the kind of judge who       understands the critical role of the courts as a protection of       individual rights and civil rights    In one column  Mr  Holmes       described certain allegations of racial prejudice at criminal       trials as harmful because it bolster s  the cynical view that       jurors vote along racial lines  which undermines public       confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system  In       fact  Mr  Holmes suggested that it is the focus on the problem       of racial bias in jury selection  as opposed to the racial bias       itself  that harms the criminal justice system  He wrote that       focusing on racial bias may actually give the green light to       jurors to exercise arbitrary power in the jury box when their       racial number allow it    The Supreme Court has long       recognized that racial bias in jury selection undermines       constitutional guarantees to a fair trial  establishing in the       landmark 1986 decision       Batson v  Kentucky that striking jurors on the basis       of race is unconstitutional  In contrast to Mr  Holmes       statement that accusations of racial bias are merely cynical       Batson was based       on evidence showing patterns of race discrimination in jury       selection  It has been reaffirmed repeatedly during the last 20       years in sharp contrast to the views of Mr  Holmes  I gave Mr        Holmes every opportunity to admit error and indicate not only       that he had learned of the Supreme Courts precedent but that he       had adopted that view of the law and accepted the prohibitions       against racial discrimination as just  but received no such       reassurance  Instead  the nominee begrudgingly acknowledged       that he would have to follow Supreme Court precedent when       expressly bound by it    In another column Mr  Holmes wrote       after the Supreme Courts landmark affirmative action decision       Grutter  v  Bollinger  he       criticized the High Court for missing an important opportunity       to drive the final nail in the coffin of affirmative action and       said that the court did not go far enough  Affirmative action       is still alive  In addition  he described affirmative action       scholarship programs as involving classifications that are       constitutionally dubious and morally offensive   This was a landmark case and in it       Justice Sandra Day OConnor spoke for the Supreme Court and the       Nation  Justice OConnor  a conservative appointed by President       Reagan  considered the facts and the law carefully  She took       into account the brief from 65 leading U S        corporations that noted the importance of a diverse workforce       and the brief of a highly respected group of former military       officers that the military needed a racially diverse and highly       qualified corps of officers  She built upon the Supreme Courts      Bakke decision       when she upheld the University of Michigan Law Schools use of       race as a factor in law school admissions and affirmed the       important interest in diversity  She proclaimed  Effective       participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the       civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one       nation  indivisible  is to be realized  She went on to note       that she hoped and expected that consideration of race might no       longer be necessary in another 25 years  Even after the       decision  Mr  Holmes chose to criticize Justice OConnors       pragmatic  principled and practical resolution of what had       become an ideological dispute  Sadly  Mr  Holmes seems to       continue to want to take sides  and in my view  he is on the       wrong side   Just last week  the Senate       unanimously extended the expiring provisions of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 for another 25 years  We all       hope that such special provisions will no longer be necessary       after another 25 years of growth and progress  But they are       needed now    Last week  we also heard the       President  who has nominated Mr  Holmes  acknowledge that       slavery and racial discrimination placed a stain on  Americas founding  a stain that we have not yet wiped       clean  In his first ever address to the NAACP national       convention during his time in office  the President said racial       discrimination remains a wound that is not fully healed  I       will not soon forget President Bush speaking to the nation from       Jackson Square in New Orleans and acknowledging that poverty       has roots in a history of racial discrimination  which cut off       generations from the opportunity of America    Such powerful words inspire hope       for change  But that change only occurs when those words are       followed by action  During his address to the NAACP  the       President lamented the Republican Partys loss of support among       many African Americans in our country today  He called it a       tragedy that the party of Abraham Lincoln could disenfranchise       the African American community  It is not difficult to       understand why  Despite his eventual support for the       reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  this Presidents       priorities  his polices    and indeed his nominees  do not       demonstrate any sort of meaningful commitment on the part of       this Administration to confront the very real racial and       economic disparities that continue to persist today     When considering a nominee to a       lifetime appointment on the federal bench  a chief consideration       of mine has always been whether all litigants would get a fair       hearing in that nominees courtroom  That is why I have been        and remain  concerned about the tone and stridency of Mr        Holmes writings  In answering my questions about the tone of       his criticisms of those with whom he disagrees on issues  Mr        Holmes seeks to make a distinction between the role of the       opinion article writer and the role of a judge  The fact that       Mr  Holmes took part in hard edged debate on public issues       should not be disqualifying  It appears  however  that those       opinions are what earned him this elevated nomination and what       his proponents expect he will deliver from the bench    Mr  Holmes has been an outspoken       critic not only of affirmative action programs and efforts to       combat race discrimination  but of African American civil rights       leaders who support them  calling them ideologically bankrupt        He has called into question the sincerity of civil rights       organizations opposed to school vouchers by describing them as       having longstanding ties to school employee labor unions  which       view vouchers as a dangerous threat to the educational status       quo  in which teachers bear little or no accountability for       their students educational failures  When the convention of       the NAACP reacted negatively last week to President Bushs       advocacy for vouchers  it was not because they were under the       sway of any teachers union  It was because they know how       important public education is to the futures of so many from       minority communities   In a letter to one publication        Mr  Holmes criticized claims of race discrimination based on       forced assimilation  characterizing a doctors complaint that       his colleagues had negative reactions to his dreadlocks as       na  ve  In another article  he described a defense attorneys       concerns about racial bias in jury selections as       philosophically offensive  Mr  Holmes comments belittling       those concerned with the persistence of race based barriers in       this country leave me with little assurance that he has the       ability to maintain objectivity when applying constitutional and       statutory remedies for race discrimination and concerned that he       will not have an open and fair mind as a judge     Mr  Holmes membership in the Mens       Dinner Club of Oklahoma City  which restricts its membership to       men  also concerns me about his ability to have an open mind        He did not resign his membership until February 2        2006  less than two weeks before his initial nomination to be       United States District Judge for the District of Oklahoma        presumably only after he had been notified that he would be       nominated  When I asked him about why he said in his response       to the Committees questionnaire that he did not perceive the       Club as practicing invidious discrimination  he did not respond       directly  Instead  he declared in a self serving conclusion       that he would not knowingly be a member of any organization       that harbored or expressed any bias against women  or any other       groups on the basis of immutable characteristics  I am left to       wonder what it is that Mr  Holmes would consider the kind of       discrimination with which he would not want to be associated and       why he was not troubled by the Mens Dinner Club  It was a       place for social and professional advancement for him and he       seemed not at all concerned with its restrictive policies  The       fact that Mr  Holmes did not resign until the eve of his       nomination because some might perceive the Mens Dinner Club as       being an improper organization is troubling    I worry that even before I       announced any opposition to Mr  Holmes nomination  we had       already begun to hear the whispers of criticisms taken from the       pages of the playbook of extreme right wing groups  These       groups marked a new low a few years ago by launching a       scurrilous campaign to inject religion into the debate over       judicial nominations  These smears were fabricated as a       calculated weapon to chill proper consideration of candidates       nominated for significant judicial positions  Similar  baseless       accusations of other forms of discrimination serve only to       inflame and distract from the fair and deliberate consideration       of judicial nominations    The Senate has confirmed 255       of this Presidents nominee  including 100 who were approved       during the 17 months that Democrats made of the Senate       majority  The first confirmation when I became Chairman was of       an African American Circuit Court nominee on whom Republicans       had refused to vote  For that matter  it was Republican       Senators who defeated the nominations of Justice Ronnie White        Judge Beatty  Judge Wynn  Kathleen McCree Lewis and so many       outstanding African Americans judges and lawyers who they pocket       filibustered    I was surprised when we debated       Mr  Holmes nomination in the Judiciary Committee that those       defending Mr  Holmes nomination criticized any expression of       concern about his troubling writings in the area of civil       rights  I appreciated when the Senator from       Oklahoma apologized to me after that debate  The Senators from       Oklahoma are within their rights in supporting this nomination        In fact  I consider their support as a weighty factor in       considering this nomination    That support is not universal        This is a controversial nomination  A number of leading       organizations concerned with civil rights  including the NAACP        MALDEF  and many others  raised grave concern about Mr        Holmes record  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the       countrys oldest  largest civil rights coalition has opposed the       confirmation of this nomination  Having reviewed the record  I       share those concerns    In the last several months  as we       have worked to reauthorize and revitalize the Voting Rights Act        I have been thinking about the civil rights movement  what       progress we have made  and what distance we still have to go        The new law is named for Coretta Scott King among others  Dr        Martin Luther King Jr  knew that our judges and our courts were       important to securing civil rights  It was not the Congress but       the Supreme Court that moved the Nation forward in its  Brown v  Board of Education       decision in 1954  It is worth recalling Dr        Kings call for the political branches to join the courts in       protecting the fundamental rights of all  In his 1957 address        Give Us the Ballot  Dr  King said   s o far  only the       judicial branch of the government has evinced this quality of       leadership  If the executive and legislative branches of the       government were as concerned about the protection of our       citizenship rights as the federal courts have been  then the       transition from a segregated to an integrated society would be       infinitely smoother  Dr  King knew how important fair minded       judges were to the realization of equality  Dr  Kings view and       that expressed by Mr  Holmes appear to be in sharp contrast   I take no pleasure today in doing       my duty  I have considered this nomination on its merits and        in good conscience  I cannot support it  Based on Mr  Holmes       own writings and his responses to our questions  I will vote no        I hope that Mr  Holmes will prove my concerns unfounded and be       the kind of judge that Dr  King would have admired  a judge in       the mold of Thurgood Marshall  William Hastie or A  Leon       Higginbotham  Jr
