       Leahy Cornyn Bill Targets Counterfeiters  Bill Would Stiffen Penalties   For Sale Of Pirated Goods                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy Cornyn Bill Targets      Counterfeiters   Bill Would Stiffen Penalties For      Sale of Pirated Goods   WASHINGTON       Friday  May 20   Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and John Cornyn       R Texas  introduced a bill Friday targeting the multi billion dollar      industry of counterfeit goods    The bipartisan      Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005 would impose      stiff penalties for those possessing counterfeit goods with the      intent to sell or traffic in those goods  The bill also expands the      definition of traffic to include any distribution of counterfeits      with the expectation of gaining something of value  and it      criminalizes the importation and exportation of counterfeit goods       including bootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the      United States  Counterfeit goods comprise a staggering piece of the      market    an estimated  350 billion a year  or between 5 percent and      7 percent of worldwide trade  said Leahy  who invited a      representative from Burton Snowboards last year to testify before      the Senate Judiciary Committee on the challenges facing companies in      Vermont and around the country involving the rise of counterfeited      goods   Both Leahy and      Cornyn are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Leahy serves      as the ranking Democratic member of the panel  Below is Leahys      statement on the bill  followed by a brief section by section      summary                    Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy     On Introduction of the      Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005      May 20  2005  MR  LEAHY  Today  I am partnering      with Senator Cornyn in another of our bipartisan efforts to improve      the lives of Americans through effective and efficient government       The bill we are introducing  the Protecting American Goods and      Services Act of 2005 will strengthen our ability to combat the      escalating problem of counterfeiting worldwide  In order to      effectively fight intellectual property theft  we need stiff      penalties for counterfeiters and those who are caught with      counterfeit goods with the intent to traffic their false wares       Ours is a short bill  indeed  it is only four pages long  but it      will have global implications in the fight against piracy   Counterfeiting is a growing problem      that costs our economy hundreds of billions of dollars every year      and has been linked to organized crime  including terrorist      organizations  According to the International Anti Counterfeiting      Coalition  counterfeit parts have been discovered in helicopters      sold to NATO  in jet engines  bridge joints  brake pads  and      fasteners in equipment designed to prevent nuclear reactor      meltdowns  The World Health Organization estimates that the market      for counterfeit drugs is about  32 billion each year     Several years ago  Senator Hatch      joined me in sponsoring the Anti counterfeiting Consumer Protection      Act of 1996  which addressed counterfeiting by amending several      sections of our criminal and tariff codes  That law made important      changes  particularly by expanding RICO  the federal      anti racketeering law  to cover crimes involving counterfeiting and      copyright and trademark infringement  Then  as now  trafficking in      counterfeit goods hurts purchasers  state and federal governments       and economies at every level    Perhaps most disturbingly  the U S       Customs Service reports that terrorists have used transnational      counterfeiting operations to fund their activities  The sale of      counterfeit and pirated music  movies  software  T shirts  clothing       and fake drugs accounts for much of the money the international      terrorist network depends on to feed its operations     Last year  as in years past  I worked      with Senator Allen on an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill      that provides the State Department with vital resources to combat      piracy of U S  goods abroad  The bill we ultimately passed included       3 million for this important purpose  Yet more work both at home      and abroad remains  When you consider that the economic impact of      tangible piracy in counterfeit goods is estimated to be roughly  350      billion a year and to constitute between 5 percent and 7 percent of      worldwide trade  a few million dollars is a worthwhile investment        We have certainly seen how this form      of theft touches the lives of hard working Vermonters  Burton      Snowboards is a small company  whose innovation has made it an      industry leader in snowboarding equipment and apparel       Unfortunately  knock off products carrying Burtons name have been      found across the globe  Vanessa Price  a representative of Burton       testified about counterfeiting at the Judiciary Committees March      23  2004  hearing on this topic  In addition to learning about the      economic costs of counterfeiting  I asked her after the hearing      about the risks posed to consumers by these goods  Her answer was      chilling  In the weeks since my Senate testimony  I discovered a      shipment of counterfeit Burton boots for sale through a discount      sports outfit After examining the poor quality of the counterfeit      boots  we determined that anyone using the boots for snowboarding      risks injury due to a lack of reinforcement and support in the      products construction    Customers and businesses lose out to      counterfeiters in other ways  too  SB Electronics in Barre  Vt  has      seen its capacitors reverse engineered and its customers lost to      inferior copycat models  Vermont Tubbs  a furniture manufacturer in      Rutland  has seen its designs copied  produced offshore with      inferior craftsmanship and materials  and then reimported  so that      the company is competing against cheaper versions of its own      products  And Hubbardton Forge in Castleton  Vt  has seen its      beautiful and original lamps counterfeited and then sold within the      United States at prices  and quality  far below their own  This      is wrong  It is unfair to consumers who deserve the high quality      goods they think they are paying for  and it is unfair to innovators      who play by the rules and deserve to profit from their labor    The bill that I am introducing today      with Senator Cornyn will help to combat this growing scourge     The bill will criminalize the      possession of counterfeit goods with the intent to sell or traffic      in those goods  and it expands the definition of traffic to      include any distribution of counterfeits with the expectation of      gaining something of value  criminals should not be able to skirt      the law simply because they barter illegal goods and services in      exchange for their illicit wares  Finally  the bill will      criminalize the importation and exportation of counterfeit goods  as      well as of bootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the      United States    By tying off these loopholes and      improving U S  laws on counterfeiting  we will be sending a powerful      message to the criminals who belong in jail  and to our innovators        I ask unanimous consent that a copy of      this bill be printed in the      RECORD                         Section by Section      Analysis     Of The Leahy Cornyn      Protecting American Goods and Services Act of 2005  Prohibits      Trafficking of Goods or Services Relating to Certain Counterfeit      Marks   Creates a new section       criminalizing possession of counterfeit goods with intent to       traffic  Sets penalties for individuals of fines of up to        2 000 000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years  or both  Also sets       penalties for a person other than an individual of up to        5 000 000     Replaces the definition of       traffic to clarify the laws applicability to circumstances       where counterfeit goods are given away with the expectation of       gaining something of value from any source     ProhibitS      Transport of Counterfeit Goods or Unauthorized Copies and      Phonorecords of Copyrighted Works   Adds section criminalizing       unauthorized trafficking of goods bearing a counterfeit mark  or       copies or phonorecords of a copyrighted work  into and out of       the United States    Imposes penalties in the form of       fines of not more than  100 000  or imprisonment of up to 10       years  or both
