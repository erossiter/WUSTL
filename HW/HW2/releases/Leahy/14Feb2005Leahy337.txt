       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Introduction Of The Artist Museum   Partnership Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy          Introduction Of The Artist Museum Partnership Act Of 2005          February 14  2005 Mr  President  I rise today again with Senator           Bennett to introduce the          AArtist Museum           Partnership Act             This bipartisan legislation will enable our country to keep cherished           art works in the United States and to preserve them in our public           institutions  while erasing an inequity in our tax code that currently           serves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums           and libraries  This is the same bill we introduced the past three           Congresses  It was also included in the Senate passed version of the           Presidents 2001 tax cut bill  and in the Senate passed version of the           2003 Charity Aid  Recovery  and Empowerment  CARE  Act  I would like to           thank Senators Bingaman  Cantwell  Cochran  Conrad  Dodd  Durbin            Jeffords  Kennedy  Kerry  Lieberman  Lugar  Stevens and Warner for           cosponsoring this bipartisan bill  Our bill is sensible and straightforward  It would           allow artists  writers  and composers who donate works to museums and           libraries to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the           work  This is something that collectors who make similar donations are           already able to do  Under current law  artists who donate self created           works are only able to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas  pen            paper and ink  which does not even come close to their true value  This           is unfair to artists and it hurts museums and libraries  large and           small  that are dedicated to preserving works for posterity  If we as           a nation want to ensure that art works created by living artists are           available to the public in the future  for study or for pleasure  this           is something that artists should be allowed to do   In my state of Vermont  we are incredibly proud of           the great works produced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live           and work in the Green Mountain State  Displaying their creations in           museums and libraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters           and strengthens a bond with Vermont  its landscape  its beauty  and its           cultural heritage  Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum           or examined an original manuscript or composition  and has gained a           greater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result            knows the tremendous value of these works  I would like to see more of           them  not fewer  preserved in Vermont and across the country   Prior to 1969  artists and collectors alike were           able to take a deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work            but Congress changed the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform           Act of 1969  Since then  fewer and fewer artists have donated their           works to museums and cultural institutions  The sharp decline in           donations to the Library of Congress clearly illustrates this point            Until 1969  the Library of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of           manuscripts from authors each year  In the four years following the           elimination of the deduction  the Library received only one such gift            Instead  many of these works have been sold to private collectors and           are no longer available to the general public         For example  prior to the enactment of the 1969 law         Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the        Library of Congress  But after the law passed  his papers were sold        instead to a private foundation in Switzerland  We can no longer afford        this massive loss to our cultural heritage  Losses like this are an        unintended consequenceof the 1969 tax bill that should now be corrected  Congress changed the law for artists more than 30        years ago in response to the perception that some taxpayers were taking        advantage of the law by inflating the market value of self created works         Since that time  however  the government has cut down significantly on the        abuse of fair market value determinations  Under this legislation  artists        who donate their own paintings  manuscripts  compositions  or scholarly        compositions would be subject to the same new rules that all        taxpayer collectors who donate such works must now follow  This includes        providing relevant information as to the value of the gift  providing        appraisals by qualified appraisers  and  in some cases  subjecting them to        review by the Internal Revenue Service s        Art Advisory Panel   In addition  donated works must be accepted by museums        and libraries  which often have strict criteria in place for works they        intend to display  The institution must certify that it intends to put the        work to a use that is related to the institution s        tax exempt status  For example  a painting contributed to an educational        institution must be used by that organization for educational purposes and        could not be sold by the institution for profit  Similarly  a work could        not be donated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not        intend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting the        recipients exemption under Section 501 of the tax code  Finally  the fair        market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion of the        artist s income        that has come from the sale of similar works or related activities   This bill would also correct another disparity in the        tax treatment of self created works  how the same work is treated before        and after an artist s        death  While living artists may only deduct the material costs of        donations  donations of those same works after death are deductible from        estate taxes at the fair market value of the work  In addition  when an        artist dies  works that are part of his or her estate are taxed on the fair        market value  The Joint Committee on Taxation has previously        estimated that our bill would cost  50 million over 10 years  This is a        moderate price to pay for our education and the preservation of our        cultural heritage   I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring        this bipartisan legislation  The time has come for us to correct an        unintended consequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage        the donations of art works by their creators  This bill will make a        critical difference in an artist s        decision to donate his or her work  rather than sell it to a private party        where it may become lost to the public forever  Mr  President  by        unanimous consent I ask that this statement and bill text be included in        the record
