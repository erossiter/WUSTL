       Vt  Delegation Reactions To The Bush Administration s Dairy Proposals   For The 2007 Farm Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Sen  Bernie Sanders and Rep  Peter Welch     To The Bush Administration s Dairy Proposals     For The 2007 Farm Bill     Wednesday  Jan  31  2007   WEDNESDAY  Jan  31     The Bush      Administration Wednesday outlined the Presidents proposals for the      new Farm Bill that Congress will be working on this year  The      Administration proposes continuing the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC       Program    which was established in the last Farm Bill under the      leadership of the Vermont Congressional Delegation  but with      reduced help to farmers  Under the Administrations proposal  dairy      producers would continue to be eligible to receive assistance if the      Class I price in Boston in any month falls below  16 94 per cwt       For FY 2008  the proposed payment rate would remain at the current      rate of 34 percent of the difference between  16 94 per cwt and the      Class I price in Boston  But in subsequent years  the payment rate      would be cut to 31 percent in FY 2009  28 percent in FY 2010  25      percent in FY 2011  22 percent in FY 2012  and 20 percent in FY      2013 2017  The Bush Administrations plan also would reduce the      eligible quantity of milk to 85 percent of the 3 year average of      milk marketed during Fiscal Years 2004 06  Following are the      comments of the members of the Vermont Congressional Delegation on      the Presidents MILC Program proposals   Sen  Patrick Leahy  The      Administration s proposal is a first step forward on dairy  but      unfortunately it s a small first step  I welcome that the      President s proposal includes an extension of the MILC Program  But      it falls far short by disregarding the low milk prices  high feed      costs and soaring fuel expenses that dairy farmers are facing       Scaling back the MILC Program while farmers are under siege is      shortsighted and counterproductive  I will continue to work with      Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch  along with our allies on the      Agriculture Committee and in the Senate  to build on the      Administration s proposal   Sen  Bernie Sanders  While I am      certainly pleased that the Administration at least acknowledges the      need for the MILC Program  it is clear that they just do not      understand the scope of the crisis dairy farmers are facing  We      should be trying to improve the federal safety net for family dairy      farmers  not dismantling it  As Congress considers the Farm Bill  I      look forward to working with Senator Leahy and Congressman Welch to      preserve and improve federal protections for family farmers in      Vermont and across this country   Rep  Peter Welch  I am encouraged      the Administration s proposal includes an extension of MILC  but I      am troubled by their lack of long term commitment to this important      program  I view the Administration s proposal as only a starting      point from which to begin the hard work we face  The 2007 Farm Bill      absolutely must address the importance of local Vermont scale dairy      farming  as well as opportunities for diversification and other      farm based revenue  I look forward to working with Senators Leahy      and Sanders and my colleagues in the House to help assure a Farm      Bill that helps our hard working Vermont farmers
