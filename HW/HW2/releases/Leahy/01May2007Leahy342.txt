       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Process Patents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   Hearing On Process Patents   May 1  2007   A few weeks ago  I joined with Senator Hatch and other    Senators  and with Chairman Berman and Representative Smith from the House    Judiciary Committee  to introduce sweeping bipartisan  bicameral patent    reform legislation  We are working to update our patent laws to provide    much needed reform for patent seekers and patent holders  The Supreme Court    is also more engaged in patent law decisions than it has been in decades     having decided three important cases already this term  In two decisions    released just yesterday  the Supreme Court ventured first into the    fundamental issue of the standard for obviousness that would prevent    patentability  and second spoke to the extraterritorial effect of U S     patent laws   In the process of drafting our patent reform    legislation  we heard a good deal about another issue involving U S  patents    and overseas manufacturing    the issues surrounding products produced    overseas using processes patented in the United States  One of those    issues is the importation of these products  Today  we turn to the debate    about what defenses should be available to a party accused of importing    products manufactured abroad by infringing a U S  process patent  Those who    work in this area refer to this issue as the 271 g  question  It is often the case that litigation brings important    issues to our attention in Congress  It should always be the case that we    do not intend to interfere with that litigation  Well aware that private    parties are interested  the Committee proceeds today careful to limit the    considerations of this issue to those of public policy  Prior to Congresss amending the patent laws in 1988  a    company holding a U S  process patent could sue for infringement of that    patent only if the infringement took place within the United States  If the    infringement took place overseas  the patent holders only recourse was to    the International Trade Commission  ITC  to exclude the product from the    U S  market  In 1988  Congress amended the law to permit patent holders to    sue in federal court for patent infringement when a product  produced abroad    using a process patented in the U S   is imported or offered for sale in the    U S  This action  however  was subject to defenses created for patent    infringement cases in which the product being imported was substantially    altered  The ITC has held that these 271 g  defenses are not    available in ITC exclusion proceedings because the plain language of the    statute  confirmed by legislative history  applies them only to patent    infringement claims being considered in federal court pursuant to the 1988    amendment   The issue we consider today is whether this distinction should    remain  I have heard from those who argue that the defenses    were never intended to be limited to infringement claims  and the law should    be changed to harmonize ITC and district court litigation  Others argue    that the purposes of an ITC exclusion proceeding and district court patent    infringement litigation are simply different  If we permit products to    enter the United States that were made abroad by a process patented here     where creation of the product would itself be an act of infringement if it    occurred here  we are doing nothing less than outsourcing infringement and    offshoring jobs   This may seem like a very narrow legal issue but the    policy that will animate our decision can have a very wide reach  Congress    should be fully informed  I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses    today  and appreciate their assistance as we try to find the best way    forward
