Thursday passed a bill      that would protect against deceptive practices aimed at suppressing      voter turnout     The Deceptive Practices and Voter      Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007  S  453  would strengthen      existing laws to assist prosecutors in preventing dirty political      tactics aimed at deceiving voters about vital information on      elections such as the time polls are open  location of polls and      qualifications necessary to vote   There is no more fundamental right in      our great democracy than the right to vote  said Chairman Patrick      Leahy  D Vt    an original cosponsor of the bill  Unfortunately       the prevalence of deceptive campaign practices    which seek to undermine that fundamental right    has      continued    Introduced by Senators Charles Schumer       D N Y   and Barrack Obama  D Ill         the bill has been cosponsored by nearly a fifth of the      Senate  including Judiciary Committee members  Senators Leahy       Schumer  Edward Kennedy  D Mass    Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Dick      Durbin  D Ill    Benjamin Cardin  D  Md    Sheldon Whitehouse  D R I         and Tom Coburn  R Okla     Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting     Deceptive Practices And Voter Intimidation Prevention Act Of 2007    September 6  2007    With the cooperation of Members of the Committee on     both sides of the aisle we can make real progress today and follow     through on the promise of the important civil rights hearing we held     yesterday with Congressman Lewis and other leaders in the effort to     achieve equal justice for all   I had hoped last month to complete action on the     Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2007      S 453  I thank Senator Cardin for chairing our hearing on these     important matters back on June 7th  We provided notice that     the bill was on our business agenda back on July 19  The measure was     held over at our meeting in August  which brings us to today  Despite     the weeks and weeks of notice  amendments were not circulated until the     hour of the deadline last night  Indeed  one Senator circulated 19     amendments as the deadline approached  I hope that we are not going to     see another filibuster of an important bill by amendment  Yesterday  those who attended the civil rights     hearing heard some of the most moving testimony ever spoken in this     hearing room  Congressman Lewis and Robert Moses were both riveting and     right  They spoke of the distance we still have to go to achieve equal     justice and the need for legislation such as the bill we are considering     today  It is on the continuum from the Civil Rights Act of 1957 that we     commemorated at our hearing  I urge all Members of this Committee to     move forward together in a bipartisan way on this legislation without     further delay   This is an important measure introduced by Senator     Obama and supported by a number of Members of this Committee  including     Senator Feinstein  the Chair of the Rules Committee  the committee with     which we share jurisdiction over voting matters  Our bill would     continue the march toward equal justice we spoke of yesterday by     providing protections against the use of deceptive practices in     elections  practices as we have seen during our hearing that are used to     depress voting in minority communities and to intimidate minority     voters  There is no more fundamental right in our great democracy than     the right to vote  Unfortunately  the prevalence of deceptive campaign     practices   which seek to undermine that fundamental right    has     continued  Tactics have evolved to exploit gaps in current laws     intended to protect Americans civil rights   At our June hearing chaired by Senator Cardin  we     were graced with the presence of another longtime civil rights leader     from Maryland  Senator Charles Mac Mathias  I was privileged to serve     with Senator Mathias on this Committee and he is a friend and     inspiration to many of us  Mac indicated his belief that this     legislation fills the gap among existing laws and would serve to thwart     modern attempts to suppress the participation of minority voters   At the outset of our debate on this bill  I will     recognize Senator Schumer  a leading sponsor of the measure  to offer     the substitute he has worked out with a number of Senators  After it is     adopted  the floor will be open to those who wish to offer further     amendment  I do regret that in the last seven weeks no one has come to     Senator Schumer  Senator Cardin  Senator Obama or to me with any     suggestions  Still  I will protect the rights of all Senators and we     will work diligently to complete action on this measure so that we can     then turn to the many other items on the agenda
