       Leahy s Judiciary Panel Grills Oil Execs On Oil Industry Concentration   And The Fuel Price Spiral                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahys Judiciary      Panel Grills Oil Execs      On Oil Industry Concentration And The Fuel Price Spiral        Leahy And Specter Introduce Bipartisan     Petroleum Industry Antitrust Act        TUESDAY  March 14     With fuel prices up another 11 percent in the      last two weeks and heading higher  the heads of the nations biggest      oil companies Tuesday came to Capitol Hill to testify before the      Senate Judiciary Committee where the panels two leaders  Chairman      Arlen Specter  R Pa   and Ranking Member Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Tuesday planned to introduce new legislation to tune up antitrust      laws that are intended to protect consumers and promote competition      in the marketplace         Leading forecaster Trilby Lundberg this week said fuel prices could      rise another 30 cents by the height of the summer driving season             The new Specter Leahy Petroleum Industry Antitrust Act contains      Leahys NOPEC Bill  which he has introduced in the past with Sens       Herb Kohl  D Wisc   and Mike DeWine  R Ohio   The NOPEC bill has      been approved three times by the Judiciary Committee and has also      passed the Senate  but in an earlier outing it was killed by      Republican House leaders and White House negotiators  The NOPEC      measure would end the immunity that foreign states engaged in cartel      activity now enjoy from the enforcement of U S  antitrust laws         The new bill by Leahy and Specter also would punish oil or natural      gas companies that divert or withhold supplies in order to boost      prices or to create shortages  The bill also would create a joint      Federal And State Task Force to pool and investigate      information sharing practices among oil and natural gas companies        Below is Senator      Leahys statement from the hearing    Statement Of      Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Consolidation In The Oil And Gas Industry     March 14  2006 I      commend the Chairman for holding this substantive and timely hearing      today  The Committee tackles a fundamental and widening crisis that      affects every American family  every American farmer and every      American business  The questions before us are as basic as these       When does the opportunity to repeatedly raise fuel prices  and to      amass record shattering profits on a scale never before known in      our society  or in any society    when does that reach      the point of becoming a corrosive kind of greed that demands some      kind of corrective action  Another question  At what point does      the ever tightening circle of energy suppliers become      anti competitive  And finally  how long should the overseas oil      cartel be exempt from antitrust remedies        Americas fuel crisis continues to drain hard earned money from our      families  farmers  factories and businesses  This problem is made      more complicated because  as President Bush observed in his State of      the Union address  America is addicted to oil   I      can only hope the Presidents public acknowledgement means he has      finally abandoned the failed policy of Vice President Cheneys      Energy Task Force that worked in secret with Enrons Ken Lay and      with other well connected energy industry folks to develop an energy      policy that pads the pockets of the special interests  at the      expense of consumers        The time for Congress to act is long overdue  It was clear even at      the time last years energy package was signed into law that it      already was a wasted opportunity of epic proportions when it comes      to truly  practically and meaningfully addressing the oil addiction      the President now cites  Flawed policies in essence continue to      levy a hefty unofficial tax on the pocketbooks and balance sheets      of millions of families  farms and businesses across the country       Each additional week without progress means continued hardship on      Vermonters and millions of others nationwide in heating their homes      or budgeting for all the other ways these escalating fuel costs are      adding to their daily expenses   As      a first step  Congress should enact the NOPEC bill into law  For      weeks we have been evaluating the security concerns prompted by a      foreign governments ownership of a company that would take over      effective control of port facilities in six of our major ports       Meanwhile  in the case of the oil cartels  government controlled      entities routinely collude to set prices  and they have also wielded      their power to purposely create major supply and security concerns      in the United States  The time for our NOPEC reforms may have      finally arrived       The Senate has already passed this bill  which would make OPEC      subject to our anti trust laws  In fact  this Committee has      approved the NOPEC bill three times  Regrettably  even though      President Bush promised in the 2000 election to jawbone OPEC  the      Bush Administration and its friends in the House have scuttled the      NOPEC bill and the relief it would bring to millions of Americans       I      am proud to join with the Chairman  Senators Kohl and DeWine and      others on a new bill which includes our NOPEC legislation  This      measure would make OPEC accountable for its anti competitive      behavior and allow the Justice Department to crack down on illegal      price manipulation by oil cartels  It will allow the federal      government to take legal action against any foreign state  including      members of OPEC  for price fixing and other anti competitive      activities  The tools this bill would provide law enforcement      agencies are necessary to fight OPECs anti competitive practices      immediately  and they would help reduce gasoline prices now  rather      than waiting another decade  It is time for the President to make      good on his campaign pledge and join the bipartisan majority in the      Senate which is saying NO to OPEC        But we should not stop there  A windfall profits tax on the      record breaking profits that oil companies have been raking in would      help consumers afford home heating oil now and for years to come       Such a levy could help provide refunds for consumers to help protect      them from high home heating prices  It could also be used to      finance practical investments for homeowners to upgrade their      insulation  replace windows  and trade in their old appliances for      more energy efficient ones  Revenues could also be used to      encourage consumers to buy more fuel efficient hybrid cars  We      also must address the merger mania within the oil industry  Over      the last several years  oil company mergers have significantly      diminished competition  leading to higher prices for consumers  The      U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  concluded in a report      that recent mergers in the oil industry have directly led to higher      prices  This may seem like an obvious conclusion  but one that has      gone too long without some kind of resolution        And finally the time is long overdue to make a serious commitment to      alternative fuels and renewable energy  We all heard the      Presidents State of the Union address and his declaration of the      need to address our dependence on foreign oil  However in reality      the President is proposing to devote less to alternative and      renewable energy resource development in inflation adjusted dollars      than was devoted to this goal in Fiscal Year 2001   I      am glad that the Committee will be returning to the Chairmans      previous policy of putting witnesses under oath  Before the      Committee today are executives from the five biggest oil companies       In a year when these corporations posted record profits  we also saw      them increase their prices  At  36 7 billion in profit last year       ExxonMobil turned the highest yearly profit in U S  history for any      business  Since 2001  the oil companies represented here have      recorded  272 2 billion in profits  Since 1999  oil refiners have      seen a 334 percent increase in yield on each gallon of gasoline      refined because of prices they set  the lack of transparency  and      the lack of effective regulation   I      suspect we will hear their reasons for price increases at a time      when their corporations are posting record profits  But to ask      Americans to pay more for gas so that a few corporations can boost      the profit margin is unacceptable to me  American families are at      the mercy of these companies to get to work  to go to school  and to      run the businesses that pay their salaries  When all of you raise      prices together  Americans are forced to meet that price    I      do hope each of the executives here today offers more than just a      well spun argument for higher prices to get higher profits  This      cannot continue  In your careers  each of you has seen what happens      when the foreign oil spigots are tightened or when disasters strike      America  This requires a responsible and carefully planned      strategy  Instead of reading about what plan you have in place on      the front pages of the newspapers  Americans read that as the prices      at the pumps soar  so do your profit margins        The rest of American rallies together when America is suffering  In      contrast  instead of preparing for possible shortfalls or      emergencies  it appears the oil industry has focused on taking      advantage of consumers who have no alternatives  You are not in the      business of making oil you are in the business of supplying a      reliable energy source to millions of Americans        That energy source for the time being is crucial to many in my home      state of Vermont  Vermonts farmers  families  hospitals  colleges      and businesses can not function without it        For a typical Vermont farmer the impacts of your lousy planning can      be catastrophic  I can give you one example from a Vermont farmer      whom I have known for years  Harold Howrigan  His dairy operation      fuel costs on about 800 acres increased by almost  10 000 in one      year  His costs were  49 800 in 2004  and increasedto  59 650 in      2005  The overall increase in fuel costs for an average Vermont      farmer last year was 43 percent  meaning that each farmer is      estimated to pay an additional  700 in fuel surcharges in 2006      alone  That may seem like pennies compared to the profit sums we      will be discussing today  but to me  and to all Vermonters  we know      what the terrible consequences can be  forcing many farmers to make      unfair choices between running their farm or heating their home       These are not choices anyone should be faced with  certainly not      our hard working farmers        Vermonts dairy farmers  who get up everyday  well before the sun      rises  whether it is minus 15 degrees  or whether its pouring rain       or pelting snow  can not do their jobs without your product  It is      not just farmers in my home state of Vermont  Farmers in Wisconsin       Pennsylvania  Idaho  California  and other key states that provide      our domestic milk supply are reliant on your product  That is how      you get the cream for your morning coffee each day  So  after that      cup tomorrow I would like you all to think about preparing for      emergencies instead of preparing to take advantage of emergencies       When I look at the record gasoline and home heating prices in      comparison to the record profits of the largest oil companies       totaling tens of billions of dollars  it is clear that a change is      necessary  The answer here is not easy  and change is not going to      happen overnight  but the first steps must be taken  and they must      be taken now
