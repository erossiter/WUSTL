       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  National Guard Caucus Breakfast                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Co Chair  Senate National Guard Caucus      National Guard Caucus Breakfast     March 27  2007  I want to thank all the Senators and      staff who are here  General Blum  General Vaughn  General McKinley       and everyone from the National Guard Bureau  A special thank you      goes to the Adjutants General who are such an important part of the      National Guard    The National Guard Caucus here in      the Senate is one of the most active and largest caucuses in the      U S  Senate  We have 86 members at this point  86  Thats getting      close to the entire Senate  which is our membership goal     I think this high membership level      underscores the awareness here in the U S  Senate just how critical      the National Guard Caucus is to our security  at home and abroad       And as the Generals know  we dont just rest on the laurels of      having a big membership  We also invest a lot of energy in helping      to meet the needs of the Guard  of today and tomorrow     The National Guard has reached a      pivotal moment in its history  The Guard has done some amazing      things for the country  But if we are going to keep the Guard      strong  and  in turn  if we are going to keep the entire military      strong  we are going to have to address some crucial issues facing      the force  For some reason  the Department of Defense has simply      not dealt with some critical matters  and it is going to be the      Caucus responsibility to step into that vacuum    Above all  the National Guard does      not have enough input into key policy and budget debates  despite      its ample contributions to the nations defense  It is this lack of      input that led to the horrible attempt last year to try to slash the      personnel end strength of the National Guard    With your help  we blocked that      unwise move  but it underscored how the National Guard lacks the      seat at the table that it needs and deserves    And it is that lack of input from      the Guard that has led the Pentagon to take its eye off the whole      military support to civilian authorities mission  which involves      responding to emergencies at home  The bottom line is that the      National Guard  serving under the control of the nations governors       is the nations homeland security force  We have to resource the      Guard for that mission    The Army Guard faces a  24 billion      equipment shortfall  and  while the Air Guard issues are not as      severe  the shortfalls are only going to grow if we dont deal with      them  Unfortunately  the Army and the Air Force have no plans  no      plans    to address these shortfalls  That only hurts our      communities and leaves us weaker    Last year  we actually went in the      wrong direction in dealing with the Guards ability to respond to      emergencies at home    A small but significant change was      made to the Insurrection Act  making it easier to federalize the      Guard and use the entire military for law enforcement  That goes      against the basic tenets of our society   We have a busy year ahead  We have      the Guard Empowerment Bill  which will ensure there is better advice      on Guard matters at the highest levels  We have a repeal of the      recent changes to the Insurrection Act  and we have this equipment      funding issue    Lots of other Senators have      important measures  such as reforming the Montgomery GI Bill and      lowering the age when Guard members and reservists can access their      retirement benefits  The Guard Caucus is going to come behind those      measures as well    So  get ready for fun and exciting      year on Guard matters  and  if you are not already a member of the      Caucus  it is definitely time to join   Thank you very much
