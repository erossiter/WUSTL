       Leahy Urges President Bush To Tap Petroleum Reserve To Curb Spiraling   Gas Prices                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy Urges President Bush     To Tap Petroleum Reserve     To Curb Spiraling Gas Prices         Oil Swap       Used Successfully By Clinton Administration  Would Boost     Supply And Cut Costs Of Oil For Gasoline And Home Heating Fuel    MIDDLESEX  Vt        Fri   Aug  19     Following is the letter that Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt   sent Friday to President Bush  asking immediate action by      the Administration to reduce gasoline prices by tapping the      Strategic Petroleum Reserve  through the same kind of oil swap used      successfully by the Clinton Administration  Leahy said an oil swap      is needed to interrupt the upward spiral of rising gasoline and home      heating oil prices  Leahy also will continue to look for      opportunities to again force Congress to take up his NOPEC Bill       which would pressure Saudi Arabia and other OPEC states to lower      their oil price demands by applying antitrust laws to their      activities  The bipartisan NOPEC Bill  which Leahy introduced with      Sens  Mike DeWine  R Ohio  and Herb Kohl  D Wisc    passed the      Senate earlier this year as part of the Senates version of the      energy bill  but it was dropped in the final version of the bill      under pressure from the White House and oil interests  The text of      the letter follows     August 19  2005  The Honorable George W  Bush     The White House     1600 Pennsylvania Avenue     Washington  DC 20500    Dear Mr  President   With the price of crude oil having      again surged to a new record  I urge your Administration to act      immediately to help reduce skyrocketing prices at the pump by      releasing a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  through      an oil swap    The high price of gasoline is placing      a severe strain on consumers in Vermont and other states  and the      price spiral also threatens the nations economic security  The      fact that these high prices have recently been reflected in the      inflation rate of finished goods is another ominous sign  If left      unchecked this summer  these high oil prices will continue to burden      our economy into the winter months by continuing to transfer the      income of working families into the pockets of large oil companies      and OPEC members  This is of particular concern in our region       which relies to a significant degree on oil for home and commercial      heating    Oil traded for over  67 a barrel this      past week  and on Monday the Vermont average per gallon of regular      gasoline was  2 51  a record high  according to the American      Automobile Association  In March the national average retail      gasoline price was about  2 per gallon and the price of a barrel of      oil was under  50  In just five years  the price of a gallon of      regular gasoline now has risen by more than a dollar per gallon        While the Administration has heralded      its tax credits for putting money back into Americans hands  it now      appears that whatever this has meant has been taken away from the      nations families and transferred to OPEC and large oil companies       OPEC members increased their profits last year by more than  86      billion  Exxon Mobil recently reported more than  25 billion in      profits in 2004 and has generated about  15 billion in profits      through the first two quarters of 2005   It is vitally important that the      Administration halt this alarming trend by making use of any tools      at its disposal to immediately quell ongoing oil price increases       In the face of skyrocketing oil prices and the coming winter months       thousands of Vermonters will face impossible choices this winter      between heating their homes or eating  or buying prescription drugs       or paying their rents or mortgages  Initiating a swap of oil from      the SPR to increase the supply of oil on the domestic market is a      proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and home heating oil  In      the fall of 2000  the Clinton Administration announced a swap of 30      million barrels over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly      fall by more than  6 per barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to      fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a swap  the federal government would      set a quantity of oil to release from the SPR and would then accept      bids from private companies for the rights to that oil  The      companies would then bid on how much oil they were willing to return         in addition to the oil they would receive under the swap    to      the SPR at a later date    An oil swap would result in a win win      situation in which gasoline prices are lowered and long term      contributions to the SPR are augmented at no additional cost to      taxpayers  The SPR is intended to provide relief at times when      working families are struggling to make ends meet  With record high      gas prices now and winter use of home heating oil just around the      corner  Vermonters need immediate help     Sincerely   Patrick Leahy     United States Senator
