       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Subcommittee On   State  Foreign Operations  And Related Programs  Fiscal Year 2006 Foreign   Operations Conference Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member      Subcommittee On State  Foreign Operations  And Related Programs     Fiscal Year 2006 Foreign Operations Conference Report     Senate Floor     November 10  2005 Mr  President       I support the Foreign Operations Conference Report for fiscal year      2006 and urge all Senators to vote its passage   Budget Constraints Like every      appropriations bill  there are things in this conference report that      I disagree with  There are programs which I  as do many here       believe need substantially more funding than we were able to      provide  A good example is our migration and refugee programs       This conference report provides less than the President requested      and far less than the Senate bill  The suffering of refugees and      displaced people that we are able to relieve but will not because of      the scant resources in this bill is shameful and inexcusable  We      and other industrialized nations could and should do far more to      help them  Another problem      is HIV AIDS  although we were able to provide  268 million more than      the President requested  I am disappointed that the amount of our      contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  TB and Malaria was       50 million less than in the Senate bill  There are few more      compelling needs for those funds than fighting these insidious      diseases  I had hoped we      would have enough to fully fund the Non Proliferation       Anti Terrorism  Demining and Related Programs account  It is a      mistake to cut funding for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty      International Monitoring System  for which the President did not      request sufficient funds  The amount in this conference report      represents a cut of  4 498 million below the fiscal year 2005 level       and is at least  6 million less than the amount of the U S  share      for this vitally important monitoring system  The fact is       despite the help we got from Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd with      our allocation  for which we are very grateful  this conference      report does not provide nearly enough resources to respond      adequately to the multitude of threats we face across the globe  We      had to make the kind of peevish choices that the worlds wealthiest       most powerful country should not be making   There are other      funding problems in this conference report  but on the whole it      strikes the right balance for the bipartisan support it needs  and      for that I commend Chairman McConnell  Chairman Kolbe  and      Congresswoman Lowey  We have worked very cooperatively as is our      practice  and I think we did about the best we could with an      allocation that was almost  2 billion below the Presidents budget      request   I want to      mention a few other issues   Colombia First       Colombia  I was pleased that the conferees agreed to my request to      provide an additional  6 million for economic and social programs       Despite assurances by the Administration that they would increase      funding for these programs as the security situation in Colombia      improves  they have done the opposite  Military programs have      consistency received a larger share of the budget   I was pleased      that the conferees included report language I requested  directing      that  500 000 of our military aid for Colombia be used to pay      incidental costs relating to the treatment at U S  hospitals of      seriously injured Colombian soldiers  Due to the tireless work of      the non profit organization United for Colombia  these hospitals      have generously offered to perform this surgery    which requires      sophisticated technology and expertise that is unavailable in      Colombia    free of charge  But there are additional expenses such      as transportation  lodging and medicines  The conferees also      included my recommendation that additional assistance from the Leahy      War Victims Fund be made available for civilians who have been      injured by landmines and other causes relating to the conflict  The conference      report also includes language concerning the demobilization of      Foreign Terrorist Organizations in Colombia  We would like to      support this process  but it has been flawed from the beginning and      the Peace and Justice law has been widely criticized by human      rights experts in Colombia  the United States  Europe  the United      Nations  and the Organization of American States  There is      considerable skepticism that the paramilitary leaders will in fact      give up narco trafficking  surrender their illegally acquired land      and other assets  or be brought to justice  We want to be sure that      the law is being implemented in a manner that lives up to its      promise of peace and justice  that these organizations are      dismantled  and that their leaders receive the severe punishment      they deserve   We provide up      to  20 million in fiscal year 2006 for the demobilization  These      are mostly funds that were already requested by the Administration      for other purposes  We require the Secretary of State to first      certify that certain conditions have been met and to notify the      Congress  This reflects the serious concerns that Members of      Congress have with the demobilization process  Among those      conditions is that the Government of Colombia is providing full      cooperation to the Government of the United States to extradite the      leaders and members of  Foreign Terrorist Organizations  who have      been indicted in the United States   This is very      important  and it was included at the insistence of both Republican      and Democratic members  When we say full cooperation we mean      nothing less  We want to see these people in handcuffs and on an      airplane to the United States as soon as possible  We do not want      anything to happen that would interfere with the extradition of the      leaders of these narco terrorist organizations  organized crime      syndicates is what they are    for major crimes for which they have      been indicted here   These are not      ordinary criminals  Some of them make Pablo Escobar look like an      amateur  They are responsible for creating and arming their own      death squads  for killing thousands of civilians  for shipping      billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States  and      they have infiltrated many sectors of Colombian society including       we learned recently  the police intelligence service  We also know      they have sway with some members of the Colombian Congress    Impunity has      been the norm throughout Colombias history  Nothing would be worse      for the cause of justice  or for democracy in Colombia  than for      people who are among the most notorious criminals in this hemisphere      to escape punishment that is proportional to their crimes  If that      happens  you can be sure that their criminal enterprises will not be      dismantled  the cocaine will keep flowing across our borders  the      Colombian people will continue to be plagued by narcotics related      violence and corruption  and peace and justice will remain out of      reach    Indonesia Another item in      this conference report deals with Indonesia  President      Yudhoyono  who was democratically elected  has been advancing      reformist policies that we support  including reducing the armys      role in the political process  He has also been a reliable ally in      fighting terrorism in the worlds largest Muslim country    The conference      report provides assistance to the Indonesian Navy in the amount      requested by the Administration  and it also provides IMET      assistance for Indonesia without restriction  In addition  our      largest counter terrorism training program is with Indonesia  and      the Defense Department regularly conducts joint exercises and other      activities with the Indonesian military  But one area      where there has been no discernable progress is accountability for      crimes by the army  In 1992 the Indonesian army shot to death an      estimated 200 unarmed protesters in a cemetery in Dili  East Timor       A few low ranking soldiers were punished  but in a perversity of      justice several of the civilians were sent to jail for far longer      sentences  Then in 1999  the Indonesian military armed the militias      who laid waste to East Timor after the independence referendum  The      UN identified the top officers involved and accused them of crimes      against humanity  but the army sabotaged the governments half      hearted efforts to bring them to justice  Thousands of innocent      people died  and no one has been punished   Some have      suggested that because these are past crimes  we should look      forward  not backward  What crime isnt a past crime  Does that      make it any less important that justice be done  How do you prevent      future atrocities if you let those who order and commit murder get      away with it  What is more fundamental to democracy than justice  For many years       the Congress has put conditions on U S  assistance to the Indonesian      army  The conditions in our law require nothing more than that the      army respect the law  yet both Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rice      asked Congress to eliminate the conditions  I understand there are      competing concerns and that we and Indonesia have common security      interests  I would have supported their request if there were any      sign that the Indonesian army is prepared to be accountable to the      law for any of these heinous crimes  So far  there is not    The conference      agreement also requires a report on the status of the FBI      investigation of the August 2002 murders of two American civilians      and one Indonesian civilian in Timika  West Papua  Soon after the      killings the Indonesian military tried to frame an innocent man       Then  when the police implicated the military in the attack  the      investigation abruptly ended  Nothing happened for another year or      so because the military actively impeded further efforts to      investigate  Since then  the military has been more cooperative and      one West Papuan individual has been indicted in the U S  But he has      yet to be indicted in Indonesia and responsibility for this heinous      crime does not stop there  It is now more than three years since      this tragedy and no one has been brought to justice   Finally  the      conference report requires a report on the humanitarian and human      rights situation in West Papua   Nepal Mr  President       another item I want to mention is Nepal  We have once again put      conditions on our military aid because of the Kings undemocratic      and repressive actions on February 1  and the armys continuing      involvement in human rights violations  We detest the tactics of      the Maoists  who forcibly recruit children  who engage in extortion       and brutalize civilians  But the Kings actions have only made a      political solution to the conflict in Nepal more elusive  and at      great cost to democracy and the rule of law  The conference      agreement provides  2 5 million for a U S  contribution to the UN      High Commissioner for Human Rights Office in Nepal  to monitor and      report on human rights violations throughout the country     Amazon Basin      Conservation Strategy The conference      agreement also provides another  10 million for USAIDs new Amazon      Basin Conservation Strategy  This is a regional initiative that I      am personally committed to  and I greatly appreciate the efforts      that USAID has made to develop this strategy through an extensive      process of consultations with governments and nongovernmental      organizations   The Amazon      Basin encompasses nine countries and has global environmental       health and economic importance that dwarfs any other forest or river      system in the world  We all have a responsibility to protect it       Brazil and Colombia are examples of countries that already have      environmental laws and policies in place and protected areas and      indigenous reserves  Coordinating with other donors  governments      and civil society organizations  we can help build the capacity to      strengthen  enforce  implement  and replicate these laws and      policies throughout the region   On a related      matter  the conference report requires USAID to establish a new      position of Advisor for Indigenous Peoples Issues  Indigenous      peoples  from the Kalahari Desert in Botswana to the forests of      Ecuador  are the most vulnerable people on Earth  Their land and      traditional ways of life are under siege  and often their own      governments are part of the problem  as was the case in our own      country a century and a half ago  USAID  which works in these      countries on issues that affect indigenous peoples  needs someone      who is knowledgeable and has the responsibility to consult with      indigenous peoples  advocate on their behalf in relation to USAID      policies  programs and activities and coordinate with other federal      agencies  I look forward to discussing this with USAID   Reform At      Multilateral Development Banks I want to      mention a provision in this conference report that deals with reform      at the multilateral development banks  There are several parts to      this provision  but one that deserves special mention concerns the      rights of whistleblowers  Too often at these institutions  people      who complain about waste  fraud or abuse are harassed  threatened       silenced  or demoted  That is the opposite of what should happen       and it is long overdue for whistleblowers to be given the protection      and recourse they deserve  This provision  among other things       calls for independent adjudicatory bodies  including external      arbitration based on consensus selection and shared costs  I      believe that access to external arbitration is long overdue  and I      urge the World Bank and the other MDBs to act expeditiously to      implement this and the other reforms called for in this provision   Millennium      Challenge Corporation The conference      report provides  1 77 billion for the Millennium Challenge      Corporation  MCC   While this represents a deep cut from the      Presidents request  it reflects the tight budgetary constraints we      faced  The conference allocation required us to cut nearly  2      billion from the Presidents total request and therefore many      programs  including the MCC  were not fully funded   I support the      goals of the MCC  and I look forward to working with the new CEO      Ambassador Danilovich  We know that foreign aid is most effective      when governments are committed to fighting corruption and addressing      the needs of their people  and when public officials  civil society      and the private sector work together to reduce poverty  I am pleased      that the conference agreement includes language emphasizing the      importance of strong participation from indigenous civil society      organizations to help ensure that the MCC is responsive to local      peoples concerns  It is through the meaningful participation of      civil society that democracy is strengthened  good governance is      valued  and open discussions of how best to achieve national      priorities are accomplished  The conference agreement requires the      MCC to submit a report that details how contributions of indigenous      civil society have been incorporated in completed compact      negotiations    African      Development Foundation and Inter American Foundation The conference      report provides funds above the Presidents request for both the      Inter American Foundation and the African Development Foundation       The Congress strongly supports the work of these foundations which      support local initiatives to increase income for Latin Americas and      Africas poorest people   Marla Ruzicka      Iraqi War Victims Fund I was very      pleased that the conference report provides additional assistance      for civilian victims of the military operations in Iraq and      Afghanistan  We provide  5 million for the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War      Victims Fund for assistance for Iraqi families and communities       which is named for Marla Ruzicka  the founder of Campaign for      Civilian Victims of Conflict  Ms  Ruzicka died  at the age of 28       along with her colleague Faiz Ali Salim  in a car bombing in Baghdad      on April 16  2005  We also provide  2 million for assistance for      Afghan families and communities that have suffered losses as a      result of the military operations  By providing this assistance the      United States is seeking to alleviate the suffering  as well as the      anger and resentment  resulting from tragic mistakes that occur in      the military operations   Neglected      Diseases I was also      pleased that the conference report includes  15 million to support      an initiative I sponsored to combat certain neglected diseases       Lymphatic filariasis  onchocerciasis  intestinal parasites       schistosomiasis  leprosy  and trachoma cause terrible suffering and      disfigurement among hundreds of millions of people in mostly      tropical countries  In addition to providing additional funds to      prevent and treat these diseases  this initiative seeks to develop a      multilateral  integrated approach to coordinate and maximize donor      contributions to control them  This is important because current      efforts are poorly coordinated and under funded  As with the      infectious diseases initiative I sponsored nearly a decade ago  I      look forward to working with USAID  other federal agencies  the      World Health Organization  and the relevant international technical      and nongovernmental organizations to develop such an approach that      has broad support    Global Environment      Facility I was      disappointed that the amount provided for the Global Environmental      Facility   80 million  fell  27 million short of the U S  pledge  I      want to emphasize that this cut does not reflect any dissatisfaction      on the part of the conferees with the GEF  which had taken steps to      adopt management and transparency reforms advocated by the United      States  but instead was due to budgetary constraints  As a strong      supporter of the GEF I am hopeful that we can make up this shortfall      in the fiscal year 2007 budget    Extractive      Industries Transparency Initiative The conference      report supports the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative       which aims to improve the capacity of developing countries to      sustainably manage the extraction of natural resources and to      monitor revenues generated from such extraction so they are used for      purposes which benefit their people  This is an anti corruption       good governance initiative spearheaded by the British Government       which responds to the longstanding practice in many developing      countries of exploiting natural resources in a wasteful and      environmentally destructive manner that benefits only the elites       The conference agreement provides  1 million for USAID to support      EITI implementation and to strengthen the role and capacity of civil      society organizations in the EITI process  This is another issue I      look forward to discussing with USAID before funds are obligated       Finally  I want      to mention the funding in the conference report for USAIDs      Operating Expenses  which was cut by  50 million below the      Administrations request  Again  this was the result of the      budgetary constraints we faced  but it also reflects some concerns      with USAIDs management of appropriated funds  This cut will force      USAID to make difficult choices  which should be the subject of      consultations with the Appropriations Committees   Mr  President       there are many other provisions in this conference report that I do      not have time here to recount  I want to again thank my friend from      Kentucky  Senator McConnell  who has been a pleasure to work with       I also thank our counterparts in the House  Congressman Kolbe and      Congresswoman Lowey  and their capable staffs  I want to commend      the Senate majority staff  Paul Grove  Tom Hawkins  Harry Christy       Bob Lester and LaShawnda Smith  They put in long hours and they      held themselves to the highest standards  And for the minority  I      want to thank Tim Rieser  Kate Eltrich and Jennifer Park    I yield the      floor
