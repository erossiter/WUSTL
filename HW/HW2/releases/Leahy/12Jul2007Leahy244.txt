Patrick Leahy      D Vt       Families Of The Vermont Fallen Go To Washington    Senate Floor    July 12  2007     This week  the Senate is again engaged in an     intense debate about one the most pivotal issues facing our Nation and     its families right now  the ongoing war in Iraq  There is great     division in the country and in the Congress on many of these issues      But we remain united in support and appreciation of our troops  and     their families and friends here at home   The Nation shares the sorrow and grief over     the loss of so many fine Americans in war  Our military operations in     Iraq and Afghanistan have come at the cost of precious American lives       And no one knows that pain more than those     loved ones left behind    the spouses  the parents  the sons and the     daughters who are left to pick up the pieces  A gaping hole of     unimaginable proportions opens with each and every one of these family     losses  Families in Vermont     have gone through more than their share of the pain  Vermont has     suffered the highest per capita casualty rate of any state in the Nation     during these ongoing operations  We are a state of just over 600 000      and many of our states sons and daughters are part of the Vermont     National Guard  the Reserves  and of the active duty forces  Twenty six     service members with Vermont ties have given their lives in Iraq and     Afghanistan   And behind the names of     those Vermonters are dozens of families and hundreds of friends facing     that all to real and perhaps unknowable loss   Earlier this year      dedicated students at Vermonts Norwich University produced a     documentary about these families coping with the loss of their loved     ones  Titled Vermont Fallen  their film documents how many of these     family members have reacted and have tried to cope   In the darkest and     saddest of times  this project has helped a new Vermont family to     emerge  brought together by community screenings of the film  They have     been able since then to turn to each others for comfort  The Norwich students     project has offered a glimpse into the searing and highly personal grief     and mourning that have touched thousands of American families and scores     of American communities  across Vermont and across the country  They     have produced a tribute that speaks directly to each human heart  Tomorrow at Arlington     National Cemetery  one of our fallen  1st Lieutenant Mark     Dooley  will be interred  Lieutenant Dooley selflessly died in the line     of duty in Iraq in 2005  He was a member of the police department in     Wilmington  Vermont  a lovely town nestled in southern Vermont      Lieutenant Dooleys parents will be there  as will other members of his     family  And joining the Dooleys      lending their unique understanding and the special bond that comes from     it  will be the families of the Vermont Fallen   I hope the Dooleys and     their new extended family will find comfort in one another  They     deserve to be in the thoughts  the hearts and the prayers of all     Vermonters and every American as they gather at
