Patrick Leahy to the Department     of State Federal     Register Notice      Card Format Passport  Changes to Passport Fee Schedule     22 CFR Parts 22 and     51  RIN 1400 AC22  Public Notice 5558 Docket ID       DOS 2006 0329     Agency  Department of State To Whom It May Concern  I am pleased to submit my comments on the     Department of States proposed rule concerning the Western Hemisphere     Travel Initiatives  WHTI  proposed passport alternative or PASS Card      as authorized in Public Law  P L   108 458  the Intelligence Reform and     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  IRTPA   and as amended on October 4      2006  by the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act  2007  P L      109 295    I am deeply concerned that the Notice of Proposed     Rule Making  NPRM  published on October 17  2006  does not acknowledge     the amendment to the WHTI contained in P L  109 295  The Departments of     Homeland Security and State have failed to incorporate into this     proposed rule the statutory changes made to WHTI in P L  108 295      including a number of certifications that must be met before the WHTI     may be fully implemented   The statutory deadline for implementation of the     WHTI is June 1  2009  The Departments of State and Homeland Security     may begin requiring a PASS Card prior to the June 1  2009  date only     after the Secretaries of these respective agencies make the required     certifications as mandated in P L  109 295   For example  one important certification in Section     546 of P L  109 295 requires that the National Institute of Standards     and Technology  NIST  certify  prior to implementation  that the     Departments of Homeland Security and State have selected a card     architecture that meets or exceeds International Organization for     Standardization  ISO  security standards and meets or exceeds best     available practices for protection of personal identification     documents  However  there is no mention of the requirement concerning     certification by NIST in the proposed rule  I am concerned that the     State Department has prematurely endorsed one card technology over     another without securing the required NIST certification on a card     architecture  I strongly recommend that the Department of State     withhold any endorsement or pre judgment of a particular card technology     until the NIST has provided its conclusions on the two competing     technologies considered in the Proposed Rule   The Proposed Rule fails to address another     requirement that any technology ultimately agreed upon be shared with     the governments of Canada and Mexico  In my view  apart from being     required by law  this requirement will ensure as smooth an     implementation as possible and will promote the inter country     cooperation and reciprocity necessary for the programs success  I     would welcome the State Departments plans as to how this outreach will     be accomplished and what it will entail   I am also concerned that the NPRM does not address     the requirement that the Departments develop alternative procedures for     groups of chaperoned children crossing a land border  This requirement     was intended to facilitate the secure and efficient cross border travel     of sports or school groups  This is of particular concern to Northern     Border States  given the frequency with which scholastic athletic teams     and other groups cross the Canadian border on field trips or other     educational or civic oriented activities  For many families and school     districts  the requirement that PASS Cards be obtained for every child     prior to a visit across the border will be unduly burdensome  I recommend that the State Department develop a     plan by which either the PASS Card fee  or the PASS Card requirement is     waived for certain qualifying groups of chaperoned children who may be     making a day long trip across a land border  I am confident that the     Departments of State and Homeland Security  working together  can ensure     the secure cross border travel of groups of these types using     alternative procedures or existing documentation   The proposed rule reduces the fee for a PASS card     below the cost of a passport book  In addition  I recommend that the     Departments develop a procedure by which low income citizens may have     the PASS Card fee waived  Although the cost of the PASS Card will be     considerably lower than a passport  for many lower income citizens whose     livelihoods depend on regular travel across the land borders of the     United States  this fee will be a significant burden  I also ask for clarification on the PASS Card     execution fee  If a Card holder renews a PASS Card after the ten year     period of validity expires  do the agencies intend to require a second     execution fee upon renewal  I look forward to reviewing the Departments of     Homeland Security and State plans to move forward with a PASS card     program that meets the requirements set forth in amendments to WHTI as     provided in Section 546 of P L  109 295  So that all parties involved may review the final     changes that became law  I have included a copy of that section for     publication in the public comment record  Sincerely  PATRICK LEAHY    U S  Senator
