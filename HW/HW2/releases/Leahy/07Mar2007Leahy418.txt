Committee      Focuses On Insurance Industry s Antitrust Exemption  WASHINGTON  Wednesday       March 7   The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing  The      McCarran Ferguson Act and Antitrust Immunity  Good for Consumers       on Tuesday focusing on the insurance industrys federal antitrust      immunity  For more than six decades  insurance companies have      enjoyed immunity from federal antitrust investigation and      prosecution    The potential for insurance industry      abuse became clear on the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane      Katrina  said Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt    Chairman of the      Committee  Residents  who lost so much as a result of the 2005      Hurricanes  and were then let down by a woefully unprepared      government  were left to face insurance companies refusing to      fulfill their commitments and help rebuild  No one should have to      go through what these Americans have been through   Leahy has teamed up with Senate      Democratic and Republican leaders to introduce S  618  The Insurance      Industry Competition Act  which would level the playing field so      that insurance companies must abide by the same competition laws as      nearly every other industry  The bipartisan bill would give the      Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission the authority      to apply antitrust laws to anti competitive behavior by insurance      companies        Leahy introduced the bill along with the Judiciary Committees      Ranking Member  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    Senate Majority      Leader

Alexander  R La         and Walter Jones  R N C     Chairman Leahys      hearing statement  as prepared  is below    Statement Of      Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On The McCarran Ferguson Act And Antitrust Immunity       Good For Consumers      March 7  2007     When Hurricane Katrina ravaged the      Gulf Coast in 2005  it caused unimaginable devastation to the      regions residents  My friend from Mississippi and my friend from      Louisiana have expended every effort to provide help to those who      have suffered  They remind us that the victims are not confined to      any one demographic group  The devastation did not care whether you      were old or young  man or woman  white or black  or whether your      political affiliation was Republican or Democratic     Today we focus on a subject that has      concerned me for some time  a topic that in the wake of the behavior      of certain insurance companies in the Gulf Coast  has been thrust      into the forefront  Our topic is the federal antitrust immunity of      the insurance industry contained in federal law and ending it so      that the insurance industry will operate by the same  good      competition laws that apply to most other industries     Our Nations competition laws can be      powerful tools to ensure that consumer welfare is the benchmark for      fair and accountable industry practices  Consumers benefit through      lower prices  more choices  and better services  Those benefits come      from competition    The antitrust immunity for the      insurance industry  contained in the 1945 McCarran Ferguson Act       raises serious concerns with me  Insurance industry practices      affect all of us  If the antitrust immunity is used in a way that      distorts the market  that leads to higher prices and poorer service       consumers throughout the country can be harmed   The potential for insurance industry      abuse became clear on the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane      Katrina  Residents  who lost so much as a result of the 2005      Hurricanes  and were then let down by a woefully unprepared      government  were left to face insurance companies refusing to      fulfill their commitments and help rebuild  No one should have to      go through what these Americans have been through   Senator Lott and Senator Landrieu can      relate as well as anyone to the difficulty their constituents have      had with insurers  insurers that have no trouble collecting premiums      when times are good  but are nowhere to be found when tragedy      strikes  Their states were hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina  and I      commend them on their tireless efforts to ensure the resources are      in place to rebuild    Now that the Gulf Coast is rebuilding       two of the areas biggest home insurers  Allstate and State Farm       are moving out and abandoning the area  A recent editorial in the     Times Picayune      implored the Louisiana Insurance Commissioner to make sure      Allstates refusal to write new home insurance policies in New      Orleans is not another systematic effort by the company to cancel      thousands of policies for which homeowners have been paying      premiums    They are not moving out because the      companies have hit on hard times  State Farm just announced that      last year it recorded net income of over  5 billion    Both Allstate and State Farm want to      keep their special status  exempt from the antitrust laws  yet both      rejected my offer to come here today and explain to the Committee      why they deserve it    The bottom line is  right now we do      not know what anticompetitive acts insurers may be engaging in      because the antitrust immunity insurers enjoy acts as a curtain that      hides their activity from federal antitrust authorities     The Insurance Industry Competition Act      that I have introduced with Senators Specter  Lott  Reid and      Landrieu would pull back that curtain to give the Department of      Justice and the Federal Trade Commission the authority to apply our      federal competition laws to insurance companies    Our antitrust laws are about good      competition policy  Competition is good for consumers and good for      our economy  Insurers may object to being subject to the same      antitrust laws as everyone else  but if they are operating in an      honest and appropriate way  they should have nothing to fear        I hope that this hearing will spark a      serious  thoughtful debate about insurance industry practices       those that benefit consumers  and those that do not  Insurers often      say that their behavior is pro competitive  If that is true       application of the antitrust laws should not be controversial       Under our federal antitrust laws pro competitive behavior is      encouraged  It is time to pull back the curtain of immunity and let      the light shine in
