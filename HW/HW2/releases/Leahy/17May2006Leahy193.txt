                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On The Costs And Benefits Of Section Five Pre Clearance      May 17  2006  Today marks the anniversary of the       Supreme Courts landmark decision in  Brown v  Board of Education        As we proceed with our fifth hearing before the Senate Judiciary       Committee on reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  it seems       appropriate to recognize the great struggle for civil rights       which led to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965        Like Brown v  Board of       Education  which began to bring to an end Americas       sorry history of racial segregation  the Voting Rights Act is       helping bring equal participation in voting to all Americans         I am encouraged that we have moved       forward with hearings and the introduction of our bipartisan        bicameral bill  I trust that we will keep to our plan of       concluding hearings before we break for the Memorial Day recess        We have been working to report our bill before Memorial Day        Regrettably  now we must look to do so by mid June  The House       Judiciary Committee has been moving forward  After almost a       dozen hearings  the House Judiciary Committee last week reported       our bicameral  bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Voting Rights       Act by a vote of 33 to one  If we are to fulfill our commitment       to reauthorizing this important measure this year  we need to       stay on schedule and push forward to make progress     Todays hearing is our fourth       focusing at least in part on Section  5  the provision of the Voting       Rights Act that requires covered jurisdictions to pre clear       changes to voting before they go into effect  By preventing       discriminatory laws from going into practice  Section 5 provides       one of the most effective measures to fight certain kinds of       pervasive and recurring discrimination  We have heard testimony       from many witnesses about examples of discrimination continuing       to this day in covered jurisdictions  and about how much harder       it would be in those jurisdictions for minority citizens to       protect their voting rights without Section 5  We have also       heard from many witnesses  including the Assistant Attorney       General for Civil Rights  that Section 5 serves as a great       deterrent against discriminatory efforts cropping up anew         At this hearing  we will hear more       from witnesses about the benefits of Section  5  What greater benefit is there       to our democracy than to ensure that no American citizens are       prevented from participating fully in it  Like the rights       guaranteed by the First Amendment  the right to vote is       foundational because it secures the effective exercise of all       other rights  As people are able to register  vote  and elect       candidates of their choice  their interests and rights get attention  The chief benefit of Section 5 is       that it furthers the very legitimacy of our government  which is       dependent on the access all Americans have to the political       process    I helped amend the Act in1982 to       include the new bailout provision to give covered jurisdictions       without recent violations the opportunity to get out of Section      5 coverage  Even       though no jurisdiction that has tried to bail out has failed        fewer than a dozen jurisdictions have sought to remove       themselves from Section 5 coverage  In fact  Section 5 is       supported by many local officials in covered jurisdictions  like       those on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors  who sent a       letter to House Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner urging that it       be reauthorized    We have heard from many       outstanding witnesses  Today we welcome a distinguished panel        Fred Gray is one of the Nations pioneering civil rights       lawyers  who has spent a lifetime fighting for those who were       denied the rights to equal protection and equal dignity under       the law  After graduating law school  he immediately went to       work defending Rosa Parks and Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  in the       Montgomery Bus Boycott  Starting in the late 1950s        he brought landmark voting rights cases like  Gomillion v  Lightfoot  to the Supreme Court  paving the way for the expansion of       voting rights that culminated in the Voting Rights Act of 1965       Armand Derfner has had a distinguished career as a       voting rights litigator and author  Mr  Derfner began his       career in 1965 working with the first federal examiners under       the Voting Rights Act to register citizens to vote in Greenwood        Mississippi  and working with Congress each time Section 5 has       been extended  in 1970  1975  and 1982  Drew Days  one of the       countrys top constitutional lawyers  was the Solicitor General       of the United States from 1993 to 1996  and has argued 23 cases       before the Supreme Court of the United States  Professor Days       also formerly served as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil       Rights  The Committee is honored that you are joining us today       and I thank you for participating in these hearings    I do regret that we have given       short shrift to extension of Section 203 and the protection of       language minorities  I wish we had moved ahead with witnesses       on that matter this week and completed it on time  We may wish       to supplement the record on that aspect of our bill before the       Senate debate
