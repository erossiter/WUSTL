       Opening Statement Of Sen  Leahy Executive Business Meeting Nov  8  2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  Executive Business Meeting  November 8  2007        I thank all Members for their cooperation earlier this week at our      extra business meeting and for their conscientious work to prepare      for our meeting today  Today we focus on proposals to amend the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA   We held an important      hearing last week and have had a number of briefings and meetings in      the last several days on these matters              Here is how I propose to proceed             When we have a quorum of 10 Senators present  I would like to turn      quickly to the Child Soldiers Accountability Act  S 2135  which was      carried over from last week  and that is cosponsored by Senators      Durbin  Coburn  Feingold and Brownback  We have a Durbin amendment      and a Kyl amendment that have both been circulated and that I      believe can be adopted by unanimous consent so that we can then      report the bill by consent  We also carried over the nomination of      Michael Sullivan that I understand is now ready to be reported              After my opening remarks and any opening remarks by the Ranking      Member  I would like to proceed directly to the FISA legislation and      will place before the Committee the amendment to title I of the      bill  which we circulated yesterday  and which Senator Feinstein is      cosponsoring              I would ask that the Committee adopt that amendment as a starting      point with the understanding that it would be open to amendment and      that any amendments filed to title I of the underlying bill be      considered in order as amendments to it  It would be my hope that      we could today adopt the substitute title I amendment  work through      other title I amendments and complete our consideration of title I      today  Yesterday evening  in compliance with our Committee rules       26 amendments were filed to the bill  including 21 amendments to      title I  So working through the title I amendments would be a good      start and a logical place to begin             I know that Members have been considering and are trying to work      together to make improvements to title II of the underlying bill       which concerns  among other things  retroactive immunity      provisions  This would allow us a few more days to continue working      to try to get consensus on title II and title III             Let me outline the title I amendment I have proposed  and point out      some of the improvements I think it brings to the bill             First  it contains an amendment that would reaffirm in the clearest      terms the fact that FISA is to be the exclusive means by which the      government conducts electronic surveillance for foreign      intelligence  That is what the law said and what Congress meant  To      me it was clear  But this provision will leave no question that the      absurd argument that this Administration concocted after the fact to      try to excuse its warrantless wiretapping by reference to the      Authorization for the Use of Military Force is just that  absurd       This is an issue on which I have focused for years and one that I      know concerns Senator Specter and Senator Feinstein among others       The substitute includes an amendment suggested by Senator Feinstein      that grows out of her work with Senator Specter on this point              The substitute also eliminates the provision in the Intelligence      Committee bill that would have changed the definition of electronic      surveillance  In his testimony to the Committee last week  Mort      Halperin correctly called that language the Alice in Wonderland      provision because it defined electronic surveillance to mean the      opposite of what it said  Our amendment corrects that  The      definition of electronic surveillance is used throughout FISA and      should be consistent  Most importantly  there appears to be      absolutely no reason to change the definition in the way the      underlying bill had done it  It accomplishes nothing and creates      significant confusion and potential harm             Other significant provisions of the substitute include a      strengthening of the minimization provisions in the Intelligence      Committee bill  I thank Senators Whitehouse and Feingold for their      important contributions to this provision  Another provision  which      Senator Feingold has developed  would impose a common sense      restriction on the use of information the FISA Court has found to be      collected improperly              One other provision that is not included in the substitute for title      I  but one that a number of us feel is important  is a requirement      that the Department of Justice Inspector General conduct a thorough      audit of the so called Terrorist Surveillance Program and report      back to the Congress and  to the greatest degree possible  the      American people  about that program  This kind of review of this      warrantless surveillance program and the legal arguments that      supported it is long overdue  I very much want to see that      provision included in our bill    The FISA is intended to protect both our      national security and the privacy and civil liberties of all      Americans  The Presidents nominee to be the next Attorney General      testified recently that protecting civil liberties  and      peoples confidence that those liberties are protected  is a part of      protecting national security  On that point  I agree with him
