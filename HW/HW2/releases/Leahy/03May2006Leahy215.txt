       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Senate GOP Ducks And Covers Up In   Refusing To Give Continued Support To The Inspector General For Iraq   Reconstruction                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D VT        Ranking Member  Subcommittee On State And Foreign       Operations       Senate Appropriations Committee         Senate GOP Ducks And Covers Up      In Refusing To Give Continued Support      To The Inspector General For Iraq Reconstruction      Congressional Record      Wednesday  May 3  2006  Mr  President  I am a cosponsor of       Amendment 3662 by my friend from Wisconsin  Senator Feingold        His amendment  which would have ensured continued support for       the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq       Reconstruction  was ruled non germane by the Parliamentarian   This is inexplicable and       unfortunate  But the real travesty is that the Majority  who       could simply agree to accept this amendment  would prefer to       hide behind the Parliamentarians ruling and let it die     By all accounts  with the       exception of the snipes of some anonymous Pentagon officials and       their friends in the Majority party who do not want the colossal       blunders of the Iraq reconstruction program exposed to the light       of day  the Special Inspector General has done an excellent job       under difficult and dangerous conditions    He has uncovered numerous       instances of waste and fraud  some  shocking in their audacity          and there are dozens of investigations and prosecutions under       way   There is another  1 6 billion for       Iraq reconstruction in this Supplemental for precisely the same       types of activities that have been funded under the Iraq Relief       and Reconstruction Fund    But in this bill they are funded       under traditional Foreign Operations accounts  not under the       Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund   What this means is that  by not       adopting the Feingold amendment  the Special Inspector General       will not have oversight of these funds   Apparently the idea is for the       State Department Inspector General to take over this       responsibility  But that office has no people in Iraq  no plan       or budget to put people there  and no ability to do the job any       time soon  They have said so themselves   This is nothing more than a       transparent attempt to shut down the only effective oversight of       this massive reconstruction program which has been plagued by       mismanagement and fraud    Projects have been poorly       designed  grossly over priced  and many will never be finished        while U S  contractors like Halliburton have made off with huge       profits   We are told by our friends in the       Majority  acting on behalf of some in the Pentagon and the White       House who want to shut down the Office of the Special Inspector       General  that they just want to return to the regular order        That is their explanation for turning this responsibility over       to the State Department   That is laughable  There is       nothing that resembles the regular order in this multi billion       dollar supplemental  none of which is paid for  In one breath       they argue that they cannot pay for the war through the regular       appropriations process because it is an extraordinary expense        In the next breath they make the opposite argument to justify       shutting down the office of the Special Inspector General   If this were really about the       regular order  the White House would support the amendment by       Senator Byrd to pay the cost of this war  rather than continue       to ignore the regular budget process and fund the war off       budget  leaving it to future generations to pay     This is just another example of       the hypocrisy of the Presidents bankrupt fiscal policy  and of       those who continue to defend it in Congress  Use a fig leaf to       make it appear as if you support the regular budget process        when in fact you are weakening it  This also is the latest       example of the Majority partys distaste and even disdain for       oversight and for the checks and balances in our system that are       supposed to root out corruption  waste  fraud and abuse and to       make government work better as government spends the taxpayers       hard earned dollars    Mr  President  the Special       Inspector General has a difficult job  His job is to find the       truth  and sometimes the truth is hard for government agencies       to accept  Sometimes they would rather not have the spotlight       shined on their mistakes   But the Special Inspector General       works for American taxpayers  not for the Pentagon  and not for       Halliburton    The Feingold amendment would have       ensured continued oversight of the very programs the Special       Inspector General was created to oversee  I want to commend him       for his attention to this issue and his effort to protect       American taxpayers  By using a technical slight of hand       maneuver to prevent the Senate from voting on this amendment  a       vote they know they would lose    the Majority has dealt a blow       to oversight of the shoddy  wasteful and criminal failures of       the Iraq reconstruction program
