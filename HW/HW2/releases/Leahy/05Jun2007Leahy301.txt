       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Dismissal Of Charges Against   Guantanamo Detainees And The Need For Restoration Of Habeas Corpus Protections                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt          Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Dismissal Of Charges Against Guantanamo Detainees    And The Need For Restoration Of Habeas Corpus Protections    June 5  2007  Time and again  the Bush Administration     and the former Republican Congress set up legally suspect systems for     addressing detainees  and time and again  these cramped systems have     been found to be flawed  These court rulings are only the latest     rebukes to these counterproductive  unilateral actions     Every time this Administration has been     called upon to create a workable and fair system  it responded by     seeking to remove judicial review and discretion and narrow the     procedures even further  I hope this time the Administration will work     with us to create a better system  The place to start is by restoring     the hallmark of justice known as the Great Writ of habeas corpus so that     there will be a check by an independent court to guarantee that basic     safeguards and the rule of law are followed  That will also begin the     process of restoring Americas reputation for justice around the world       Senator Specter and I have introduced the     Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 to preserve the legal process that     guarantees people an opportunity to go to court and challenge the basis     for their detention and any abuse of power by the Government  The     Military Commissions Act currently allows the government to hold not     just the detainees at Guantanamo Bay  but any non citizen  including the     nations 12 million lawful permanent residents  picked up even on the     unproved suspicion of being an enemy combatant  without that person     having the ability to go to court to challenge his or her detention   It is important to our national security     that we have a credible system for detaining people who actually present     a threat to the United States  These court decisions underscore that      far from being beyond reproach  the system set up by this Administration     in the weeks before the last election is not adequate and cannot be     trusted with the liberties of millions of people  The Judiciary     Committee is expected to consider our bill later this week  and I look     forward to senators supporting this legislation so we can begin the     process of restoring these fundamental safeguards
