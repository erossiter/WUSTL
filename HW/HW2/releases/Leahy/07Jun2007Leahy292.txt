       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On REAL ID Provisions In The Immigration   Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement    Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   On REAL ID Provisions In The Immigration Bill   June 7  2007 Mr  President  I rise today in support of the    Baucus Tester Sununu Leahy Akaka Collins amendment to strip the references    to the problematic REAL ID program from the underlying immigration bill     We may agree or disagree about the merits of the actual    REAL ID program  but as hearings in the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland    Security and Government Affairs Committee have shown  REAL ID is far from    being ready for primetime  In fact  the Department of Homeland Security has    not even released final regulations directing the States on REAL ID    implementation  With 260 million drivers in this country  I do not see how    we could have the massive national databases required by REAL ID and this    immigration bill up and running by the 2013 deadline set in this bill   In addition to numerous privacy and civil liberties    concerns  REAL ID is an unfunded mandate that could cost the States in    excess of  23 billion  Opposition spans the political spectrum  from the    right to the left  A large number of States have expressed concerns with    the mandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and resolutions in    opposition  Georgia  Washington  Oklahoma  and Montana have gone so far as    to indicate that they intend to refuse compliance with it  The National    Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors Association have    expressed concerns about the costs imposed on the States  The reaction to    the unfunded mandates of the REAL ID Act is a good example of what happens    when the Federal government imposes itself rather than working to create    cooperation and partnership   On top of that  even though they are not even in    production yet  REAL ID cards are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID    card  since they will be need to enter courthouses  airports  federal    buildings  and now workplaces all across the country  In my opinion  REAL    ID raises multiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges could delay    final implementation for years   For any new immigration measures to be effective  they    must be well designed  Forcing employers  employees  and the States to use    this troublesome national ID card will slow down the hiring process  stifle    commerce  and not serve as an effective strategy  As a result  we should    not jeopardize the future success of the immigration reforms sought in this    legislation by tying REAL ID too closely to it  I do not see how it is    possible for all of the States to have their new license programs up and    running by the 2013 deadline called for in this bill  Thus  I think that    instead of mandating REAL ID in this bill  we should support the    Baucus Tester amendment to strip REAL ID from this bill and put together a    workable employment verification system that does not needlessly burden    every legal job seeker in this country with the onerous and problematic    requirements of REAL ID
