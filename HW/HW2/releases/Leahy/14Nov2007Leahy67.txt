       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On Judicial Nominations   November 13  2007     The Senate continues  as we have all year       to make progress filling judicial vacancies when we have the      cooperation of the White House  The nomination before us      today for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench is Robert      Michael Dow  Jr   for the Northern District of Illinois  He has the      support of both home state Senators  I thank Senators Durbin and      Obama for their work in connection with this nomination          After we consider the confirmation of this nominee today  the Senate      will have confirmed 35 nominations for lifetime appointments to the      Federal bench this session alone  That matches the total number of      judges confirmed for 2004  It exceeds the total number of judicial      nominations that a Republican led Senate confirmed in all of 1999       2005 or 2006 with a Republican Majority  all of 1989  all of 2001       all of 1983  when a Republican led Senate was considering President      Reagans nominees  all of 1993  when a      Democratic led Senate was considering President Clintons nominees       and  of course  the entire 1996 session during which a      Republican led Senate did not confirm a single one of President      Clintons circuit nominees              Already this year  we have confirmed five circuit judges to the      Federal bench  including the nominations of Judge Jennifer Walker      Elrod and Judge Leslie Southwick who became the fourth and fifth      circuit court nominees we confirmed so far this year  That matches      the total number of circuit court judges confirmed in all of 1989      and all of 2004  when a Republican led Senate was considering this      Presidents nominees  It matches the number of President Clintons      circuit court nominations confirmed by this time in 1999 with a      Republican led Senate and is five more than the Republican led      Senate confirmed in the entire 1996 session  That was the session      in which not a single circuit court nominee was confirmed  It is      more than were confirmed in the entire 1983 and 1993 sessions              When this nomination is confirmed today  the Senate will have      confirmed 135 total Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as      Judiciary Chairman  During the Bush Presidency  more circuit      judges  more district judges    more total judges    were      confirmed in the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary Chairman      than during the 2 year tenures of either of the two Republican      Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities              The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts will list 47 judicial      vacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after todays      confirmations  At the end of the 109th Congress  the      total vacancies when Republicans controlled the Senate were 51      judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies  Despite the      additional 5 vacancies that arose before the start of the 110th      Congress  the current vacancy totals under my chairmanship of the      Judiciary Committee are below where they were under a Republican      led Judiciary Committee              The President has sent us only 21 nominations for these remaining      vacancies  Twenty six of these vacancies  more than half  have no      nominee  Of the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to      be judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees      for nine  more than half of them  Of the 14 circuit court      vacancies  six  nearly half    are without a nominee  If the      President would decide to work with the Senators from Michigan       Rhode Island  Maryland  California  New Jersey  and Virginia  we      could be in position to make even more progress              Of the 26 vacancies without any nominee  the President has violated      the timeline he set for himself at least 18 times    18 have been      vacant without so much as a nominee for more than 180 days  The      number of violations may in fact be much higher since the President      said he would nominate within 180 days of receiving notice that      there would be a vacancy or intended retirement rather than from the      vacancy itself  We conservatively estimate that he also violated      his own rule seven times in connection with the nominations he has      made  That would mean that with respect to the 47 vacancies  the      President is out of compliance with his own rule more than half of      the time              Today we consider the nomination of Robert Michael Dow  Jr  He is a      partner at the law firm of Mayer  Brown  Rowe  Maw  LLP  where he      has worked almost his entire career  He received his B A  from Yale      University where he graduated summa cum laude and his J D       from Harvard Law School where he graduated cum laude  A      Rhodes Scholar  Mr  Dow earned a master and doctorate degrees from      Oxford University  Mr  Dow also served as a law clerk to Judge Joel      M  Flaum on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh      Circuit             I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today
