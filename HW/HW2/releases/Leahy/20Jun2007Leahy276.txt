       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy After his Meeting With UN  Secretary General Ban Ki moon                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Subcommittee On State And Foreign Operations   Of The Appropriations Committee    After His Meeting With UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon   June 20  2007  The Secretary General made a strong case    for sustained U S  leadership at the United Nations   It is time for the Congress to recognize    that the UN serves our interests and the interests of our allies  and to    give it the support it needs  In fact our own security interests    increasingly intersect with the UNs capabilities in such crucial tasks    as peacekeeping and helping refugees  We discussed the need for U S     support for UN peacekeeping missions around the world  including in    Darfur  as well as the worsening refugee crisis in the Middle East      For some in Congress  bashing the UN is    sport  But the UN is responsible for maintaining peace and stability in    many places that might otherwise require the deployment of U S  troops     We would be far better off today if the UN weapons inspectors had stayed    in Iraq and we had kept our focus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and    promoting dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians
