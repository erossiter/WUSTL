       Statement Of Vermont s Congressional Delegation On International Paper s   Decision To Halt Trial Tire Burn                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Vermonts Congressional      Delegation     On International Papers Decision To Halt Trial Tire Burn     November 14  2006      IP s decision to abandon its test burn of tires is positive news       but we believe Vermonters should not have been subjected to these      emissions in the first place  It took IP a full week of test burning      to learn what we have been telling them all along  the plant needs      updated equipment before it burns tires for fuel  We remain      extremely concerned that the available data suggest that pollution      levels from the week long burn approached the permitted limit and      exceeded IP s expected levels  If IP had not taken this action  the      delegation was prepared to call on EPA to shut down this test burn       The delegation will press EPA to see that all of the data from the      test burn is made public  We will continue to monitor results to      ensure thatthe any environmental or health effects of this test are      known  and that the people of the Champlain Valley are not      subjectedtoany more trials at their expense
