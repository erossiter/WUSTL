       Leahy  Snowe Urge EPA To Approve Northeast Merucy Plan                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy  Snowe      Urge EPA To Approve Northeast Mercury Plan   And Enhance      National Mercury Pollution Standards  October 25  2007               WASHINGTON  Thursday  Oct  25     U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe       R Maine  and Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday began circulating a      letter to their fellow Northeast Senate Colleagues urging      Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson to      approve the Northeast Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load      cleanup plan  As part of the plan  the region requires enhanced      federal guidelines for mercury pollution coming into the Northeast      from other parts of the country               In recent years  the Northeastern states of Maine  New Hampshire       Vermont  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut  and New York have      drastically reduced mercury pollution from in state power plants       Yet the region fails to meet current EPA guidelines because of the      mercury pollution brought in from neighboring states  The Snowe Leahy      letter follows a similar plea made yesterday by the governors of the      Northeastern states            The Northeastern      states  including Maine  continue to be at end of the tailpipe of      mercury  spewing coal fired power plants in the Midwest  said Snowe       Maine has led the way in reducing mercury emissions within the      state  but we must see strong action on the part of the EPA to      reduce mercury emissions that enter our state from sources in other      states  The petition from the region clearly identifies that our      State simply can not do anything more  The lax approach by EPA in      regards to our national problem has failed to protect the health of      our children  Maines natural resources and the economies that      depend on them                Mercury kills and injures  and thats a scientific fact  Leahy      said  Unfortunately the Administrations approach to the mercury      in our environment has been to allow industry insiders to write a      do nothing national policy  Our region has long led the way in      curbing mercury pollution  which is among the least controlled and      most dangerous toxins threatening pregnant women and children in      America today  Because mercury pollution knows no borders  we need      a sensible national approach to protect Vermonters  Mainers and all      Americans           During the 109th Congress  Senators Leahy and Snowe introduced the      Mercury Emission Act of 2005  which would have restricted mercury      emissions throughout the country and set a cap of 5 tons by 2009       Under the Bush proposal there would be a limit of 38 tons by 2010       In further action  as part of the Congressional Review Act  Senators      attempted to pass a resolution expressing disapproval of the EPA      mercury rule  On September 13  2005  the Senate voted for the      resolution S J Res  20  which failed in a vote of 47 51                 Text of the Letter                Stephen Johnson        Administrator        Environmental Protection Agency       1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Room 3426        Washington  DC              Dear Administrator Johnson               We are writing to request that you expeditiously approve the      petition for the Northeast Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load       TMDL                 The Northeast states of Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont       Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut  and New York have      drastically reduced mercury pollution in recent years  For example       between 1998 and 2002 state initiatives to reduce mercury pollution      from municipal waste combustors and medical waste incinerators      prevented 8 000 pounds of mercury pollution  Indeed  nearly all      in region sources of mercury have been eliminated in the Northeast       While our States efforts are laudable and have produced tangible      results  our federal standards have been virtually stagnant and      maintained the status quo  Mercury is atmospherically deposited and      it is becoming increasingly evident that for our states to comply      with Section 303 d  of the Clean Water Act strong federal action      that encompasses all of the States is essential                The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed scientific research      demonstrating that maternal consumption of unsafe levels of mercury      in fish can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm resulting in      children that suffer from learning disabilities  poor motor      function  mental retardation  seizure disorders and cerebral palsy       This clearly impacts the health of our region  as well our economic      wellbeing  Currently  six of the seven Northeast states have      statewide freshwater fish consumption advisories directly as a      result of mercury pollution  Currently 10 000 bodies of water as      well as 46 000 miles of rivers in the Northeast are listed as      impaired for fish consumption due to mercury pollution                 On October 24th  the Northeast States submitted the      Northeast Regional TMDL  which states  The Northeast regions      ability to achieve the calculated TMDL allocations is dependent on      the adoption and effective implementation of national and      international programs to achieve necessary reductions in mercury      emissions  As you know  mercury pollution originates from two      major sources  wastewater discharge and atmospheric deposition  The      Clean Air Mercury Rule  CAMR  insufficiently reduces emissions      through atmospheric deposition and amounts to only 70 percent      reduction by 2018  The CAMR will not allow our states to move      forward with this TMDL  We therefore urge you to approve the      Northeast Regional Mercury TMDL and again ask you to strongly      consider reevaluating the CAMR and promulgate national rules      consistent with the regions TMDL                Thank you for your serious consideration of our request  and we look      forward to hearing your response at your earliest convenience                    Sincerely               OLYMPIA J  SNOWE       PATRICK J  LEAHY       United States      Senator
