       Shield Law                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Senate Committee Passes Press Shield Law    Leahy Forges Bipartisan Consensus      Sending Bill To Senate Floor        WASHINGTON  Thursday  Oct  4   The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday     passed bipartisan legislation to establish a federal qualified     reporters privilege law to protect and encourage the exchange of     information between journalists and confidential sources in defense of     the publics right to know  The panel approved the Free Flow of     Information Act  S  2035  Thursday morning in a vote of 15 to 2      Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   shepherded the legislation to a     strong bipartisan consensus through lengthy negotiations and then     through two weeks of intensive debate among committee members  Dozens of     media organizations across the country support the legislation      including the Vermont Press Association  the New England Press     Association  the Associated Press  the American Society of Newspaper     Editors  The New York Times Company  and The Washington Post      In a time when the publics right to know has often been under siege      the American people finally can celebrate some progress  said Leahy      Through arduous and exacting negotiations  we have produced a consensus     Free Flow of Information Act that takes careful and tangible steps to     help ensure a free and vibrant press      A companion bill is making its way through the House of Representatives      The legislation will       Establish a federal qualified reporters privilege to protect and     encourage the free flow of information between journalists and     confidential sources       Reconcile a reporters need to maintain confidentiality    in order to     ensure that sources will speak openly and freely    with the publics     right to effective law enforcement and fair trials       Balances the public interest in combating crime and protecting     national security and the public interest in ensuring a free and vibrant     press by providing that a federal court can only force a journalist to     reveal confidential source information when the information is truly     crucial to a case or investigation       Requires the party seeking a reporter s confidential information to     exhaust all reasonable alternative sources before turning to the media       Contains exceptions to the privilege for those situations where     information sharing is critical  For example  a reporter may not     withhold source information where such information is needed to prevent     a terrorist attack  significant harm to our national security  death      kidnapping  or substantial bodily harm  Journalists who witness crimes     also cannot refuse to share their eyewitness observations       Defines journalist to include anyone who regularly engages in     journalistic activities    so that legitimate bloggers that disseminate     information about matters of public interest are covered by the     qualified privilege    Leahys statement follows      Statement of Chairman Patrick Leahy    Senate Judiciary Committee    Executive Business Meeting October 4  2007        Today  the Committee returns to complete its consideration of the     bipartisan bill to establish a statutory privilege to safeguard the     freedom of the press  I first gave notice that we would be considering     the Free Flow of Information Act back on September 12  We were finally     able to begin marking up that measure last Thursday  We did make some     progress last week adopting amendments offered by Senator Specter      Senator Feinstein  Senator Brownback and Senator Kyl  I hope and trust     that we can complete our consideration today and move forward on this     important matter      As I noted last week  we now have Senator Specter  Senator Schumer      Senator Lugar  Senator Dodd  Senator Graham and me all uniting to     cosponsor a version of the Free Flow of Information Act that is fair      that is balanced and that is bipartisan  It would create as a matter of     federal law a qualified privilege for journalists to protect the     identity of their confidential sources  with certain exceptions  In so     doing  we would be following the lead of 33 States and the District of     Columbia  which have shield laws that protect journalists from     disclosing their confidential sources  and many other States  including     Vermont  which recognize a common law reporters privilege      Sadly  the press has become the first stop  rather than the stop of last     resort  for our government and private litigants when it comes to     seeking information  And  this trend can have a chilling effect on the     press and the publics right to know       When he testified before this Committee in favor of a federal shield law     in 2005  William Safire told us that the essence of newsgathering is     this  if you dont have sources you trust and who trust you  then you     dont have a solid story  and the public suffers for it       Bill Safire is exactly right  We simply have no idea how many newsworthy     stories have gone unwritten and unreported out of fear that a reporter     would be forced to reveal a source  or face jail time  We also do not     know how many potential whistleblowers  or other confidential sources      have chosen to remain silent  out of fear that a journalist could be     compelled to disclose their identity  Just recently  investigative     journalism and confidential sources have helped uncover significant     government failures in Iraq and in New Orleans  as well as government     neglect at the Walter Reed Medical Center       Still  as a former prosecutor  I also understand the importance of     making sure that the government can effectively investigate criminal     wrongdoing  combat terrorism and preserve national security  The     consensus federal shield legislation before the Committee today strikes     the proper balance among these important objectives  This bill addresses     the legitimate need for law enforcement to obtain information from     reporters to prevent a crime or a national security threat  In addition      by providing a qualified and not an absolute privilege to withhold the     identity of confidential sources  the bill also advances other important     law enforcement objectives  such as encouraging whistleblowers to     disclose fraud  waste and abuse that might otherwise go unreported      The belated opposition to this carefully crafted bill by the Department     of Justice and Office of the Director of National Intelligence is simply     misplaced  Although 49 states and several federal courts have recognized     a reporters privilege either by statute or common law for years  the     Department of Justice and the ODNI have not cited a single circumstance     where the privilege caused any harm to national security or to law     enforcement  In fact  the legitimate concerns about the need to     effectively combat crime and protect national security have been     adequately addressed in the bill and by amendments to this bill offered     several Senators Feinstein  Brownback and Kyl  I have received two     excellent letters from the Newspaper Association of America rebutting     the unfounded concerns raised by the Justice Department and the ODNI      and I will submit these letters for the record  I have also received a     letter of support for this bill from the Vermont and New England Press     Associations which I will also submit for the record      The Free Flow of Information Act is strongly supported by more than 50     news media and journalism organizations  including the National     Newspaper Association  the Coalition of Journalists for an Open     Government  the Magazine Publishers of America and the National Press     Club  The call for action extends to editorial pages across the country      including the Washington Post  Arizona Republic  Salt Lake Tribune  San     Francisco Chronicle and New York Times       I believe that the consensus Free Flow of Information Act takes     important steps to ensure a free and vibrant press  so that Americans     are informed about matters that affect their lives  The time for     needless delay of this legislation has passed  I urge all Members to     favorably report this bill today  so that it can be considered by the     full Senate
