       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Conservation Policy   Recommendations For The Farm Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Senate Committee On Agriculture  Nutrition  And Forestry   Hearing On   Conservation Policy Recommendations For The Farm Bill   May 1  2007   Mr  Chairman  thank you for    this opportunity to make a brief opening statement  The Judiciary Committee    is about to begin an important hearing on patent reform that I am Chairing    so I will not be able to stay for the full hearing this morning    The 2002 Farm Bill    represented a historic commitment to the conservation of Americas privately    owned farm and forest landscape  These heightened investments have begun to    make a real difference in rural America  In this 2007 Farm Bill I believe    we have an opportunity to build on the success of the 2002 Farm Bill to    ensure these programs have the additional resources needed and operate as    effectively as possible for Americas farmers and ranchers   In particular I would like to    highlight a few priorities that several of our witness will discuss in    greater detail  The boost in funding working lands conservation programs    including the Environmental Quality Incentives program  the Wildlife Habitat    Incentives Program  the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program and the    Agriculture Management Assistance Program  and the Regional Equity    requirement  has been particularly helpful to producers in Vermont and    elsewhere  I hope we can continue to provide additional funding for these    programs and expand the Regional Equity requirements this year    In addition I believe this    Farm Bill presents a unique opportunity to expand USDAs working lands    conservation programs to ensure private forested landowners have access to    these successful conservation programs   Finally there are new    exciting opportunities for this reauthorization  such as developing an    organic conversion program within the conservation title to provide needed    technical and financial assistance for producers seeking to transition to    organic production   Mr  Chairman  again thank you    again for extending me this time  I believe we went a long way with the    passage of the 2002 Farm Bill  and with your leadership we can build on    earlier successes to redouble our commitment to conservation programs in the    2007 Farm Bill
