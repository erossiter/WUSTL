       Leahy Reaction To Department Of Justice s IG OPR Expanding Internal   Probe Of U S  Attorneys To Include Politicization Of Hiring Practices Within   Department                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy Reaction To     Department Of Justice s    IG OPR Expanding Internal Probe Of U S  Attorneys    To Include Politicization Of Hiring Practices Within Department    The Department of     Justices Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional     Responsibility sent the attached letter to the Senate Judiciary     Committee today  notifying the Chairman and Ranking Member that the     offices are expanding their investigation related to the firings of     several U S  Attorneys to include improper considerations in DOJs     hiring of career employees  The letter is available as a       Below is a comment     from Chairman Leahy on the expansion of the internal investigation       Comment Of Sen  Patrick     Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On DOJs OIG OPR Expanding U S  Attorney Probe     To Include Politicization Of Hiring Practices Within DOJ    May 30  2007 These     are serious revelations that reinforce the need for meaningful     congressional oversight of this Justice Department and the Bush     Administration   It is     deeply troubling that the crisis of leadership at the Department allowed     the White House and others to wield political influence over key law     enforcement decisions and hiring policies  It is unacceptable that a     senior Justice Department official was allowed to screen career     employees and some judicial appointments for political loyalty  and it     confirms our worst fears about the unprecedented and improper reach of     politics into the Departments professional ranks  I     look forward to the results of the Inspector Generals investigation      and as Congress continues its oversight into the politicization of the     Justice Department it is abundantly clear that we must do all we can to     get to the truth behind this matter and the role the White House played     in it
