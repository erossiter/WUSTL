       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On President Bush s Signing Of The Secure   Fence Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On President Bushs Signing Of The Secure Fence Act Of 2006    October 26  2006 I share the disappointment of tens of millions of Americans who     hoped the President would have exercised his constitutional authority to     veto this costly  cobbled together and mean spirited law  The     President seems to have abandoned his principles in signing the Secure     Fence Act  given his previous support for fair comprehensive immigration     reform  This bill is neither fair nor comprehensive  It will     cost between  2 billion and  9 billion and fail to perform as advertised     to seal our 2 000 mile southern border with a 700 mile fence  It     is a pricey bumper sticker law passed to curry favor before the     midterm elections and timed by Congressional Republicans and the White     House to achieve maximum impact  That this President    who speaks     about the need for comprehensive immigration reform and who came to     office as a former Governor of the State of Texas    would abandon his     principles and endorse this crass political ploy is disappointing and     wrong   The President has said many times that in order for the United     States to achieve real security  we must have comprehensive immigration     reform  which must include a realistic solution to bring out of the     shadows the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country and to     meet the pressing needs of employers for willing workers along with     border security  In numerous statements  including a speech in     Mission  Texas  in August 2006  he recognized that without all     components of comprehensive reform working together  immigration reform     will not work  In addition  his Secretary of Homeland Security has     not recommended wasting these billions of dollars to construct a     700 mile fence along our 2 000 mile southern border  To the     contrary  the recommendations of Secretary Chertoff for authority to     utilize barriers were followed and incorporated in S 2611  which     authorized 370 miles of fencing along the southern border      I will continue working to enact legislation that will secure     Americas borders  strengthen our economy and bring about a realistic     solution to the millions of people who want to work and live legally in     our country  I will continue to support fair and comprehensive     immigration reform and to respect the dignity of those who seek to join     mainstream American society and to better their lives in the United     States  Scarring our southwestern landscape with a symbol of fear      pandering and intolerance offends the great heritage of our Nation while     sending the wrong message to our neighbors and to the world about     American values
