       Senate Panel Unanimously Okays USA PATRIOT Act Renewal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Senate Panel Unanimously Okays USA      PATRIOT Act Renewal  Leahy Reforms Shed      Sunshine On Use of Powers      Including Govt  Searches Of Library  Medical Records WASHINGTON       Thursday  July 21   The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously      approved a bill Thursday that would reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act       including renewing key sunset provisions and bolstering checks and      balances over the governments use of powers granted under the      sweeping anti terror law   The bill      reauthorizes key sunset provisions originally authored by Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   with former House Majority Leader Richard      Armey  R Texas   which they included in the USA PATRIOT Act  enacted      just weeks after the attacks of September 11  2001  Leahy  now the      ranking Democratic member of the panel  led the Senates      negotiations with the White House in drafting the original USA      PATRIOT Act  as then chairman of the Judiciary Committee  The      reauthorization bill also contains new features authored by Leahy      that would require the government to report how it uses its      authority to obtain citizens library and medical records and in      other forms of domestic surveillance  The new      sunshine reporting requirements  along with the key sunset      provisions that we renew  add up to greater accountability  said      Leahy  This would help restore public confidence in how these laws      are being used  Below is      Leahys statement from todays Judiciary Committee voting session       followed by a fact sheet outlining highlights of the bill                Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee on the Judiciary     Executive Business Meeting     USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization Bill Markup  Opening The PATRIOT Act     To More Sunshine And Accountability     July 21  2005 We are      approaching the fourth anniversary of the horrific attacks of      September 11  2001  Nearly 3 000 lives were lost that morning  and      our lives as Americans changed in an instant  In the aftermath of      the attacks  Congress moved quickly  some have said too quickly         to pass new antiterrorism legislation  The fires were still      smoldering at Ground Zero when the USA PATRIOT Act became law on      October 30  2001  just six weeks after the attacks  Many of us here      contributed to the PATRIOT Act  We worked together in a spirit of      bipartisan unity and resolve to craft a bill that we hoped would      make us safer as a Nation  Freedom and security are always in      tension in our society  and especially so in those somber weeks      after the attacks  but we tried our best to strike the right      balance  I negotiated      many of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act myself and am gratified to      have been able to add several checks and balances that were not      contained in the initial proposal  As I said at the time  however       this was not the final bill that I  or any of the sponsors  would      have written if compromise had been unnecessary   In the final      negotiating session  former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I      insisted that we add sunset provisions for certain domestic      surveillance powers that have some of the greatest potential to      affect the civil liberties of the American people  These sunset      provisions had positive results  The sunsets are the reason why      this Committee and others have been re examining the PATRIOT Act and      considering modifications  with the experience of the past few years      to guide us  They have prompted a healthy and constructive national      dialogue about the proper limits of governmental power  And the      sunsets explain why we were finally able to pry some information out      of the Department of Justice  after many years of stonewalling  Legitimate      concerns and questions have been raised about various powers granted      by the PATRIOT Act  not so much for how they have been used  but for      how they could be used  and for the cloak of the secrecy under which      they operate  Many of us on the Committee have been working on ways      to improve the law  I worked with Chairman Specter for months on      draft legislation that became the basis for S 1389  Apparently  the      Department of Justice objected to some of our language  I regret      that our negotiations were cut short  but I understand that the      Chairman was pressed to introduce a bill last week so that we could      report legislation to the full Senate before the August recess  The bill before      us proposes some modest improvements in the law  while making the      PATRIOT Act largely permanent  Given the benefits of the PATRIOT      Act sunset mechanism  I had urged the Chairman to extend some of the      expiring provisions for another four years rather than making them      permanent  I am pleased that S 1389 does this with respect to three      provisions  but I believe we should maintain the sunset on other      provisions as well  I am also concerned that S 1389 would repeal a      sunset provision that Congress enacted just last year and that is      not due to expire until the end of 2006  One of my      principle objectives as we have drafted this reauthorization bill is      to introduce more sunshine into the PATRIOT Act  The bill retains      most of the new sunshine provisions that I had insisted upon      including in our earlier draft  for which I commend him  I am      particularly pleased that portions of the Domestic Surveillance      Oversight Act  which I introduced with Senators Grassley and Specter      in the last Congress  survived the final cut  In addition          Section 3 requires the      Department of Justice to report periodically on the use of PATRIOTs      roving wiretap authority           Section 5 requires reporting      on the use of PATRIOTs good faith emergency exception to the Stored      Communications Act           Section 6 requires detailed      public reporting on the use of sneak and peak warrant authority               Section 8 requires public      reporting on the use of national security orders to obtain library       medical  and other sensitive records  and          Section 11 requires reporting      on the use of certain emergency authorities  I regret that      in the final round of negotiations  important provisions of the bill      were struck  The bill as introduced made modest improvements to the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA  pen register law       allowing the court to consider the facts in support of the      governments application  instead of operating as a powerless      rubberstamp  A bipartisan working group that included some of      PATRIOTS staunchest defenders supported a reform  But it was      apparently too much for the Department to swallow  Another modest      provision requiring notice to the court when intercepted      communications are shared with the intelligence community was also      removed from the bill  Why  I do not know  as the Department has      expressed no concerns with a parallel provision relating to grand      jury information  which we passed as part of the PATRIOT Act  On a more      positive note  the final package does include some important new      civil liberties protections  including a presumptive seven day time      limit on sneak and peak search warrants   something I advocated for      in the original PATRIOT Act negotiations  The substitute amendment      also addresses the concerns of librarians and other Americans who      felt that the PATRIOT Act made it too easy for the government to      access records containing sensitive and highly personal information  Like the      PATRIOT Act itself  this is not the bill that I  or anyone here       would have written if compromise were unnecessary  Americans can      feel confident that through our bipartisan efforts  we have moved      the law in the right direction  It is my hope that the      bipartisanship that allowed us to reach this point will carry over      to the floor and speed this bill to final passage                   HIGHLIGHTS OF S 1389 AS VOTED OUT OF COMMITTEE The bill protects the privacy interests of      Americans   It requires the government to convince a      judge that a person is connected to terrorism or espionage before      obtaining their library records  medical records or other sensitive      personal information    It requires the government to notify the      target of a sneak and peek search within seven days  instead of      the undefined delay that is currently permitted by the PATRIOT Act   It prohibits the issuance of John Doe      roving wiretaps  which identify neither the person nor the place to      be surveilled  The bill enhances judicial oversight and      protects free speech rights    It gives the recipient of an order for      sensitive personal information the right to challenge the order in      court on the same grounds as they could challenge a grand jury      subpoena   It provides a right to challenge the gag      order that currently prevents people who receive a request for      records from speaking out even if they feel the government is      violating their rights  The bill increases transparency and ensures      accountability   It requires increased reporting by the      Department of Justice on its use of several PATRIOT Act powers       including roving wiretaps  business record orders  and sneak and      peak search warrants   It sets a 4 year sunset on three domestic      surveillance powers with great potential to affect civil liberties         roving wiretaps  business record orders  and lone wolf      surveillances
