       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Amendment  3063 To The Budget   Resolution Restoring Funds For The Community Development Block Grant Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                        Statement Of Sen           Patrick Leahy          On Amendment   3063 To The Budget Resolution                     Restoring Funds For The Community Development Block          Grant Program           March 15  2006   Mr  President  it is          regrettable  and it is frustrating  that once again          we find ourselves having to speak out on the          shortfalls in the budget resolution for key          community and economic development programs  The          budget before us slashes Federal assistance to          distressed and underserved communities  These cuts          are shortsighted  they are ill advised  and they          represent a significant retreat from our long          standing commitment to invest in our nations          communities    In just a few weeks          the Senate will again be asked to appropriate tens          of billions more to help Iraq  Though the          Presidents request for Iraq funds is once again off          the budget so that it avoids our normal budget          rules  the Iraq supplemental funding request once          again is for real taxpayers dollars  no less real          than the domestic cuts that the Bush Cheney budget          proposes for the priorities of the American people          here at home    That is why I am          proud to join Senators Murray and Sarbanes  as well          as 14 more of our colleagues  17 of us in all  in          offering an amendment to the FY07 budget resolution          to provide for an increase of  1 3 billion to          restore the Community Development Block Grants  or          CDBG  to the FY04 level of  4 3 billion  We fully          pay for the increase in funds by closing egregious          tax loopholes that more than 90 members of this          chamber have already gone on record in support of          closing    Our amendment is          supported by those who know best how effective and          important this program is to Americas communities           The list of endorsements includes the National          Association of Counties  the National League of          Cities  the National Conference of Black Mayors  the          National Association of Local Housing Finance          Agencies  the National Association for County          Community and Economic Development  the National          Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials           the Council of State Community Development Agencies           and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation  I          ask unanimous consent that a letter from these          groups in support of our amendment be included in          the Record    The CDBG Program is          the centerpiece of the Federal governments efforts          to help states and localities meet the needs of          low income communities  CDBG funds vital housing          rehabilitation  supportive services  public          improvements and economic development projects in          communities across the nation  It serves more than          1 100 entitlement communities  urban counties and          states  and more than 3 000 rural communities           These investments help change the face of our          communities for the better and help improve the          standards of living of Americans across the Nation           right where they live  in their communities    CDBG is one of the          most effective Federal domestic programs helping to          revitalize neighborhoods  and it has a proven record          of results  For example  in 2005 Vermont used CDBG          grants to rehabilitate 771 units of affordable          housing and to help create or preserve more than 500          jobs  directly helping to raise the standard of in          Vermonts communities    There are hundreds of          similar stories across the Nation  but in each of          them the message is the same  CDBG funds are          critical building blocks for improving our          communities  our neighborhoods and our economy    The CDBG formula          allocation was  4 41 billion in 2001  Since then it          has decreased by  670 million  or 15 2 percent  with          a five percent cut in FY05 and a 10 percent cut in          FY06  The budget resolution for the coming year          would further reduce the formula funding by 25          percent  cutting the formula allocation by over a          third in just three years  Communities that benefit          from CDBG will be devastated if further cuts in          funding are made to this program    I recently led a          bipartisan letter with Senator Coleman to the Budget          Committee attesting to the effectiveness of CDBG and          urging that it be funded at  4 3 billion in the          coming fiscal year  Fifty three members of the          Senate from both sides of the aisle joined me in          this letter  which I would like to submit for the          Record    I want to take a          moment to explain the differences between the          Murray Sarbanes Leahy CDBG amendment and the          amendment offered by Senators Santorum and Coleman           The amendment we offer facilitates restoring these          CDBG funds by increasing the budget cap by closing          tax loopholes that the Senate has already supported          closing  in previous votes  This  in turn  makes          real money available to the Appropriations Committee          to be able to spend for next year    Increasing the cap is          important  because the budget resolution we are          considering assumes domestic spending will be capped          at the same level as the Presidents request           Simply put  the budget resolution assumes that          funding for CDBG will be reduced by the same amount          as the president has proposed  which would be a cut          of  1 billion from FY06 levels    A separate amendment          offered by our colleagues  Senator Santorum and          Senator Coleman  also supports an increase of          funding for CDBG  but it would do so by asking the          Appropriations Committee to impose across the board          cuts on all other domestic programs    Speaking as an          appropriator  I can tell you that all their          amendment will do if it passes is to tell the          Appropriations Committee that the Senate supports          CDBG  But that will not be enough to guarantee that          the Committee will hear and provide the          Transportation Treasury HUD  TTHUD  Appropriations          Subcommittee with a higher allocation to increase          funding for CDBG    My colleagues should          note that the Santorum Coleman amendment is the same          as the CDBG amendment that passed last year           However  because it provided no additional funding          to the Appropriations Committee  the TTHUD          Subcommittee received an allocation that was          inadequate to fund all of the programs within its          jurisdiction  CDBG was the program that was on the          chopping block  suffering cuts of more than  400          million    So  if my colleagues          want to simply signal their support for CDBG funding          to the Appropriations Committee  then they should          vote for the Santorum Coleman message amendment           Unfortunately  if they choose to do that and that          amendment passes at the expense of our amendment           they will find that when it comes time to write the          TTHUD Appropriations bill  they will have failed to          protect this important program from further cuts    The choice is clear           Those who want to vaguely express support for the          CDBG program can support the other amendment  which          is a nice sentiment  like a Candygram  But for          those who also really want to get the job done  I          urge support of our amendment     I challenge each          member to go back to their states and to take stock          of the benefits that communities have reaped through          CDBG investments  I challenge each member to visit          with their local community action groups and hear          how they use the Community Services Block Grant to          support the neediest in their communities  These          programs fill a real need and have proven results    A cut of  1 billion          in federal funds  which is proposed in this budget          resolution  will result in the loss of at least  9          billion in matching funds from local and state          governments and non profit and private sector          investments  I fail to see the wisdom in          dismantling programs that are so vital to our          communities    I encourage my          colleagues to join me in support of the          Murray Sarbanes Leahy amendment and express their          real support for these important programs
