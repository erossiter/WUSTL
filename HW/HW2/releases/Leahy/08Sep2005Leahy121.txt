       Leahy Steps Up Push To Repeal Controversial Mercury Pollution Rule                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Steps Up      Push To Repeal Controversial Mercury Pollution Rule      Senate Vote Looms Next Week   Below are the      remarks of Sen  Patrick Leahy from a news conference today       Thursday  on the Leahy Collins resolution to repeal the Bush      Administrations controversial EPA rule on mercury pollution       Repeal of the rule would force EPA to follow the more stringent      terms of the Clean Air Act  Leahy is using the Congressional Review      Act  CRA  in his bid to repeal the rule  This will be only the      third time in its history that CRA has been used in an effort to      repeal a federal agency regulation  The Senate vote may happen on      Monday  The 60 day  Senate Legislative Days  clock for bringing the      Leahy Collins resolution to a Senate vote runs out on Monday  but      Leahy is working with Senate leaders on the possibility of obtaining      unanimous consent in the Senate to extend that deadline by a few      days  Leahys bipartisan resolution is cosponsored by Sen  Susan      Collins  R Maine   Sen  James Jeffords  I Vt    and by 31 other      senators  total of 34  with additional senators indicating support      but not cosponsoring   The abstract of a new peer reviewed study      about the connection between mercury pollution and mental      retardation  as well as an estimate of costs to the U S  economy of      this connection  was also released today at the news conference and      is available on request and is posted on the Leahy website  leahy senate gov          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On S J  Res  20  A Resolution To Disapprove     The Administrations Mercury Rule      September 8  2005 If we ever wondered what a mercury pollution      rule would look like if it were written by the polluters  now we      know  This is pretty much it  Given the trust that people have      justifiably had in the Environmental Protection Agency since its      creation during the Nixon Administration  it is sad  and it is      appalling  to see how the agency has been captured by polluting      special interests in decisions on limiting mercury pollution  And it is regrettable that the American people      and many of their representatives in Congress have been forced to      the conclusion that the mercury rule has been so mishandled and so      co opted by special interests that this rare effort to override this      rule has become necessary  But it has become necessary  And in the      coming days the United States Senate will have a choice to make      about the future of toxic mercury pollution     Do we follow the Bush Administration  and the      well funded special interests who are creating most of this mercury      pollution  in taking several steps backward  forcing the American      people to wait at least another decade before cleaning up the toxic      mercury that is spewing out of old dirty power plants across the      country   Do we allow this new rule to let toxic mercury         a substance so harmful that it causes birth defects  IQ loss and      mental retardation  continue to poison children and pregnant women       while costing taxpayers billions in healthcare costs  Shouldnt the      proliferation of warnings that our states and the federal government      have had to give to sportsmen and women and to the general public      about the consumption of fish  fish caught in our own waters    be      enough to shame our government into action  Do we allow this rule to move forward when      EPAs own Inspector General has said it does not comply with EPA and      Executive Order requirements  And when the General Accountability      Office has said there are major shortcomings in the economic      analysis  Or do we uphold the bipartisan work that      produced the Clean Air Act  protect the health of pregnant women and      children  and begin now to clean up the toxic mercury emissions      now   Instead of working to enforce and implement the      Clean Air Act  as two previous Administrations had  the Bush      Administration has turned the Clean Air Act on its head  With this      rule the Administration revokes an earlier EPA finding that it is      necessary and appropriate to require that each power plant apply      technology to reduce mercury emissions   Although I am somewhat impressed that they can      make this statement with straight faces  I am appalled at their      audacious disregard for the health of the American people  and  like      the scientific community  I am baffled by their gymnastic arguments       This rule is all the more shameful because the      evidence of public health and environmental damage from mercury and      other toxics is clear enough for action right now  Look at EPAs      own estimate of the number of newborns at risk of elevated mercury      exposure  which has doubled to 630 000  EPA also found that one in      six pregnant women has mercury levels in her blood above EPAs safe      threshold   And today we will hear about a new      peer reviewed study by the Mount Sinai School of Medicines Center      for Childrens Health and the Environment  which concludes that our      country loses two billions dollars each year from the impact of      mercury on childrens brain development  Yet it seems that many in      Congress have wanted to join the Administration in trying to avoid      any public daylight on this flawed rule  At a minimum  our effort      will open this issue to some sunshine   One reason for the Administrations lack of      candor clearly is the discovery that this rule has polluting      industries fingerprints all over it  EPAs first proposal for      these rules lifted exact texts from memoranda provided by utility      industry lobbyists   For all their talk of family values  the      Administration has again put the value of corporate contributions         not families    first  It is not a family value to tell a whole      generation of women that their health is not important  It is not a      family value to put another generation of young kids at risk of      learning disabilities  These mercury rules do just that  It is time to put people first  and to stop      letting the big polluters and the special interests write the rules      and run the show over at EPA  The people we represent in the United States      Senate will be watching the choice that the Senate    and we as      individual senators    will make in this vote  Will we side with      the people  or with the polluters  This rule would leave mercury pollution from      power plants  the largest emitter of mercury in the United States       as the only source of toxic air pollution that is allowed to avoid      rigorous emissions standards under the Clean Air Act  That is a      daily  tangible and dangerous risk to the health of the American      people that we need not  and we should not  accept   The Administrations mercury rule is a danger      to Americas women and children  It is time to do it over  and to      get it right
