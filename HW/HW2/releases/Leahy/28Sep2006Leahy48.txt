       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  FY 2007 Department Of Defense   Appropriations Conference Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     FY 2007 Department Of Defense Appropriations Conference Report    September 28  2006 Mr  President  the Senate is poised to approve the     FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations conference report  Like     past Defense Appropriations bills  there are things in this bill that I     support and there are others that I disagree with  Without taking much     of the Senates time today I want to mention one small but very     important provision in this bill   Section 9012 of the conference report states that     no funds shall be made available for the establishment of permanent U S      military bases in Iraq or to exercise U S  control over any oil resource     of Iraq  This language  which was sponsored by Senator Biden and which     I strongly support  provides an important signal to the Iraqi people and     to the sovereign government of Iraq that it is not the intent of the     United States to control or maintain a permanent military presence in     their country  It is especially important in light of the recent     surveys which indicate that a significant majority of Iraqis want United     States military forces to withdraw from their country   For many Vermonters and for people around the world     who have concerns and suspicions about the Bush Administrations     intentions in Iraq  this makes clear that regardless of the     disagreements among us over the continued deployment of U S  troops in     Iraq we agree that they are not there to establish permanent bases or to     control Iraqi oil resources   I yield the floor
