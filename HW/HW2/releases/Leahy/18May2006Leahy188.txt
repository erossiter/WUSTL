       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Inhofe Amendment To Make English The   Official Language                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statements Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     For The Salazar Amendment     On English As The Nations Common Language      And Against the Inhofe Amendment     On English As The Official Language    Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      In Support Of The Salazar Amendment      On English As The Nations Common Language       To S 2611  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act      May 18  2006  I thank the Senator from Colorado      for his amendment  He is a Senator who continues to demonstrate his      interest and ability in bringing us together rather than seeking to      drive wedges between us  We can all agree that English should be the      common language of the United States  His is a good suggestion for      an alternative that I will support  In many local communities and      States it may well be useful and helpful for the government to reach      out to language minorities  Greater participation and information      are good things  We should not be mandating artificial and      shortsighted restrictions on State and local government   I have spoken in the course of this      debate about my belief that immigrants should learn the English      language  In my experience  most new Americans want to learn our      language and make efforts to do so as quickly as possible  The bill      that we are debating calls for immigrants to learn English as one      the several steps they must take before they can earn citizenship       I certainly understand why the      Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund  the Asian      American Justice Center  the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights       the National Council of La Raza  the National Association of Latino      Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund and others have      been concerned about the Inhofe amendment  I share their concerns  I      strongly support the efforts of the Senator from Colorado to find a      common ground to unite us rather than divide us and strongly support      his alternative amendment               Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      On Inhofe Amendment SA3996  To Make English As The Official Language          To S 2611  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act      May 18  2006   I have spoken several times in the      course of this debate about my belief that immigrants should learn      the English language  In my experience  most new Americans want to      learn our language and make efforts to do so as quickly as possible       The bill that we are debating calls for immigrants to learn English      as one of the several steps they must take before they can earn      citizenship   We can all agree that English      should be the common language of the United States  but by making      English the national language  the Inhofe amendment goes too far       The amendment was modified to remove a ban on publishing official      documents in any language but English  That was a good correction       In many local communities and States it may well be useful and      helpful for the government to reach out to language minorities       Greater participation and information are good things  We should not      be mandating artificial and shortsighted restrictions on State and      local government   I regret  however  that the      amendment continues to include language that strongly discourages      the use of other languages to inform residents and continues to      treat those who speak another language as second class citizens  We      would do better to recognize our diversity and provide greater      opportunities for those for whom English is a second language to      become more fluent   Information is vital and sometimes      lives depend on it  Is it not in the interests of all Americans to      have every member of our society as well informed on matters of      health  safety and our democracy as possible  Do we really want to      restrict government publications and communications  such as those      on disaster preparedness  public health concerns  if there is an      avian flu pandemic  to English only  We have recently seen the      extensive and effective reach of Spanish radio in this country       Would we not want to employ that resource in a crisis  Do we really      want to tie our hands and require Congress to pass a special statute      every time health and safety materials  for example  would be      useful   We already have statutes that call      for bilingual election materials to assist language minorities in      accordance with our commitment to making participation in voting      fair and meaningful  We know that there are many circumstances in      which effective access to information requires communications in      many ways and many languages  Would it not have been useful for the      President to try to sell and explain the Medicare drug benefit plan      with all its complications and permutations in many languages in      order to reach the most possible beneficiaries  Do we really intend      to require such obviously beneficial actions to need a special      statutory authorization  Should we review agency requirements to      take warnings in languages other than English off our airlines and      automobiles and dangerous equipment  Are we going to stop providing      court translators and require all court proceedings  which are      themselves official government proceedings  to occur in English       only to the detriment of fairness and justice  Are we going to go      back into the Congressional Record and scrub the statements of      Senators Martinez and others who have used Spanish here on the      floor  If I recall correctly  the Senator from Oklahoma has spoken      on this floor in Spanish  Would this amendment make his use of      Spanish illegal    or does the Constitutions speech and debate      clause mean that the rule that he is asking us to adopt applies to      everyone else but not to Senators   It was only a few weeks ago that we      worked together to adopt the Alexander amendment to S 2454  the      immigration bill we debated in April  The text of Senator      Alexanders amendment is included in S 2611  the bill before us now       The Alexander amendment created a grant program to promote the      integration of immigrants into our democracy by teaching civics       history and the English language  That is the right approach for      America to take  The Inhofe amendment takes the opposite approach       the wrong approach and has the effect of stigmatizing those who grew      up where Spanish or Chinese or other great languages were spoken  It      risks driving a wedge between communities  This is contrary to our      values and what we should be seeking to accomplish with this      important legislation   I recognize that not every State is      like my home State of Vermont  where the majority of residents speak      English  Even in my State  however  there are many families who      first came to America speaking only French  My wifes first language      as a little girl was French  In prior generations  we welcomed large      groups of Irish  Italians  Eastern Europeans  and in recent years       immigrants and refugees from Africa  Asia and many other parts of      the world  I agree with the Senator from South Carolina who spoke      earlier on this amendment and lamented that more of us do not speak      more languages in this increasing interdependent world  I wish my      French were better  I wish my Latin were more polished  I wish I      knew more than a few words and phrases in Chinese and Spanish       On Monday night  the President      spoke eloquently about the need to help newcomers assimilate and      embrace our common identity  He spoke of civility and respect for      others and said that Americans are bound together by our shared      ideals  These are the messages we must send to the American people       not the divisive message of the Inhofe amendment   I look around this Senate chamber      and engraved in the wall behind the elevated desk and chair of the      President of the Senate are the words E Pluribus Unum  Every      school child is taught that expression  out of many  one and what      it means to our shared value of being the United States of America       It points to an important value from our history and today  It      points to our struggle to become a nation of many people  of many      States  and of many faiths  What is wrong with our using Latin  as      we traditionally have and expression our unity   Latin expressions mark our official      currency and the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States  The      phrases annuit coeptis and novus ordo seclorum are part of the      official symbols of the United States  These expressions are traced      back to Virgil and a line from his instruction for farmers  which      seeks the favor of God or Providence for our great endeavor to      create a nation unlike any that had come before  The second Latin      phrase is another allusion to Virgil and notes our seeking a new      order   Our incorporation of languages      other than English does not stop there  Take a look at the flag of      the Connecticut with the phrase Qui transtulit sustinet  the flag      for Idaho that includes the phrase Esto perpetua  the Kansas flag      that includes the phrase ad astra per aspera  the Maine flag that      includes Dirigo  the Massachusetts flag that includes the phrase      Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem  the Michigan flag      includes not only e pluribus unum but also Circumspice  Si      quaeris peninsulam amoenam and Tuebor  the Missouri flag includes      the phrase Salus populi suprema lex esto  the flag of New York      includes the expression Excelsior  the Virginia flag includes the      phrase Sic semper tyrannis  the flag of West Virginia includes the      phrase Montani semper liberi  and the Wisconsin flag also includes      the phrase e pluribus unum  Of course the flag of Minnesota      includes a French language phrase befitting its history  Letoile      du Nord   Do we in this Senate mean to demand      that the States change their State flags and State mottos to      eliminate Latin and French  Do we really mean to frown on their use       Or is it only Spanish  a language derived from Latin that we wish to      denigrate  In that case  I remind the Senate that the State of      Montana includes on its flag the phrase oro y plata  a Spanish      phrase that serves as the State motto gold and silver  I remember      how silly we looked a couple of years ago when some in the House      demanded that French fries be renamed freedom fries  Does this      prohibition apply to Roman numerals  such as those included on the      flag of Missouri  Does this body intend to embark down that road  I      hope not  I pray not
