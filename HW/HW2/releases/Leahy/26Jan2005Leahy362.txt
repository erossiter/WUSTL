       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Condoleezza Rice                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Nomination Of Condoleezza Rice        January 26  2005  I am glad that we have had a few more days to consider and hours to         discuss this nomination  Some have suggested that we should have simply         voice voted Dr  Rices nomination so she could be confirmed in time for         the Inauguration  Senators are here to advise and consent  not rubber         stamp for the White Houses convenience   We needed this extra time for debate  The Secretary of State is the        chief foreign policy advisor to the President and fourth in the line of        Presidential succession  And  like some other Senators  I was disappointed        by Dr  Rices testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee last week         I had hoped that her testimony would demonstrate the kind of forthright         objective analysis that I believe we need in a Secretary of State         Unfortunately  it did not  I share the serious concerns expressed by        Senator Boxer and Senator Kerry  and I commend them and other Senators for        voicing them  I have not been impressed with Dr  Rices performance as National        Security Advisor  Strong leadership  openness  and sound judgment have been        far less evident at the National Security Council during her tenure than I        would have liked   I also believe that she has not always been forthright with Congress or        the American people  She contributed to the exaggerated public statements         false information in the Presidents State of the Union speech about Iraqs        supposed attempts to acquire nuclear material  and the selective        declassification of intelligence  which helped to create an atmosphere of        hysteria that led us into war in Iraq  She and others created the false         the false  impression that Iraq posed an imminent threat the United        States   These were serious failures  made worse by Dr  Rices unwavering        advocacy and support for the Administrations policies that have cost the        lives of over 1 300 American soldiers and an estimated 100 000 Iraqis  many        of them noncombatants   It has alienated our friends and allies and convinced many of the        worlds Muslims that we are at war with Islam itself  It led to the        atrocities at Abu Ghraib  It has added  200 billion to the federal deficit        and at the rate we are going that is only a down payment  There are now 150 000 American troops  many of them National Guard and        Reserve  bogged down in an unwinnable war in Iraq that has become a haven        for terrorists   Yet  Dr  Rice refuses to own up to the Administrations failures  When        confronted with her own glaringly inconsistent statements regarding weapons        of mass destruction which were the primary justification for the war  she        responded that the question unfairly impugned her integrity  She had an opportunity to reassure her detractors  and believe me there        are many in my state of Vermont  when she testified last week  She declined        to do so  and that was disappointing and frustrating to those of us who        want her to succeed in her new position  My vote in favor of Dr  Rice is difficult to explain  It is more the        product of a belief than a cold analysis of her record  I believe that Dr         Rice is capable of learning from her mistakes and changing her ways  That        she will rise to this new challenge  That she can be a good Secretary of        State   The other major reason I am voting in favor of Dr  Rices nomination is        that I am the Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee  In        this capacity  I have a responsibility to work with the Secretary of State         on a daily basis  to tackle a full range of international issues critical        to the United States and the rest of the world  AIDS and other global        health issues  human rights  the United Nations  terrorism  the        environment  womens rights  poverty  corruption  To name just a few   By voting for Dr  Rices nomination  I am sending a clear message  I        want to get this important working relationship started on the right track         I hope that my vote will be a step towards a more constructive U S  foreign        policy  After all  it is these policies that ultimately impact the lives of        billions of people around the world   Mr  President  during the first term  the Bush Administration dug a deep        hole  relationships with our oldest allies are badly strained  Iraq is a        mess  our own country is badly divided   We need to come together as a Nation to deal with these and many other        problems  But  coming together does not mean ignoring valid criticism         embarking on a policy that pleases only one side of the aisle  and accusing        those opposed of being un American or un patriotic  Criticism and dissent        are the essence of democracy  the essence of patriotism   Coming together means genuine consultations with members of both        political parties  and policies which reflect a range of views even if they        do not fit into pre conceived ideologies   As I said  I hope that my vote here today will  in some small way  help        begin this process  I hope it will allow us to get back to the real        practice of the Vandenberg rule  that politics end at the waters edge         and away from the slash and burn politics practiced during the first term        of the Bush Administration   I hope that Dr  Rice will meet me half way  I want to work with her on        the many pressing issues that concern both Democrats and Republicans         including the issues of freedom and human rights that the President spoke        of in his inaugural address that are so important not only to Americans         but to people everywhere         I yield the floor
