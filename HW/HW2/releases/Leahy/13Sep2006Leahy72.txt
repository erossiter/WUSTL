       Judiciary Pael OK s NSA Bills                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Judiciary Panel OK s NSA Bills Democratic Backed Bill Only One To Win Bipartisan Support  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Sept  13           The Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday reported out three       bills relating to the Bush Administrations warrantless       surveillance program  with the only Democratic sponsored       measure winning bipartisan support    The only bill to win support from       both Republicans and Democrats on the panel       was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and       Enhancement Act  sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein  D Calif          The bill  S 3001  reaffirms Congresss oversight role in setting       parameters for wiretapping  while also providing reasonable new       authorities and flexibility to conduct surveillance on       terrorists  The bill protects Americans civil liberties while       making reasonable changes to ensure that the U S  intelligence       community can continue to operate and protect the nation with       the necessary FISA court oversight   The other two bills    one       sponsored by Chairman Arlen Specter  R Pa    and another by       Senator Mike DeWine  R Ohio    were reported out on party line       votes  Democratic members of the committee opposed these bills        citing concerns about the sweeping authorities they granted the       President and the federal government  without the proper checks       and balances provided by the courts and Congress     Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the       ranking Democratic member of the panel  supported the Feinstein       bill along with all Democratic members and two Republican       senators  Specter and Senator Lindsey Graham  R S C    Below       is Senator Leahys statement from the committees business       meeting     Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting      September 13  2006  Earlier this week  the Committee       held an important hearing on the Department of Justices policy       to coerce waivers of the attorney client privilege in various       settings  Erosion of the right to counsel undermines the       fairness of our criminal justice system for all Americans  Once       lost  this fundamental right would be hard to regain  Many       critics worry that the so called Thompson Memorandum and the       Justice Departments current practices are yet another example       of this Administrations tendency to overreach in asserting       Executive power without regard for the Constitution  the laws        and basic fairness  A growing number of critics of the Thompson       Memorandum  including former Reagan Attorney General Edwin       Meese  the U S  Chamber of Commerce  the American Bar       Association and the editorial board of  The Wall Street Journal       have expressed concern that the Departments policy is too heavy       handed  coercive and intimating    This Administration has taken       extraordinary steps to investigate and prosecute the press and       to intimidate the media  critics  and attorneys while it has       claimed unlimited privileges and unprecedented secrecy for       itself  The Chairman and I have worked together this week in our       latest effort at oversight  It is in that same spirit that I       wish we could take effective action and engage in effective       oversight of the unauthorized warrantless wiretapping program       that the Administration operated in secret for most of the last       five years    I have been attempting to clarify       the facts and the law relating to the Administrations       warrantless wiretapping program since it was first disclosed in       December 2005  During the ensuing eight months  we have made       numerous efforts to get straight answers from the Administration       regarding the nature  scope and purported legal basis of this       program  Our efforts were rebuffed by the most flagrant and       disrespectful stonewalling of any Administration that I have       seen in my 32 years in Congress   While refusing to answer even our       most basic questions about its secret spying program and its       purported legal justification  the Administration claimed that       Congress approved the program when it authorized the use of       military force in Afghanistanalthough Attorney General Gonzales       had to admit that this was an evolving rationale not present       at the time Congress considered its action  The Administration       claimed that even if they violated the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act  FISA   the Presidents powers and their view       of the unitary executive must trump the law and the authority       of Congress  Not since the rationalization of Richard Nixon for       actions during the White House horrors and Watergate scandal       have we heard such a claim  And  of course  the Administration       claimed it had all the authority it needed and no new       legislation was needed    Turning to the bill before us that       the Chairman negotiated with the White House  in my view it       contains several fundamental flaws    The bill makes compliance with        FISA entirely optional  and explicitly validates the        Presidents claim that he has unfettered authority to        wiretap Americans in the name of national security  In        other words  it suggests that FISA is unconstitutional  a        claim for which there is no judicial precedent and very        little academic support  and invites the President to        ignore it    The bill abandons the        traditional  case by case review contemplated by FISA and        introduces the concept of program warrants  If that novel        concept is constitutional  which I doubt    a single FISA        court judge could approve whole programs of electronic        surveillance that go far beyond the Presidents program          The bill immunizes from        prosecution anyone who breaks into a home or office in the        United States to search for foreign intelligence        information  if he is acting at the behest of the        President  I would have thought that electronic        surveillance is a large enough area to address in one bill         But apparently  the Administration was unwilling to address        electronic surveillance without also reaching for new powers        to break into Americans homes    And  the 16 pages of        fundamental revisions to FISA contained in Section 9 create        gaping loopholes in FISAs current court order requirement        by redefining key terms and making other changes      I was disappointed during the       Committees debate last week to witness Republican members close       their minds on these matters  It appears that no amount of       debate will make any difference and that no amendments will       garner a single Republican vote    I do not read the language of the       bill the Chairman negotiated with the White House the way that       he does    I suppose you could say that the       bill removes constraints on Executive powers rather than       creating entirely new powers  but that is semantics  The end       result is the same  this bill is all about authorizing the       President to invade the homes  e mails and telephone       conversations of American citizens in ways that are expressly       forbidden by law   So far  federal judges in Oregon        California  and Michigan have rejected the Governments state       secrets claim  and in the Oregon case  there appears little       doubt about the plaintiffs standing since they have documentary       proof that they were monitored under the program  Senator       Schumer has offered an alternative and more limited measure to       ensure standing  Of course  the President and the Department of       Justice could allow the challenges to go forward on the merits       by choosing not to raise technical legal issues or assert the       state secret doctrine as a blunderbuss    If the Governments state secrets       and standing arguments present real obstacles to judicial       review  the bill would do nothing to remove those obstacles  To       the contrary  the bill expressly preserves all Government       litigation privileges   As for the bills provisions       authorizing the Administration to apply for program warrants  it       may sound like a good way to obtain judicial review    until you       think about it  The program warrant concept itself is novel and       constitutionally suspect  It may well be non justiciable  since       it involves asking a federal judge to go beyond an individual       case or controversy and instead make a broad policy decision       about a whole category of Government activity  In essence  it       asks an individual judge to legislate in broad terms the scope       of Government surveillance power  And Section 9 of the bill       would redefine electronic surveillance so narrowly that the       Government might not need  and the FISA court might not have       jurisdiction to issue    any warrant for the sort of       surveillance that the Administration has admitted to conducting   The Chairman said that he would       like to see the issue of inherent authority resolved by the       Supreme Court  But under the bill  there is almost no chance it       would reach the Supreme Court  Under the bill  if the FISA       court approves a government application for a program warrant          after a secret and one sided proceeding in which the Government       is the only party    then there is no appeal  If the FISA court      refuses to approve an application  the Government has a       range of options  It could appeal  but it would more likely       take advantage of the fact that the bill allows the Government       to submit second and successive applications to various       individual FISA court judges  Or  the Government could skip the       whole process and proceed without court approval and outside of       FISA  which the bill makes optional  Under those scenarios  the       Supreme Court would have no opportunity to resolve the       constitutional issue   As the Supreme Court recently       explained in its Hamdan decision  Whether or not the       President has independent power  absent congressional       authorization  he may not disregard limitations that Congress       has  in proper exercise of its own war powers  placed on his       powers  Thus  even assuming that the President had some       undefined inherent power to carry out national security searches       without a warrant  Congress may place limitations on that power        and those limitations are binding  They are the law  No one is       above the law  not even the President   The Chairman has said that       President Bush would not agree to legislation that required       submission of his domestic surveillance program to the FISA       court  which is what the original version of the Chairmans       bill proposed  because he did not want to bind future       Presidents  But even taking this purported concern at face       value  the bills solution is using a sledgehammer to crack a       nut  If the concern is with future Presidents  and the       Administration means what it represented to Senator Specter that       it is prepared to submit to judicial review  the solution is       simple  We could restore the mandate as Chairman Specter       originally drafted it  but have it expire on the day that this       President leaves office  In other words  we could require this       President to do what he has informally promised to do  without       binding future Presidents   The Chairman said  what our       concern ought to be is to solve the present problem  to get the       current program submitted for judicial review  That is  of       course  what Senator Schumers bill aims to do  without gutting       FISA  and without relying on unenforceable side agreements  If       Republicans share that concern  Senator Schumers bill is far       simpler and better and should be approved unanimously by this       Committee    Senator Cornyn referred to the       bills mandatory transfer provisions as a prohibition against       judge shopping  but in fact they are just the opposite  The       bill is the ultimate example of forum shopping  It would give       one party  the Government  an absolute right to move every       case to the FISA Court of Review  for a one sided proceeding in       which the Government is the only recognized party before judges       whose members are handpicked  Contrary to what the Senator from       Texas suggested  the FISA Court of Review has no unique       competence in the constitutional issues concerning the       Presidents inherent powers and the impact of FISA on those       powers  In its history  the FISA Court of Review has issued       only a single decision  The U S  District Court for the       Southern District of New York  which sits just a few blocks from       Ground Zero  has far more experience with terrorism cases than       the FISA Court of Review  and many Federal judges at the       district court and appellate levels have significant expertise       on constitutional issues   There was a claim last week that       the inherent authority provision in Section 8 of the bill is       weaker than what is in FISA today  quoting a portion of FISA       known as the embassy exception  That is  at best  an apples       to oranges comparison  The current embassy exception is       strictly limited to circumstances in which there is no       substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the       contents of any communications to which a United States person       is a party  Moreover  that narrow exception is one that       Congress elected to make  Section 8  by contrast  appears to       exempt the President from the requirements of FISA regardless of       whether he is listening in on the calls of American citizens        and it would ground that exemption from accountability in an       unsound interpretation of the Constitution rather than the       policy judgments of Congress   Let me turn now to the rhetorical       claims made by the bills defenders about matters of procedure        At the end of last weeks markup  my colleagues and I were       accused of obstruction  I will confess that I am in no rush to       rubberstamp a flawed bill that would expand Governmental power       and reduce Governmental accountability in an area in which we       have been unable to engage in effective oversight     But we all know who is really       engaged in obstruction here  It is the Bush Cheney       Administration that has evaded judicial review for five years by       refusing to seek warrants  in violation of FISA  It is the       Bush Cheney Administration that has refused to answer the       questions of this Committee and of the Intelligence Committee        It is the Bush Cheney Administration that continues to advance       specious arguments regarding the 2001 Authorization for the Use       of Military Force resolution  It is the Bush Cheney       Administration that four years ago rebuffed Senator DeWine when       he proposed amending FISA to make it easier to obtain warrants        No wonder  then  that earlier this year  it was the Bush Cheney       Administration that Chairman Specter and Chairman Sensenbrenner       rightly accused of stonewalling on these matters   At our last meeting  Senator       Cornyn said that Congress and the President need to work       together as partners  I agree  That is what we have done on       multiple occasions since the 1970s  when FISA was first       enacted  We worked as partners in October 2001 to craft the       amendments to FISA contained in the USA PATRIOT Act  Of course        over the last five years  instead of working with us as partners       this Administration has carried on its secret       spy on Americans without warrants program  Moreover  partners       do not attempt to rewrite history in order to pass the buck for       failures that occur on their watch  I remain stunned by section       2 of the bill  which purports to find that the FBI did not seek       a warrant to search Moussaouis laptop computer because it could       not meet FISAs requirements  That finding is flatly contrary       to the facts as determined not only by the       Leahy Specter Grassley Report  but also by the Final Report of       the Joint Inquiry of the House and Senate Intelligence       Committee  Both reports found that the FBI failed to seek a       warrant because key personnel misunderstood the applicable legal       standard  We have come to expect little from an Administration       that often says one thing while knowing another  but the attempt       to enshrine false and revisionist history into law is truly a       low point   Lets be real  The Bush Cheney       Administration is not looking for a partner  Partners dont       hide their activities from each other for five years  Partners       dont refuse well intentioned offers of help  like Senator       DeWines offer in 2002  or mine on military commissions in 2002        in order to keep on hiding the facts from each other  Partners       dont insist  as a precondition of any deal  that they have       unfettered power  And partners dont refuse to talk with each       other for five years and then suddenly attack the others       patriotism for asking questions and not immediately acquiescing       to one sided demands  The Bush Cheney Administration is not       looking for a partner  it is looking for a way to avoid       accountability and a rubberstamp Congress    This Committee has two important       functions  an oversight function and a legislative function        Having backed off of hearings because questioning Administration       witnesses would be futile  to use the Chairmans term  we have       effectively abdicated our oversight function The majority now       proposes that we abdicate our legislative function as well  by       reporting out multiple bills with fundamentally differing       approaches to issues that we lack sufficient information to       address intelligently  I do not understand  and I do not       believe the American people will understand  how Committee       members can support more than one of the incompatible bills       currently before this Committee  Either FISA is mandatory or it       is optional  either the President has inherent power to ignore       whatever Congress legislates regarding domestic surveillance of       Americans or he does not  This Committee will have failed the       American people if it votes out bills that have it both ways on       these basic issues    We all believe that       monitoring the communications of suspected terrorists is       essential  And  especially when the monitoring involves       Americans  it needs to be done lawfully and with adequate checks       and balances to prevent abuses of Americans rights and       Americans privacy  The need for safeguards is more than a       hypothetical exercise  Concern about earlier abuses is one of       the reasons we have FISA in the first place  Now we are being       asked to make sweeping and fundamental changes in the law for       reasons that we do not know and in order to legalize secret        unlawful actions that the Bush Cheney Administration refuses to       fully divulge  We do not know what we need to know to assess       the proposals before us and to legislate responsibly   We can do better  If legislation       is really needed to affirm the availability of judicial review        then lets write that legislation together with no strings       attached  If FISA needs fixing  then lets work from a       bipartisan bill that has been crafted by a Senator who has at       least had access to the limited information provided by the       Administration to the Intelligence Committee  The only such       bill available is the Feinstein Specter bill  Alternatively  we       can accuse each other of obstruction while the Administration       continues to thumb its nose at the Congress and the courts   I continue to hope that we can       work together to legislate good policy  based on a careful       review of the merits  rather than watch the majority attempt to       ram through a partisan back room deal that rubber stamps the       Administrations unlawful domestic spying activities and bogus       constitutional assertions
