       Leahy  Specter Press DOJ  DHS On Investigations Into Rendition Of   Canadian Citizen Maher Arar To Syria                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy  Specter Press DOJ  DHS      On Investigations      Into Rendition Of Canadian Citizen Maher Arar To Syria   Ask For Status of Internal      Inquiries     And Claims IG Officials Are Being Stonewalled WASHINGTON       Wednesday  February 28   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa   sent      a letter Wednesday to the independent investigative arms of the      Departments of Homeland Security  DHS  and Justice  DOJ  seeking      information on inquiries into the 2002 rendition of Canadian citizen      Maher Arar   Mr  Arar is the      Canadian citizen who was detained by federal agents in New York City      in 2002 on suspicion of ties to terrorism and deported to Syria       where he was held for 10 months  Late last year  a Canadian      commission found no evidence to support that Mr  Arar had any      terrorist connection or posed any threat  but  the panel found that he      was tortured and held in abhorrent conditions in Syria  The      Canadian government has apologized to Mr  Arar for its part in this      incident and has     announced that Canada will  pay Mr  Arar almost  10      million in compensation   Department of      Justice officials briefed Senators Leahy and Specter earlier this      month on the Arar case following a request by the Judiciary      Committee for more information about Mr  Arars rendition      Following the briefing  Senator Leahy said the      Administration still had yet to adequately explain its decision to      send Mr  Arar to Syria   Senators Leahy and      Specter also sent a letter last week requesting that the Government      Accountability Office conduct an inquiry to determine whether the      government provides individuals with effective means to challenge      their presence on terrorist watch lists  That letter followed the      revelation that Mr  Arar remains on a U S  watch list despite the      Canadian governments determination that he poses no threat  The text of the      letters is below                  February 28  2007  The Honorable Richard L  Skinner     Inspector General     United States Department of Homeland Security     Washington  D C  20528  Dear Inspector General Skinner     We have long been concerned about the      case of Maher Arar  a Canadian citizen who  while returning home      from a vacation  was detained by federal agents at JFK Airport in      New York City in 2002 on suspicion of ties to terrorism and deported      to Syria  where he was held for 10 months  A Canadian commission      found that there was no evidence that Arar had any terrorist      connection or posed any threat  but that he was tortured and held in      abhorrent conditions in Syria   The Canadian government has apologized      to Mr  Arar for its part in this debacle  The head of the Royal      Canadian Mounted Police resigned  and the country has agreed to pay      Mr  Arar almost  10 million in compensation  Our country       meanwhile  has not apologized or admitted any wrongdoing   House Judiciary Committee Chairman      John Conyers requested in December 2003 that your office investigate      the role of the Department in the Arar case  Your predecessor       Clark Kent Ervin  wrote to Representative Conyers in July 2004      indicating that the office was investigating the matter but had      experienced delays and obstruction in obtaining relevant documents      and interviewing relevant officials    We write to ask the status of your      investigation  Please tell us if the investigation has continued to      experience delay and obstruction and  if so  please describe any      such delay and obstruction  Please also tell us whether your      investigation is ongoing  when you expect to complete it  and      whether you believe that you will have received all the information      you need to investigate the matter completely    We look forward to your reply and to      your investigation into this important matter   Sincerely   PATRICK      LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER     Chairman      Ranking Member                  February 28  2007  The Honorable Glenn Fine     Inspector General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Ave   NW  Suite 4706     Washington  D C  20530       Dear Inspector General Fine     We have long been concerned about the      case of Maher Arar  a Canadian citizen who  while returning home      from a vacation  was detained by federal agents at JFK Airport in      New York City in 2003 on suspicion of ties to terrorism and deported      to Syria  where he was held for 10 months  A Canadian commission      found that there was no evidence that Arar had any terrorist      connection or posed any threat  but that he was tortured and held in      abhorrent conditions in Syria   The Canadian government has apologized      to Mr  Arar for its part in this debacle  The head of the Royal      Canadian Mounted Police resigned  and the country has agreed to pay      Mr  Arar almost  10 million in compensation  Our country       meanwhile  has not apologized or admitted any wrongdoing   House Judiciary Committee Chairman      John Conyers has said publicly that he requested in December 2003      that your office and that the Inspector General for the Department      of Homeland Security investigate the roles of the respective      Departments in the Arar case  The Inspector General for DHS has      conducted an investigation which apparently remains ongoing  I look      forward to the results of that investigation  but there is also more      need than ever for a comprehensive examination of the Justice      Departments role in this disastrous incident   For years  our questions about Mr       Arars case went unanswered  Finally  earlier this month  the      Department of Justice provided us with a confidential briefing about      this case  focusing on the decision to send Mr  Arar to Syria and on      his continued presence on a terrorist watch list  We both said      publicly after the briefing that  despite being briefed for an hour      and forty minutes  we came out with as many questions as when we      went in   In this light  we write to ask whether      you have conducted any inquiry into this matter and  if so  what you      have found  To the extent that you and other relevant offices at      the Department are not already doing so  we request that you examine      the Justice Departments role in the decision to send Mr  Arar to      Syria in 2003  We are interested in how the decision was made       whether there were errors in judgment or violations of law and if so      by whom  and what steps have been taken to redress any such errors      and violations and to avoid repeating them in the future   We look forward to your investigation      and insights on this important matter   Sincerely   PATRICK      LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER     Chairman      Ranking Member                February      21  2007 The      Honorable David M  Walker     Comptroller General     United States Government Accountability Office     441 G Street  NW     Washington  D C  20548 Dear      Comptroller General Walker   We have      long been concerned about the Governments terrorist watch lists       While we must make every effort to ensure our security  these lists      have often appeared to be over inclusive and limited in their      effectiveness  They have too often ensnared innocent people without      providing any easy way for those caught up in their web to seek      redress   Late last      year  we learned that Maher Arar  a Canadian citizen who was sent by      the United States to Syria where a Canadian commission has concluded      he was tortured  is still on a United States terrorist watch list      even though an exhaustive Canadian inquiry concluded that he poses      no risk and has no ties to terrorism  This revelation contributed      to our continuing concern about the Governments watch lists  In this      light  we were interested to review your September 2006 report       Terrorist Watch List Screening  Efforts to Help Reduce Adverse      Effects on the Public  This report documents frequent      misidentifications and mistaken listings on the Governments      terrorist watch lists and examines the varied procedures for      individuals to seek redress  several of which the report found to be      deficient  The report did not make specific recommendations because      the agencies managing the watch lists asserted they were in the      process of improving their systems  We      request that you perform a follow up inquiry to determine whether      the agencies responsible for the Governments terrorist watch lists      have  in fact  taken effective steps to reduce misidentifications      and mistaken listings and to provide individuals with effective      means to challenge their presence on these lists   We ask      that you look at the redress available both to people wrongly      targeted in the course of their travel as a result of mistakes      related to the lists  as well as any recourse available to people      like Mr  Arar who are purposely placed on watch lists  but for whom      significant additional scrutiny has been conducted which may support      a different conclusion  We look      forward to your further research and insights on this important      issue       Sincerely  PATRICK      LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER     Chairman      Ranking Member
