       Senate Adds Leahy Bond Amendment To Defense Bill To Erase Housing   Benefits Gap For Active Duty Guard And Reserve                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Senate Adds Leahy Bond Amendment To Defense Bill     To Erase Housing Benefits Gap     For Active Duty Guard And Reserve        Amendment Raises Housing      Allowance WASHINGTON       Thursday  Nov  10   The Senate this week approved an amendment to      the Defense Authorization Bill by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and      Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo   that would effectively end a housing allowance      formula that shortchanges active duty Guard members and Reservists  The Leahy Bond      Amendment targets the so called Basic Allowance of Housing II  B A H       II  program  which unfairly pays members of the National Guard and      Reserve serving on active duty an average of  300 to  400 less per      month than the allowance available to regular active duty troops      carrying out similar duties  The amendment  which would covers the      nations 870 000 member Selected Reserve of the United States       mandates that reservists called to active duty receive the same      monthly housing allowance as active duty members of the military       The amendment       which Leahy and Bond originally introduced in April as the National      Guard and Reserve Housing Equity Act of 2005  S 938   has been      endorsed by several major Reserve associations  including the      National Guard Association of the United States  the Reserve      Officers Association of the United States and the Enlisted      Association of the National Guard of the United States  It      eliminates the discretion of the Office of the Secretary of Defense      to set a lower housing allowance for reservists called to serve for      30 days or more  Under current law  members of the National Guard      maintaining private residences  called for active duty for periods      of fewer than 140 days  receive a Basic Allowance of Housing II  BAH      II   The allowance has consistently been set at lower levels than      the active duty housing allowance  The National      Guard and Reserve are giving first class efforts and getting      first class results that are consistently on par with the stellar      performance of our entire military  said Leahy  But lingering      policies are giving our reservists only second class benefits       Senator Bond and I have worked long and hard to correct the unfair      discrepancies in benefits between our active duty troops and the      members of the National Guard and Reserves  Hurricane Katrina      showed how important our National Guard is to protecting our own      soil  This amendment offers merited and much needed housing      assistance to families that are making sacrifices of their own while      these active duty soldiers who are giving their all to their      country  The National      Guard is engaged on two major fronts  combating terrorism abroad      while simultaneously providing critical military support to our      communities in response to the unprecedented number of natural      disasters that have occurred recently  Bond said  Our Guard      forces are on call 24 7 and have demonstrated clearly that they are      willing to put service above self and country above all  I am      honored to work with my colleague and co chair of the Guard Caucus       Senator Leahy  in eliminating the housing disparity between our      Guard and active duty forces  The U S  Senate      and U S  House of Representatives will have to reconcile differences      in their two versions of the Defense Authorization Bill through      conference negotiations  Because the Leahy Bond amendment is      identical to a provision in the House version  it will likely prove      uncontroversial and remain in the final legislation   Leahy and Bond       the co chairs of the Senate National Guard Caucus  have also      championed other legislation that has helped to meet the needs of      the Guard and Reserves
