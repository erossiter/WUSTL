       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy In Opposition To The Graham Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     In Opposition To The Graham Amendment     November 15  2005 Mr  President  I      commend my colleagues across the aisle who are attempting to address      the treatment of detainees in U S  custody  despite resistance from      members of their own party and the strong opposition of the White      House  I know Senator Graham has worked closely with Senator McCain      and others to give our troops the clear guidance they need to      effectively detain and interrogate enemy prisoners  and I commend      him for that  The Legislative Branch has not met its obligation of      oversight and policymaking in this area  For months  Senator Graham      has been prodding the Congress to take action  He is one of the few      members of his party to forcefully speak out on the need to change      the Administrations policies   While I support      Senator Grahams efforts on these issues  I cannot support his      amendment to strip federal courts of the authority to consider a      habeas petition from detainees being held in U S  custody as enemy      combatants  The Graham      amendment would deny prisoners who the Administration claims are      unlawful combatants the right to challenge their detention  At no      time in the history of this Nation have habeas rights been      permanently cut off from a group of prisoners  Even President      Lincolns suspension of habeas was temporary  The Supreme Court has      held numerous times that enemy combatants can challenge their      detention  Many of my      colleagues across the aisle argue that terrorists do not deserve      access to our federal courts  This argument would be far more      persuasive if all of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were      terrorists  Unfortunately  many of them are almost certainly not       Numerous press accounts have quoted unnamed officials who believe      that a significant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo do not      have a connection to terrorism  And yet they have been held for      years without the right to challenge their detention in a fair and      impartial hearing  a situation that does significant harm to our      Nations reputation as a leader in human rights and which puts our      own soldiers at risk   Filing a writ of      habeas corpus is often the detainees only opportunity to openly      challenge the basis for his detention  Providing detainees this      right is not about coddling terrorists  it is about showing the      world that we are a nation of laws and that that we are willing to      uphold the values that we urge other nations to follow  It is about      honoring and respecting the principles that are part of our heritage      as Americans and that have been a beacon to the rest of the world       Allowing a detainee to file a habeas petition provides legitimacy to      our detention system and quells speculation that we are holding      innocent people in secret prisons without any right to due process  Some members of      the Senate have argued that these prisoners should be tried in the      military justice system  I think that we could all agree on such a      course if the Administration had worked with Congress from the start      and established with our approval procedures that are fair and      consistent with our tradition of military justice  I introduced a      bill in the 107th Congress to do just that  So did      Senator Specter  The fact is that the system that has been      established by the Administration to try individuals held at      Guantanamo is not a system that reflects our values  It does not      give due process or independent review   Everyone in      Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist suspects       but it can and should be done in accord with the laws of war and in      a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law  The      Judiciary Committee held a hearing on detainee issues in June  At      that hearing  Senator Graham said that once enemy combatant status      has been conferred upon someone  it is almost impossible not to      envision that some form of prosecution would follow  He continued       We can do this and be a rule of law nation  We can prove to the      world that even among the worst people in the world  the rule of law      is not an inconsistent concept  I agree with Senator Graham  but I      strongly believe that in order to uphold our commitment to the rule      of law  we must allow detainees the right to challenge their      detention in federal court  As Chairman      Specter noted on the floor last week  there are existing procedures      under habeas corpus that have been upheld by the Supreme Court  that      do not invite frivolous claims  and that are appropriate  Senator      Grahams amendment would not only restrict habeas in a manner never      done before in our Nation  but  as the Chairman of the Judiciary      Committee said last week  it would open a Pandoras box    The Chairman is      right  He spoke forcefully again this morning about the danger of      such court stripping efforts  We must not rush to change a legal      right that predates our Constitution  Creating one exemption to the      Great Writ only invites more  The Judiciary Committee has      jurisdiction over habeas corpus and it should have the first      opportunity to review any proposed changed carefully and      thoroughly  Although congressional action on the issue of foreign      detainees is long overdue  we must not act hastily when the Great      Writ  something that protects us all  is at stake   I ask unanimous      consent to place in the record a letter from the deans of four of      our Nations most prestigious law school that articulates the      dangers of adopting the Graham amendment
