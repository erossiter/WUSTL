       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito    Jr                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr        To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United       States      Executive Business Meeting      Tuesday  January 24  2006     This nomination raises the       fundamental question whether the Senate will serve its       constitutional role as a check on the President by preserving       the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion of       presidential power  Today I urge Senators and  in particular        Republican Senators  to approach this discussion with open ears       and open minds    This is a nomination that I fear       threatens the fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans       now and for generations to come  This President is in the midst       of a radical realignment of the powers of the government and its       intrusiveness into the private lives of Americans  This       nomination is part of that plan  I am concerned that if       confirmed this nominee will further erode the checks and       balances that have protected our constitutional rights for more       than 200 years  This is a critical nomination  one that can tip       the balance on the Supreme Court radically away from       constitutional checks and balances and the protection of       Americans fundamental rights    This past week I introduced a       resolution to clarify what we all know  that congressional       authorization for the use of military force against Osama bin       Laden did not authorize warrantless spying on Americans as the       Bush Administration is now claiming  I thought  we all thought        that when we joined in the bipartisan authorization of military       action against Osama bin Laden more than four years ago  that       action would have been more effective and have succeeded by now       in ridding the world of that terrorist leader  I still hope       that the clarifying resolution I introduced last week will       become a bipartisan statement upholding the rights of all       Americans         As Justice OConnor underscored recently  even war is not a       blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the       Nations citizens  Now that the illegal spying of Americans       has become public and the President has acknowledged the       four year old program  the Bush Administrations lawyers are       contending that Congress authorized it  The September 2001       Authorization to Use Military Force did no such thing        Republican Senators know it  and a few have said so publicly        We all know it  The liberties and rights that define us as       Americans and the system of checks and balances that serve to       preserve them should not be sacrificed to threats of terrorism       or to the expanding power of the Government    In the days immediately following       those attacks  I said  and I continue to believe  that the       terrorists win if they frighten us into sacrificing our freedoms       and what defines us as Americans    I joined with others  Republican       and Democrats  and we engaged in round the clock efforts over       the next months in connection with what came to be the USA       PATRIOT Act  During those days the Bush Administration never       asked us to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to       accommodate the spying on Americans they were already       undertaking contrary to law  That law does contain an express       reservation for the 15       days following a declaration of war by the Congress  But       neither when Attorney General Ashcroft demanded that we pass his       so called Anti Terrorism Act proposal that he presented us on       September 19 or at any time in September 2001 or thereafter has       the Bush Administration sought congressional authorization for       the NSA spying program that affects Americans  Indeed  Attorney       General Gonzales admitted at a recent press conference that the       Bush Administration did not seek the legal authorization of the       NSA spying program on Americans because it was not something we       could likely get  Consider that damning admission  It is       utterly inconsistent with the Bush Administrations current       argument that Congress authorized warrantless spying on       Americans    The Bush Administrations       after the fact claims about the breadth of the Authorization to       Use Military Force are the latest in a long line of       manipulations and another affront to the rule of law  American       values and traditions  We have also seen this type of       overreaching in that same Justice Department offices twisted       interpretation of the torture statute  with the detention of       suspects without charges and denial of access to counsel  and       with the misapplication of the material witness statute as a       sort of general preventive detention law  Such abuses serve to       harm our national security as well as our civil liberties  By       way of illustration  sources at the FBI reportedly say that much       of what was forwarded to them to investigate from the NSA spying       program was worthless and led to dead ends  That is a dangerous       diversion of our investigative resources away from those who       pose real threats  while precious time and effort is devoted to       looking into the lives of law abiding Americans     Throughout the Alito hearing  from       my opening statement on Monday afternoon  to my first questions       on Tuesday morning  to my last written question  which received       a response last Friday  I asked Judge Alito about these       matters  I am not reassured    The Need for an       Effective Check on Unfettered Presidential Power  A central question during the       hearings on this nomination was whether Judge Alito would serve       as an effective constitutional check on the presidency  We have       a President prone to unilateralism and assertions of Executive       power that extend all the way to illegal spying on Americans         Preventing government intrusion       into the personal privacy and freedoms of Americans is one of       the hallmarks of the Supreme Court  There is no assurance that       Judge Alito will serve as an effective check and balance on       government intrusion into the lives of Americans  Indeed  his       record suggests otherwise    We know that Samuel Alito sought       to justify absolute immunity for President Nixons Attorney       General John Mitchell from lawsuits for wiretapping Americans        among other violations of their privacy  That is immunity even       if the Attorney General acted willfully to violate their rights         We know that as a judge  Samuel       Alito was willing to go further than even Michael Chertoff  the       former head of the Ashcroft Justice Departments Criminal       Division  a former U S  Attorney  and the current Secretary of       the Department of Homeland Security  in excusing government       agents for searches not authorized by judicial warrants  We       know Judge Alito would have excused the strip search of a       10 year old girl that was not expressly authorized by the search       warrant   We know he was part of the effort       within the Meese Justice Department to expand the use of       presidential signing statements to increase the presidents role       in construing what a law passed by Congress means  That is the       practice that the Bush Administration has taken to new heights        This President does not veto laws with which he disagrees as       contemplated by the Constitution  Instead  he signs them and       then picks and chooses what he will faithfully enforce  Often       the Bush Administration makes a unilateral statement declaring       what it will not follow or how it will choose to construe the       measure  In these signing statements  the President is reported       to have relied upon the theory of the Unitary Executive more       than 100 times   This is not just theory  it has       practical effects on Americans lives and liberties  We saw it       recently in the Presidents signing statement on Congresss       declaration against torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading       treatment of detainees  After months of obstruction and delay       by the Bush Administration  Congress passed a bill last month       containing a provision against torture known as the McCain       Amendment  which Senator Durbin and I cosponsored  The McCain       Amendment was passed overwhelmingly by large bipartisan       majorities in the Senate and the House after being stalled for       months by this Administration  Vice President Cheney lobbied       against it  The Administration tried to create a loophole in       the law to get out of following it  When Congress said no  the       President had a widely publicized meeting with Senator McCain at       the White House to announce that they had worked it out and that       President Bush now agreed to the prohibition against torture   Shortly after that meeting with       Senator McCain  after Congress had enacted the measure and the       President had signed it into law  the President released a       signing statement proclaiming that his Administration would       construe the law in a manner consistent with the constitutional       authority of the President to supervise the unitary Executive       branch  Many of us  Republicans and Democrats  are concerned       that the President is still trying to have it both ways  He is       apparently signally that he thinks that he can choose to       disregard the law  at his discretion  based on his own       self serving view of his powers    A       Deferential Nominee At a Pivotal Point in History  In this blessed land  with the       constitutional legacy that has been entrusted to us through the       blood  sweat and tears of earlier generations of Americans  we       must not yield to the temptation to sacrifice our liberties and       our way of life  If we do  the terrorists win  Benjamin       Franklin warned against such a choice when he observed  Those       who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security        deserve neither liberty or security  With enough effort and       foresight  we can and we should demand both   I chaired the Judiciary Committee       after the 9 11 attacks  and in working with the White House and       with congressional partners in crafting the USA PATRIOT Act  I       pushed hard to add a variety of checks and balances  such as       judicial review and sunsets  to many of its provisions  The       Bush Administration resisted those additions at the time  but       today they brag about them as if they were their own     This President has made some of       the most expansive claims of power since American patriots       fought the war of independence to rid themselves of the       oppressive rule of King George III  This President is claiming       power to illegally spy on Americans  to allow actions that       violate our values and laws protecting human rights  and to       detain U S  citizens       and others on his say so  without judicial review or due       process  This is a time in our history when the protections of       Americans liberties are at risk  as are the very checks and       balances that have served to constrain abuses of power for more       than two centuries    The Supreme Court is the ultimate       check and balance in our system  The independence of the Court       and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of life        The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp  and       neither should the Supreme Court  I asked Judge Alito to       demonstrate his independence from the interests of the       President  and he failed that test     A       Presidents Choice   We know Judge Alito       took time from his busy schedule and docket to attend a       Federalist Society convention in   Washington just days after the       presidential election in 2000 to discuss his adherence to the       theory of the Unitary Executive and criticized the Supreme       Court for upholding the constitutionality of the independent       counsel statute  He went so far as to call the Unitary       Executive gospel and to say that in his view it best       captures the meaning of the Constitutions text and structure    That audition before       the Federalist Society appeared to work  reminding those       advising the new President that they had a known quantity in       Samuel Alito  It led to a White House interview in connection       with a possible future Supreme Court vacancy shortly thereafter       in 2001  Judge Alito had other meetings and interviews but the       key one took place in May 2005       with Vice President Cheney  Scooter Libby  Karl Rove and others       at the White House  It was months before Justice OConnor made       her announcement to retire  that came in July  But in May        Judge Alito was called to a meeting with this Administrations       key political strategists    I suspect that the       answer to the question Judge Alito posed at the hearing       regarding how he got the nomination can be answered in large       measure with regard to his demonstrated deference to government       power  his adherence to the Unitary Executive  his rulings in       favor of government intrusions  and whatever he said in his job       interviews at the White House that convinced those advising this       President that he will be a reliable vote against challenges to       presidential power    No President should be allowed to       pack the courts  and especially the Supreme Court  with nominees       selected to enshrine presidential claims of government power        Our system was designed to ensure a balance and to protect       against overreaching by any branch  The Senate should not be a       rubber stamp to this Presidents effort to move the law       dramatically to the right and to give him unfettered leeway  I       will not lend my support to an effort by this President to move       the Supreme Court and the law radically to the right and to       remove the final check within our democracy   I voted for President Reagans       nomination of Justice Sandra Day OConnor  for President       Reagans nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy  for President       Bushs nomination of Justice Souter  and for this Presidents       recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts  I cannot vote for       this nomination    At a time when the President is       seizing unprecedented power  the Supreme Court needs to act as a       check and to provide balance  Based on the hearing and his       record  I have no confidence that Judge Alito would provide that       check and balance  I will vote against granting the Senate its       consent to this nomination by this President
