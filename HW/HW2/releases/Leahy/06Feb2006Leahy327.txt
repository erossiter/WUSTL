       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Wartime Executive Power   And The NSA s Surveillance Authority                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement      Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On     Wartime Executive Power And The NSA s Surveillance Authority     Monday  February 6  2006  The question for this hearing is the      illegality of the Governments domestic spying on ordinary Americans      without a warrant    The question facing us is not whether      the Government should have all the tools it needs to protect the      American people  Of course it should  The terrorist threat to      Americas security remains very real  and it is vital that we be      armed with the tools needed to protect Americans security        That is why I co authored the PATRIOT Act five years ago and why it      passed with such broad  bipartisan support  That is why we have      amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act five times since      9 11 to provide more flexibility   We all agree that we should be      wiretapping al Qaeda terrorists  of course we should  Congress has      given the President authority to monitor these messages legally       with checks to guard against abuses when Americans conversations      and email are being monitored  But instead  the President has      chosen to do it illegally  without those safeguards     A judge from the special court      Congress created to monitor domestic spying would grant any request      to wiretap an al Qaeda terrorist  Of the approximately 20 000      foreign intelligence warrant applications over the past 28 years       only a handful have been turned down    I thank the Chairman for convening      todays hearing  The Chairman and I have a long history of      conducting vigorous bipartisan oversight investigations  If the      Senate is to serve its constitutional role as a real check on the      Executive  thoroughgoing oversight is essential     The      domestic spying programs into emails and telephone calls apparently      conducted by the National Security Agency were first reported by the      New York Times      on        December 16  2005  The next day  President Bush admitted that      secret  domestic wiretapping has been conducted without warrants      since late 2001  and that he has issued secret orders in this regard      more than 30 times since then  We have asked for the presidential      orders  but they have not been provided  We have asked for the      official legal opinions of the Government that the Administration      says justify and limit this program  They  too  have been withheld      from us          This hearing is expressly about the legality of these programs  not      about their operational details  In order for us to conduct      effective oversight  we clearly need the official documents that      answer these basic questions  We are an oversight Committee of the      United States Senate  the oversight committee with jurisdiction      over the Department of Justice and over its enforcement of the laws      of the United States  We are the duly elected representatives of      the people of the United States  and it is our duty to determine      whether the laws of the United States have been violated  The      President and the Justice Department have a constitutional duty to      faithfully execute the laws  They do not write them  They do not      pass them  They do not have unchecked power to decide what laws to      follow and what laws to ignore  They cannot violate the law or the      rights of ordinary Americans  In America no one  not even the      President  is above the law    The Presidents Domestic Spying      Programs        There is much that we do not know about the Presidents secret      spying programs  I hope that we will begin to get some real answers      from the Administration today  not simply more self serving      characterizations  Lets start with what we do know         Point One    The Presidents secret wiretapping program is not      authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA               That law expressly states that it provides the exclusive source of      authority for wiretapping for intelligence purposes  Wiretapping      that is not authorized under that statute is a federal crime  That      is what the law says  and that is what the law means  This law was      enacted to define how domestic surveillance for intelligence      purposes may be conducted while protecting the fundamental liberties      of Americans  Two or more generations of Americans are too young to      know this from their experience  but theres a reason we have the      FISA law  It was enacted after decades of abuses by the Executive       including the wiretapping of Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  and other      political opponents of earlier government officials  and the White      House horrors of the Nixon years  during which another President      asserted that whatever he did was legal because he was the      President     The      law has been updated five times since September 11  2001  in order      to keep pace with intelligence needs and technological      developments  It provides broad and flexible authority  On July      31  2002  the Justice Department testified that this law is a      highly flexible statute that has proven effective and noted  When      you are trying to prevent terrorist acts  that is really what FISA      was intended to do and it was written with that in mind    The      Bush Administration now concedes that this President knowingly      created a program involving thousands of wiretaps of Americans in      the United States over the period of the last four to five years      without complying with FISA  Legal scholars and former Government      officials have been almost unanimous in stating the obvious  This      is against the law          Point Two    The Authorization for the Use of Military Force that      Democratic and Republican lawmakers joined together to pass in the      days immediately after the September 11 attacks did not give the      President the authority to go around the FISA law to wiretap      Americans illegally          That resolution authorized the military action of sending military      troops into Afghanistan to kill or capture Osama bin Laden and those      acting with him    in the words of the statute  to use the United      States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks      launched against the United States    It      did not      authorize domestic surveillance of United States citizens without a      warrant from a judge  Nothing in the Authorization for the Use of      Military Force was intended secretly to undermine the liberties and      rights of Americans  Rather  it was to defend our liberties and      rights that Congress authorized the President to use our Armed      Forces against those responsible for the 9 11 attacks      Let      me be clear  It is only Republican Senators who are talking about      special rights for terrorists  I have no interest in that  I      wish the Bush Administration had done a better job with the vast      powers Congress has given it to destroy al Qaeda and kill or capture      Osama bin Laden  But it has not     My      concern is for peaceful Quakers who are being spied upon and other      law abiding Americans and babies and nuns who are placed on      terrorist watch lists          Point Three    The President never came to Congress and never sought      additional legal authority to engage in the type of domestic      surveillance in which the NSA has been secretly engaged for the last      several years          After September 11  2001  I helped lead a bipartisan effort to      provide tools and legal authorities to improve our capabilities to      prevent terrorist attacks  We enacted amendments to FISA in the USA      PATRIOT ACT in October 2001 and four additional times subsequently       Ironically  when a Republican Senator proposed a legal change to the      standard needed for a FISA warrant  the Bush Administration did not      support that effort but raised questions about its constitutionality      and testified that it was not needed       This Administration told the Senate that FISA was working just fine      and that it did not seek additional adjustments  Attorney General      Gonzales has said that the Administration did not ask for      legislation authorizing warrantless wiretapping of Americans and did      not think such legislation would pass    Not      only did the Bush Administration not seek broader legal authority       it kept the very existence of its domestic wiretapping program      without warrants completely secret from 527 of the 535 Members of      Congress  including Members on this Committee and on the      Intelligence Committee  and placed limits and restrictions on what      the eight Members who were      told anything could know or say     The      Administration had not suggested to Congress and the American people      that FISA was inadequate  outmoded or irrelevant until it was caught      violating the statute with a secret program of wiretapping Americans      without warrants  Indeed  in 2004  two years after he authorized      the secret warrantless wiretapping program  the President told the      American people  Anytime      you hear the United States government talking about wiretap  a      wiretap requires a court order  He continued  Nothing has      changed  When were talking about chasing down terrorists  were      talking about getting a court order before we do so  In light of      what we now know  that statement was  at best  misleading      The      Rule Of Law   I      have many questions for the Attorney General  But first  I have a      message to give him and the President  It is a message that should      be unanimous  from every Member of Congress regardless of party and      ideology  Under our Constitution  Congress is the co equal branch      of Government that makes the laws  If you believe we need new laws       you can come to us and tell us  If Congress agrees  we will amend      the law  If you do not even attempt to persuade Congress to amend      the law  you must abide by the law as written  That is as true for      this President as it is for any other American  That is the rule of      law  on which our Nation was founded  and on which it endures and      prospers
