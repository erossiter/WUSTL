       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Specter Leahy Amendment To The   Budget Reconciliation Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Specter Leahy Amendment  2378  To Fund Justice Programs      To The Budget Reconciliation Act  S  1932       Congressional Record  November 3  2005  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am      thrilled that the Senate has agreed to accept by unanimous consent      to the Budget Reconciliation Act  S  1932  a bipartisan amendment      offered by Senator Specter and myself to allocate the extra       278 000 000 in revenue provided from the Judiciary Committee markup      on reconciliation to supplement funding for the Bulletproof Vest      Partnership  programs authorized by the Justice For All Act  and the      Copyright Royalty Judges Program   I thank my good friend and colleague       Senator Specter  for his leadership on and commitment to seeing that      these important programs are funded as much as we can during these      tough fiscal times  As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary      Committee  Senator Specter and I have joined forces before to      champion funding for these programs  I am privileged to partner      with him again in that pursuit   The Judiciary Committee markup on its      reconciliation title provided  278 000 000 more in revenue than was      mandated by the Budget Resolution instructions  We now seek to      include additional provisions within the jurisdiction of our      Committee into the Senate reconciliation package  Our bipartisan      amendment funds a number of Judiciary programs that enjoyed broad      bipartisan support when Congress authorized them  These mandatory      spending changes would simply spend some of the additional revenue      that we raised through increases in immigration fees during our      markup   Our proposal would provide  60 000 000      over the next five years for such initiatives as the Bulletproof      Vest Partnership Program  which helps law enforcement agencies      purchase or replace body armor for their rank and file officers       Recently  concerns over body armor safety surfaced when a      Pennsylvania police officer was shot and critically wounded through      his new vest outfitted with a material called Zylon r   The Justice      Department has since announced that Zylon r  fails to provide the      intended level of ballistic resistance  Unfortunately  an estimated      200 000 vests outfitted with that material have been purchased    many with Bulletproof Vest      Partnership funds   and now must be replaced  Law enforcement      agencies nationwide are struggling to find the funds necessary to      replace defective vests with ones that will actually stop bullets      and save lives  Our amendment will help them replace those faulty      vests   Our amendment also provides over       216 000 000 for programs authorized by the Justice For All Act of      2004  a landmark law that enhances protections for victims of      Federal crimes  increases Federal resources available to State and      local governments to combat crimes with DNA technology  and provides      safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and executions  The      bipartisan amendment that Senator Specter and I propose will  among      other things  allow for training of criminal justice and medical      personnel in the use of DNA evidence  including evidence for      post conviction DNA testing  It will promote the use of DNA      technology to identify missing persons  With these funds  State and      local authorities will be better able to implement and enforce crime      victims  rights laws  including Federal victim and witness      assistance programs  State and locals can apply for grants to      develop and implement victim notification systems so that they can      share information on criminal proceedings in a timely and efficient      manner  The amendment will also help improve the quality of legal      representation provided to both indigent defendants and the public      in State capital cases   Last  but certainly not least  our      amendment provides  6 500 000 over five years for the Copyright      Royalty Judges Program at the Library of Congress  The Copyright      Royalty Distribution Reform Act of 2004 created a new program in the      Library to replace most of the current statutory responsibilities of      the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels program  The Copyright      Royalty Judges Program will determine distributions of royalties      that are disputed and will set or adjust royalty rates  terms and      conditions  with the exception of satellite carriers  compulsory      licenses  Our amendment would help pay the salaries and related      expenses of the three royalty judges and three administrative staff      required by law to support this program    Mr  President  the Specter Leahy      amendment will give to programs that help protect police officers      and victims of violent crime  allow State and local governments to      combat crimes with DNA technology  and provide safeguards to prevent      wrongful convictions and executions  Chairman Specter and I are      proud that the Judiciary Committee was able to agree to a      reconciliation package that will provide  278 million more in      revenue than was mandated by the Budget Resolution instructions  I      thank our colleagues for supporting our amendment and agreeing to      use that additional money to fund some of these important priorities      that continue to lack adequate Federal resources
