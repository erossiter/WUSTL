       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Hearing On The Nomination Of   John G  Roberts  Jr   To Be Chief Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Opening Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member      Hearing Before The Senate Committee On The Judiciary      On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts  Jr        To Be Chief Justice Of The Supreme Court      Monday  September 12  2005      Senate Caucus Room  A few days       ago William H  Rehnquist passed away after 33 years of service       on the Supreme Court  including 19 as the Chief Justice  Last       week many of us paid our respects for his service at the       monumental building across the street in which the Chief Justice       devoted himself to protecting the independence of the federal       judiciary  The facade of that Court exhibits the enduring       strength and dignity of marble from  Vermont  a place that served as a       refuge for the Chief Justice          Self Government And The Common Good  Today  the       devastation and despair facing millions of our fellow Americans       in the Gulf region is a tragic reminder of why we have a federal       government and why it is critical that our government be       responsive  We need the federal government for our protection       and security  to cast a lifeline to those in distress  and to       mobilize vital resources  beyond the ability of any local or       State government  for the common good    The full       dimensions of the disaster are not yet known  Bodies of loved       ones need to be recovered  families need to be reunited  the       survivors need to be assisted  long term health risks and       environmental damage need to be assessed  But if anyone needed       a reminder of the need and role for government  the last days       have provided it  If anyone needed a reminder of the growing       poverty and despair among too many Americans  we now all have       it  And if anyone needed a reminder of the racial divide that       remains in our nation  no one can now doubt that we still have       miles to go   I believe       that the American people still want  expect and demand their       government to help ensure justice and equal opportunity for all       and especially for those who  through no fault of their own        were born into poverty  The American people deserve a       government as good as they are  with a heart as big as theirs        We are all Americans and all Americans should have the       opportunity to earn a fair share of the bounty and blessings       that America offers         We The       People  We have       been given a great Constitution  It begins  We the People of       the United States  in Order to form a more perfect Union        establish Justice  insure domestic Tranquility  provide for the       common defence  promote the general Welfare  and secure the       Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity  do ordain       and establish this Constitution for the United States of       America  Our Constitution is the framework for our government       and the foundation of our rights and liberties    Vermont       joined the Union in the same year that the Bill of Rights was       ratified  Those of us from the Green Mountain State  the       nations 14th state  have historically been protective of our       fundamental rights and liberties  Vermonters understand the       importance the Constitution and Bill of Rights and of those       constitutional amendments that have expanded individual rights       over time   In these       hearings  we will be discussing constitutional issues that may       seem legalistic  But these are vital questions that affect each       of us  every day  When we discuss the Constitutions Commerce       Clause or Spending Power  for example  we are asking about       congressional authority to pass laws to ensure clean air and       water  childrens and seniors health  safe food and drugs  safe       workplaces  even wetland protection and levees that should       protect our communities from natural disasters    Our       constitutional values remain constant as we strive to realize       the American promise of fairness  equality  and justice  I have       noted that our Constitution begins with the words We the       People  When the Constitution was written  We the People did       not include Native Americans or African American slaves but only       free Persons  It took more than  four score years and a Civil War       before the Constitution was amended to include as citizens all       persons born or naturalized in the United States  Even then        the Constitution failed to accord half of the people one of       democracys defining rights    women were not yet guaranteed the       right to vote  That was not remedied until 1920  Decades later       still  it took an historic constitutional ruling by the United       States Supreme Court in the case of  Brown v  Board of Education        and landmark legislation by the federal government  for America       to begin to provide a measure of equality to many who were held       back for so long because of the color of their skin   I have long       been a proponent of First Amendment freedoms and open government       because the publics right to know what our government is doing       promotes accountability and invigorates our system of checks and       balances    Federal       judges are not elected  Once confirmed  they serve for life        The people never have the opportunity for effective oversight of       their work  The judiciary is the most insulated branch of       government from public accountability    This       hearing is the only opportunity for the American people to       examine what kind of justice John Roberts will dispense  if       promoted to the Supreme Court  and the direction in which he       would lead the federal judiciary  This hearing is the only       chance that We the People have to hear from and reflect on the       suitability of the nominee to be a final arbiter of the meaning       of the Constitution  Open and honest public conversation with       the nominee in these hearing rooms is an important part of this       process    Our       Fundamental Rights In A New Century  This       hearing is about the fundamental rights of all Americans  Judge       John Roberts is the first nominee of the 21st Century  If he is       confirmed he serves not just for the remaining three years of       the Bush Administration but could serve through the       administrations of the next seven or eight presidents  He would       be deciding matters that affect not only all of Americans today        but also our children and grandchildren    Nearly 20       years ago  I noted how critical it is for the Senate to engage       in a public exploration of the judicial philosophy of Supreme       Court nominees saying  There can hardly be an issue closer to       the heart of the Senates role than a full and public exposition       of the nominees approach to the Constitution and to the role of       the courts in discerning and enforcing its commands  That is       what I mean by judicial philosophy  This truth has not       changed  as today we consider a successor to Chief Justice       Rehnquist and will then be called upon to consider a successor       for Justice Sandra Day OConnor    The Arc       of the Law   What is       more difficult to see is the arc of the law in the years ahead        as Justices will vote on which cases to accept and how to decide       them  Ours is a government of laws  but when faced with a       vacancy on the Supreme Court  we are reminded that our fellow       citizens on the Court interpret and apply those laws  The       balance and direction of the Supreme Court are now at issue with       two vacancies  Chief among emerging concerns are whether the       Supreme Court will continue its recent efforts to restrict the       authority of Congress to pass legislation to protect the       peoples interests in the environment  safety  and civil rights        and  whether the Supreme Court will effectively check the       enhanced presidential power that has been amassed in the last       few years   The light       of the nominations process is intense because it is the only       time that light will shine  and the afterglow lasts for the rest       of a Justices career  We the People have just this one       chance to inquire whether this person should be entrusted with       the privilege and responsibility of interpreting our       Constitution and dispensing justice from the nations highest       court  On behalf of the American people  it is our job to do       all we can to make sure we get it right
