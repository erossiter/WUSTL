       Leahy Wins Senate Approval To Ease Asylum Rules That Shut Out Terror   Victims And U S  Allies                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Wins Senate      Approval To Ease Asylum Rules     That Shut Out Terror Victims And U S  Allies     Like The Hmong  The Montagnards      And Refugees From Iraq And Afghanistan  WASHINGTON  Friday  Sept  7    The      U S  Senate has approved reforms to allow thousands of persecuted      refugees   barred because they were members of armed groups         allied with or supported by the U S  or who were forced to offer      food  shelter or other services to designated terrorist groups    to      seek asylum here   The change was included in the annual      budget bill for the State Department  which passed the Senate late      Thursday night  The material support reforms were authored by      Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    who chairs the Senate Appropriations      Committee panel that wrote the bill  The Leahy provisions were      modified by an amendment negotiated Thursday by Leahy and Sen  Jon      Kyl  R Ariz    The reforms include a carve out for Vietnam era      allies such as the Hmong tribesman of Laos and the Montagnards of      Vietnam  and for child soldiers whose affiliation with proscribed      organizations was involuntary   The current law is illogical  and it      is unfair  said Leahy  It is an affront to our values and our      honor to shut our doors to persecuted allies like these  They were      there for us when we needed them  and we should not turn our backs      when they need the safety of our shores  This reform is a step in      the right direction  to bring our law a bit more into sync with our      values  Once this is enacted  we will watch to see how it is      implemented and whether further steps are needed   Overbroad changes in the law made in      the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts have been used to bar refugees and      asylum seekers who were either members of groups that fought on the      side of the United States    such as the Hmong  the Montagnards  and      the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan    or who were the victims of      terrorist groups and forced to provide goods or services    Leahy noted that these overly broad      restrictions have kept thousands of refugees and hundreds of asylum      seekers in limbo  Bush Administration officials belatedly have      acknowledged that they have been slow to deal with this problem and      that the law needs to be changed  Meanwhile an additional problem      is looming  Iraqi refugees  7000 of whom the President agrees      should be admitted to the United States  many of whom are being      barred from admission unless the law is fixed    Leahy s reforms themselves will not      raise the number of refugees admitted to the United States  which is      determined by the numerical limit the President sets each year and      by the amount Congress appropriates for refugee admissions
