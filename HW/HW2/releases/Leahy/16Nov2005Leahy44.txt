       Leahy Backs Bill To Give Seniors Greater Leeway  Plus One Penalty Free    Do Over   In Enrolling In Medicare Drug Benefit Plans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Backs Bill To      Give Seniors      Greater Leeway  Plus One Penalty Free  Do Over        In Enrolling In Medicare Drug Benefit Plans              Says  Botched Rollout  Of Drug Program      Is Exasperating Seniors In Vermont And Coast To Coast     WEDNESDAY  Nov  16     Tuesday s      launch of the signup period for the new Medicare prescription drug      program was botched  says Sen  Patrick Leahy  He says poor      planning has burdened frustrated seniors with confusing choices and      a looming deadline  compounded this week by unanswered  overloaded      help lines and a slow and crash prone Medicare website    Tuesday was the first day that      seniors were able to enroll in prescription drug plans under the new      Medicare Part D program  created by the Medicare Modernization Act      of 2003  with coverage to begin January 1  In Vermont there are 44      plans  each differing in costs  the drugs it covers and where      prescriptions can be filled  Leahy said his office has had dozens of      calls from exasperated Vermonters trying to sort through the      enrollment maze    Leahy and eight other U S  senators      are pressing for Senate action on a bill to offer added protections      for seniors as they decide whether and how to enroll in the Medicare      drug plan  The Medicare Informed Choice Act  S 1841  chief sponsor       Sen  Bill Nelson  D Fla   would extend until the end of 2006 the      time that Medicare beneficiaries have to enroll in a plan without      being assessed a penalty  let seniors make a one time switch in      plans if they feel they made a mistaken initial choice  and protect      retirees from being dropped from their former employers  plans      during the first year of the new program    Vermonters on Medicare are facing      confusing and difficult decisions about whether and how to enroll in      a prescription drug plan  said Leahy  The Administration made this      program unduly complicated when they designed it  It will compound      those mistakes if they now force seniors to make these choices under      the gun and under conditions that are far from acceptable  This bill      will give seniors more time and more flexibility so they can make      choices that are best for them    Leahy had voted against the Bush      version of the Medicare drug plan  favoring instead another version       because the Bush plan does nothing to bring down the cost of      prescription drugs and falls short of the benefit levels he believes      Medicare beneficiaries need
