       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh      May 25  2006  The Senate has just passed       bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform  which is an       achievement for all Americans  present and future  who want to       keep our country safe and fix our broken system  At a time when       the Senate should be continuing on a path of addressing       Americans top priorities  including the war in  Iraq  rising gas prices and health       care costs  stem cell research  and the reauthorization of the       Voting Rights Act  the Republican leader is seeking to divert us       to consideration of a controversial judicial nomination  That       nomination  like the difficult and controversial nominations of       Judge Terrence Boyle and Michael Wallace  signifies that the       Bush Cheney Administration and its allies in the Senate are more       interested in playing partisan  election year politics by       heeding the siren call of special interest groups than in       tackling the pressing issues facing Americans today    Local and national law enforcement       have called upon the President to withdraw the nomination of       Judge Boyle and he would be well advised to do so  The       nomination of Michael Wallace received the first  ABA rating of unanimously not       qualified that I have seen for a circuit court nominee in more       than 20 years  And the nomination before us today of Brett       Kavanaugh is one of the few judicial nominations to be       downgraded over time by the ABA     The Senates job is       to fulfill our duty under the Constitution  not to advance a       political agenda  We must be able to assure the American people       that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments to the       highest courts in this country are being appointed to be fair       and protect their interests  rather than those of a presidential       patron    Mr   Kavanaugh is a young man who was       nominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the       District of Columbia Circuit while working for most of his       career on behalf of this President and the Republican Party in       partisan political jobs  Since helping to author the Starr       Report he has worked in the Office of the White House Counsel       and as Staff Secretary to the President  He was involved in the       Administrations use of 750 presidential signing statements to       try to reserve to the President the power to pick and choose       which laws passed by Congress he wanted to follow  He has       helped the President pack the federal bench with right wing       ideologues  and helped design the White Houses overbearing       secrecy policy    My question for this nominee  as       for all nominees  is whether he will be an independent check and       balance  Regrettably   Mr  Kavanaugh has       failed through two hearings to establish that he has the       capacity to be an independent check on his political patron  a       President who is asserting extraordinary claims of power        Despite his close ties to the White Houses inner circle  he       would not even tell us what issues he would recuse himself from       hearing as a judge  Instead  we heard from a nominee who       parroted the Administrations talking points on subject after       subject  I do not think the Senate should confirm a       presidential spokesman to be a judge on the second highest court       in the land    After carefully       evaluating Mr  Kavanaughs record and his answers at two       hearings  it is clear that he is a political pick being pushed       for political reasons  His nomination is a continuation of the       Republicans decade long attempt to pack the D C  Circuit        Dating back to President Clintons first term   the Republicans have played       politics with the D C  Circuit   blocking President       Clintons nominees to preserve a majority of Republican       appointees on that court  Their plan has succeeded  After       confirming two other nominees last year that I strongly opposed         Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith    Republican       appointees now comprise a two to one majority on this important       court  This is not a court that needs another rubberstamp for       this Presidents exertions of executive power     I also ask why the Republican       majority now bent on packing this court also did not apply the       up or down vote standard to President Clintons nominees to the       D C  Circuit  When the Republican Senate majority stalled the       nomination of Merrick Garland to the D C  Circuit beyond the       1996 election  even Senator Hatch became frustrated and in March       1997 he proclaimed that the way that Republicans were opposing       judicial nominees was playing politics with judges  was       unfair and that he was sick of it  Regrettably  he did not       follow through  That was the last nominee of President       Clintons that Senator Hatch and the Republican Senate were       willing to consider to this important Circuit  Two highly       qualified nominees  Elena Kagan  now Dean of the  Harvard Law School  and Allen       Snyder  who had served as a clerk to Justice Rehnquist and was       an experienced and respected litigator  were left without       consideration for years  No questions were raised about their       qualifications  as they have been for this and many others of       this Presidents nominations  The fact is that for the rest of       President Clintons second term  Senate Republicans would not       consider another nominee to the D C  Circuit  They were just       blocked  pocket filibustered with impunity    The only nominee of this President       to have received similar treatment was when the President       nominated his White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme       Court  She is a       woman who had not gone to Ivy League schools  but had a more       impressive background of legal experience than this nominee        Republicans questioned her qualifications and demanded answers       about her work at the White House and legal philosophy  They       defeated her nomination before allowing her a hearing     The Senate has already confirmed       John Roberts  Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith to the       D C  Circuit  Today  judges appointed by Republican Presidents       outnumber those appointed by Democratic Presidents  six to three on this       pivotal Circuit   Despite the political battle that       has been waged by the Republicans for control of the D C        Circuit  I approached the nomination of Mr  Kavanaugh with an       open mind  I gave him the chance that Elena Kagan and Allen       Snyder never received  He has had opportunities to demonstrate       at not one  but two hearings that he was the kind of independent       nominee who deserved to be confirmed  The Washington Post noted       in 2003 when President Bush nominated Mr  Kavanaugh that he had       nominated someone who will only inflame further the politics of       confirmation to one of this countrys highest quality courts       and concluded that it was too bad Mr  Bush is too busy playing       politics to lead    I kept an open mind even though       only one of the 22 judges appointed to the D C  Circuit since       the Nixon administration Kenneth Starr  had less legal       experience at the time of his nomination than Mr  Kavanaugh  I       even kept an open mind after Mr  Kavanaughs nomination was one       of the few to be downgraded by the  ABA  I cannot recall anyone being       confirmed after such a development    However  after seeing Mr        Kavanaugh at his recent hearing  I can appreciate one judge       interviewed by the       ABA peer review committee describing Mr  Kavanaugh as less than       adequate and as someone who demonstrated experience on the       level of an associate  Others interviewed recently raised       concerns about Mr  Kavanaughs ability to be balanced and fair       given his many years in partisan positions working to advance a       partisan political agenda  Mr  Kavanaugh was described by       interviewees as insulated  sanctimonious  and immovable and       very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues        These are not qualities that make for a good judge  Despite the       word put out falsely by his White House defenders  it was not a       change in membership on the ABA peer review committee that led       to his downgrading  Indeed  three quarters of those who had       previously reviewed this nomination and continued on the       committee voted to downgrade the rating based on the recent       interviews and review    His response to one simple       question I asked during his most recent hearing spoke volumes        I asked why the nominee had taken seven months to answer the       written questions submitted to him following his initial hearing       in 2004  His repeating the phrase that he took responsibility       for such dismissive and irresponsible conduct and  implicitly        for his lack of seriousness about the confirmation process       elicited laughter from the hearing room  but not from me  It       was not the first time that I felt Mr  Kavanaugh had       dissembled in response to my questions    I suspect that the truth is that       he made a political calculation and decided to expend his time       and effort on his benefactors re election campaign during the       spring  summer and fall of 2004  We did not receive any       response to our written questions until after that November 2004       election  Mr  Kavanaugh may be brilliant at politics and have       powerful supporters  but that does not mean that he will be a       good judge   In my opening statement at his       hearing I raised the key question regarding this nomination        Will he demonstrate his independence and show that he can serve       in the last  independent branch of the government that the       American people can look to as a check and balance on a       President who is asserting extraordinary claims of power  He       could have told us something about his responsibilities as Staff       Secretary or as an associate White House counsel and given us       examples of when he showed independence and good judgment  but       he did not    Instead  Mr  Kavanaugh appeared at       his confirmation hearing to be a spokesman and representative       for the Administration  Over and over he answered our questions       by alluding to what the President would want and what the       President would want him to do  We heard from a nominee who       responded not with answers but with the Administrations talking       points  I do not think the Senate should confirm a presidential       spokesman to be a judge on the second highest court in the land   We heard from a young man who when       invited by the Chairman to introduce his family  began his       remarks by thanking the President for nominating him and later       emphasized as if a qualification that he had earned the trust       of the President and his senior staff  All that may be       useful for advancement within this Presidents Administration or       Republican circles  but those are hardly qualities or       qualifications for an independent judge of this President and       this Administrations actions    Senator Graham put the question       this way during the course of the hearing  There       is a fine line between doing your job as a White House       counselor  being part of the judicial selection team and being a       judge yourself  There is a line between being advocate and       being a judge  I do not believe that Mr  Kavanaugh       demonstrated that he has left his role as a member of the       Presidents Administration or that he will  The D C  Circuit is       too important to pack with those who would merely rubberstamp       this Administrations or any Administrations   policies          With the sudden       resignation of the Presidents previous hand picked head of the       CIA  Porter Goss   America witnessed       another heck of a job accolade to an Administration insider       leaving a critical job undone  This week we learned that the       Presidents Secretary of the Veterans Administration has       presided over the       largest theft of private information from the Government ever        the loss of information on more than 26 million American       veterans  Compounding the incompetence was the misguided       decision by the Veterans Administrations for secrecy in trying       to cover this up for last three weeks  This follows on the heels       of last years debacle of a billion dollar shortfall in VAs       budget for veterans health care  after repeated denials  It       all adds up to a heck of a job by this Administration      What is desperately       lacking throughout this Administration is accountability  The       attack on 9 11  the faulty intelligence  the years of       fundamental mistakes in   Iraq  the lack of preparation and       horrific aftermath of Katrina  and on and on   A       Republican controlled Congress has not provided a check and has       made it all the more important for the courts to be that check       to preserve our rights and way of life  to check the       Governments overreaching  Now that the Administration is       raiding congressional offices  the Republican leadership of the       Congress is protesting  When ordinary Americans telephone       calls and Internet use were being wiretapped without warrants        the Republican Congress looked the other way     Last year  when the       President nominated Harriet Miers  Republicans questioned her       qualifications and demanded answers about her work at the White       House and legal philosophy  They defeated her nomination before       allowing her a hearing  While it now appears that Republicans       are back to their rubberstamping routine with every Senate       Republican ready to approve this nomination without question or       pause  the question raised by the nomination of the Presidents       own counsel and staff secretary remain  Will that nominee act       as a check and balance     At his hearing       Senator   Feinstein and I gave Mr  Kavanaugh       another opportunity to answer concerns about his loyalty to this       President affecting his decisions as a judge  We asked about       recusal  He could have said that he would not hear any matter       that raised questions about the Presidents claims or exercise       of powers  given his close association with the development of       the policies and practices of this Administration  He could       have walled off matters covered by the presidential signing       statement  now reported to number 750  in which this President       has shown an assertiveness of unchecked Executive power that       exceeds those of Richard Nixon  He could have said that given       his role in the development of this Administrations secrecy       policies  he would recuse himself from those questions regarding       the rights of the American people to know about their       Government  Instead  we were served pabulum   At a time when the Senate should       be addressing Americans top priorities  the President and his       Senate allies  instead  try to divide and distract from fixing       real problems by pressing forward with controversial and       unqualified nominations   The Senate Republican leadership is       ready to cater to the extreme right wing and special interest       groups agitating for a fight over judicial nominations  They       have made no secret of the reason for rushing this nomination       through this Committee and to the Senate after it has languished       for three years under Republican control  They want to stir up       a fight    Mr  Kavanaugh is a young and       relatively inexperienced but ambitious person who in two       hearings has failed to demonstrate his capacity for       independence  Because Mr  Kavanaugh has failed to demonstrate       his capacity for independence  I cannot in good conscience       support action on his nomination to one of the Nations highest       courts
