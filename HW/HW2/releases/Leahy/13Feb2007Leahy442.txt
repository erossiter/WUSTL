       Ensuring Human Rights Through Checks And Balances                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Ensuring Human Rights Through      Checks And Balances     Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Second Annual Samuel Dash Conference On Human Rights     Georgetown University Law Center     Washington  D C      February 13  2007       I am deeply grateful to this law school for nurturing my      appreciation for the rule of law in a just and free society  I      thank Dean Aleinikoff for his invitation to be with you  again       today  And it is truly a privilege to be speaking at a conference      honoring Professor Sam Dash  who did so much in his long and storied      legal career to promote civil rights and liberties in this country      and human rights around the world        The last time I was here was two months ago and everyone was in the      middle of first semester finals  I trust all went well  Whenever      the Senate debates a constitutional amendment on school prayer  I      remind other Senators if you want to see evidence that prayer in      school already is alive and well  just drop by any class in the      middle of finals  I know that was true when I attended here  and I      suspect it still is     Subcommittee On      Human Rights And The Law       One of our first actions in the Judiciary Committee in this new      Congress was to establish  for the first time  a new subcommittee      whose focus is human rights and the law  Our new Human Rights and      the Law Subcommittee is being chaired by another Georgetown Law      Center graduate  Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois  and we held our      first hearing just last week  on the subject of genocide     It is our intention that our new      Subcommittee will closely examine some of the vital  often difficult      and sometimes controversial legal issues that increasingly have      landed on the Judiciary Committees doorstep  Many derive from      actions taken by this Administration over the last five years  Its      policies of declaring persons enemy combatants  indefinitely      imprisoning them incommunicado in isolated and dehumanizing      conditions without charge  and denying them access to legal counsel      or to the courts    until the Administration was forced to do so by      the Supreme Court    make our work particularly timely and      increasingly necessary    The United States played the key role      in the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Our      Bill of Rights and our independent judiciary have been models for      other nations for more than 200 years  Justice Jacksons role at      the Nuremberg trials  and our support for war crimes tribunals for      perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity in the former      Yugoslavia  Rwanda and Sierra Leone  are part of a tradition of      which we can be proud    During the last five years  Americas      reputation has suffered tremendously  and along with it  so has our      constructive influence in the world  Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo  and      also  I believe  our refusal to join the International Criminal      Court  after we played a central role in the negotiations on the      Rome Treaty that established it    have tarnished that tradition       The secret prisons that the President confirmed last year and this      Administrations role in sending people to other countries where      they would be tortured have led to condemnation by our allies  legal      challenges and criminal charges  Just last week  our government      declined to join 57 other countries that signed a treaty  already      adopted by the U N  General Assembly  which prohibits governments      from holding people in secret detention  We have condemned      countries in the past for detaining people in secret and then      covering up that detention  but we now choose not to join much of      the rest of the world in condemning this outrageous tactic  which      the President admitted last fall is a tactic our government has been      using   Even more inexplicably  our government      also declined last week to join 58 other countries who signed a      non binding accord banning the use of child soldiers  That is an      abhorrent practice  which has brought misery to so many children      around the world  and I cannot imagine why our government would pass      up this opportunity to condemn it in the strongest possible terms   One of the reasons the image of this      country has been so damaged during recent years is because the world      believed that we stood for something better  They hold us to a      higher standard  and they want us to live up to our own ideals  as      do we all  When we fall short of that standard  it is not only our      reputation that suffers  the cause of justice everywhere also      suffers  And the hope of oppressed and suffering people everywhere      dims whenever we dim our beacon of human rights leadership     In Darfur we see the tragic replay of      suffering and death  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people      killed  or raped  tortured and forced to flee the ashes of their      homes  This was the topic of our new Subcommittees hearing last      week    What happened in Rwanda was  I      believe  among the most egregious failures of the international      community to protect human rights since the Cambodian genocide of      the 1970s  We cannot allow that horror to be repeated     We will do what we can to seek  at      every opportunity  additional humanitarian aid and funding for      international peacekeeping troops in Darfur  We need to ask what      more can be done to convince the Sudanese Government to disarm the      militias that are responsible for the genocide and to allow the      United Nations to deploy additional troops to buttress the African      Union force    We also need to determine whether our      own laws provide adequate authority to prosecute in the United      States acts of genocide by non U S  nationals that occur outside      this country  whether in Darfur or anywhere else           Life Saving Medicines   I am also redoubling my      efforts to reexamine our patent laws in the hope that by making      thoughtful and practical changes  we can greatly increase access to      essential medicines throughout the world  We can help struggling      families in developing nations  while improving U S  relations with      large segments of the worlds population  The current global health      crisis is one of the great callings of our time  Whether it is the      Avian Flu  AIDS  SARS  West Nile Virus  or the approaching menace of      multi drug resistant bacteria  we need to recognize that the health      of those halfway around the world now influences our security and      affects our lives here in the United States  I want the work of the      Judiciary Committee to be a catalyst to help make life saving      medicines more readily available around the world      Iraq  The issue that continues to dominate      the national discussion is the failed policy in the aftermath of the      invasion of Iraq  I imagine that you  like I  know Guardsmen and      Reservists who have been sent to Iraq  sometimes  several times         along with tens of thousands of other brave young women and men        While Republicans in the Senate for      now have prevented a vote and a real debate  I am hopeful that this      debate will come soon  and that a majority of the United States      Senate will get the chance to vote to voice their disapproval of the      Presidents proposal to escalate the war by injecting more of our      forces into the sectarian civil war that now dominates Baghdad and      that country  President Bushs father knew better than to seek to      occupy Iraq  General Colin Powell knew better than to leave our      forces in harms way for years without end    I would go farther than merely      disagree with the Presidents policy  I would act to correct it and      to begin bringing our young men and women home from a conflict that      even the President now admits is not the fight that he thought he      was beginning    As part of the Judiciary Committees      efforts  we held a recent hearing with Congressman Hamilton and      former Attorney General Meese on the Iraq Study Group      recommendations  bipartisan recommendations that have been largely      rejected by the Administration  Our focus was on the Iraqi police      forces  which have been infiltrated and corrupted by partisan      militias and death squads    The police forces have      proven to be among the worst failures of the occupation  The      human rights violations ongoing in Iraq today rival if they do not      surpass those of the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein  These      abuses persist  and the violence grows    We may not be able to control what      others do  but we can control our own actions  Accordingly  I      strongly believe that any American aid must be conditioned on      adherence to the Leahy Law  That law prohibits American aid to      military units that engage in human rights violations  That law      needs to be honored and enforced  not ignored         Oversight And Restoring Checks And Balances   We have begun seeking to      restore constitutional values and the rights of ordinary Americans      here at home and to repair a broken oversight process  in order to      return a measure of accountability to our government      This Administration has      over the last several years brazenly refused to answer the      legitimate oversight questions of the publics duly elected      representatives  and this refusal was routinely enabled by a      Republican controlled Congress  The Administration has acted      outside lawful authority to wiretap Americans without warrants  and      to create databanks and dossiers on law abiding Americans without      following the law and without first seeking legal authorization  I      have noted that this White House seems to skip Article I regarding      congressional authority when it considers the Constitution  Indeed       they have taken their extreme ideology of a unitary executive to      great lengths to strip both Congress and our independent federal      judiciary of their rightful roles     Our constitutional      balance must be restored  Congress has a solemn duty to protect the      rights of the American people and to perform meaningful oversight to      make sure the laws are faithfully followed  Real oversight makes      government more accountable  more effective in keeping us safe  and      more responsive to human rights     I am immensely proud to      be one of the two Senators given the opportunity to represent a      state that boasts such a rich tradition of defending those rights       Vermont was the first colony to abolish slavery  in 1777  Vermont      did not and would not become a state until 1791  the year the Bill      of Rights was ratified  Vermonters have traditionally risen up      against abuses and against infringements of the peoples rights       even when doing what was right was not necessarily popular at the      time    For years  this      Administration had hidden the Presidents program of warrantless      wiretapping of Americans  We all support monitoring the      communications of suspected terrorists  It is essential  and it is      permitted under existing law  It is also essential that when that      monitoring impinges upon the rights of Americans  it needs to be      done lawfully and with adequate checks and balances to prevent      abuses  Initially the Administration stonewalled our inquiries and      claimed unilateral power and a monopoly on deciding what needs to be      done and how to do it  As we pressed for answers  their responses      turned into a demand for sweeping legal authority without any      independent judgment by Congress  or any meaningful answers about      what they have been doing     This year we are working      to restore the balance  and we may be seeing some success  I held      an oversight hearing with the Attorney General in January  It was      then that the Administration reversed itself and agreed to terminate      its warrantless wiretapping of Americans  It was then that the      Administration announced that it could in fact conduct the      wiretapping of terrorist suspects in accordance with the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act and pursuant to court orders  Then we      insisted that Congress be shown the court orders  The      Administration resisted for weeks but has now sent copies to the      Congress  We have a long way to go  but these initial steps show      that things have changed  and we are beginning to make progress and      restore checks and balances  What once was a program outside the      law is now being conducted pursuant to law  pursuant to court order       and subject to congressional oversight  Score one for the rule of      law  for congressional oversight  and for the difference that an      election can make in a free society         Restoring Basic American Values And Human Rights   Another core concern      that strikes close to home are the excesses of the Military      Commissions Act  passed by the Republican Congress in the run up to      the last election  It was wrong to suspend the Great Writ of Habeas      Corpus    a keystone of American liberty    in order to avoid      judicial review that prevents government abuse  That law needlessly      undercut our freedoms and values  and  as I noted at the time  it      allowed the terrorists to achieve something they could never win on      the battlefield  an action from fear rather than strength to      undercut the Constitution  It was a squandered opportunity to write      a good law to set enforceable guidelines for fighting and winning      the war on terror without sacrificing American values and American      leadership on human rights     Justice Scalia wrote in      the Hamdi case  The very core of liberty secured by our      Anglo Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from      indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive  But the bill      written by the White House and passed by the last Congress is      designed to ensure that the Bush Cheney Administration is never      again embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court decision      reviewing its unlawful abuses of power  I am committed to restoring      basic American values to the way we combat terrorism and to      developing a more effective strategy  Working with Senator Specter      and others  I hope that we will succeed   As a result of that sweeping       ill conceived law  we have now eliminated basic legal and human      rights for 12 million lawful permanent residents who live and work      among us  to say nothing of the millions of other legal immigrants      and visitors whom we welcome to our shores each year  This      decimation of basic rights for legal immigrants and visitors follows      on our governments continuing mistreatment and deportation of too      many of the people who come to this country seeking asylum from      persecution abroad  as the bipartisan United States Commission on      International Religious Freedom found just last week     If you saw the movie Babel and were      moved by the toll taken in individual lives by the callous ways that      government can treat people  think about the possible sequel  with      story lines of unlimited detention of innocent people  and our own      government sending people to Syria and to secret prisons to be      tortured  That is not the America we have known or what we want      America to be         Sam Dash is known for his role in helping to rescue our own      government from abuses of power  But he also devoted much time and      effort to defending human rights in far off places like Chile  South      Africa  the former Soviet Union  and Northern Ireland  Someone      aptly called Sam Dash a force for good  His patriotism drove him      to demand the highest standards from our legal system  and from      those who benefit from it  and it also drove him to empathize with      those far away from our shores who yearn for their own human      rights  Many who benefited from his labors will never know his name      or what he did to help protect their rights and to defend their      humanity         As our own difficult experience of the last five years plainly      shows  even though we have the blessings of a remarkable      Constitution  it falls to each generation of Americans to keep its      promise alive         Looking back now  we see so clearly that the internment of Japanese      Americans during World War II was a blot on our constitutional      stewardship  And it didnt make us safer  Our generation now faces      its own tests   The matters I have raised will not be      resolved in an hour or a day  They will be resisted by powerful      forces  They will take sustained effort over weeks and months and      maybe years  I hope that you will think about ways in which you can      help in this struggle  Isnt this why we came here to law school       Isnt this why we are here  Shouldnt each of us  in our own ways       strive  like Sam Dash  to be a force for good
