       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Abuse Of Foreign Detainees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Abuse Of Foreign Detainees      November 8  2005 MR  PRESIDENT       The Bush Administration has steadfastly refused to address the black      mark on our Nation caused by its interrogation policies and      practices and the resulting abuse of detainees  Some of us in      Congress strongly believe that oversight and accountability are      paramount to restoring Americas reputation as a human rights      leader  We have been stymied in our efforts to learn the truth      about how this Administrations policies trickled down from offices      in Washington to cellblocks in Abu Ghraib  Guantanamo  and      Afghanistan   The      Administrations effort  led by Vice President Cheney  to block any      legislation that would regulate the treatment of detainees is      wrong  Also wrong is the Bush Administrations refusal to consider      an independent commission to investigate the abuses  It would      rather rely on internal  piecemeal investigations conducted within      the Defense Department  none of which address the significant role      of the Central Intelligence Agency in interrogations    The Need for an Independent Commission Given the failure      of the Republican controlled Congress to conduct effective      oversight  I support the Levin amendment to the Defense      Authorization bill to establish an independent commission on the      treatment of detainees in U S  custody  I have spoken many times      about the need for a comprehensive  independent investigation into      the abuse of detainees  Such an investigation may not be without      painful  but accountability is a necessary step if we are to recover      from all that has transpired during this Administrations watch        I am not alone in calling for an      independent commission  Several organizations  including the      American Bar Association  Human Rights First  Amnesty International       and Human Rights Watch  have urged the creation of an independent       bipartisan commission to investigate the prisoner abuses  A letter      from eight retired generals and admirals to President Bush asked him      to appoint a prisoner abuse commission modeled on the 9 11      Commission  In that letter  the flag officers stated  internal      investigations by their nature  suffer from a critical lack of      independence  Americans have never thought it wise or fair for one      branch of government to police itself      The 9 11 Commission provides more than      a structural model for a new commission  it also provides a lesson      in how perseverance can overcome the Bush Administrations      inclination to secrecy and to refuse to acknowledge the facts  The      Bush Administration initially opposed the formation of the 9 11      Commission  just as it now opposes a prisoner abuse commission  The      Administration used the same argument against both commissions  It      asserts that its own internal investigations are sufficient       Ironically  Dr  James Schlesinger  the      head of a panel established by Secretary Rumsfeld to investigate the      prisoner abuses  addressed this issue in his testimony to the Senate      Government Affairs Committee in February 2002  as it debated the      need for the 9 11 Commission  He argued for the creation of the      9 11 Commission because to this point many questions have been      addressed piecemealor not at all  The purpose of the National      Commission would be systematically and comprehensively to address      such questionsand to give a complete accounting of the events      leading up to 9 11  In my judgment  such a Commission would serve a      high  indeed indispensable  national purpose  This is exactly the      same reason we need an independent commission to investigate the      prisoner abuse scandals   Ignoring the      problem will not make it go away  Delaying the accounting will not      solve the problems  Each week brings new allegations that reveal      how much we still do not know  Human rights groups and journalists      are doing what they can to bring the truth to light  It is past time      for Congress to hold a thorough  oversight investigation  The least      Congress should finally do is establish an independent commission to      investigate these matters  Rather than wait to read about the      latest discovery of abuse in tomorrows paper  let us at least do      that    McCain Amendment After months of      delay from the Republican Senate leadership  the Senate finally had      an opportunity last month to vote on clear guidance for treatment of      detainees in U S  custody  When we did  the Senate voted      overwhelmingly  90 9  in favor of Senator McCains amendment      to the Defense Appropriations bill  which I was glad to cosponsor      along with Senator Durbin and others   That same      amendment was adopted a second time to the Defense Authorization      bill and I  again  cosponsored it   Our credibility      and reputation as a world leader in human rights has suffered      greatly during the last few years  The scandals have put our own      troops at risk and undermined their efforts in Afghanistan and      Iraq   Many of us have      been working on these issues for years  I first wrote to      Condoleezza Rice in 2003  after reports of deaths of detainees were      reported from the Bagram base in Afghanistan in late 2002  Like so      much we have learned  those first reports came from the press and      human rights groups  not the Bush Administration  The Bush      Administration has threatened to veto any legislation that would      regulate the treatment of detainees  Vice President Cheney is      reported to be personally lobbying on this matter   A group of 28      senior military officers  including General John Shalikashvili       recently wrote to Senator McCain in support of his amendments      addressing detainee treatment  That letter states  The abuse of      prisoners hurts Americas cause in the war on terror  endangers U S       service members who might be captured by the enemy  and is anathema      to the values Americans have held dear for generations   Our      service members were denied clear guidance  and left to take the      blame when things went wrong  They deserve better than that  I      hope the President will consider these words before he vetoes a bill      that contains our amendment    Continuing Need to Address Rendition Prisoner abuse by      U S  personnel is deeply troubling  It is one aspect of a broader      problem  While we must ensure that prisoners are treated humanely      by our own personnel  we must also prohibit the use of so called      extraordinary renditions to send people to other countries where      they will be subject to torture   The Bush      Administration says that it does not condone torture  but      transferring detainees to other countries where they will be      tortured does not absolve our government of responsibility  By      outsourcing torture to these countries  we diminish our own values      as a nation and lose our credibility as an advocate of human rights      around the world   We have addressed      this issue before  Congress implemented Article 3 of the Convention      Against Torture in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act      of 1998  but this Administration has exploited loopholes in that law      to transfer detainees to countries where they are subjected to      torture  Attorney General Gonzales recently said that U S  policy      is not to send detainees to countries where we believe or we know      that theyre going to be tortured  but he acknowledged that we      cant fully control what other nations do  and added that he does      not know whether countries have always complied with their      promises  In fact  they have not  I introduced      legislation in March to close the loophole and to prevent      extraordinary renditions  Now that Congress is finally willing to      regulate the treatment of detainees  a power that is expressly      granted in the Constitution  I hope that the Senate will support my      legislation to prohibit renditions
