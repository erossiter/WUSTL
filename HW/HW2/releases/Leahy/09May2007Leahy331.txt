       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Confirmation Of Debra Ann Livingston                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On The Confirmation Of Debra Ann Livingston   May 9  2007    The Senate continues to make significant progress today    with another confirmation of another lifetime appointment to the federal    bench  The judicial nomination we consider is Debra Ann Livingston of New    York  who has been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the    Second Circuit  That is the Circuit for New York  Connecticut and  of    course  Vermont  Professor Livingston has the support of both her home    state Senators  I thank Senator Schumer for chairing the confirmation    hearing at which she appeared  Professor Livingston is the Paul J  Kellner Professor    of Law and Vice Dean of the Columbia Law School  where she has been a    professor for 13 years  teaching criminal procedure  evidence  and national    security law  She previously taught at the University of Michigan Law    School  Prior to her academic career  Professor Livingston served as a    federal prosecutor and Deputy Chief of Appeals for the U S  Attorneys    Office for the Southern District of New York and worked in private practice    for the Wall Street law firm of Paul  Weiss  Rifkind  Wharton  Garrison  I    congratulate Professor Livingston and her family on what I am sure will be    her confirmation today   Coincidentally  this is the anniversary of the date six    years ago  in 2001  on which this President began his assault upon the    courts by announcing his first list of nominees  With the help of Senate    Republicans  this President has sought to pack the courts and tilt them    decidedly in one direction  To a great extent  he has succeeded  After    Republican Senators stalled President Clintons nominees to the Fourth     Fifth  Sixth  D C   and other Circuits  the Senate proceeded to confirm this    Presidents nominees to the very vacancies that had previously been    maintained by pocket filibuster in the Senate   In my time as Chairman from mid 2001 to the end of    2002  I worked hard to reach out to this President and tried hard to change    the tone and get the confirmation process back on track  We succeeded in    confirming 100 nominees in 17 months  including 17 to the    Circuit Courts  But I could not change the tone alone  This White House    chose  instead  to use judicial nominations to divide and to seek political    gain in the ensuing confrontations   I have tried  again  this year to restore order and    civility to the process  In spite of all our progress and all our efforts     we are still confronted by shrill complaints  More ominous are the signals    and rumors that the White House is  again  gearing up to nominate more    extreme nominees and more who do not have the support of their home state    Senators  That is wrong  It may be the good politics to appeal to the    Republican base  but it is wrong to use our courts in that way    just as it    is wrong to corrupt the law enforcement responsibilities of the Department    of Justice  Some will undoubtedly repeat the current Republican    talking point that the Senate must confirm 15 Circuit judges this    Congress  this year and next  because that is a statistical average of    selected years  Well  during the 1996 session the Republican led Senate    refused to confirm a single Circuit Court nominee  not one  That meant that    in the 104th Congress  in 1995 and 1996 combined  only 11 Circuit    nominees were confirmed   It is true that during the last two years of this    Presidents fathers term  a Democratic led Senate confirmed an    extraordinary number of Circuit nominees  20    in fact  That action was    not reciprocated by the Republican majority during the Clinton years   It is true that during the last two years of the Reagan    Administration  a Democratic led Senate confirmed 17 Circuit court    nominees  That action was not reciprocated by the Republican majority    during the Clinton years   Instead  the last two years of President Clintons two    terms witnessed a Republican led Senate confirming only 11 Circuit nominees    and then  with vacancies skyrocketing to historic highs  15 Circuit nominees    in the 106th Congress   Thus  to get to the supposed historical average that    Republicans like to talk about  they take advantage of the high confirmation    numbers during Democratic led Senates and thereby inflate and excuse their    own actions from the Clinton years   There are three more factors that the Republican    talking point ignores  The first is the number of vacancies  The second is    adding additional judgeships by congressional action  The third is the    number of qualified Circuit nominees   The last Congress of the Reagan Administration  the one    in which a Democratic led Senate confirmed 17 Circuit nominees  the Circuit    Court vacancies went down from 13 to 8 during the course of the Congress     Seven Circuit nominations were returned to the President without action  In    fact  in addition to filling vacancies that were arising in the regular    course  the Democratic led Senate was working to fill many of the 24    additional Circuit judgeships created in 1984  By the end of the Reagan    Presidency all Circuit vacancies  those from existing judgeships and those    created during his Presidency  were reduced from a high of 25 down to 8     During the last Congress of the first Bush    Administration  the one in which a Democratic led Senate confirmed 20    Circuit judges  the Circuit vacancies again went down  from 18 to 16  Again     the Senate was filling both existing and newly created vacancies  In 1990     during President Bushs term  Congress authorized an additional 11 Circuit    judgeships  That was why vacancies at the beginning of the 102nd    Congress rose to 18   By contrast  during the last Congress of the Clinton    Administration  the one in which a Republican led Senate confirmed 15    Circuit judges  Circuit Court vacancies skyrocketed from 17 to 26  This    rise in Circuit vacancies had nothing to do with Congress creating    additional Circuit judgeships  however  Unlike during the Reagan    Administration and during the Bush Administration  during the Clinton    Administration the Republican led Congress refused to act in accordance with    the previous 6 year cycle for reviewing needed judgeships  Not a single new    Circuit judgeship was created during the Clinton Administration that I can    recall  Instead  the Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous efforts to    keep Circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican president     Indeed  at the end of the 106th Congress  the last in the Clinton    Presidency  17 Circuit court nominees were returned to President Clinton    without action  More Circuit nominees were returned without action that    Congress than were acted upon by the Senate for the first time in modern    history   Likewise  during the last Congress of the first term of    President Clinton  the one in which a Republican led Senate confirmed only    11 Circuit judges  Circuit Court vacancies went up  from 16 to 19  Again     this was without the addition of new Circuit judgeships   Despite the carping and the clamor  the vacancies on    the Circuit Courts have gone from 26    where a Republican led Senate forced    the Circuit vacancies at the end of the Clinton Administration    steadily    downward during the Bush Administration  With the confirmation of Judge    Livingston  Circuit vacancies will be at half that amount today 13    and    approaching an historic low  Judge Livingston will be the third Circuit Court    nomination confirmed this year  It is only May  but we have already equaled    the total Circuit nominees confirmed in the entire year of 1993  We have    far surpassed the total confirmed during the entire 1996 session when the    Republican majority would not consider or confirm a single Circuit    nomination of President Clintons   This will be the 20th Circuit Court    nomination confirmed while I presided as Judiciary Chairman  It is a little    known fact that during the more than six years of the Bush Presidency  more    Circuit judges  more District judges and more total judges have been    confirmed while I served as Judiciary Chairman than during either of the two    Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities      This will be the 18th judicial confirmation this year  It is    spring and we have already confirmed more judges than were confirmed during    the entire 1996 session when President Clintons nominees were being    reviewed by a Republican Senate majority  This is the 118th    judicial confirmation while I have served as Judiciary Chairman  That    exceeds by more than a dozen the confirmations Senator Hatch presided over    during the more than two years he was Judiciary Chairman   The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts lists 47    judicial vacancies  yet the President has sent us only 24 nominations for    these vacancies  Twenty three of these vacancies  almost half  have no    nominee  Of the 15 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be    judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees for six of    them  That means more than a third of the judicial emergency vacancies are    without a nominee   This is the third factor I mentioned above  the lack of    nominees   This President has shown that he would rather pick    politic fights than good judges  I was encouraged at the beginning of this    Congress that a few of the most controversial nominees from the last    Congress were not renominated  That sensible approach seems to have ended     however  and this White House seems to be returning to its old  bad habits     Despite the harping and the criticism  the Judiciary    Committee has been working hard to make progress on those nominations the    President has sent to us  Of course  when he sends nominees that he knows    are unacceptable to home state Senators  it is not a formula for success     Sadly  that is what appears to be happening  again  Before the consideration of the Second Circuit nominee    today  we had already proceeded with Committee and Senate consideration of    the nominations of Randy Smith and Thomas Hardiman  They were confirmed to    the Ninth and Third Circuits  respectively   Some may recall that I had been working for more than a    year to make progress on the Smith nomination  When the President finally    renominated Judge Smith for an Idaho vacancy  we were able to make quick    progress with that nomination   Our Circuit Court confirmations so far this year are in    addition to the 15 lifetime appointments to the federal district courts we    have proceeded to confirm  During the entire 1996 session only 17 judges    were confirmed  We are doing pretty well with 18 confirmations before the    middle of May   With respect to Circuit nominees  after this    confirmation there will be only 13 vacancies  Eight of those are without a    nomination  Of the five remaining current Circuit nominees  one was only    nominated a few weeks ago  Having consulted with the home state Senators    from Mississippi  I have scheduled our next judicial confirmation hearing to    be held tomorrow to include Judge Leslie Southwick of Mississippi   All three of the other Circuit nominations are    renominations that were not considered last Congress with a Republican    majority  Two are renominations that the White House made knowing full well    that they did not yet have the support of their home state Senators  When I    previously chaired the Committee  I was able to break the blockade of Sixth    Circuit nominations that was established by the Republican majority when it    pocket filibustered several of President Clintons outstanding nominations    to the Sixth Circuit  Once we broke through with two Sixth Circuit    confirmations in 2002  President Bush was left with seven appointments to    the Sixth Circuit during his term in office  Given the White Houses    unwillingness to work with the home state Senators of the two current    nominees  however  it will be very difficult to make more progress   With respect to the nomination of Peter Keisler  that    renomination is controversial  He was previously nominated in June of 2006    but was not considered by the Republican majority then in control  The    Republican majority did not seek to proceed with this controversial    nomination at that time  In fact  the President and the Republican Senate    majority insisted  instead  to proceed over the last several years on other    nominations to the important D C  Circuit  which were  themselves  highly    controversial  The nominations of Janice Rogers Brown  Thomas Griffith and    Brett Kavanaugh were each apparently a higher priority for this White House    and the Republican majority than the nomination of Mr  Keisler  The others    have each been confirmed to lifetime appointments on this very important    court  At the end of the last Congress  the Keisler nomination was    returned to the President without action in accordance with Senate Rules     The Republican Senate majority pocket filibustered more    than 60 of President Clintons qualified and moderate judicial nominees  I    have proceeded on more judicial nominees far faster than Republicans did on    President Clintons nominees   With the cooperation of the President  with his working    with Senators from both parties in making his nominations  with the    cooperation of the Committee and the Senate  we can continue to make    progress
