       Vermont Inventor Offers Leahy Panel Advice On Patent Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Vermont Inventor Offers      Leahy Panel Advice On Patent Reform   WASHINGTON  MONDAY       APRIL 25     A Waitsfield inventor testified before a panel Monday      led by Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member      of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and Sen  Orrin Hatch  R Utah       that is reviewing the U S  Patent System  The Intellectual Property      Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing  The      Patent System Today and Tomorrow  Leahy  who also serves as the      ranking member of the subcommittee  invited William Parker  CEO and      Director of Research for Diffraction Ltd   of Waitsfield  Vt   to      testify before the committee on challenges facing small inventors      seeking patents  Parker  a successful inventor best known for the      plasma sphere  an interactive plasma demonstration commonly found      in nearly every science museum in the world  has been granted 22      patents worldwide As a successful inventor  Parker offered      recommendations to the Senate panel on making the system more user      friendly for smaller inventors  The testimony of Jon Dudas       Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of      the U S  Patent and Trademark Office is also below           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Democrat  Subcommittee On Intellectual Property     The Patent System Today And Tomorrow     April 25  2005  Today the Intellectual Property      Subcommittee begins its public examination of the myriad issues      faced by our patent system  As I have noted before  the spirit of      American innovation has made the United States the      worlds leader in intellectual property  Yet the expressions of      American innovation  in the form of patented goods and processes       are only as good as the system that fosters and protects them    I share the growing concern about our      patent systems ability to address the many challenges it faces  I      had looked forward to hearing from Jonathan Dudas  the      Undersecretary for Intellectual Property and Director of the U S       Patent and Trademark Office  at a hearing last Thursday  That      hearing was cancelled at the last minute  and I am grateful that Mr       Dudas was gracious enough to rearrange his schedule to be with us      this afternoon  We worked with Mr  Dudas to get him confirmed and      before that when he staffed Republican leadership in the House and      on the House Judiciary Committee  I look forward to continuing our      collaboration as we tackle the patent system in the 21st      century    I am also very pleased to welcome      President Richard Levin of Yale University and Professor Mark Myers      from the Wharton School of Business  They are the authors of the      acclaimed National Academy of Sciences report on patent reform  and      I have no doubt that their continued assistance in this project will      be most useful   The size of the project we are      undertaking seems to be reflected in the number of witnesses we have      at this hearing  and I do want to thank all the witnesses  people      who actually live with the intricacies of our patent system every      day  for appearing today  Let me draw attention to one of those      witnesses  for it is particularly fitting that in discussing      creativity and innovation we have with us someone who we know      understands both and is a Vermonter to boot  I thank Bill Parker      for traveling to Washington today to share his      thoughts with us as an inventor and a spokesperson for inventors       He is part of our wonderful tradition of invention  exemplified by      the fact that the first U S  patent issued  and signed by Thomas      Jefferson  was to a Vermonter    In 2002  the House and Senate directed      the Patent and Trademark Office to develop a five year plan  the      result of which was the PTOs 21st      Century Strategic Plan  designed to modernize  expedite       and improve the process by which patent applications are processed       Parts of that plan are being implemented  and last year I supported      a compromise in the Appropriations Committee that will  for one      year  prevent PTO user fees from being diverted to other government      programs  I am interested in hearing more from our witnesses about      the implementation of the PTOs plan  but I am also very interested      in discussing the proposals we have all been hearing that suggest      improvements to the quality of the patents the PTO is issuing   We know that the PTO faces a Herculean      task  The volume of patent applications has increased roughly      three fold since the 1980s  The PTO receives more than 350 000      patent applications annually  and the office approved 187 000      applications in 2004 alone  That works out to more than 500      approved patents daily       Some say that the high number of approved patent applications is      itself a concern  When non innovative inventions are patented  some      patent holders fear they will spend more time litigating than they      do innovating as a result of predatory tactics  This is a real      problem  and we ought to explore ways to alter the patent      examination process in order to allow for patent challenges before      costly  highly technical litigation is required    In this vein  I am especially      interested in the suggestions that we find ways to allow outsiders      with prior art to present information at the examination stage and      also that we look into the need for improved post grant review      procedures  With careful safeguards  both suggestions may help      reduce unnecessary and costly litigation    At the same time  we are hearing calls      to reform the very ways in which these cases are being litigated       One criticism I have heard is that the standards courts use to      determine whether a patent violation is willful has been applied      in a way that encourages patent holders to wear blinders to what      others invent  We have also heard about abusive litigation      practices of patent trolls  described to me as companies that      neither invent anything new nor produce anything at all  but simply      acquire patent rights and then push the bounds of their patents       suing patent holders who actually do innovate  I am interested in      hearing more about these concerns  as well as proposed solutions      from our witnesses    The concerns I mention are just a few      of the many we have heard about  and I am pleased that patent reform      ranks high on the legislative agenda of the 109th      Congress  Today marks the first hearing of this newly formed      subcommittee and I can think of no better issue to kick off our work      this year than patent reform    As we get started  I look forward to      working with the Chairman and other members of the Subcommittee       Last week the House finally granted final passage to the Family      Entertainment and Copyright Act  This legislative package was      sponsored by a number of us  including Senators Hatch  Feinstein       and Cornyn  We approved it last year and passed it  again  in      February of this year  Chairman Hatch and I worked cooperatively on      that legislative package last year with the result that it has now      been enacted by the Congress  The Family Entertainment and      Copyright Act is an example of a legislative package built through      bipartisan compromise  I look forward to additional legislative      accomplishments through this Subcommittee  as we proceed in a      bipartisan manner                         Statement Of William      Parker Chief Executive      Officer Director of Research     Diffraction  Ltd Perspectives on      Patents     Before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property     Senate Judiciary Committee     April 25  2005  Mr       Chairman  Ranking Member Leahy  and members of the Subcommittee  my      name is Bill Parker and I am the Chief Executive Officer and      Director of Research for Diffraction LTD  a technology and      intellectual property based small business  Thank you for inviting      me to testify today on the very important topic of patent reform        In my      testimony I hope to present some of the views of individual      inventors and other small entities on needed changes to the   United States patent      system  As evidenced by the substantial numbers of innovations and      patents that spring from small businesses around this country  and      the jobs these innovations create or maintain  even our rural      Vermont operation has a role to play in the United States economy      and its highly valued high technologies    My      company  Diffraction LTD is not just small  it is a micro business       This panels members are by and large from large entities  so I will      try to make this presentation as focused as possible on a few issues      of patent reform as they affect individuals and small businesses       My apologies in advance if this testimony takes on a personal      perspective  but perhaps this approach will help us to remember that      it is  still  people that do the inventing   Introduction  Like      many small technology based businesses  our company was founded by      an inventor and patent holder  in our case it was my wife Julie       After earning a graduate degree from MIT  and with little or no      business background  she decided to start her own company to further      develop and capitalize on her skills  talents  inventions and      discoveries  She found it was useful to have a partner in business      with some experience finding funding and navigating the complexity      of intellectual property protection   thats where I came in  As an      inventor from childhood  with some reasonable commercial success  I      had collected a considerable range of experiences learning about the      things one did  and did not do  to capitalize on ones creativity       We started with nothing but a few good ideas   In the      last 15 years our company  now employing over a dozen innovators and      a similarly sized professional support staff  has produced a number      of commercially viable developments in holography  optics       microelectronics and nanotechnology  Some of these discoveries and      intellectual developments have been issued   United States letters      patent  still others are in the patenting process  We have recently      launched an effort to develop innovations that may help win the war      against terrorism  work supported with federal government contracts      as well as our own private funds  Some of our homeland defense      ideas are now in the patent process and will hopefully gain      protection as well    It is      important to note that we believe our intellectual property in the      long term will have a greater value than our tangible output will in      the short term  Said a different way  the product of our minds      probably has more value than the things we can make with our hands       This is a theme you will be hearing frequently in representations      that there is a need for better patent quality  If intellectual      property is not protected with high quality patents  then its value      diminishes or goes away   When      we have done our inventing job well  and the result is a product in      demand  we may need to depend on others to take our innovation to      the market  Like other inventors that choose the licensing route      over manufacturing  we then ask for a royalty payment as a return on      our investment in the innovation  A royalty bearing license or      other payment method is used to transfer the right an inventor has      to monopolize their invention on to another party        Ranging from a few percent and up  a royalty payment is made during      the life of the patent and sometimes longer  with terms and      conditions negotiated between the inventor  licensor  and the      manufacturer  licensee   The licensee using or selling our patented      invention wins because he has gained a protected product or process      without the expensive RD it took to create it  Society wins      because independent innovators can think of new products  processes      or methods unfettered by limits part and parcel with the corporate      decision process or the demands of quarterly profits reporting  As      more large companies outsource innovation to companies expressly      built around the speedy generation of new processes and products       consistent protection is to everyones benefit    That      the  United States is moving      toward an economy where intellectual property  IP  is a significant      element of the GDP is undeniable  That we are doing everything we      can as a country to protect our IP is questionable  The future      world market will need new rules regarding the ownership of ideas       rules that are fair and balanced  I would like to offer an image to      the committee of a day when all the US has to offer the world is IP       a few raw materials and some farm produce  This is a scary      scenario if we are not prepared or able to protect our most      important assets    As it      has since its inception in all other areas  the   United States needs to      take the ethical and legal high ground with robust  creative and      independent approaches required for a fair and equitable marketplace      for ideas  I believe that patent reform efforts now in discussion      can produce the necessary changes in a relevant time period   I      would like to direct my remaining remarks toward recognizing a few      of the critical elements for the success of small technology based      businesses that would be affected by patent reform currently under      discussion    Quality of Patents  The      patent process must be flawless for a patent to be above question       And it must be above question to have any real value  Thorough      examination is all that is required  but as the art becomes more      involved and specialized it is increasingly more difficult to factor      out mistakes of omission  Better access to prior art is part of the      solution  but more is needed in the examination process to prevent a      poor outcome despite a significant amount of time and money being      spent    When      an examination for a foreign filing uncovers prior art that neither      I nor the USPTO examiner had seen before  it leads to a very      uncomfortable feeling of what else didnt we know about  I have      personally seen improvements in this area in the last few years       hopefully due to better resources being applied to the problem       Resources that need still more improvements  i e  more money  as      well as some outside the box thinking on the problem     Money not spent by the PTO to ensure      quality is often spent instead by the patent holders and their      challengers in legal actions  when its too late for anyone to      gracefully back down  Tremendous amounts of money are spent in      challenges when a fraction of that could have often prevented the      problem at its source  This leads to the appreciation that for many      inventors a patent is seen as nothing more than a license to      litigate  We need to do everything we can to dispel that      appreciation   If it is true that other counties tend      to have better prior art examinations than in the US       then perhaps we can determine why  This may be an effect of timing       as our examination may be concluded prior to the commencement of a      foreign one  but it may also be that they know how to do better      examinations  This should be investigated and if we can learn some      new tricks  then lets do it   There is a need for skilled examiners      in emerging technology areas  keep in mind that experts in their      specific art are their customers  From biotechnology to      nanotechnology  in software and microelectronics as well as other      cutting edge fields  the experts are the ones making the inventions       not the ones determining if they are in fact inventions  It is      not easy for an examiner to know enough about an emerging field of      science  and in particular a specialty area of scientific or      technical endeavor  to see the full breadth of a filings impact or      the value of a particular claim   Regardless of what it takes  in      manpower or money  the patent examination process needs to be up to      the task  Entrepreneurs depend on a filed patent to interest      investors  and if the invention succeeds to the point of a patent      but is in fact easily challenged  both sides have wasted time and      money that could have been better spent  Patent filings are      routinely used by entrepreneurs to protect themselves from      confidants that might just as easily become competitors as      customers  Everyone benefits if the product of an examination is      beyond question   A post grant review process      undoubtedly could improve the quality of the patents issued       Despite the fact that it is a good idea  how does the owner best      deal with the wait time in a commercial sense  A patent in limbo      for a year is a scary thing from a commercial perspective  but far      better that a patent in limbo for its entire life  It would be      great to have a system that erased the worry  will the patent that      you are building your business on ever be a sure thing     First to Invent vs       First to File  You      will hear much about why we should move to a First to file      approach  It sounds like a good approach in many ways for      individual inventors  and for the system in general  but in fact it      poses a few big problems for small entities    Due to      the high cost of building prototypes or laboratory work  it takes a      small inventor longer to go from idea to reduction to practice  and      without a sufficient test of reality a patent filing is more      difficult to put through the PTO and more suspect when it is  A      one year grace period following a provisional patent filing is the      best protection afforded a small entity   unless it takes over a      year to assemble the required funding and then verify the invention       as it often does         Perhaps there are ways to optimize the first to file approach that      levels the playing field with bigger entities  Different rules are      already in play for filing costs  why not extend those benefits in      other ways as well  A number of efforts are in place to help small      entities short circuit this issue of costs to reduce ideas to      practice  such as the Small Business Innovative Research  SBIR       program  but even then only a small fraction of innovative ideas      obtains support toward a reduction to practice    International Protection for Small      Entities  We      should always be looking for additional ways to encourage the      creativity and capabilities of the countrys small inventor      entities  reduce their costs in obtaining patents  and give them      enough extra protection in the world market to keep them  and us       competitive  When our best ideas are being copied wholesale      overseas it does nothing to reinforce the inventors or the publics      belief in and support of the patent system   An      issue I hear frequently from independent inventors is how they can      do nothing to stop overseas copying of their inventions  When I ask      them how they know they are being infringed  they tell me they see      their inventions in big chain stores here in the   US  What may be      needed is both a better understanding of the rights of an inventor      to compel a seller of their invention to cease and a less expensive      and more responsive means in the courts to enforce this right        Need for Injunctive      Relief  Not      all inventors are opportunists or patent predators  A lot of talk      is aimed at protecting big businesses from the actions of a few      opportunists that would try to use the system in ways it was not      meant to be used  If a court reads a situation such that in its      estimation harm is coming to the patent holder by way of an      infringement  then injunctive relief should be available to the      plaintiff  Some would say that the use of a permanent injunction      is excessive  particularly if the patentee does not intend to      manufacture the invention themselves  In some ways this is exactly      counter to the purpose of a patent as a means to bring new products      or processes into commerce   There      is  however  a need to recognize and protect the value independent      inventors and other small entities bring to the commercialization      party  But how best to accomplish this  when there is such a      large range of ways patents can be used  and misused  A patentees      ability to operate in the commercial sense is in part determined by      how well they are able to control their intellectual property  with      whom they do a deal and under what terms  If their invention has      been infringed  willfully or otherwise  and the infringer is not      compelled to cease  then not only has the inventors rights been      abridged  but so has their earning power  Another deal  with      another manufacturer at a higher royalty rate and with a larger      commercial value could have been the outcome of a clean  preferably      exclusive  licensing relationship  Because an infringer is willing      to pay a royalty  it is not an indication that they are willing to      respect the rights of the patentee in the broader sense  In these      cases commerce in general suffers  and the full potential of the      patent is in question    Conclusion  I      speak for many of my small entity colleagues when I thank the      Committee for this opportunity to be at the table during this      hearing  We only ask for more chances to provide views to Congress      on this important topic and for more presence on advisory boards      during the patent reform debate   I      personally thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today       Mr  Chairman  and I offer my continuing efforts to find  or invent       ways to make our patent system work for the 21st century      and beyond   Statement Of The Honorable Jon      W  Dudas     Under Secretary Of Commerce For Intellectual Property And      Director Of The United States Patent And Trademark Office     Before The Subcommittee On Intellectual Property     Committee On The Judiciary     United States Senate     The Patent System  Today And Tomorrow     April 21  2005         Introduction    Chairman Hatch  Ranking      Member Leahy  and Members of the Subcommittee     Thank you very much for      inviting me to testify today  I commend you for holding this hearing      appropriately named the Patent System  Today and Tomorrow  This is      a particularly appropriate time to reflect upon the incredible      success of innovation and of our patent system in the  United States  It was      215 years ago this month that our young nation adopted its first      patent statute  On April 5  1790  your predecessors in the Senate      passed the final version of the statute  and President George      Washington signed it into law on April 10     The benefits of our      patent system have always been obvious to Americans  You are      familiar with Article 1  Section 8  Clause 8 of the U S       Constitution  granting Congress the power to promote the progress      of science and the useful arts  by securing for limited times to      authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective      writings and discoveries  James Madison wrote in one of the      Federalist Papers  The utility of this power will scarcely be      questioned  He was right  That clause was adopted into the      Constitution without a dissenting vote    without even any recorded      debate     The need for a statutory      system to examine and grant patents was just as obvious  President      Washington signed the first patent statute 215 years ago    before      our nation even had its 13th state  History has repeatedly affirmed      the wisdom of this decision of our Nations founders  The tremendous      ingenuity of American inventors  coupled with an      intellectual property system that encourages and rewards innovation       has propelled our nation from a small agrarian society to the      worlds preeminent technological and economic superpower         The flexibility and strength of our patent system have helped entire      industries flourish  rather than perish  Everyone has benefited from      the innovative products encouraged by this system  And all of the      technology encouraged by the patent system finds its way to the      public domain within 20 years    freely available to any and all             The success of the patent system is not limited to the  United States  It is the basis for economic development in      nations throughout the world  Unfortunately  a growing chorus of      critics is asking if the fundamental patent system that has been so      critical to the growth of innovation and economic success in the      United States and other nations will enhance or hinder development      in their nations         Today  many of the nations questioning the efficacy of an      intellectual property system have become hotbeds for the manufacture      and export of counterfeit goods  Unsurprisingly  some of the nations      that allow their citizens to counterfeit and pirate others      intellectual property are the very ones questioning a system that      encourages and rewards innovation  and discourages copying and free      riding    The USPTO Today and      Prominent Issues   In the last several years       intellectual property  IP  assets have become an ever more essential      ingredient of economic vitality  In the past  raw materials and      other tangible goods were the main drivers of an economy  Today       economic success depends increasingly on intangible       information based assets  such as the creativity of employees and      the knowledge gained from research  As a result  intellectual      property based industries  such as biotechnology and entertainment       now represent the largest single sector of the U S       economy  In fact  IP industries export more American value to the      world than the automobile  automobile parts  agricultural  and      aircraft industries combined    As the clearinghouse for  U S  intellectual property rights  the USPTO is an important      catalyst for U S  economic growth  Through the grant of patents and      the registration of trademarks  the USPTO promotes the economic      vitality of businesses and entrepreneurs  paving the way for      investment capital  research and scientific development    We are proud of our 200 year old      legacy of partnership with America  providing the      tools for our nation to become a technological and economic giant       To continue this partnership  we must remain the best      patent examination system in the world  To ensure on going success       the USPTO must focus on improved quality and productivity  To ensure      timely grant of rights  we must reduce our backlog of patent      applications by increasing our efficiency and taking advantage of      our automation efforts   Intellectual      Property  Increasing Importance and Complexity    Globally  intellectual property      protection is more relevant than ever  Worldwide  12 million patent      applications are pending in the European Patent Office  the Japan      Patent Office  and various national patent offices  Without      question  the growing importance of intellectual property protection      has a direct impact on the USPTO  Patent applications in the  United States have more than doubled since 1992  In the last      five years alone  biotechnology related patent filings at the USPTO      increased 46 percent  while pharmaceutical and chemical related      filings climbed 42 percent  As a result  the USPTO issued more      patents last year alone  173 000  than it did during the first 40      years of its existence    While the sheer volume of applications      is staggering  the technical complexity of patent applications is      escalating rapidly  In 1905  more than one third of      U S  patent filings were bicycle related  Today  the USPTO routinely      examines patent applications in areas such as nanotechnology       bio informatics  and combinatorial chemistry     art areas that      didnt even exist one hundred years ago  Some patent applications      are received on CD ROMs  containing literally the equivalent of      millions of pages of data on paper    The Patent      Applications Backlog   The dual trends of increased volume      and complexity of patent applications filed pose significant      challenges for the USPTO  While the volume and technical complexity      of patent applications have increased significantly  our capacity to      examine patent applications has not risen at the same rate  The      result is a pending application backlog of historic proportions  In      essence  we face a unique historical challenge  how to handle record      levels of complex work in an efficient manner  without the benefit      of a precise role model    Patent pendency  the amount of time a      patent application is pending before a patent is issued  now      averages more than two years  In more complex art areas such as      data processing technologies  average pendency stands at more than      three years  Without fundamental changes in the way USPTO operates       average pendency in these areas could double by 2008  Moreover       without intervention  the backlog of applications awaiting a first      review by an examiner could grow from its current level of      approximately 500 000  to over 1 000 000 by 2010    To put these pendency numbers in      perspective  in 1981 when the U S  patent system was      faced with a workload crunch  U S  News  World Report published an      article on the situation entitled Patent System a Drag on      Innovation  At that time  average patent pendency was 22 months and      the backlog of unexamined cases was 190 000  Today  as the numbers      above show  the pendency predicament is far more dramatic    The problem arises because both the      nature of technology and the nature of the marketplace make long      processing delays unacceptable    and unsustainable     If intellectual property protection is      to continue to serve its purpose as a catalyst for technological      innovation and economic growth  the USPTO must fundamentally break      with the status quo  If we are to issue quality patents and register      quality trademarks in a timely manner  we must fundamentally reform      the way we do business  Fortunately  Mr  Chairman  thanks to the      leadership you and many of your colleagues in the House have shown       the USPTO has been appropriated the funds we need to face these      challenges  We know  however  that simply using appropriated      resources will not alone do the job  We must be prudent in      developing the processes that will make the patent system more      effectively serve its purposes    Summary of Critical      Issues   Due to the record growth that began in      the 1990s and continues today  the USPTO is facing a record workload      crisis  The rate of growth of patent applications has slowed  but we      continue to receive record numbers of applications every year       Unless the bold new actions described below are taken  progress on      our quality enhancement and electronic government initiatives will      be in jeopardy  the backlog of unexamined patent applications will      skyrocket  and average patent pendency will dramatically increase         USPTO  Working to      Improve our Patent System       Given our workload challenges  we are considering a variety of      internal reforms that will continue to enhance patent quality and      address our increasing pendency challenges  It is our responsibility      not only to do everything we can to perfect the patent system in the      United States    something you too are doing by holding this      hearing  We must actively educate the world that it is fundamentally      the best patent system         The right fundamentals alone though are not enough  I am the first      to acknowledge that even the best system in the world can and must      improve  Today  we are implementing a range of improvements and are      building on existing initiatives  We are also working on a series of      potential legislative improvements to the system  The future      requires that we work both domestically and with our international      counterparts to develop the best patent system  in terms of patent      quality and performance   for inventors both here at home and      abroad    We applaud the Committee for examining      our patent system with an eye to improvements that it can make  We      are also looking internally at the improvements that the USPTO can      make through the authority that Congress has given it     Making commitments and keeping them      has led to some successes throughout the USPTO organization       including the implementation of the Presidents Management Agenda      and the 21st Century Strategic Plan  The USPTO is now      better equipped to handle the many important challenges that face      our nation and our IP system at home and abroad    Earlier this year  the USPTO announced      additional initiatives that will improve quality and      efficiencyincreasing transparency  internally improving ex parte      reexamination  and saving applicants tens of millions of dollars by      revamping our process concerning the submission of appeal briefs by      applicants during the examination process  We continue to make      commitments  and we will continue to keep them    Improving      Transparency and Enhancing Quality   As a measure to enhance quality and      public confidence in our office  I have committed the USPTO to      provide improved transparency in our operations  The USPTO will      continue to report to the public more information  better      information  and more meaningful information about our office and      its performance  You will see us measure ourselves more often  more      intensely  and with more useful data    data that will not only      report quality and pendency statistics at the USPTO  but will      present a basis for improvement    While implementing electronic tools to      assist employees of the USPTO in doing their jobs  the USPTO has      also provided Public PAIR    the Patent Application Information      Retrieval system    to assist and benefit the public  Public PAIR      allows anyone access to the entire file history of an application       including access to images of every paper of record for every      published application in our database  With the click of a mouse       Public PAIR provides innovators information that is critical to      understanding how a technology is evolving  This will help American      industry better target its research and development investments  and      be more responsive to the demands of the national and global      marketplaces  Its counterpart for unpublished applications         Private PAIR    lets applicants access the entire file history of      their applications in our Image File Wrapper  IFW  database       saving time for both applicants and examiners  These systems are      truly milestones of achievement for the agency    In the past  our pre grant sampling of      allowed patent applications showed an error rate that fluctuated      between 3 percent and 7 percent  Our metrics were not as effective      as they could have been in helping us evaluate and train our      examiners about what went wrong and how to avoid that type of error      in the future  Starting with the 21st Century Strategic      Plan  we re assessed ourselves  Today  we conduct more general      reviews and more in process reviews  We now have meaningful data      from which to calculate quality baselines  We use that information      to identify points of error  and thereby to adjust training and      interactions with examiners to improve our processes and our      examination    We now review more work  and we review      it in a smarter way  In some areas  we have tripled our number of      reviews  We are looking at our error rates more deeply  and      dissecting the issues causing errors  We can and are developing      specialized training for examiners based on results from in process      reviews of our examiners work  And  as an enhanced quality measure       we have expanded a second pair of eyes review in certain      technology areas    Finally  until recently  our pendency      measures were not meaningful enough from the perspective of managing      an office  Old ways of measuring pendency did not illuminate all      issues and could be misleading  As noted above  precise information      regarding both pendency and our backlog is critical to informed      management decisions  I have directed that our pendency statistics      be supplemented by additional measures that more fully reflect the      current state of affairs in the USPTO  with the goal of identifying      specific ways in which we can improve    Our users will now know more of what      we know  Provided with better information  our customers can have      enhanced insight to the patent examination process and will be      encouraged to offer constructive recommendations for systemic      improvement    Improving the Reexamination Process       Many of the quality issues raised and      debated today in the patent system are within our reexamination      system  Without entering the debate on the limitations of inter      partes reexamination  legislative improvements  or even post grant      review  there is no question that the USPTO can do much to improve      the reexamination process    By way of background  we are focused      on improving the reexamination process because it is an opportunity      for the public to assess patentability without resorting to costly      litigation  An ex parte reexamination proceeding is conducted within      the USPTO when any person  including the patentee  submits a      substantial new question as to the patentability of the subject      matter of an issued patent  The statute authorizing reexamination      proceedings requires the USPTO to conduct this process with special      dispatch  Frequently  these proceedings require more than 100 hours      of examiner time to complete  And today  a large number of      reexamination proceedings have been pending before the USPTO for      more than four years without resolution  We are just as dissatisfied      with these results as are the stakeholders in the system     As I mentioned earlier  reexamination      proceedings are important to patent owners and to the public as a      means of resolving the issue of patentability without resorting to      the high cost option of litigation  In these proceedings  both      timeliness and correctness of the decision are important to all      parties to provide certainty of intellectual property rights       Therefore  we have an especially important duty to get it right here      with special dispatch  However  many reexams are complex and      time consuming  Sometimes there is intentional delay on the part of      those outside the USPTO  which can add to the time it takes us to      process reexams    Proposed Reexamination Improvements       To address issues of timeliness and      correctness of the decision  the USPTO will implement a new process      for handling reexamination proceedings  Our goal is that  by the end      of FY 2005  we will have resolved all instances of ex parte      reexamination proceedings that have been pending with an examiner      for more than two years  Specifically  of the current 1 200 pending      ex parte reexamination proceedings  we hope to resolve 420  or over      one third of our current reexamination workload  If we had not      undertaken this challenge  the total number of reexaminations      pending for more than two years would have risen to 600 by the end      of this year  An additional commitment is that  by the end of FY      2005  the USPTO will set a defined time period for all future ex      parte reexamination proceedings to be completed before the examiner       and the period will be less than the two years achieved in fiscal      year 2005    A similar clean up effort is being      conducted for all inter partes reexamination proceedings now pending      before the USPTO  To address the issue of the correctness of the      decision  the USPTO will require supervisory review of all USPTO      decisions in any reexamination proceeding  It is expected that this      process will employ a panel of least three supervisors and senior      patent examiners  Further  by the end of this fiscal year  the USPTO      will establish firm processing time periods for all reexamination      proceedings ordered  after the Office order for reexamination  on or      after October 1  2005  for both ex parte and inter partes      reexamination proceedings    Making Pre Brief      Appeal Conferences More Citizen Centered   Pre Brief Appeal Conferences are      another area where we are implementing the President s Management      Agenda mandate that government be citizen centered  not      bureaucracy centered  and results oriented  by eliminating certain      patent processing costs for citizens    Today  when an applicant wants to      appeal a patent rejection with the Board of Patent Appeals and      Interferences  BPAI   the applicant must file a Notice of Appeal and      an Appeal Brief outlining why the examiner s position is in error       The next step is an Appeal Conference with the examiner who decided      the claims were not patentable  joined by the examiner s supervisor      and another experienced examiner or supervisor  Only after this      conference does the examiner prepare an Examiner s Answer explaining      why the application is not allowable    Currently  after the Appeal      Conference  approximately 60 percent of cases are not      forwarded to the BPAI for a decision  A conservative estimate of      costs to applicants for preparing and filing the 60 percent of the      Appeal Briefs that are never forwarded to the BPAI is  30 000 000       To save applicants at least  30 000 000 annually  the USPTO will      implement a program in the third quarter of FY 2005 that allows      applicants to request an Appeal Conference before preparing      an Appeal Brief    For a Pre Appeal Brief Conference  it      is not necessary for the members of the Appeal Conference to review      the full Appeal Brief to determine whether the examiner s action on      that particular application was proper and should proceed to appeal       If the Appeal Conference determines that the examiner s decision was      not proper  the applicant will be notified that an appeal to the      BPAI is not necessary at this time  thereby saving the applicant the      cost of preparing and filing an Appeal Brief  If the Appeal      Conference determines that examiner s decision was proper  the      applicant will be notified to file an Appeal Brief in order for the      application to go forward to the BPAI for a judicial decision  To      assist in this evaluation  the USPTO has this month  April 2005       initiated a new pilot program to create a corps of appeal conference      specialists  who will be trained in the way that the BPAI judges      would review an appeal once it reached the Board    Post Grant Review   As part of our 21st Century      Strategic Plan  we proposed a legislative initiative  Post Grant      Review  to address patent quality  as well as the badly needed      patent litigation reform that is being advocated in many quarters       Post Grant Review has great support among all major patent interest      groups  including the bar  technology companies  academicians  and      others seeking patent reform  Simply put  post grant review will      give the public another vehicle for reviewing the quality of issued      patents  We believe our proposal promotes innovation by ensuring      that the patent system is fair to all  By fairness  we mean it      promotes a patent system where flaws in issued patents can be      quickly and expertly revealed  without exposing a patent holder to      frivolous or even mischievous review and uncertainty  We look      forward to working with the Committee in helping it design the most      effective and fair post grant review process   Other Reform      Initiatives   We have increasingly recognized that       when the USPTO receives 375 000 patent applications a year  the task      of maintaining and improving a sound patent system must be shared by      patent applicants and their representatives  as well as by the USPTO       One aspect of the Strategic Plan addressed the concept of shared      responsibility through a proposal for mandatory continuing legal      education for registered patent practitioners with respect to laws      affecting practice before the USPTO  We are currently developing the      means for making such education equally available to all      practitioners via the Internet and through Continuing Legal      Education  CLE  providers    As an agency  we are focusing our      operational improvement initiatives on our examiners and other      employees who are keys to the success of the patent system  We are      using a better training process  and are updating our employees      skills throughout their careers    I do not purport to have all the      answers to address all the challenges faced by the patent system       However  I can assure you that we are reviewing the USPTOs role as      part of the system  and we will welcome the opportunity to share      what we learn with you and how we believe we can appropriately      address the issue of application quality    I certainly will not shy away from      focusing on how we can improve processes at the USPTO  As you know       we have spent the last three years doing just that  and I am      thankful that you passed legislation that will give us many of the      tools we need to make the necessary improvements  I fully appreciate      that you will hold the USPTO agency accountable for addressing      shortcomings and am confident that we will deliver results on issues      of concern    Over Two Full      Centuries of Partnership With Customers   Our system continues to prove its      strength through the new inventions described in patent applications      we see every day  the growth of investment  and the fact that the      Office receives record numbers of applications each year  i e        375 000 new patent applications last year alone   We encourage new      applications  Unfortunately  many of the applications we are      examining are not new  In fact  an important exacerbating factor      with respect to the tremendous volume of the workload is the amount      of rework cases we see in the form of continuation applications       While there may have been a time where the system could afford      duplication and redundancy  that time has passed    We have an incredibly dedicated core      of patent examiners and technical support staff  I have met with      hundreds of examiners individually  collectively  in tech center      meetings  at union meetings  at retirement parties  and just walking      the halls  Those who stay and make a career at the USPTO are      dedicated  engaged  and knowledgeable  They not only know their art       but also are keenly aware of the outside pressures on our office        Interestingly  the number one      challenge I hear from examiners is that of problems with incoming      application quality  The comments from our examiners emphasize to      me  possibly more than anything else  how much of a shared      responsibility patent quality is and improvement to the patent      system    The Impact of Continuations on the      USPTO   Last year  more than 100 000 of the      355 000 applications filed with the USPTO were iterations of      applications that had previously been reviewed by an examiner  That      is  more than one third of the applications received last year were      not  strictly speaking  new  Rather  they represented a form of      re work  This rework is a significant challenge for reaching new      applications  because so called continuations represent additional      work on subject matter that has already been reviewed in examination      and  in some instances  even issued as a patent  Continuations  or      re work  can take a variety of forms  A continuation  per se  is      a second application for the same invention claimed in a prior      nonprovisional application and filed before the original prior      application becomes abandoned or patented  A divisional      application is a later filed application for an independent or      distinct invention  carved out of a pending application and      disclosing and claiming only subject matter disclosed in the earlier      or parent application  An RCE  request for continued examination       is available in an application where prosecution is closed  at the      request of the applicant  Given the ever increasing workloads we      face  it is necessary and appropriate for all to consider whether      some restrictions should be placed upon so called continuation      practices    Patent Applications and the Number of      Claims   Patent applicants include  as part of      their application  patent claims that ultimately define the legal      metes and bounds of the protection when a patent is granted  Thanks      to your efforts last year  the USPTO now receives additional funding      to support our examination function through fees based upon the      number of claims presented for examination  Tying increased fees to      increased numbers of claims inserts the right monetary incentives in      the system  What is not immediately evident is that even a      relatively small number of applications containing a large number of      claims present efficiency challenges  Complexity of analysis is      directly related to the number of claims presented  and large      numbers of claims immediately affect our examiners ability to      conduct the high quality examination we all expect from our patent      system  It is not solely a question of time  Large numbers of claims      may involve numerous interactions with possibilities not envisioned      by even the applicant  Accordingly  the burden imposed by such      large claim applications  even when received in relatively small      numbers    can impede our ability promptly to examine applications      relating to other inventions  At the same time  we must certainly      recognize the legitimate need for applicants to present large      numbers of claims in some applications    What we must do is find the right      balance  We must find ways in which inventors can submit large      numbers of claims when needed  while making it feasible for      examiners to effectively analyze a plethora of claims  Currently       about 7 percent of applications present about 25 percent of the      patent claims we examine  That is  a minority of applicants  7        creates more than 25  of the claims review work  We are considering      the possibility of requiring applicants who file these so called      super sized applications to help us by identifying the relevant      issues    Increased Applicant Responsibility       We are also considering additional      rules changes that would require those applicants who place      relatively greater stresses on the system to assist the USPTO with      efficient processing of applications  For example  applications      filed with large numbers of claims represent challenges to timely      processing  particularly for examination  Applications filed with      large numbers of prior art references  without any guidance as to      which references the applicants believes to be most relevant  have      an impact on efficient examination  We believe that the patent      system as a whole is better served where applicants work in      partnership with the USPTO to take responsibility for efficient      processing of applications  We want a patent examination system that      gets it right the first time  Concentrating our review on the most      pertinent information relevant to patentability is an efficient      means to get it right the first time  For applicants  quick       accurate focus on relevant prior art means their applications are      properly assessed  and amendments or changes to the patent      application and claims can be suggested with confidence  Ensuring      such a focused examination is a joint responsibility of the examiner      and the applicant  By working to improve the ways that the best       most relevant information comes before the examiner  we will best      achieve the goal we all share of high quality patent grants that      have the respect and trust of the entire patent community  both      domestically and internationally     The USPTO and      Tomorrow        The USPTO is a team of 7 000 people  including scientists       engineers  and PhDs  many of whom spend their time considering how      we might improve our patent system  A multitude of others outside of      the USPTO also are reflecting upon our system  and are likely to      approach you with suggested changes         While we have much to be proud about in our system  there is much      talk about whether our patent system should be reformed  Two recent      reports by the Federal Trade Commission and the National Academies      of Sciences call for a variety of patent system reforms  While such      studies have earned enormous attention from the media  it is      important to underscore that much of what they discuss is not new       In fact  several of the proposals suggested reflect ideas that were      first developed and discussed by the USPTO         At the USPTO  we have had experts working on patent reform issues      for decades  We welcome the discussion of many of these initiatives      as part of a legislative package that you may introduce later this      year  We presently are hearing of legislative proposals in three      general categories  operational issues  litigation reform  and      convergence of international laws and best practices  In my view       each of these discussions must center on how the patent system      encourages innovation  and how well it serves the public at large        In my capacity as the Under Secretary      of Commerce for Intellectual Property and the Director of the Office      that must examine these applications  I am pleased to work with you      on patent reform on behalf of the Administration  We are grateful      for your support and enactment of the revised fee schedule last      November that will help fund the Plan  Since the bill that passed      was different from the Administrations original submission  we are      working to ensure that the USPTOs strategic goals can be met       consistent with the parameters of the modified fee schedule in place      for two years  We need to work creatively to achieve the gains in      light of the record workload that patent system faces today     Like you  we are tasked with looking      at patent issues from every angle  We must look at them from the      perspective of the independent inventor  who may be the next Thomas      Edison  to the perspective of a large  successful company that      believes its innovations are being frivolously undermined by      unnecessary legal obstacles  We must look at these proposals from      the perspective of an economic superpower negotiating treaties to      create a better intellectual property system internationally  to the      perspective of the American consumer who may not care about patents      but is affected greatly by the effects of our patent system     The increasing importance of trade in      IP industries to the world economy has also increased calls for      substantive harmonization and cooperation among intellectual      property offices  At the same time  it has put pressure on the      international organizations concerned with intellectual property  As      we at the USPTO are working internally to improve our systems  we      are also working with our trading partners to ensure that the world      IP system becomes more effective    Developments in      International Patent Law   A strong U S  patent system is not      enough for American innovators  whether in established businesses       independent entrepreneurs and start ups  or non profits  While      patent rights are territorial  the opportunities and challenges in      the international arena are incredible  both in the near  and long       term  Critics have observed that there is growing anti IP sentiment      internationally  and in some domestic circles  This sentiment has      even  in some instances  spilled into the World Intellectual      Property Organization  WIPO   The simplest patent harmonization      efforts recently have been met with obstruction and procedural      tactics  We must work hard to achieve a consensus at WIPO  and      ideally  we should have every nation agree on intellectual property      reforms  We cannot have a few nations obstructing the process on      reforms that will benefit them and the rest of the world     The USPTO has been successful in      launching a process to bring together interested international      parties to establish a work plan for progress on substantive patent      law harmonization  In February 2005  we held an inaugural meeting in      the United States  which was attended by 20 nations  the European      Union  and the European Patent Office  This meeting resulted in the      unanimous decision to establish a technical working group for the      express purpose of discussing certain areas of patent law      harmonization  1   Building on this momentum  subsequent      WIPO sponsored consultations resulted in a general statement      regarding a suitable work plan for proceeding with patent law      harmonization within WIPO  2 Continuing work on these      parallel tracks will lead us closer to immediate benefits that will      inure to the patent community and patent offices worldwide  This      dual approach will be encouraged for other IP related issues as      well    However  a challenge we face is the      use of Patent Cooperation Treaty  PCT  fees paid to WIPO  At WIPO       less than  1 out of every  3 goes to the Office of the Patent      Cooperation Treaty  PCT   As a result  the United States and a      handful of other developed nations effectively are the net donors to      the WIPO  while the remaining 174 nations are net receivers  These      net receivers are the beneficiaries of the fees Americans pay  which      do not go to PCT operations    I am happy to say we were successful      in protecting against further PCT fee increases last year at WIPO       We staunchly opposed a proposal and then stopped a provision that      would have raised fees another 12 7 percent more than the previous      years  This saved U S  applicants more than  20 million annually        We must keep in mind that proposals      exist to fundamentally change the WIPO charter and philosophy         from one that promotes intellectual property and its protection to a      more amorphous charter of balancing intellectual property rights       We have no quarrels with balance     in fact  we believe our      current system and international norms are properly balanced  But      simply put  this new balancing act is a strategy to water down      intellectual property protection  and the U S  will fight this       Clearly  our future efforts around the world on IP issues hold even      greater opportunities and challenges as we continue to promote      strong  global IP protection that keeps pace with technological      development    Conclusion    I take this opportunity to reiterate      to you  the Members of the Subcommittee  our commitment to ensuring      that USPTOs practices and policies promote the innovation and      dissemination of new technologies  While we work to improve our      system by internal reform of USPTO operations  we realize that      additional measures within the domain of Congress can also make      invaluable contributions         The overwhelming evidence of the history of the U S  patent system      suggests that strong intellectual property protection supports       rather than impedes  innovation  Indeed  for more than 200 years       our patent system has helped American industry flourish  creating      countless jobs for our citizens  Advanced technologies have been         and continue to be    nurtured and developed in our nation to a      degree that is unmatched in the rest of the world  In many      instances  the availability of patent protection has been integral      to these advancements         In this regard  the USPTO and the Administration look forward to      continuing to work with you and the Members of the Subcommittee as      you develop reform legislation to ensure that the U S  patent system      remains the envy of the world    Thank you  Mr  Chairman    Notes         1 Statement and Participants of the Exploratory Meeting of      Interested Parties Concerning the Future of Substantive Patent

genetic      resources  in the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual      Property and Genetic Resources  Traditional Knowledge and Folklore  IGC        Each of the SCP and the IGC should agree
