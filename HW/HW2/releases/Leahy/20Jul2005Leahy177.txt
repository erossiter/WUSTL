       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts    Jr  To Be Associate Justice Of The United States Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts  Jr  To Be Associate Justice     Of The United States Supreme Court     Senate Floor     July 20  2005  Capping days of public speculation      that he would name Judge Edith Clement or Attorney General Alberto      Gonzales  President Bush made a dramatic evening announcement of his      intention to nominate Judge John Roberts to succeed Justice Sandra      Day OConnor on the United States Supreme Court  Now the Senate has      a job to do  It must fulfill its constitutionally mandated duty to      ensure that those who receive lifetime appointments to our highest      court will protect the rights and liberties of all Americans  uphold      our Constitution and our laws  and be impartial in their judicial      approach    The President has announced his      choice  The Senate must rise to the challenge and get to work  To      fulfill our constitutional duties we need to consider this      nomination as thoroughly and carefully as the American people      deserve  That will take time and the cooperation of the nominee and      the Administration  That will require Republicans as well as      Democrats to take seriously our constitutional obligations on behalf      of all the American people  not just a select few     Justice OConnor serves as a model      Justice  She is widely respected by  America as a jurist with common sense      and practical values who brought no agenda from the far right or the      far left  She did not prejudge cases  She cast the critical      deciding vote in a number of significant cases  and her legacy of      fairness is one that all Americans should want to see preserved       For 24 years on the Supreme Court  she has tried to decide them      fairly and with an open mind  I thank her for her service to the      country and her graciousness in agreeing to serve until her      successor is considered and confirmed by the Senate and appointed by      the President    I regret that some on the extreme      right have been so critical of her and so adamantly opposed to a      successor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities  Their      criticism reflects their own narrow mindedness and biased agenda       It does nothing to tarnish the record of the first woman Justice of      the United States Supreme Court  I have noted that our neighbor to      the north  Canada  also has a Supreme Court with nine members  but      four of them are women  including the Canadian Chief Justice  I      look forward to the time when the membership of the United States      Supreme Court is more reflective of  America    I know that Hispanics across the      country are disappointed that the President has missed this      extraordinary historic opportunity to pick a candidate who would      have made the Court more diverse  There was no dearth of      highly qualified individuals who could well have served as unifying      nominees while adding to the diversity on the Supreme Court        Reports last week mentioned Judge      Sonia Sotomayor of the Second Circuit and Judge Edward Prado of the      Fifth Circuit  Certainly they were the kinds of candidates worthy      of consideration  Judge Sotomayor was first appointed to the      federal court by President George H W  Bush  the Presidents      father  Judge Prado was first appointed by President Reagan and      elevated to the circuit by President Bush himself  There are many      outstanding Hispanic judges  and African American judges  who could      have added to the diversity of the Supreme Court and made it more      representative of all Americans   Last week Chairman Specter and I spoke      about our interest in having the President consider nominees from      outside what I call the judicial monastery  I believe that life      experience is important and that the Supreme Court could have      benefited from someone with experiences that were not limited to      those of a circuit judge  I am disappointed that the President did      not work with us to identify such a candidate    The Senate must now begin      consideration of the Presidents selection  Above all  we need to      ensure that the Supreme Court remains a protector of all Americans      rights and liberties from government intrusion and that the Supreme      Court understands the role of Congress in passing legislation to      protect ordinary Americans from abuse by powerful special interests         No one is entitled to a free pass to a      lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  There are far different      considerations for circuit court nominations than for those to the      Supreme Court  How the nominee views precedent  what the nominee      regards as settled law  and how the nominee will exercise the      incredible power of a Supreme Court Justice to be the final arbiter      of the meaning of the Constitution  all of these raise very      different considerations than those for lower court nominees  In      addition  a nominee coming from the appellate bench will have a      record there  in votes and opinions and performance that will      provide important additional insights into his likely tenure as a      Supreme Court Justice   Now that the President has made his      choice  the Senate must take the time carefully to evaluate this      lifetime nominee to the Nations highest Court  The Judiciary      Committee must have the time it needs to perform due diligence on      Judge Roberts record and judicial philosophy  and the Senators on      the Committee must have time to prepare for fair and thorough      hearings  I urge all Senators  Republicans and Democrats  to be      mindful of the Senates fundamental role in this process  Americans      have put us all here to do an important job and it is critical that      we treat that responsibility with the seriousness and respect it      deserves    I start from the premise that the      Supreme Court should not be a wing of the Republican Party or one of      its factions  nor should it be an arm of the Democratic Party  The      Senate has a responsibility to all 280 million Americans and to      millions of future Americans  The independence of the federal      judiciary is critical to our American concept of justice for all       The Supreme Court provides a fundamental check in our system of      government to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans  and      we must ensure that it serves as a bulwark of individual liberty      against incursions or expansions of power by the Executive branch       We must also ensure that the Supreme Court respects the role of      Congress when it acts to protect Americans from those with great      power  to improve their lives through environmental laws and by      reigning in powerful special interests    Ours is a nation based on the rule of      law  and the test of a good judge is his or her ability to apply the      law fairly  As I evaluate candidates for lifetime appointments to      the federal bench that often will span not merely years but decades      and sometimes eras  I want to make sure that every person who comes      before the court will know and feel that they will be treated      fairly  That is the basic test that I will apply  again  as this      confirmation proceeding goes forward   Justice OConnor has served for 24      years  Chief Justice Rehnquist for 34  In fact  the average tenure      of Supreme Court justices since 1970 is 25      years  Thus  we are considering a nomination not just for the      period remaining to the Bush Administration  which will end in 2008       but for our childrens and grandchildrens futures and likely to      2030 and beyond  This is a matter of fundamental importance to the      American people now and in the years ahead  This nomination fills      the seat that Justice OConnor has occupied while serving as the      swing or decisive vote on so many cases and issues  If her      successor does not share her judicial philosophy  that replacement      could radically change the Court and the way our Constitution is      interpreted    It is critical to the Senates      performance of our duties that we not prejudge a nominee and that      the Judiciary Committee be accorded the time to develop a full      record on which Senators can base an informed judgment  I look      forward to working out agreements with Chairman Specter on      procedures to allow the kind of thorough consideration a lifetime      nomination to the Supreme Court deserves    A preliminary review of Judge Roberts      record suggests areas of significant concern that need exploration       We need to consider his service on the circuit court  although that      is quite limited  We need to understand how he will exercise the      judicial power of the      United States and whether he will respect precedent  A recent study      demonstrated that the Rehnquist Court has been the most activist in      overturning congressional enactments and restricting legislative      authority since before the New Deal  and this Courts most activist      members are Justices Thomas and Scalia  We need to know what kind      of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts would be  I hope the White      House and the nominee will work with us and cooperate so that all      relevant matters can be constructively explored as we begin this      important process    The Constitution calls on the Senate      carefully to examine nominations to the courts  not to rubber stamp      them  I look forward to hearings that will inform the Senate and      the American people in making the Senates confirmation decision
