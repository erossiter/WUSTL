       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Class Action Fairness Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement         Of Senator Patrick Leahy         Class Action Fairness Act  S  5        February 10  2005  Over the few         days that the Senate has been considering the so called Class Action         Fairness Act  a few modest amendments have been offered to clarify some         ambiguous provisions and to respond to serious concerns raised by the         National Conference of State Legislatures  the National Association of         State Attorneys General  prominent legal scholars  consumer and         environmental groups and civil rights organizations  Anyone who has been         watching this debate on C SPAN or reading the Congressional Record may         have figured out by now that apparently the fix was in despite the         legitimate concerns raised by some of this legislations own sponsors         I am        disappointed that the Senate has been reduced to taking its marching orders        on major legislation from corporate special interests and its allies in the        White House  The Senate could have made limited but important        improvements to the bill  but instead the majority of Senators refused to        even consider these minor improvements  This        legislation will make it harder for American citizens to protect themselves        against violations of state civil rights  consumer  health  and        environmental protection laws by forcing these cases out of local state        courts  Aside from being convenient  state courts have experience with the        legal and factual issues involved in these important cases  This bill will        simply sweep these cases into federal courts and  thereby erect new        barriers to lawsuits and place new burdens on plaintiffs   This bill        contains language to reduce the delay parties can experience when a case is        removed to federal court by setting a time limit for appeals of remand        orders  However  no measure is included in the bill that would set a        timeline for the district court to rule on the actual remand motion  This        means that plaintiffs claims will simply be removed from state court  just        to languish on the federal docket for years  without any recourse         Senator Feingold offered a modest amendment to set a reasonable time limit        for the district court to rule on remand orders  This solution received        praise from one of the sponsors of the legislation  yet the amendment was        still rejected   The biggest        concern raised by legal scholars and agreed to by several Senate sponsors        of the bill would have addressed the recent trend in the federal courts not        to certify class actions if multi state laws are involved  Given this        development  what this bill will succeed in doing is removing class actions        to federal court where they will likely be dismissed for involving multiple        state laws and where they will not be considered on the merits because the        federal court will choose not to consider a case involving the laws of the        state  Cynics might even speculate that is what the business groups behind        this purported procedural change are really seeking  the dismissal of        meritorious cases on procedural grounds by the federal courts   Many Senators        understand that this bill could deny justice to consumers and others in        class actions who band together to seek relief in state court  Senator        Feinstein and Senator Bingaman worked together on an amendment to alleviate        this legal Catch 22  It is unfortunate that the fix is in and the wisdom        of their common sense solution was rejected   Anyone who        reads this bill will notice that despite its title  it affects       more than just class actions  Individual        actions  consolidated by state courts for efficiency purposes  are not        class actions  Despite the fact that a similar provision was unanimously        struck from the bill during the last Congress  mass actions reappeared in        this bill this Congress  Federalizing these individual cases will no doubt        delay  and possibly deny  justice for victims suffering real injuries         Senator Durbins amendment sought to clarify the bills effect on these        cases  Im glad the debate this week served to clarify the narrow scope of        this provision   Prominent        civil rights organizations and labor advocates requested that the bill be        modified to acknowledge the fact that many of our states have their own        protective civil rights and employment laws  Senator Kennedys amendment        to exempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from this bill was a        sensible solution  I was proud to cosponsor it and regret that with the        fix being in  this amendment was rejected by the Senate   This class        action legislation has also been criticized by nearly all of the state        Attorneys General in this country  They expressed a specific concern that        S  5 could limit their official powers to investigate and bring actions in        their state courts against defendants who have caused harm to their        citizens because in certain instances they file suit as the class        representative for the consumers of their state  Not even this minor        clarification  requested by nearly every states highest law enforcement        officer  was acceptable to the majority as the Senate refused to adopt        Senator Pryors amendment   It is        disappointing to me that the Senate has refused to listen to wise counsel        of our state legislatures  our state law enforcement officers  our state        judges and even the views expressed by our federal judiciary since they are        the institutions that we are affecting by enacting this legislation   I predict this legislation will be manipulated by        well paid corporate defense lawyers to create complex  expensive and        lengthy litigation over the criteria and factors in the bill and whether        they apply to a particular case  Unfortunately  one of the great boons of        this legislation  to the extent it does not simply deter class actions        brought by consumers  is that it will make them more costly  burdensome and        complicated  The so called Class Action Fairness Act falls short of        the expectation set by its title  It will leave many injured parties who        have valid claims with no avenue for relief  and that is anything but fair        to the ordinary Americans who look to us to represent them in the United        States Senate
