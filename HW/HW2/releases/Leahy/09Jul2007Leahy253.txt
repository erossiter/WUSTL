       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick LEahy On The U S  Attorney Investigation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Remarks OfSen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The U S  Attorney Investigation     U S  SenateFloor    July 9  2007              Today  House Judiciary Chairman     Conyers and I received another letter from the White House Counsel Fred     Fielding responding to duly authorized subpoenas with a blanket     assertion of executive privilege  I had hoped the Judiciary Committees     subpoenas would be met with compliance  Instead  they have been met        yet again    with Nixonian stonewalling that reveals this White Houses     disdain for our system of checks and balances      This is more stonewalling from a     White House that believes it can unilaterally control the other co equal     branches of government  It raises the question  What is the White House     trying to hide by refusing to turn over evidence     From the outset of this scandal     the President has spoken about the firing of U S  attorneys as if it     were a matter handled and decided by the Attorney General and something     Mr  Gonzales would have to explain to Congress and the American people      The President was hands off and arms length  He had to ask others     whether anything improper was done and relied on a review by White House     lawyers for his assertion that nothing was  This President and the     Attorney General have also from time to time expressed confidence that     the Congress would get to the bottom of this as if they did not know the     details of what had transpired      Are we now to understand from the     White House claims of executive privilege that these were decisions made     by the President  Is he taking responsibility for this scandal  for the     firing of such well regarded and well performing U S  attorneys       When we had the Attorney General     testify under oath  he did not know who added U S  attorneys to the list     of those to be fired or the reasons they were added  Indeed  the bottom     line of the sworn testimony from the Attorney General  the Deputy     Attorney General  the Attorney Generals former Chief of Staff  the     White House liaison and other senior Justice Department officials was     that  while the President was not involved in the decision making that     led to the unprecedented firings of several well performing prosecutors      they were not responsible either  Then  I ask  who did make these     decisions  Was it the political operatives at the White House       Even this White House cannot     dispute the evidence we have gathered to date showing that White House     officials were heavily involved in these firings and in the Justice     Departments response to congressional inquiries about them      The White House continues to try     to have it both ways  but at the end of the day it cannot  It cannot     block Congress from obtaining the relevant evidence and credibly assert     that nothing improper occurred  What is the White House hiding  Was the     President involved and were his earlier statements to the American     people therefore misleading  Or is this simply an effort by the White     House legal team to protect White House political operatives whose     partisan machinations have been discovered in a new set of White House     horrors      Several weeks ago  after Mr      Fielding first conveyed the Presidents blanket executive privilege     claimI have yet to hear directly from the PresidentChairman Conyers     and I sent him a letter asking the White House to provide us with the     specific factual and legal bases for its claims regarding each document     withheld and a privilege log  I asked the White House to provide this     information so that it could substantiate its claim  For months  I have     been giving the White House every opportunity to work with us     voluntarily to provide the information we have sought and for months     these efforts have been met with the same unacceptable take it or leave     it offer  I have since tried to give the White House every opportunity     to explain its claims  A serious assertion of privilege would include     an effort to demonstrate to the Committees which documents  and which     parts of those documents  are covered by any privilege that is asserted     to apply and why  It is apparent that this White House is contemptuous     of the Congress and feels that it does not have to explain itself to     anyone   not to the peoples representatives in Congress  nor to the     American people      The White Houses refusal to     provide a listing of those documents on which it asserts privilege and a     specific factual and legal basis for the assertion of executive     privilege claims raise more questions  Specifically  what is it the     White House is so intent on hiding that they cannot even identify the     documents  the dates  the authors and recipients  Would we see the     early and consistent involvement of White House political operatives in     what should be independent and neutral law enforcement decisions       Nor is the White House content     with blanket assertions of privilege regarding matters in its control      It has now reached out to direct the Republican National Committee not     to provide information it has to Congress and has today instructed a     former White House official Sara Taylor not to cooperate with the     investigation by testifying to the best of her knowledge      Ms  Taylor is scheduled to testify     on Wednesday to comply with a subpoena authorized by the Committee  It     is unfortunate that the White House is trying to interfere with Ms      Taylors testimony before the Senate and with Congresss responsibility     to get to the truth behind the unprecedented firings of several U S      Attorneys      There is clear evidence that Ms      Taylor was one of several White House officials who played a key role in     these firings and the Administrations response to cover up the reasons     behind them when questions first arose  There is also clear evidence     that Ms  Taylor was part of more than 66 000 RNC e mails that have been     kept hidden from the public as part of a White House wide effort to     avoid oversight by ignoring the laws meant to ensure a public record of     official government business      I am willing to discuss the matter     in good faith with the White House  I have been trying to engage the     White House for months in discussions to come to some sort of     accommodation and I hope we can do that  I am reluctant to agree to     anything that prevents Congress from doing our oversight job     effectively  Previous Administrations have found ways to work with     Congress  this Administration seems only to obstruct and obfuscate         We cannot lose sight that this is     a serious matter  This is about improper political influence of our     justice system  it is about the White House manipulating the Justice     Department into its own political arm  It is about manipulating our     justice system to pursue a partisan political agenda  It is about     pressuring prosecutors to bring cases of voter fraud to try to influence     elections  of sending a partisan operative like Bradley Schlozman to     Missouri to file charges on the eve of an election in violation of     Justice Department guidelines  It is about high ranking officials     misleading Congress and the American people about this political     manipulation of justice      It is about the unprecedented and     improper reach of politics into the Departments professional ranks      such as the admission by the Departments White House Liaison Monica     Goodling that she improperly screened career employees for political     loyalty and wielded undue political influence over key law enforcement     decisions and policies         It is about political operatives     pressuring prosecutors to bring partisan cases and seeking retribution     against those who refuse to bend to their political will    such as the     example of New Mexico U S  Attorney David Iglesias  who was fired a few     weeks after Karl Rove complained to the Attorney General about the lack     of purported voter fraud enforcement cases in Mr  Iglesias     jurisdiction      Along the way  this subversion of     the justice system has included lying  misleading  stonewalling and     ignoring the Congress in our attempts to find out what happened  We     know that White House officials are involved  but it is difficult to get     the facts when the White House refuses to provide a single witness or     document     This Administration has instituted     an abusive policy of secrecy aimed at protecting themselves from     embarrassment and accountability  Apparently the President and Vice     president feel they are above the law  In America no one is above the     law      This President has sought to make     the Vice Presidents former Chief of Staff above the law when he granted     him a form of amnesty last week  The President chose to override a     prosecution  jury trial  conviction and prison sentence and to excuse     his lying to federal investigators and a grand jury and his perjury  and     to reward his silence and purportedly bad memory by giving Mr  Libby     what commentators have called a get out of jail free card      The lack of accountability for     anyone in the Bush Administration has reached new heightsor lows  It     is not often when The New York Times and Washington Times     editorial boards agree  but they did about this Presidents abrupt     commutation of Mr  Libbys 30 month prison term for perjury and     obstruction of justice  The Washington Times opined that     President Bushs action was neither wise nor just  It continued in its     Independence Day editorial  Perjury is a serious crime        The     integrity of the judicial process depends on fact finding and     truth telling  A jury found Libby guilty of not only perjury but also     obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury  I would add that the     widely respected trial judge  who was nominated by this President and     confirmed by the Senate while I chaired the Judiciary Committee in     September 2001  imposed a reasonable sentence at the lower end of what     the prosecutor recommended  and that the D C  Circuit had refused to     stay the sentence pending appeal in accordance with the law       The New York Times in a     July 3 editorial entitled Soft of Crime called the Presidents action     a baldly political act  noting that  a s president  he has repeatedly     put himself and those on his team  especially Mr  Cheney  above the     law  They noted that the President sounded like a man worried about     what a former loyalist might say when actually staring into a prison     cell      That presidential act sent the     message that silence  bad memory and abject loyalty would be     rewardedjust as the mass firings of U S  attorneys sent the message     that all remaining federal prosecutors had better knuckle under to the     political agenda of this Administration      Untoward White House interference     with federal law enforcement is a serious matter  It corrupts federal     law enforcement  threatens our elections and has seriously undercut the     American peoples confidence in the independence and evenhandedness of     law enforcement      Despite the attitude of the     current Administration  our Constitution does not include the phrase     unitary executive or executive privilege  What the United States     Constitution does provide in the oath of office is that the President     must swear to faithfully execute the Office of President of the United     States and preserve  protect and defend the Constitution of the United     States  His essential duties require him to take care that the Laws be     faithfully executed  I have great concern with regard to how this     Administration is fulfilling those essential duties  The political     intrusion into the law enforcement functions of the Government through     the scheme to fire and replace our U S  attorneys is a key part of that     concern      Congress will continue to pursue     the truth behind this matter because it is our constitutional     responsibility    and it is the right thing to do  I hope the White     House stops this stonewalling and accepts my offer to negotiate a     workable solution to the Committees oversight needs so that we can     effectively get to the bottom of what has gone on and gone wrong
