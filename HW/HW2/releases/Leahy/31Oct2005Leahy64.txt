       Statement Of Senator Patcik Leahy On The Nomination of Samuel Alito To   Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of Samuel Alito      To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court     Monday  October 31  2005 Mr  President  on      Friday the President formally withdrew from the Senate his      nomination of Harriet Miers to be an Associate Justice of the U S       Supreme Court  Today  he announced his intention to nominate Judge      Samuel Alito to that same position  This will be the third      nomination to fill the seat vacated by the future retirement of      Justice Sandra Day OConnor  This is a      needlessly provocative nomination  Regrettably  when he could have      united the country through his choice  the President chose to reward      one faction of his party and risk dividing the country  He should      instead have rewarded the American people  America would have been      better served through consultation to select one of the many      consensus conservative Republican candidates who could have been      overwhelmingly approved by the Senate  Just last week       the President succumbed to partisan pressure from the extreme right      wing of the Republican Party to withdraw his nomination of Harriet      Miers  The President abdicated his own role in the Constitutions      process of selecting Supreme Court Justices  and allowed his own      choice to be vetoed by extremists within his party  without hearings      by the Judiciary Committee or a vote by the Senate The Miers      nomination has been an eye opening experience for the country       exposing for all to see what a vocal and virulent wing of the      Republican Party really wants  They do not want an independent      federal judiciary  They want a right wing litmus test  not the      selection of judges and justices who will be fair and impartial in      applying the law  They  in fact  demand judges who will guarantee      the results that they want   With turmoil      engulfing the White House  with no exit from the disastrous and      deadly occupation of Iraq  with an excalating federal debt  and with      obscenely high profits that continue to pile up for the      Administrations oil company friends  catering to an extreme wing of      one political party jeopardizes the vital checks and balances that      protect ordinary Americans  It is a pity that the President felt      his position was so weak that he had to bend to a narrow but      strident faction of his political base  The Supreme Court is the      ultimate safeguard in our system to protect the fundamental rights      of all Americans  I hope the White House is not using this      announcement today to try to distract the public from the scandals      and failures mounting by the day for this Administration    With the      announcement of Judge Samuel Alito to fill the position to be      vacated by Justice OConnor  the White House failed to follow      through with initial discussions and engage in meaningful      consultation  I regret that the President has not chosen the clear      path of a consensus candidate to unite the American people and the      Senate  The Nation and the Senate would have overwhelmingly      welcomed his choice if he had   I have not formed      a final judgment as to the merits of this nomination  although an      initial review of Judge Alitos record suggests areas of significant      concern  Judge Alitos opinions from the federal bench demonstrate      that he would go to great lengths to restrict the authority of      Congress to enact protective legislation to protect in the areas of      civil rights  consumer protection  and the rights of workers       consumers and women  Judge Alito has also set unreasonably high      standards for ordinary Americans who are victims of discrimination      to meet before being allowed to proceed with their cases   The Democratic      Leader of the Senate and I wrote to the President last week  urging      him to pick one of the many qualified mainstream women and minority      candidates who could win widespread bipartisan support in the Senate      and earn the confidence of the American people  We noted the unique      circumstances that now attend this nomination and that make it      essential that Justice OConnor be replaced by a mainstream nominee       not by an activist who would bring an ideological agenda to the      Court    The Court that serves America should      reflect America  but although President Bush declared  in reference      to filling Justice OConnors seat on the Court  that he is mindful      that diversity is one of the strengths of the country  with his      nomination of Judge Alito he is weakening that strength  Should      Judge Alito be confirmed  the Court will lose some of that      diversity  There was no dearth of highly qualified women  African      Americans  Hispanics and other individuals who could well have      served as unifying nominees while adding to the diversity on the      Supreme Court  I look forward to the time when the membership of      the United States Supreme Court is more reflective of the country it      serves   As the grandson of Italian and      Irish immigrants  I know that Italian Americans and President Bushs      guest  the Italian Prime Minister  will be feeling pride today  But      this nomination does not add to the diversity of the Supreme Court      or make it more reflective of America  I imagine that this      announcement is a disappointment to many Hispanic Americans who had      expected the President to seize this historic opportunity given to      him for a third time  by nominating the first Hispanic to the      Court  I also imagine that all the women here in our Nations      Capitol today to honor Rosa Parks    the first woman to lie in state      in the Capitol Rotunda  for her work in bringing racial justice to      our Nation  are somewhat saddened that the seat of the first woman      to serve in on our highest court is not going to be filled by      another woman   I do not expect      Democrats to engage in the kinds of personal attacks on this nominee      that the right wing used to force the President to withdraw the      nomination of Ms  Miers  who he described as the best qualified      person in the country to replace Justice OConnor  I do think we      need to take the time necessary to examine the record of the nominee      in the Reagan Justice Department and on the bench before proceeding      with full and thorough hearings  The stakes for      the American people could not be higher with this new nomination       Justice OConnor brought an open mind to the cases she reviewed and      served as a moderating influence on the Court  The person who      replaces her replaces a pivotal vote on our most powerful court  and      has the potential to dramatically tilt the courts balance       Maintaining the stability of the court is crucial for the nation and      will be an important factor for me as I consider this nomination       At this critical      moment  and in light of the circumstances that led to the withdrawal      of the Miers nomination  all Senators should perform our      constitutional Advice and Consent responsibility with heightened      vigilance  The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the rights of all      Americans  I look forward to      the hearing and will  as I did before  work with Senator Specter       the Chairman  to make sure they are open and fair as they were for      Chief Justice Roberts  But those were open and fair hearings      because we had the time to prepare for them  and I would urge the      President and even the leadership of this august body to allow the      Judiciary Committee to take the time to do it right  Its far more      important to do it right than to do it fast  The appointment must      be made in the nations interest  not to serve the special interests      of any partisan faction  even though today some are claiming credit      for destroying the chances of Harriet Miers
