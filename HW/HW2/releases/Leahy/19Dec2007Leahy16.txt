       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Leahy Stevens WHTI Provision In The   Omnibus                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   On  The Leahy Stevens WHTI Provision In The Omnibus  December 18  2007        MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  one important issue I wish to highlight      today is an international border issue with our friendly neighbors      in Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean that could have severe      implications for the social and economic ways of life for      communities all across our country              In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks  Congress has      enacted a number of new border security measures  all with the      expressed goal of preventing another terrorist incident  In this      bill  we have worked hard to provide the needed resources for these      programs in a fair and balanced manner  Post 9 11  everyone      recognizes that there are potential threats and security needs  but      we must implement them sensibly and intelligently              Over the past few years  I have heard from many Vermonters about      problems they have encountered at U S  border crossings  from long      traffic backups to invasive searches and questioning to inadequate      communication from federal authorities about new facilities and      procedures  Such a top down approach does not work well in      interwoven communities along the border  where people cross daily      from one side to the other for jobs  shopping  and cultural events       We have hardened security around this Capitol and the White House      and built fences near San Diego  But those procedures do not work      on Canusa Avenue in Beebe Plain  a two lane road where one side of      the street is the Vermont and the other side is Quebec  or at the      Haskell Free Library and Opera House  which straddles the      international border in Derby Line  Vermont  and Stanstead  Quebec                  That is why I am pleased that this bill includes a much needed delay      for full implementation of the so called Western Hemisphere Travel      Initiative  which will require individuals from the United States       Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean to present passports or other      documents proving citizenship before entering the United States  I      was pleased to join with Senator Stevens and many other colleagues      from both bodies in pushing for inclusion of this important      provision because it is clear that the Department of Homeland      Security and the Department of State are not ready for a full      rollout of the new passport checks next summer              Muddled thinking  poor planning  and administrative hubris have      plagued implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative       The Department of Homeland Security has rushed to implement the new      passport checks before the necessary technology  infrastructure and      training are in place at our border stations  If these critical      features of the deployment are not in place when the new program      starts  we will see severe delays at our border and law abiding      citizens from the United States  Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean      will have great difficulty moving between our countries  Most      importantly  a hasty implementation will undermine the intended      goals of the program             The massive backlogs in processing passport applications we saw      earlier this year when the Departments of Homeland Security and      State started to require passports for air travel is just a taste of      the chaos that is likely when they start enforcing citizenship      checks at our nations land and sea borders in January  There is      another train wreck on the horizon if these federal agencies      continue pushing forward with full implementation of the Western      Hemisphere Travel Initiative before the necessary policies and      procedures are in place to handle the surge in applications and the      lengthy border crossing delays that are sure to come              I appreciate the recognition by this Congress that premature      implementation will recklessly risk the travel plans of millions of      Americans and the economies of scores of U S  states and      communities  The Departments of Homeland Security and State have      shown that they need more time to establish a set of rules and      procedures that will do more than just shut our borders down to      legitimate travel and trade
