Committee Members Seek Undisclosed Documents   From Department Of Justice   Bipartisan    Request For Information On Scope   Of DOJs Review Of Documents Released To Congress  WASHINGTON  Monday  April 9      Leading Senators on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Alberto    Gonzales today seeking undisclosed documents relating to the panels ongoing    investigation into the dismissal and replacement of federal prosecutors    Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt       chairman of the committee  Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member  joined    with Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Charles Schumer  D N Y   in a    bipartisan request for the undisclosed documents as well as more detailed    information on the scope of the Departments review of documents identified    and released to Congress    Below is the    text of the letter  A    is also available    April 9  2007  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales   Attorney General   U S  Department of Justice   950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW   Washington  DC 20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales      We are writing to follow up on the hearings    held by the Senate and House Judiciary Committees  and to seek your    assistance in working with the Committees so that we may conduct a thorough    investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Administrations    removal and replacement of so many U S  Attorneys appointed by President    Bush   While the Department of Justice has produced    some documentation  we are concerned that additional documents relevant to    the Committees investigations are missing or have been withheld  For    example  according to an April 2  2007  article in  The American Spectator  a    series of files and documents that could prove critical to the congressional    investigation into the firings of eight U S  Attorneys remain in the office    of the Deputy Attorney General  DAG  and the Executive Office for the U S     Attorneys  EOUSA   but have not been produced by the Department  According    to the article  these files include overviews and evaluations of at least a    dozen current and now former U S  Attorneys  and briefing materials    provided to you and the Deputy Attorney General for a meeting early last    December  These materials are reported to contain information about the    status of each U S  Attorney for an early December meeting in Washington     D C  for all 93 U S  Attorneys  including material about why particular U S     Attorneys might be on his or her way out  In addition  testimony provided    in public hearings and private interviews raises questions about the    thoroughness of the production to date and with regard to documents that    have not been turned over to the Committees   Among the documents that have not been turned    over to the Committees are relevant e mails  attachments to e mails and    other documents not produced or produced in full  By way of example  an    e mail dated February 12  2007  indicates that Monica Goodling provided a    chart to Mike Elston and Kyle Sampson that apparently you requested however     that chart was not provided to the Committee   Given that this was a process that extended    over more than two years and involved staff from both the Department of    Justice and the White House  and involved consideration of a number of U S     Attorneys  there would seem to be other documents that would comment upon    the reasons some U S  Attorneys were chosen for removal and others were    not  For example  there are press reports that the former U S  Attorney in    San Francisco had multiple evaluations and was the subject of significant    discussions  Documents reflecting those multiple evaluations and    significant discussions have not been produced to date  This raises a    question about whether we have seen all similar documents about others    selected for replacement or left in place    The Department has produced only one ranking    of the 93 U S  Attorneys  that from February 24  2005  If there were    additional rankings or lists  as some e mails and testimony have indicated     the Committee requests copies of all such lists and evaluations created   In addition  we ask for a timely response to    the following requests and questions         What was the precise scope of the document    productions that have occurred thus far  Have all requested documents been    produced  including all documents related to the Administration s    evaluationof  and decisions to remove and replace  U S  Attorneyssince    President Bush s    re election  as well asthe selection  discussion and evaluation ofpossible    replacements and interim appointments  What was included and what was    excluded          How was the precise scope of the production    determined  What precise directions were given to staff to locate  identify     and preserve relevant documents  Please identify the person or persons who    were responsible for making that determination with respect to scope and who    were responsible for issuing instructions to staff  Please provide all    instructions given to staff         What process did the Department follow for    determining that all relevant documents had been located and produced     including e mails from governmental and non governmental accounts and    documents stored in electronic archives         What  if any  documents remain that may be    relevant to the Committees investigations  Why have those documents not    been produced          Have you provided the Committees with all    documents you have been reviewing in preparation for your April 17  2007    appearance before the Judiciary Committee  including the thousands of pages    of documents related to  your  upcoming testimony you were reported to be    reviewing in an April 5  2007 article in  The Washington Post  If not     please provide those documents prior to your appearance before the Committee    and please explain the reasons why they were withheld   While the Committee will be considering at its    next markup an authorization providing subpoena power to the Chairman to    require the Department to turn over all relevant documents in its possession    custody and control  we hope subpoenas will not be necessary to compel    cooperation with the Committees investigation  Please provide the    requested in formation by Wednesday  April 11  2007  That way it will be    available to us to review in time for your testimony before the Committee to    testify on April 17  2007   Sincerely
