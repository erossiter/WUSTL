       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Resignation Of Assistant Attorney   General Wan Kim                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comment Of Sen      Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Resignation Of Assistant Attorney General Wan Kim     Head Of The Justice Departments Civil Rights Division    August 23  2007 This is yet another high level departure from a Justice Department that     has seen its leadership ranks emptied in the last few months  The     vacancy rate at the departments highest levels is another index of the     extent to which the current Administration has blunted the Justice     Departments sense of direction and tainted its sense of purpose      The politicization of the Civil Rights Division  long one of the most     vital and well respected units of our legal system    has been one of     the most grievous travesties that have been uncovered during the     investigation of the mass firings of U S  Attorneys  Mr  Kim is leaving     the Civil Rights Division at a time when there are serious concerns     about the Divisions priorities  hiring  and decision making process      The actions of former Department officials like Brad Schlozman call into     question the Divisions commitment to civil rights enforcement and     reveal the true cost of injecting corrosive political influences into     the work of the Justice Department  It should come as no surprise that     the result  and of course the intent  of the political makeover of the     Civil Rights Division has been a dismal civil rights enforcement record      I hope that the President promptly sends us a nominee who understands     that the Civil Rights Division is entrusted with defending our most     precious rights as Americans  including our fundamental right to vote     and our rights against discrimination
