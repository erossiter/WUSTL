       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Thompson Memorandum s   Effect On The Right To Counsel In Corporate Investigations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On The Thompson Memorandums Effect       On The Right To Counsel In Corporate Investigations      September 12  2006   The protection of communications       between client and lawyer has been fundamental to our nations       legal justice system since its inception  The right to counsel       has long been recognized as essential to ensure fairness        justice and equality under the law for all Americans  This       Administration has taken extraordinary steps to investigate and       prosecute the press and to intimidate the press  critics  and       attorneys while it has claimed unlimited privileges and secrecy       for itself    As a former prosecutor  I       understand all too well that our democracy requires a healthy       respect for the law and that criminal wrongdoing must be       punished  Wrongdoers who profit at the expense of ordinary       working Americans must be held accountable  This is true for       corporate wrongdoers and for those who violate the publics       trust    Following Enrons collapse in       2001  I authored the criminal provisions in the Public Company       Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002  commonly       referred to as the Sarbanes Oxley Act  which strengthened       existing criminal penalties for corporate crime  I have since       repeatedly offered stronger criminal penalties and       accountability for war profiteering and contractor fraud   only       to be stymied by Administration and Republican opposition        Those war profiteering provisions are now also included in the       REAL Security Act  introduced by the Senate Democratic       leadership last week to refocus our efforts against terrorism       and to make American safer  Like so many aspects of the       Administrations involvement in Iraq  the fraud and waste that       have plagued the rebuilding efforts there undermine our efforts       to win hearts and minds in that part of the world that are       necessary to any success    Historically the attorney client       privilege has been balanced with competing objectives  including       the need to ensure cooperation with the Government in criminal       or regulatory probes  The issue before us today is whether this       Justice Department has struck the right balance   In the wake of major corporate       scandals at Enron  WorldCom and elsewhere  the Justice       Department revised its corporate fraud policy in 2003  when then       Deputy Attorney General Larry D  Thompson issued the Principals       of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations  The       Thompson Memorandum  as it is commonly known  increased the       emphasis on  and scrutiny of  a corporations cooperation with       the Government in connection with corporate fraud       investigations  Specifically  the memorandum requires  among       other things  that corporations under criminal investigation who       wish to cooperate with the Government demonstrate their       willingness to cooperate by waiving the attorney client       privilege and work product doctrine  by restricting the payment       of legal fees for employees under investigation  and by       refraining from entering into joint defense agreements and other       information sharing arrangements   A growing number of critics of the       Thompson Memorandum  including former Republican Attorneys       General  have expressed concern that the Departments policy is       too heavy handed and that the policy has created a dangerous       culture of waiver in our criminal justice system  Last month        the American Bar Association adopted a resolution opposing the       Departments policy because it has the effect of eroding       constitutional and other legal rights  Last Friday  the  Wall Street Journal       editorial board joined the criticism of Attorney General       Gonzales and the Thompson Memorandum  noting that the coercive       intimidation it represents is more than a PR problem for the       Administration    Two recent cases involving the       Justice Departments corporate fraud prosecutions highlight the       ABAs concerns  Earlier this year  the Department took the       unusual step of criminally indicting the securities class action       law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad  Schulman after that law firm       refused to sign a deferred prosecution agreement that would have       required the firm to waive the attorney client privilege  In       June  a federal judge in the Southern District of New York ruled       that the Department had unfairly pressured accounting firm KPMG       not to pay the legal fees of its former partners  in violation       of the partners Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial and Sixth       Amendment right to counsel   The serious legal and       constitutional concerns raised by the Departments policy have       far reaching implications  Erosion of the right to counsel       undermines the fairness of our criminal justice system for all       Americans  Once lost  this fundamental right would be hard to       regain  Many critics worry that the Thompson Memorandum is yet       another example of this Administrations tendency to overreach       in asserting executive power without regard for the       Constitution  the laws  and basic fairness   Today  we will hear from the       Deputy Attorney General and a distinguished panel of legal       experts with broad range of experience and expertise on this       issue  I look forward to a meaningful exchange
