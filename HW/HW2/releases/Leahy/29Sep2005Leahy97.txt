       Judiciary Democrats Seek Second Hearing On Department Of Justice Nominee                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Judiciary       Democrats Seek Second Hearing On Department Of Justice Nominee   THURSDAY  Sept  29   Senator       Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary       Committee  on Thursday raised key concerns about the nomination       of Timothy Flanigan to be Deputy Attorney General  including              The role Flanigan played in       developing the Bush Administrations interrogation policies       governing detainees              Flanigans dealings with indicted       lobbyist Jack Abramoff when Flanigan worked as general counsel       for Tyco International  and             The lack of relevant prosecutorial       experience  Like other top officials within the Justice       Department  Flanigan lacks that relevant law enforcement       experience    The nomination is pending before       the Committee  Democratic members of the panel this week       requested a second hearing on the nomination  citing unanswered       questions including those involving Flanigans dealings and       relationship with Abramoff  Below is Leahys statement on the       nomination from the Committees meeting earlier today  The       letter from the Democratic Senators seeking a second hearing       follows    Opening       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting      September 29  2005   The Flanigan       Nomination  While we have been considering the       nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the  United States  another nomination for another important       position inside the Bush Administration needs additional       consideration by this Committee    The President has nominated       Timothy E  Flanigan to serve as Deputy Attorney General  the       number two person in the Justice Department  This nomination       has raised a number of questions  some of which were answered       last night and some of which remain unanswered  Several members       of this Committee continue to seek substantive responses to our       concerns  and so yesterday we requested another hearing on this       troubling nomination     Lack Of       Prosecutorial Experience At The Department Of Justice  This debate is all the more       important in the wake of the Nations recent tragic experience       with Hurricane Katrina  an experience made worse by the       appalling failure of the federal government to respond       appropriately and in a timely manner  We quickly discovered the       high cost of cronyism to the public  with the head of FEMA not       having any significant experience in disaster response  His top       two deputies did not have any relevant experience in disaster       response  All three had been given their jobs only through       political patronage  Know who had replaced know how at the top       of the nations disaster response agency  and the results were       tragic    For Americans to have confidence       in their government  federal agencies need to be run by       professionals with relevant experience  not merely by       well connected individuals who are beholden to the White House        This is especially true at the Department of Justice  which is       the federal agency called upon to investigate the actions of       government officials  It has long been recognized that the       Justice Department  more than any other federal department  must       maintain a sufficient degree of independence from the White       House    It has also long been recognized       that expertise in law enforcement within the top management       levels of the Justice Department is valuable in guiding the       Department in fulfilling its missions  For justice to be       served  prosecutorial experience among those who run the       criminal components of the Department is useful  and maybe       invaluable    It is regrettable that the White       House does not hold to this standard  and this Justice       Department is a reflection of that  The Attorney General had no       significant law enforcement experience when he was confirmed       earlier this year  He had served as a corporate lawyer  a      Texas state Supreme Court judge on civil  not       criminal  matters  and as White House Counsel  The nominee to       lead the Criminal Division  who was given a recess appointment       in August  also had no history of working as a prosecutor  The       Associate Attorney General was never a prosecutor  The       Solicitor General was never a prosecutor  And Mr  Flanigan does       not have prosecutorial experience either  And so it is that we       have reached the point that the top five positions heading the       Justice Department on criminal law enforcement matters have       never  among the five of them  prosecuted a single case  as far       as I know    Like Mike Brown and his two top       subordinates at FEMA  Mr  Flanigan has a long history in the       service of Republican administrations  That is all well and       good  But it does not qualify someone for crucial law       enforcement responsibilities in the nations top law enforcement       department  Indeed  with the recent arrest of the Bush       Administrations top federal procurement official  the       continuing investigations into the activities of Republican       lobbyist Jack Abramoff  the ongoing investigation by the Office       of Inspector General into the reassignment of a U S  Attorney       who had tried to investigate Mr  Abramoff in 2002  the       unfinished investigation into the outing of a CIA agent  and the       unfinished investigation into the theft of documents from our       own server here on the Committee by Republican staff  there is       every reason to insist on greater independence from the White       House  not less independence    Mr  Flanigan cannot credibly claim       that he is independent of this Administration  But       prosecutorial experience and independence from the White House       are exactly what are needed  and Mr  Flanigan offers neither        He is being named to replace a seasoned prosecutor who had the       confidence of Republicans and Democrats alike  I know Jim Comey        I have worked with Jim Comey  and Tim Flanigan is no Jim Comey          Mr  Flanigans       Role In The Formulation Of Interrogation Policies  A lack of prosecutorial experience       is not the only concern I have with this nomination  Before his       confirmation hearing  we understood that Mr  Flanigan was       involved to some degree in the development of Bush       Administration policies on detention and interrogation  What I       learned in the hearing and from his answers to written questions       does not give me comfort    Mr  Flanigan acknowledged that       that he was present at two briefings conducted by the Office of       Legal Counsel  OLC  in the summer of 2002 regarding that       offices interpretation of the torture statute  That office s       legal opinions are considered to be binding on the Executive       Branch  The OLC drafting process on which Mr  Flanigan was       briefed produced the infamous Bybee torture memo that was       dated August 1  2002  That memo asserted that the       President has a commander in chief override to order torture and       immunize from prosecution anyone who commits torture subject to       his order  It also stated that for action to rise to the level       of torture  it must result in the type of pain associated with       major organ failure or death    The OLC analysis could not stand       the light of day  Once it was made public  that memorandum was       withdrawn by the Bush Administration  It should have been       denounced from the first moment it was presented to White House       officials in the summer of 2002  just the way that it was       condemned by Members of Congress and the American public when it       was disclosed by the press in 2004  But the White House       officials who were briefed by OLC  including Mr  Flanigan        apparently said nothing    Mr  Flanigan did not say to       Members of this Committee that he took issue with the legal       analysis presented by OLC in those briefings  Furthermore  he       acknowledges that specific interrogation techniques were brought       up in these briefings and does not claim that he spoke out       against their use  Rather  he claims that it was not his role       to evaluate the methods discussed or to provide his own legal       judgment about them  Incredibly  he contends that his role was       merely to assure that OLC was responsive to the request for an       analysis of the torture statute    I also find it deeply troubling       that Mr  Flanigan has endorsed the Bush Administrations flawed       interpretation of the Torture Convention related to cruel        inhuman and degrading treatment  commonly referred to as CID        The Administration asserts that the Conventions prohibition on       CID does not apply to aliens captured overseas by the  United States  Such an interpretation is in direct       conflict with statements made to Congress by Reagan       Administration officials when the Convention was ratified  The       original interpretation of the Convention was reaffirmed this       year by the Reagan Administration official  Ambassador Abraham       Sofaer  who handled its Senate ratification    It is on this topic that  The  Washington Posts       lead editorial yesterday on the Flanigan nomination raised       particular concerns  The editorial concludes   I t is an       odious thing that the top two law enforcement officers of the       United States will both be people who resort to evasive       legalisms in response to simple questions about uncivilized       conduct  I ask that a copy of that editorial be included in       the record     More Questions       Need Answers On Tycos Relationship To Jack Abramoff  Mr  Flanigan joined Tyco       International as its General Counsel in December 2002 after       leaving his position in the White House  Mr  Flanigan states       that in Spring of 2003  Jack Abramoff  who was at Greenberg       Traurig  began to lobby on behalf of Tyco  Mr  Abramoff was       engaged to lobby against proposed tax legislation targeting       so called Benedict Arnold corporations  These are American       corporations that are incorporated outside the       United States  and Tyco is apparently incorporated in Bermuda         Mr  Flanigan claims that Mr        Abramoff offered to use his contacts to House Majority Leader       Tom DeLay and White House Political Director Karl Rove to lobby       against the proposed legislation  He says that he did not       personally ask Mr  Abramoff to lobby Mr  Rove     Tyco then engaged another firm        GrassRoots Interactive  at the suggestion of Mr  Abramoff        Abramoffs firm later notified Tyco that approximately  1 5       million in payments from Tyco to GrassRoots Interactive had been       diverted to accounts that were controlled by Mr  Abramoff         Members of this Committee have       asked a number of questions of Mr  Flanigan about these       incidents  but each set of responses leads to more questions        Senator Kennedy still has pending a number of questions on these       points that deserve to be answered  and others among us received       written responses only last night  A number of us believe it is       important for the Committee and the Senate to have more       information about these relationships and issues before Senators       are asked to vote on this nomination  Such information is       directly relevant to Mr  Flanigans management capabilities          Other Questions  In addition  a number of questions       and issues remain outstanding with respect to this nomination       and with regard to the Justice Departments law enforcement       effort  It is now almost three weeks since I wrote to the       Attorney General regarding my concerns that two United States       Attorneys Offices were forced to close as a result of the       Hurricane Katrina  I received no response  nor did I receive       answers to any of my inquiries about the fate of the Justice       Department employees in the region or about the adverse effects       on evidence and the administration of justice  Yesterday I sent       the Attorney General a follow up letter seeking the answers that       should have been provided weeks ago  Lack of responsiveness       from the Justice Department  regrettably  is what the American       people and their elected representatives have become accustomed       to during this Administration  I do not see how Mr  Flanigans       nomination is anything other than a prescription for more       politics and partisanship and less responsiveness at the Justice       Department                        Letter from Democratic Members Seeking a Second Hearing on       Nomination of Timothy Flanigan   September 28  2005  The Honorable Arlen Specter      Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary      United States Senate  224 Dirksen Senate Office Building      Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Specter   We write to request that you       schedule a follow up hearing on the nomination of Timothy E        Flanigan to serve as Deputy Attorney General  Important       information pertaining to Mr  Flanigans nomination has come to       light since his initial hearing on July 26  2005        We believe that Committee members should have the opportunity to       question Mr  Flanigan about these developments before his       nomination proceeds in the Committee   At his hearing  Mr  Flanigan       acknowledged that  on behalf of Tyco International  he hired and       personally supervised indicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff  who was       then employed by Greenberg Traurig  Mr  Flanigan  in response       to a question from Senator Durbin  said that he could not speak       about the details of his relationship with Mr  Abramoff because       we  Tyco  have issues in the nature of claims involving the       Greenberg firm which are pending which are  I believe  covered       by an attorney client privilege that is not mine to waive   Following the hearing  however        media reports quoted Tyco officials speaking about Tycos       relationship with Mr  Abramoff and Greenberg Traurig  In       response to written questions from Senator Durbin  Mr  Flanigan       acknowledged that following his hearing Tyco had authorized       limited disclosures regarding the nature of Tycos relationship       with the Greenberg Traurig firm   It therefore appears that Mr        Flanigan is now at liberty to comment in more detail on his       relationship with Mr  Abramoff  Mr  Flanigan has been nominated       to fill the second in command job at the Department of Justice        a position that is too important to let these outstanding issues       linger without answers  We believe the Committee has the       responsibility to explore this and other pertinent issues at a       follow up hearing before it is called upon to make a decision on       this important nomination    Thank you for your time and       consideration
