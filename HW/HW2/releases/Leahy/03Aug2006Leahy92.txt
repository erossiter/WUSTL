       Leahy Bill Targeting Unsolved Cases Of Missing Children And Civil Rights   Violations Clears Key Senate Panel                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Bill Targeting Unsolved       Cases       Of Missing Children And Civil Rights Violations       Clears Key Senate Panel     Bipartisan       Bill Authorizes DOJ Unit To Devote Resources      To Solving Heinous Cold Cases   WASHINGTON  Thursday  Aug  3   A       bill sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   that would allow       federal law enforcement to dedicate available resources to       solving cold cases of missing children and civil rights       violations was approved Thursday by the Senate Judiciary       Committee    Leahy  the leading Democratic       member of the committee  teamed up with fellow panel member Sen        John Cornyn  R Texas  on the bill  The bill will allow       inspectors general to allocate staff to work with The National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children in investigating       unsolved cases of missing children and establish a unit within       the Department of Justice to investigate historic cases of civil       rights discrimination   Leahy has long been an advocate       for strengthening laws protecting children and targeting human       rights and civil rights offenders  This bill builds on Leahys       hard fought victory in 2004  when he secured passage of the       Anti Atrocity Alien Deportation Act  That law expanded the       authority of a DOJ unit targeting Nazi war criminals to include       other human rights offenders and war criminals seeking refuge in       the       United States    Senator Leahys statement from the       committees business meeting is below  followed by a brief       summary of the bill       Statement of       Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On the Cornyn Leahy Substitute      And Inclusion of the Missing Child Cold Case Review Act in S        2679      August 3  2006  I am very pleased that the Missing       Child Cold Case Review Act has been partnered with the Unsolved       Civil Rights Crime Act and that the substitute I cosponsored has       been adopted by the Committee and reported to the Senate for its       consideration    Among its many vital functions        The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC        serves as a clearinghouse for inactive case files in which a       child has not been found or where a suspect has not been       identified  This bill authorizes the various Inspectors General       of federal law enforcement agencies to work with NCMEC and to       provide their staff  on a voluntary basis  to assist NCMEC with       the review of case files stored at the National       Center    Under current law  an inspector       general s duties are limited to activities related to the       programs and operations of an agency  My bill would allow our       inspectors general to assign criminal investigators to assist in       the review of cold case files at NCMEC  so long as doing so       would not interfere with normal duties  I understand that our       inspectors general are eager to provide this assistance and I       understand why  These cases need resolution  As parents and       grandparents we all know that  What they need is legal       authorization to be allowed to help  That is what my amendment       provides    It is a useful step for us to       enable this cooperation between one of our Nations top       resources for child protection and the diverse and talented       investigators in the offices of our inspectors general  This       cooperation will bolster efforts to resolve these       heart wrenching cases   Just last week John and Reve Walsh       and those who worked with us to help establish the National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children observed the 25th       anniversary of the tragic loss of young Adam Walsh  Working       together  we have accomplished a good deal for many families in       the last 25 years  but we have more to do  I am honored to       sponsor this amendment to take another step forward in the       interests of our children and to authorize our inspectors       general to join in these efforts   The Cornyn Leahy amendment is a       complete substitute for the underlying bill  In addition to the       important addition of the Leahy amendment to assist NCMEC and       authorize inspector general activity  the substitute makes other       changes in the bill at the behest of the Department of       Justice                 Summary of The       Missing Child Cold Case Review Act   The Missing Child Cold Case        Review Act amends the Crime Control Act of 1990  by        explicitly providing authority for an Inspector General         appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978  to        authorize his or her staff to lend assistance to the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC            Under current law  Inspectors        General are not authorized to provide such assistance        outside of their statutory duties  Senator Leahys bill        specifically allows Inspectors General staff to assist NCMEC        in conducting reviews of inactive case files and making        recommendations for further investigations     The bill does not permit        Inspectors General to provide assistance when doing so would        interfere with any statutory duties  The bill also requires        no additional funding    As reported from the Senate        Judiciary Committee  the Missing Child Cold Case Review Act        was paired with the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act  which        mandates new divisions in the Department of Justice and        Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate unsolved        civil rights related murders that occurred prior to 1969
