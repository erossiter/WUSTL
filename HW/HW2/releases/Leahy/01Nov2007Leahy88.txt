  Leahy Specter Anti Cyber Crime Legislation      WASHINGTON        Thursday  Nov  1  2007   The Senate Judiciary Committee today       approved the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act        by voice vote  The legislation toughens penalties and provides       new tools for prosecuting cyber crime and online identity theft       and fraud  The bipartisan bill was introduced on October 16 by       Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Ranking Member       Arlen Specter  R Pa    The bill reported by the Committee       incorporates key provisions from cyber crime legislation       introduced by Sens  Joe Biden  D Del   and Orrin Hatch  R Utah        earlier this month       The bill has the support of the       Department of Justice  the Secret Service and the federal       prosecutors and investigators who battle against identity theft       and other cyber crimes every day  It has broad support from       industry and consumer groups  including the Chamber of Commerce        the Cyber Security Industry Alliance  the Business Software       Association  the Consumers Union  the Consumer Federation of       American  and the AARP  The legislation is cosponsored by Sens        Biden  Hatch  Dick Durbin  D Ill    Chuck Grassley  R Iowa         Chuck Schumer  D N Y    and Bill Nelson  D FL         The Judiciary Committee has       passed strong  bipartisan legislation to protect consumers from       identity theft and fraud  said Leahy  Every day  cyber       criminals find new ways to get around our laws  I hope the       Senate moves quickly to pass this legislation to give the       necessary tools to our prosecutors to shut these criminals       down       I am grateful that my colleagues       have recognized the importance of protecting Americans who have       become victims to Identity Theft  stated Specter  Identity       theft is a serious and growing problem  and this legislation       will have an immediate impact on federal prosecutors  victims       and the perpetrators of this serious crime by providing the       tools and penalties to effectively prosecute identity theft       The Identity Theft Enforcement and       Restitution Act of 2007 would        Give victims of identity theft        the ability to seek restitution for the loss of time and        money spent restoring credit and remedying the harms of        identity theft     Ensure that identity thieves        who impersonate businesses in order to steal sensitive        personal data can be prosecuted under federal identity theft        laws  Current law only provides for prosecution of identity        theft perpetrated against an individual      Enable prosecution of those        who steal personal information from a computer even when the        victims computer is located in the same state as the        thiefs computer  Under current law  federal courts only        have jurisdiction if the thief uses an interstate        communication to access the victims computer      Eliminates the requirement        that damage to a victims computer exceed  5 000 before        charges can be brought for unauthorized access to a        computer  The provision protects innocent actors while        punishing violations resulting in less than  5 000 in damage        as misdemeanors     Make it a felony to employ        spyware or keyloggers to damage ten or more computers        regardless of the aggregate amount of damage caused         ensuring that the most egregious identity thieves will not        escape with a minimal  or no  sentence     Makes it a crime to threaten        to steal or release information from a computer  Current        law only permits the prosecution of those who seek to extort        companies or government agencies by explicitly threatening        to shut down or damage a computer  Violators of this        provision are subject to a criminal fine and up to five        years in prison     Add the remedies of civil and        criminal forfeiture to the arsenal of tools available to        federal prosecutors to combat cyber crime  Mandate that the        U S  Sentencing Commission review and update its guidelines        for identity theft and other cyber crime offenses     Statement of       Sen  Patrick Leahy       Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary       On Consideration Of       The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2007      November 1  2007 Today  the       Committee will consider the Leahy Specter Identity Theft       Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2007  This bipartisan cyber       crime bill will provide new tools to federal prosecutors to       combat identity theft and other computer crimes        I am pleased that Senator Specter  who has been a valuable       partner in combating the growing problem of identity theft for       many years  has joined me in introducing this important criminal       bill  I also thank Senators Durbin  Grassley and Schumer for       joining with us as cosponsors of this legislation         I also commend and thank Senators Biden and Hatch for their       important work in this area  I am pleased that several       provisions that they have drafted to further strengthen this       cyber crime legislation will be included in the bipartisan       managers amendment for this bill  and that they will also       cosponsor this legislation        Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of       Justice in crafting this criminal legislation and the       Leahy Specter Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act has       the strong support of the Department of Justice  the Secret       Service and the federal prosecutors and investigators who are on       the front lines in the battle against identity theft and other       cyber crimes  The bill is also supported by a broad coalition of       business  high tech and consumer groups  including Microsoft        Consumers Union  the Cyber Security Industry Alliance and AARP        I will also submit several support letters that I have received       about this bill for the record        The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act takes several       important and long overdue steps to protect Americans from the       growing and evolving threat of identity theft and other cyber       crimes  First  to better protect American consumers  our bill       provides the victims of identity theft with the ability to seek       restitution in federal court for the loss of time and money       spent restoring their credit and remedying the harms of identity       theft  so that identity theft victims can be made whole         Second  because identity theft schemes are much more       sophisticated and cunning in todays digital era  our bill also       expands the scope of the federal identity theft statutes so that       the law keeps up with the ingenuity of todays identity thieves        Our bill adds three new crimes  passing counterfeit securities        mail theft  and tax fraud  to the list of predicate offenses       for aggravated identity theft  And  in order to better deter       this kind of criminal activity  our bill also significantly       increases the criminal penalties for these crimes  To address       the increasing number of computer hacking crimes that involve       computers located within the same State  our bill also       eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that a computers       information must be stolen through an interstate or foreign       communication in order to federally prosecute this crime        Our bill also addresses the growing problem of the malicious use       of spyware to steal sensitive personal information  by       eliminating the requirement that the loss resulting from the       damage to a victims computer must exceed  5 000 in order to       federally prosecute this offense  The bill    as amended by the       managers package  also carefully balances this necessary       change with the legitimate need to protect innocent actors from       frivolous prosecutions  and clarifies that the elimination of       the  5 000 threshold applies only to criminal cases  In       addition  our bill addresses the increasing number of cyber       attacks on multiple computers  by making it a felony to employ       spyware or keyloggers to damage ten or more computers        regardless of the aggregate amount of damage caused  By making       this crime a felony  the bill ensures that the most egregious       identity thieves will not escape with minimal punishment under       federal cyber crime laws        Lastly  our bill strengthens the protections for American       businesses  which are more and more becoming the focus of       identity thieves by adding two new causes of action under the       cyber extortion statute    threatening to obtain or release       information from a protected computer and demanding money in       relation to a protected computer    so that this bad conduct can       be federally prosecuted  In addition  because a business as well       as an individual can be a prime target for identity theft  our       bill closes several gaps in the federal identity theft and the       aggravated identity theft statutes to ensure that identity       thieves who target a small business or a corporation can be       prosecuted under these laws  The managers amendment for this       bill also adds the remedy of civil and criminal forfeiture to       the arsenal of tools to combat cyber crime  It also directs the       United Sates Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines for       identity theft and cyber crime offenses to reflect Congressional       intent to better deter and combat these crimes         The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act is a good        bipartisan measure to help combat the growing threat of identity       theft and other cyber crimes to all Americans  This carefully       balanced bill protects the privacy rights of American consumers        the interests of and business and the legitimate needs of law       enforcement  Again  I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators       who have joined Senator Specter and me in supporting this       important legislation  as well as the many consumer and business       groups that support this bill  I urge all Members of the       Committee to join with us in supporting this important privacy       legislation
