       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Wililam Pryor To   The U S  Court Of Appeals forThe Eleventh Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Closing Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of William Pryor      To The U S  Court Of Appeals For The Eleventh      Circuit June 9  2005  In the last Congress  following one of      the most divisive debates I have seen on the floor of the Senate  I      explained why I felt strongly about voting against the nomination of      William Pryor to the U S  Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit       in Committee and in two unsuccessful cloture attempts  The      President disregarded the advice given to him by the Senators      opposing this nomination  and he installed Mr  Pryor as a      recess appointed judge on the Eleventh Circuit where he will serve      until the end of this year  Today  because the President continues      to insist on pushing his most divisive nominees in a group that he      renominated to the Senate  we are here voting yet one more time on      this nomination    I expect some will try to point to the      few cases he has worked on during his time auditioning on the      Circuit Court as evidence that he should be confirmed  But nothing      Judge Pryor has done in the intervening period has changed my view      that based on his entire career and record  if he were to receive      life tenure on the federal bench  he would put ideology above the      law  I cannot support him    Inflammatory      Rhetoric  In the course of their march toward      the nuclear option  a development thankfully averted  the      President and the Republican leadership escalated the rhetoric      surrounding this issue in alarming ways  The Majority Leader last      month participated in a telecast smearing opponents of the most      extreme judicial nominees as against people of faith  Arrayed      behind the podium at that gathering were photos of the filibustered      nominees  and speaker after speaker accused Democrats of opposing      nominees such as Judge Pryor because of his faith  These are      baseless and despicable accusations  and it is time the Republican      leadership and other Republicans in and out of the Senate disavow      them    Senate Democrats do not oppose William      Pryor because of his faith  We oppose the nomination of William      Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit because of his extreme  some  with      good reason  use the word radical  ideas about what the      Constitution says about federalism  criminal justice and the death      penalty  violence against women  the Americans with Disabilities      Act  and the governments ability to protect the environment on      behalf of the American people  Of course  those substantive      concerns will not do much to advance Republicans political      ambitions and the agendas of polarizing interest groups  So some      Republican partisans are putting the truth to one side  They      dismiss the views of Democratic Senators doing their duty under the      Constitution to examine the fitness of every nominee to a lifetime      position on the federal bench and choose  instead  to use smears and      accusations    The last time Judge Pryor came before      this Committee and the Senate  slanderous accusations were made by      Republican Senators  and scurrilous newspaper advertisements were      run by a group headed by the Presidents fathers former White House      counsel and a group whose funding includes money raised by      Republican Senators and even by the Presidents family  Other      Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and of the Senate      stood mute in the face of these McCarthyite charges  or  worse  fed      the flames  Now  the same type of rhetoric  identifying opponents      as against faith  has again reared its ugly head   This kind of religious smear campaign      hurts the whole country  It hurts Christians and non Christians  It      hurts all of us  because the Constitution requires judges to apply      the law  not their personal views  Remember that all of us  no      matter what our faith    and I am proud of mine    are able to      practice our religion as we choose or not to practice a religion       That is a fundamental guarantee of our Constitution  The      Constitutions prohibition against a religious test in Article VI      is consistent with that fundamental freedom  I hope that Republican      Senators will debate this nomination absent the scurrilous charges      that marked it the past and the discourse during the nuclear      option last month    An Extreme and      Divisive Nomination  Instead  the Senates debate should      center on the nominees qualifications for this lifetime post in the      federal judiciary  There is an abundance of substantive and      compelling reasons why William Pryor should not be a judge on the      Eleventh Circuit  Opposition to Judge Pryors nomination is shared      by a wide spectrum of objective observers  Judge Pryors record is      so out of the mainstream that a vast number of editorial boards and      others have weighed in with significant opposition     Even The Washington Post  which      has been exceedingly generous to the Administrations efforts to      pack the courts  has termed Judge Pryor unfit and consistently      opposed his nomination  In  Alabama  both the Tuscaloosa News      and the Hunstville Times wrote against the nomination  Other      editorial boards across the country have spoken out  including the     Atlanta Journal Constitution  the Pittsburgh Post Gazette      The New York Times  the Charleston Gazette  the      Arizona Daily Star  and The Los Angeles Times     We have also heard from a large number      of organizations and individuals concerned about justice before the      federal courts  The Log Cabin Republicans  the Leadership      Conference on Civil Rights  the AFL CIO  the National Partnership      for Women and Families and many others have provided the Committee      with their concerns and the basis for their opposition  We have      received letters of opposition from organizations that rarely take      positions on nominations but feel so strongly about this one that      they are compelled to publicly oppose it  including the National      Senior Citizens Law      Center  the Anti Defamation League and the Sierra Club   The  ABAs evaluation also indicates      concern about this nomination  Their Standing Committee on the      Federal Judiciary gave Mr  Pryor a partial rating of not qualified      to sit on the federal bench  Of course this is not the first not      qualified rating or partial not qualified rating that this      Administrations judicial nominees have received  More than two      dozen of President Bushs nominees have received indications of      concerns about their qualifications from the ABAs peer reviews       which have been less exacting and much more accommodating to this      Administration than to previous ones  I would note that this softer      treatment follows the changes in the process imposed by the Bush      Administration     Activist and      Crusader  Judge Pryor has long been a leader of      the federalist movement  promoting state power over the federal      government  A leading proponent of what he refers to as the      federalism revolution  Judge Pryor seeks to revitalize state power      at the expense of federal protections  seeking opportunities to      attack federal laws and programs designed to guarantee civil rights      protections  He has urged that federal laws on behalf of the      disabled  the aged  women  minorities  and the environment all be      limited  Not long ago  in a New York Times Magazine article      about the so called Constitution in Exile movement  Michael Greve       was quoted as saying  Bill Pryor is the key to this puzzle  theres      nobody like him  I think hes sensational  He gets almost all of      it  William Pryors ideological crusading  at the expense of      ordinary Americans  is precisely why he should not be confirmed    Limiting Worker and      Environmental Protections  William Pryor has argued that the      federal courts should cut back on the protections of important and      well supported federal laws including the Age Discrimination in      Employment Act  the Americans with Disabilities Act  the Civil      Rights Act of 1964  the Clean Water Act  the Violence Against Women      Act  and the Family and Medical Leave Act  He has repudiated      decades of legal precedents that permitted individuals to sue states      to prevent violations of federal civil rights regulations  His      aggressive involvement in this federalist revolution shows that he      is a goal oriented  activist conservative who has used his official      position to advance his cause   Alabama was the only state to file an      amicus brief arguing that Congress lacked authority to enforce the      Clean Water Act  He argued that the Constitutions Commerce Clause      does not grant the federal government authority to prevent      destruction of waters and wetlands that serve as a critical habitat      for migratory birds  The Supreme Court did not adopt his narrow      view of the Commerce Clause powers of Congress  While his advocacy      in this case is a sign to most people of the extremism  he trumpets      his involvement in this case  He is unabashedly proud of his      repeated work to limit congressional authority to promote the      health  safety and welfare of all Americans    His passion is not some obscure legal      theory but a legal crusade that has driven his actions since he was      a student and something that guides his actions as a lawyer  His      speeches and testimony before Congress demonstrate just how rooted      his views are  how much he seeks to effect a fundamental change in      the country  and how far outside the mainstream he is    Judge Pryor is candid about the fact      that his view of federalism is different from the current operation      of the federal government  and that he is on a mission to change      the government to fit his vision  His goal is to continue to limit      Congresss authority to enact laws under the Fourteenth Amendment      and the Commerce Clause  laws that protect women  ethnic and racial      minorities  senior citizens  the disabled  and the environment  in      the name of sovereign immunity  Is there any question      that he will pursue his agenda as a judge on the Eleventh Circuit      Court of Appeals  reversing equal rights progress and affecting the      lives of millions of Americans for decades to come     Judge Pryor s      comments have revealed insensitivity to the barriers that      disadvantaged persons and members of minority groups and women      continue to face in the criminal justice system  This is what is at      stake for Americans  the consumers of our justice system  This is      the type of judge this President and this Republican leadership are      intent on permanently installing in our justice system     Attacking the      Voting Rights Act and Other Key Rights  In testimony before Congress  William      Pryor has urged repeal of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act  the      centerpiece of that landmark statute  because  he says  it is an      affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived      its usefulness  That testimony demonstrates that Judge Pryor is      more concerned with preventing an affront to the states dignity      than with guaranteeing all citizens the right to cast an equal      vote  It also reflects a long discredited view of the Voting Rights      Act  Since the enactment of the statute in 1965  every Supreme      Court case to address the question has rejected the claim that      Section 5 is an affront to our system of federalism  Whether      under Earl Warren  Warren Burger  or William Rehnquist  the United      States Supreme Court has recognized that guaranteeing all citizens      the right to cast an equal vote is essential to our democracy  not      a burden that has outlived its usefulness   His strong views against providing      counsel and fair procedures for death row inmates have led William      Pryor to doomsday predictions about the modest reforms in the      Innocence Protection Act that would create a system to ensure      competent counsel in death penalty cases  When the United States      Supreme Court questioned the constitutionality of Alabama s      method of execution in 2000  William Pryor lashed out at the Supreme      Court  saying   A T his      issue should not be decided by nine octogenarian lawyers who happen      to sit on the U S  Supreme Court  Aside from the obvious      disrespect this comment shows for the Nations highest court  it      shows again how results oriented Judge Pryor is in his approach to      the law and to the Constitution  Of course an issue about cruel and      unusual punishment ought to be decided by the Supreme Court  It is      addressed in the Eighth Amendment  and whether or not we agree on      the ruling  it is an elementary principle of constitutional law that      it be decided by the Supreme Court  no matter how old its members        Judge Pryor has also vigorously      opposed an exemption for persons with mental retardation from      receiving the death penalty  exhibiting more certainty than      understanding or sober reflection  He authored an amicus curiae      brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not declare      that executing mentally retarded persons violated the Eighth      Amendment  After losing on that issue  Judge Pryor made an      unsuccessful argument to the Eleventh Circuit that an  Alabama death row defendant is not      mentally retarded    Judge Pryor has spoken harshly about      the moratorium imposed by former Illinois Governor George Ryan       calling it a spectacle  Can someone so dismissive of evidence      that challenges his views be expected to hear these cases fairly       Over the last few years  many prominent Americans have begun raising      concerns about the death penalty and the close calls endured by      innocent Americans condemned to death row  Those raising these      concerns include current and former supporters of capital      punishment  For example  Justice O Connor recently said there were      serious questions about whether the death penalty is fairly      administered in the United States  and added   T he system may      well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed  In      response to this uncertainty  Judge Pryor offers us nothing but his      obstinate view that there is no problem with the application of the      death penalty  This is a position that is not likely to afford a      fair hearing to a defendant on death row         Judge Pryors troubling views on the criminal justice system are not      limited to capital punishment  He has advocated that counsel need      not be provided to indigent defendants charged with an offense that      carries a sentence of imprisonment if the offense is classified as a      misdemeanor  The Supreme Court nonetheless ruled that it was a      violation of the Sixth Amendment to impose a sentence that included      a possibility of imprisonment if indigent persons were not afforded      counsel    Judge Pryor is overwhelmingly hostile      to a womans right to choose  There is every indication from his      record and statements that he is committed to reversing  Roe v  Wade       Judge Pryor describes the Supreme Courts decision in Roe v  Wade      as the creation out of thin air  of  a constitutional right  and      opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest   Judge Pryor does not believe Roe      is sound law  neither does he give credence to  Planned Parenthood v  Casey       He has said that Roe is not constitutional law  and that in      Casey  the court preserved the worst abomination of      constitutional law in our history  When Judge Pryor appeared      before the Committee  he repeated the mantra suggested by White      House coaches that he would follow the law  But his willingness      to circumvent established Supreme Court precedent that protects      fundamental privacy rights seems much more likely    Judge Pryor has expressed his      opposition to fair treatment of all people regardless of their      sexual orientation  The positions he took in a brief he filed in      the Supreme Court case of  Lawrence v  Texas were entirely repudiated by the Supreme Court      majority two years ago when it declared that  The petitioners are      entitled to respect for their private lives  The State cannot      demean their existence or control their destiny by making their      private conduct a crime  Judge Pryors view is the opposite  He      would deny certain Americans the equal protection of the laws  and      would subject the most private of their behaviors to public      regulation    Capping Judge Pryors record of      extreme activism were sworn statements made by former Alabama      Governor Fob James and his son  both Republicans  explaining that      Judge Pryor was only chosen by James to be the states Attorney      General after promising that he would defy court orders  up through      and including orders of the Supreme Court of the  United States  In sworn affidavits       Governor James and his son recount how William Pryor persuaded them      he was right for the job by showing them research papers he had      supervised in law school about nonacquiesence to court orders       Indeed  under penalty of perjury  the former Republican Governor and      his son say that Judge Pryors position on defying court orders      changed only when he decided he wanted to be a federal judge        If true  this information  consistent      with the activism and extremism present elsewhere in Judge Pryors      record  is revealing  To think that this man would come before the      Senate after having made a promise like that  to undermine the very      basis of our legal system  and ask to be confirmed to a lifetime      position on the federal bench  is beyond belief     Driven by Politics  Indeed  William Pryors activism has      often transcended judicial philosophy and entered the realm of pure      partisan politics to the point where it appeared political concerns      openly affected his legal views  As Attorney General of Alabama       Pryor was one of the founders of the Republican Attorneys General      Association  or RAGA  an organization which raised money from      corporations for Republican candidates for state Attorney General      positions  Before RAGA was founded  Attorney General candidates      usually shied away from corporate fundraising because of the      potential for conflicts of interest with an Attorney Generals duty      to go after any corporate wrongdoing    But William Pryor not only ignored the      tradition of keeping Attorney Generals races above politics  he      embraced with both hands the mixing of law and politics  He spoke      out  vocally and often  against state attorneys general bringing      aggressive cases against the tobacco industry  the gun industry  and      other corporate interests  And then RAGA  William Pryors      organization  raised money for attorney general campaigns from these      very industries and others like them that hoped to avoid lawsuits      and prosecution  His philosophy of opposing mainstream government      regulation of corporations advanced his politics and his      organizations fundraising  and his political interests in turn      informed his pro corporation legal philosophy  Curiously  when      asked about RAGA at his hearing  Mr  Pryor could remember very      little about the organization or his role in it   His partisan  political worldview      colors the way he thinks about the role of the courts as well  He      ended one speech with the prayer  Please God  no more Souters   a      slap at a Supreme Court Justice seen by some as insufficiently      conservative  And he said he was pleased the Courts vote in      Bush v  Gore was a 5 4 split because that vote would give      President Bush a full appreciation of the judiciary and judicial      selection  in other words  it would show the president that he      needed to appoint partisan conservatives to the bench  These are      the sentiments of an activist and a politician  They are not the      considered deliberations that all of us  as Republican or Democratic      Senators  would expect from an impartial judge    A Lifetime Record      of Activism  On a full slate of issues    the      environment  voting rights  womens rights  gay rights  federalism       and more    William Pryors record of activism and advocacy is      clear  That is his right as an American citizen  but it does not      make him qualified to be a judge  As a judge  it is his duty      impartially to hear and weigh the evidence and to impart just and      fair decisions to all who come before the court  In their hands  we      entrust to the judges in our independent federal judiciary the      rights that all of us are entitled to enjoy through our birthright      as Americans    Judge Pryors time on the Eleventh      Circuit brings out the very problem with recess appointments of      controversial judges  The Constitution sets out that Article III      judges receive lifetime appointments precisely so that they can be      independent  Judge Pryor  in contrast  cannot be independent during      the pendency of his recess appointment because he is dependent on      the Senate for confirmation to a lifetime position  He is  in      essence  trying out for the job  Accordingly  the opinions he      writes while temporarily on the court are not much of a predictor      for what he would do if he did receive a lifetime appointment and      became truly independent    What is a good predictor for what he      would do as a permanent Eleventh Circuit judge  Quite simply  his      actions and statements in the many years of his professional life      before he was appointed provide the best insight  And these actions      and statements paint a clear and consistent picture of a judicial      activist whose extreme views place him far outside the mainstream       A year of self serving restraint does little to alter this picture   The President has said he is against      what he calls judicial activism  How ironic  then  that he has      chosen several of the most committed and opinionated judicial      activists ever to be nominated to our courts   The question posed by this      controversial nomination is not whether Judge Pryor is a skilled and      capable politician and advocate  He certainly is  The question is      whether    not for a two year term but for a lifetime    he would be      a fair and impartial judge  Could every person whose rights or      whose life  liberty or livelihood were at issue before his court       have faith in being fairly heard  Could every person rightly have      faith in receiving a just verdict  a verdict not swayed by or yoked      to the legal philosophy of a self described legal crusader  To see      Judge Pryors record and his extreme views about the law is to see      the stark answer to that question    I oppose giving Judge Pryor a lifetime      appointment to the Eleventh Circuit where he can impose his radical      activist vision on the many people whose lives and disputes come      before him  The President has chosen to divide the Senate and the      American people with this and other nominations  I believe the      President owes the American people a nominee who can unite the      American people by showing that he or she is committed to fairly      applying the law and not to pursuing an ideological crusade
