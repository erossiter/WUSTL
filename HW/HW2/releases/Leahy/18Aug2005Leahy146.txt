       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The White House Release Of 40 000   Pages Of Documents Relating To The Supreme Court Nomination Of John Roberts                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy      D Vt   Ranking Democratic Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The White House Release Of 40 000 Pages Of Documents     Relating To The Supreme Court Nomination Of John Roberts     August 18  2005  The White      House Thursday supplied about 40 000 pages of documents to the      Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the panels review of the      nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court of the United      States  The documents received relate to John Robertss time      working for former President Ronald Reagan in the White House      Counsels office  The Democratic members of the Committee have a      pending request for documents relating to 16 of the more than 300      cases that were handled by the Solicitor Generals office during      John Robertss four years working as a senior level political      appointee in that office  The Bush Administration so far has      refused to provide those documents  despite precedent in previous      Senate reviews of Supreme Court nominations  Below is Senator      Patrick Leahys reaction to todays document release  Leahy is the      ranking Democratic member of the committee    More important      than just the number of pages the Senate is receiving is the fact      that the White House continues to withhold the most relevant      documents about John Roberts   With little      more than two weeks left to prepare for Senate hearings on this      nomination  the White House continues its stonewalling of a limited      request for his memoranda on a handful of the most controversial      matters he handled while working in the government  These documents      would help illuminate Judge Robertss views and choices on important      issues of concern to all Americans  civil rights  privacy and      access to justice  The Administration should produce those      materials without further delay   The      Administration has also withheld more than 2 000 pages from the      papers provided this week  and I urge the White House to reconsider      its refusal to cooperate on these documents  as well  The      White House has continued to process some documents  and I      appreciate those efforts  But it is crucial that the Judiciary      Committee and the Senate fully and fairly review this nomination       and that requires as complete a record as is available  The Senate      has only one chance to decide on this lifetime appointment  and the      American people expect and deserve for us to get it right
