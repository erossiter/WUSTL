       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Comprehensive Immigration Reform      Senate Floor      May 15  2006  Today the Senate turns its       attention again to comprehensive immigration reform  I hope we       can finish the job the Judiciary Committee started in March and       the Senate began considering in April  We need to fix the       broken immigration system with tough reforms that secure our       borders and with reforms that will bring millions of       undocumented immigrants out of the shadows    I commend the majority and       minority leaders for continuing to search for a procedural       agreement  even though Republicans blocked action on a       comprehensive solution by filibustering before the April       recess  Democrats supported the bill that was reported by the       Judiciary Committee  and we were willing to support the       Hagel Martinez compromise  In fact  Democrats voted twice in       two days for comprehensive reform  but the Republican leadership       refused to follow the commitments it made when the cameras were       on  and folded its tent by declining to support cloture even on       the motion of the Republican leader    I hope that when the President       speaks to the Nation this evening  he will strongly encourage       his party to support a comprehensive bill in the Senate  The       President offered some helpful comments in April but these words       came too late  as the far right wing of his party had already       undermined the potential compromise  Democrats were prepared to       pass a bill in April  and are prepared to pass a fair and       comprehensive bill now    The Bush Cheney administration has       gone to great lengths to create the impression that it is now       committed to strengthening our border security  The reality is       that very little progress has been made  A recent report       concluded that the number of people apprehended at our borders       for illegal entry fell 31 percent under President Bushs watch        from a yearly average of 1 52 million between 1996 and 2000 to       1 05 million between 2001 and 2004  The number of illegal       immigrants apprehended while in the interior of the country       declined 36 percent  from a yearly average of roughly 40 000       between 1996 and 2000 to 25 901 between 2001 and 2004  Audits       and fines against employers of illegal immigrants have also       fallen significantly since President Bush took office  Given       the vast increases in the number of Border Patrol Agents  the       decline in enforcement can only be explained by a failure of       leadership    The recent aggressive and       well publicized enforcement efforts to detain illegal immigrants       are little more than political posturing that do little to       improve the situation  We need comprehensive reform  backed up       by leadership committed to using the tools Congress provides        not piecemeal political stunts    Tonight we expect to hear that the       National Guard will be deployed to the Mexican border  Once       again the Administration turns to the fine men and women of       National Guard in a crisis  After our intervention turned sour       in Iraq  the Pentagon turned to the Guard  After the       governmental wide failure in responding to Katrina  we turned to       the Guard  Now  the Administration s continual unwillingness to       focus on our porous border and develop a comprehensive       immigration policy  the Administration turns once again to the       Guard  Yet I am continually puzzled that this Administration        which seems so ready to take advantage of the Guard  fights so       vigorously against providing this essential force with adequate        equipment  a seat at the table in policy debates   even adequate       health insurance for the men and women of the Guard   As       long as these Guard units operate under the authority of State       governors I believe this action is appropriate  In addition  the       Federal Government should pick up the full costs of such a       deployment and be clear about the length of this service  Those       costs should not be foisted onto the States and their already       taxed Guard units  Their families have been called upon to       sacrifice more than any other group of Americans  My heart goes       out to the members of the Guard and their families     Controlling our borders is a       national responsibility  and it is regrettable that so much of       this duty has been punted to the states and now to the Guard        The Guard is pitching in above and beyond  balancing its already       demanding responsibilities to the states  while sending troops       who have been deployed to Iraq  The Guard served admirably in       response to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal Government       utterly failed to respond in a timely or sufficient manner  The       Vermont Guard and others have been contributing to our national       security since the immediate aftermath of 9 11  Later tonight        we expect the President will announce that after more than 5       years of failing to use the authority and funding Congress has       provided to strengthen the Border Patrol and our border       security  it has come to this  militarizing our southern border         Instead of proposing a budget with       robust and complete funding for our Border Patrol  the President       has focused on providing tax cuts for the wealthiest among us        Congress has had to step in time and again to create new Border       Agent positions and direct that they be filled  Instead of       urging his party to take early and decisive action to pass       comprehensive immigration reform as he signaled he would in       February 2001  the President began his second term campaigning       to undercut the protections of our Social Security system that       Americans oppose  While the President talks about the       importance of our first responders  he has proposed 67 percent       cuts in the grant program that supplies bulletproof vests to       police officers  a program that has special resonance today when       we meet to recognize the 157 officers we lost last year     Five years of the Bush Cheney       Administrations inaction and misplaced priorities have done       nothing to improve our immigration situation  Its time for       action  not more talk  The Senate just passed an emergency       supplemental appropriations bill that includes nearly  2 billion       for border security  These are important programs and we all       support them  although a number of us believe the Democratic       leader was right to offer them without taking the funds from our       troops needs in Iraq    Border security alone is not       enough to solve our immigration problems  We must pass a bill        and enact a law    that will not only strengthen the security       along our borders  but that will also encourage millions of       people to come out of the shadows  When this is accomplished we       will be more secure because we will know who is living and       working in the United States  We must encourage the       undocumented to come forward  undergo background checks  and pay       taxes to earn a place on the path to citizenship     Just a few weeks ago I went to the       White House with a bipartisan delegation of Senators to speak       with the President  The need for a fair and comprehensive       immigration bill was the consensus at that meeting and I believe       the President was sincere when he told us that we had his       support  I hope he will include that commitment in his       statement to the nation tonight  If not  I trust that he will       not wait to urge comprehensive immigration reform on those       Republican Senators and the Republican House leadership who have       yet to endorse our bipartisan comprehensive approach  Without       Republican support and the intervention of the President with       the recalcitrant factions within his party  this effort is       unlikely to be successful and the hopes of millions will be       destroyed  Those who have peacefully demonstrated their       dedication to justice and comprehensive immigration reform       should not be relegated back into the shadows     The bill that won the bipartisan       support of a majority of the Judiciary Committee was a       compromise that contained the essential components that are       required for comprehensive immigration reform  Before the last       recess I was willing to support a further compromise that       incorporated the principles of the Hagel Martinez bill because       it was proposed by the majority leader as a breakthrough that       would allow us to pass immigration reform   Immigration reform must be       comprehensive if it is to lead to real security and real reform        Enforcement only measures may sound tough but they are       insufficient  In these next two weeks  the Senate has an       opportunity  and a responsibility  to pass a bill that addresses       our broken system with comprehensive reform and puts the pieces       in place to secure the nation
