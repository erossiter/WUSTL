       Leahy Letter Calls On President To  Cease And Desist  Practice Of   Cherry Picking Laws To Enforce                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Letter Calls      On President      To  Cease And Desist  Practice Of Cherry Picking Laws To Enforce      Criticizes Administration s Abuse Of Power    WASHINGTON  Friday  July 28         U S  Senate Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt    on Friday publicly       called on President Bush to immediately stop abusing his       constitutional authority through after the fact statements used       to cherry pick       sections of laws that the Administration intends to enforce       while ignoring others    In a speech delivered Friday       morning on the floor of the U S  Senate  and in a letter to the       President sent earlier in the day  Leahy urged President Bush to       stop his practice of misusing bill signing statements after       Congress has passed laws  specifically noting the just passed       and just signed reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  The       President  who signed the reauthorization of the historic Voting       Rights Act into law yesterday  is expected to issue a bill       signing statement within the next week or so     Instead  Leahy called on the       President to raise any concerns or questions the Administration       has at the appropriate time  when the bills are being       considered and debated in Congress  Rather than wait until a       bill is passed  why not provide those of us elected to Congress       with any constitutional concerns you may have regarding pending       legislation at the earliest opportunity  That would allow       legislators to consider your concerns during the legislative       process  Leahy wrote    Leahy  the ranking Democratic       member of the Judiciary Committee  has long been concerned about       the Presidents misuse of the bill signing statements  He first       raised concerns in 2002  along with Republican Senator Charles       Grassley   R Iowa   a fellow member of the panel  about the       Presidents bill signing statement on the Sarbanes Oxley law       combating corporate fraud  The senators successfully objected       to the Presidents attempt to narrow a provision protecting       corporate whistle blowers in a way that would have afforded them       very little protection    Below is Leahys letter to       President Bush and his floor remarks delivered Friday morning  A       is also       available              July 28  2006  President George W  Bush      The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue      Washington  DC 20500  Dear President Bush   This week a distinguished Task       Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation of       Powers Doctrine of the American Bar Association reported  The       Task Force unanimously opposed a Presidents issuance of signing       statements to claim the authority to state the intention to       disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law he has       signed  or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with       the clear intent of Congress as contrary to the rule of law and       our constitutional system of separation of powers  The Senate       Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the matter last month  I       have spoken to the issue on a number of occasions  including       this week on the floor of the Senate   You have produced more signing       statements containing challenges to bills you have signed into       law than all prior Presidents in our history combined  I       understand that you have produced more than 800 challenges to       the bills you have signed into law  including many challenges       related to your theory of the unitary executive   I write to urge you to cease and       desist from this practice  I urge you to recognize that our       Constitution vests All legislative Powers in the Congress and       that the Presidents constitutional responsibility is to take       Care that the Laws be faithfully executed    I offer the following constructive       suggestion  Rather than wait until a bill is passed  why not       provide those of us elected to Congress with any constitutional       concerns you may have regarding pending legislation at the       earliest opportunity  That would allow legislators to consider       your concerns during the legislative process   Respectfully   PATRICK LEAHY      Ranking Democratic Member  cc  Hon  Alberto Gonzales              Statement Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On Presidential Signing Statements July 28  2006  Today I have sent a letter to       President Bush urging him to cease and desist from his abuse of       presidential signing statements  Since I began drawing       attention to these matters in 2002  the abuses have mounted        Outstanding reporters  such as Charles Savage of the Boston       Globe  have taken note of this important matter and reported on       particular examples of egregious signing statements by which the       President attempts to rewrite our laws  Editorial boards across       the country have been increasingly critical    This week a distinguished       bipartisan Task Force of the American Bar Association released a       unanimous report highly critical of this Presidents practice as       contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional system of       separation of powers  With todays letter I point the       President to a better way  I urge him to raise any       constitutional concerns he has with legislation with us in       Congress while the legislation is pending and early in the       process  If we agree  we can work together to fix it  But       Congress writes the laws not the President    I speak on this topic again today       because of its immediate importance to the reauthorization and       revitalization to the Voting Rights Act that we unanimously       passed last week and that the President signed into law       yesterday    Yesterday I complimented the       President for the words he used in the ceremony during which he       signed the law  He sounded like a man fully on board and       supportive of the findings  purposes and provisions of the law        He said that his Administration would vigorously enforce the       provisions of this law and we will defend it in court  I       commended him for his statement at the signing when the       Judiciary Committee met yesterday  Rumor is that next week the       President will issue a presidential signing statement on the       voting rights act reauthorization  I do not want that to be one       in the infamous line of signing statements where he says       something else  seeks to undercut the law  reinterpret it or in       any way reduce his responsibility for fully and vigorously       enforcing the law and defending and upholding its provisions in       legal challenges    The Constitution places the       law making power  All legislative Powers in the Congress        That is an Article I power  We are at a pivotal moment in our       Nations history  where Americans are faced with a President who       makes sweeping claims for almost unchecked Executive power        This Administration is now routinely using signing statements to       proclaim which parts of the law the President will follow  which       parts he will ignore  and which he will reinterpret  This is       what I have called cherry picking and it is wrong   This President has also used       signing statements to challenge laws banning torture  on       affirmative action and prohibiting the censorship of scientific       data  In fact  time and again  this President has stood before       the American people  signed laws enacted by their       representatives in Congress  while all along crossing his       fingers behind his back  I do not want to see the       reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fall into that group of       important enactments  Under our constitutional system of       government  when Congress passes a bill and the President signs       it into law  that should be the end of the story  At that       moment the Presidents constitutional duty is to take Care that       the Laws be faithfully executed  That is his duty  which he       acknowledged yesterday  with respect to the Voting Rights Act        His Article II power  the executive Power  is to execute the       laws  it is not a legislative Power    I remind this President and this       Administration that the Constitution has more than one Article       and that All legislative Power is vested in Congress  not some       unitary executive  When the President uses signing       statements to unilaterally rewrite the laws enacted by the       peoples representatives in Congress  he undermines the Rule of       Law and our constitutional checks and balances designed to       protect the rights of the American people   These signing statements are a       diabolical device but this President will continue to use and       abuse them  if the Republican Congress lets him  So far  this       Congress has done exactly that  Whether it is torture        warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens  or the unlawful       treatment of military prisoners  this Republican led Congress       has been willing to turn a blind eye and rubber stamp the       questionable actions of this Administration  regardless of the       consequences to our Constitution and civil liberties   I mentioned that this issue of       signing statements is something that has concerned me since       2002  That was also the year that the Bush Cheney       Administration was writing secret legal memoranda seeking to       justify another form of lawlessness by postulating an unfounded       and unconstitutional commander in chief override to our laws in       its justification of torture  When that memorandum was exposed       to light  the Administration had to withdraw it  But we read in       a front page story in The            Washington Post today of another ominous       development  Apparently the Bush Cheney Administration lawyers       are meeting with Republicans in Congress to write immunities and       amnesties into the law and to renege on this countrys       commitment to human rights and the Geneva Conventions    This is evidence of another aspect       of the lawlessness of the Bush Cheney Administration  It can       only succeed if the Republican Congress continues to act as a       wholly owned subsidiary of the White House  instead of       fulfilling its responsibility as a separate and independent       branch of government intended by the Founders and established by       the Constitution to serve as a check on the Executive     I helped write the war crimes law       that the Bush Cheney Administration is reportedly seeking to       undermine  In 1996 and 1997  we acted with the support of the       Department of Defense  to include expressly in our laws       culpability for violating human rights and the Geneva       Conventions  The United States has tried to       serve as a world leader  We have set standards for conduct that       we demand that others around the world follow  We cannot       credibly ask others to meet standards we are unwilling to meet       ourselves  We have insisted on human rights and the rights of       Americans  civilian and military  throughout the world    More recently  Abu Ghraib        reported detainee abuses  investigations into the deaths of       detainees and civilians in war zones  indictments of American       service personnel and contractors have all combined to stain      Americas reputation and role  We must not       retreat from the fight for human rights  We must not cut and       run from our responsibilities as a world leader and the worlds       only superpower    The American military men and       women are the finest in the world  They have been trained to       respect human rights and do so  They need not fear laws against       brutality and inhumanity  We helped develop and then endorsed       the Geneva Conventions to set standards that protect our troops       from harm  To walk away from these protections would be to walk       away from our men and women in uniform  Pulling a thread from       this cloak of protection risks the beginning of a process of       unraveling the entire fabric to the detriment of our troops and       to our great shame   It is disheartening to read that       the highest law enforcement officer in the country is leading an       effort to undercut the Rule of Law  Rather than enforce the       law  he is reportedly seeking to undermine it  Instead of       ignoring or changing laws we have long honored  our leaders       should be obeying them  not obfuscating or creating loopholes in       them  The Attorney General of the United States is       not an in house counsel to the President or consigliere to the       Vice President and Secretary of State  His constitutional       responsibility is to enforce the law
