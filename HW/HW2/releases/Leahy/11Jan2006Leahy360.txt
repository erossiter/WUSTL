       Statement Of Sen  patrick Leahy On Judge Alito s REsponsivness During   His Supreme Court Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy        D Vt        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Judge Alitos Responsiveness      During His Supreme Court Nomination Hearing      January 11  2006   By now Judge      Alito has responded to many questions  but he has truly answered too      few of them  I did not agree with many of the answers that Judge      Roberts gave at his confirmation hearing  but the clarity of his      answers at the hearings and in our meetings convinced me to vote for      his confirmation  His candor at this moment stands in contrast to      Judge Alitos testimony  which has blurred instead of clarified the      question of what kind of justice he would be   So far  Judge      Alito has failed to provide the Committee or the American people      with a clear sense of his legal philosophy or what kind of justice      he would be if confirmed  Instead he has retreated from his record      and offered too many answers that have been inconsistent with his      past statements  Judge Alito      testified Wednesday that he saw no connection between the Unitary      Executive theory and the use of presidential signing statements  In      doing so  Judge Alito glossed over his own record which shows he had      a hand in pioneering a strategy to use these statements to expand      presidential power  It is a troubling tactic that President Bush is      prodigiously using today   We know that      Judge Alito has advocated his personal legal view about the Unitary      Executive theory in public remarks he made just a few years ago  as      a sitting judge  We also know that while in the Reagan      Administration in 1984 he helped craft the scheme of expanding      presidential power through increased use of presidential signing      statements   Efforts to      expand presidential power have led to troubling actions by this      President  and so far we have had insufficient and troubling      responses from his nominee for this vitally important job  The      Supreme Court  after all  is the ultimate check and balance in our      system of government
