       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Is The Department Of Justice   Politicizing The Hiring And Firing Of U S  Attorneys                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On HearingOn Preserving Prosecutorial      Independence   Is The Department Of Justice Politicizing     The Hiring And Firing Of U S  Attorneys   Part VII     August 2  2007      Today  the Committee welcomes Scott      Jennings  Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of      Political Affairs  He is accompanied by his attorney Mark Paoletta       whom the Committee has permitted to be seated with Mr  Jennings at      the witness table to provide him with counsel  Mr  Jennings       through his attorney  has informed the Committee that he will refuse      to answer questions falling within the Presidents unsubstantiated      blanket claim of executive privilege  I had a chance to meet with      Mr  Jennings just before the hearing  I thanked him for appearing      today and shared my hope that he would instead cooperate and testify      to the best of his knowledge and information  I reiterate that hope         the choice is his    His appearance here today contrasts      with the failure to appear by Karl Rove       who was also served with subpoenas to produce documents and testify      today  Mr  Jennings appearance shows that the White Houses newly      minted claim of immunity for White House employees is a sham  It      is also a shame that this White House continues to act as if it is      above the law  That is wrong  The subpoenas authorized by this      Committee in connection with its investigation into the mass firings      of U S  Attorneys and the corrosion of federal law enforcement by      White House political influence deserve respect and compliance         For many months  I have      sought the voluntary cooperation of the White House with our      investigation to no avail  Instead  the President and his counsel      have conditioned any limited availability of information on their      demand that whatever the White House provides initially must end the      matter  and the Senate Judiciary Committee must agree to stop its      pursuit of the truth  They also demand that the information they      chose to provide be shared behind closed doors  not under oath and      without any record of the responses  This matter is too important      to the publics trust in federal law enforcement to be left to a      self serving  one time only  secret interview on which there can be      no follow up    The White House said it      was willing to provide some information under these secret      conditions  but when pressed to do so in a manner that would allow      for follow up  this information suddenly becomes somehow      privileged and withheld from Congress  How can that be  How can      communications with the Justice Department  the RNC and others      outside the White House be subject to any claim of executive      privilege  How can White House employees like Karl Rove speak      publicly about these matters one day but declare that he cannot in      any way be accountable to the American people and their duly elected      representatives in Congress on the same matter    Karl Rove  who refused      to comply with Senate subpoenas  spoke publicly in sessions at Troy      University in Alabama and at the Clinton School of Public Service in      Arkansas about the U S  Attorney firings when the scandal first      became public  In March  he spoke about the reasons that were then      being given for the firings of individual U S  Attorneysreasons      that have now been shown to be inaccurate after the fact      fabrications  Yet  he will not appear when summoned      before Congress to tell the truth   He refuses to tell this Committee    with      legislative  oversight and advice and consent responsibilities for      the Department of Justice and United States Attorney    about his      role in targeting well respected U S  Attorneys for firing and in      seeking to cover up his role and that of his staff in the scandal        As in the Scooter Libby matter  this      White House starts by saying one thing and when caught in a lie  it      changes its talking points  all the while holding itself above the      law  When the firing scandal became public in January  the White      House said that it was not involved  When the then Deputy Attorney      General revealed in testimony in February something of the White      Houses role in the targeting of Bud Cummins for firing in Arkansas       it incensed the White House political operatives  Mr  Roves top      aide  Sara Taylor  appeared before this Committee last month but hid      behind the White House claim of Executive privilege  I hope that      Mr  Jennings will not repeat that error but will testify truthfully      about what he did  what he knows and what  in fact  happened     Like in the Libby scandal  as we have      pried back the cover up  the White House has hunkered down and      sought to fortify protection of political operatives like Mr  Rove      at all costs  That is why he is not here today     The      blanket claim of Executive privilege has not been substantiated  To      date the White House refuses even to specify the documents being      withheld pursuant to its claim  Could it be that the mere listing      of the documents  their dates  author and recipient will confirm the      intimate involvement of political operatives at the White House       such as Mr  Rove  Sadly  our efforts to follow the evidence where      it leads has been met with Nixonian stonewalling       We are quickly reaching      the point where  given the claim of executive privilege  the logical      question is what did the President know and when did he know it  By      his claim of executive privilege  is President Bush now taking      responsibility for the firing of such well regarded and      well performing U S  attorneys     To date  that has not      been the Presidents position  The Attorney Generals former chief      of staff  the former political director at the White House and the      Attorney General himself have testified under oath that they did not      talk to the President about these firings  That is      one reason why the White Houses blanket claim of Executive      privilege rings so hollow     The White House      continues to try to have it both ways  but it cannot  It cannot      block Congress from obtaining the relevant evidence and credibly      assert that nothing improper occurred  It cannot claim Executive      privilege based on the Presidents involvement and need for candid      advice and simultaneously contend that he was not involved  that      this was done at the Justice Department  This blanket claim appears      to me to be a misdirected effort by the White House legal team to      protect White House political operatives whose partisan schemes are      being discovered in a new set of White House horrors  rivaling      those of the Nixon White House and Watergate era        This is a grave matter       This is about improper political influence of our justice system       it is about the White House manipulating the Justice Department into      its own political arm  It is about manipulating our justice system      to pursue a partisan political agenda  It is about pressuring      prosecutors to bring cases of purported voter fraud to try to      influence elections  of sending a partisan operative like Bradley      Schlozman to Missouri to file charges on the eve of an election in      violation of Justice Department guidelines  It is about      high ranking officials misleading Congress and the American people      about this political manipulation of justice  It is about the      unprecedented and improper reach of politics into the Departments      professional ranks  such as the admission by the Departments White      House Liaison Monica Goodling that she improperly screened career      employees for political loyalty      It is about political      operatives pressuring prosecutors to bring partisan cases and      seeking retribution against those who refuse to bend to their      political will    such as the example of New Mexico U S  Attorney      David Iglesias  who was fired a few weeks after Karl Rove complained      to the Attorney General about the lack of purported voter fraud      enforcement cases in Mr  Iglesias jurisdiction  I hope to learn      more from Mr  Jennings today about why Mr  Iglesias was fired    The accumulated evidence      shows that the list for firings was compiled based on input from the      highest political ranks in the White House  including Mr  Rove and      Mr  Jennings  The evidence shows that senior officials were      apparently focused on the political impact of federal prosecutions      and whether federal prosecutors were doing enough to bring partisan      voter fraud and corruption cases  It is obvious that the reasons      given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover up and      that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that      same effort  Just recently during his sworn testimony  Mr  Gonzales      himself contrasted these politically motivated firings with the      replacement of other United States Attorneys for legitimate cause          There can be no more      conclusive demonstration of this Administrations partisan      intervention in federal law enforcement than its threat to block the      Justice Department from pursuing congressional contempt citations       This Administration has announced its intentions to interfere with      our system of justice by preventing a United States Attorney from      fulfilling his sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the      laws and proceed pursuant to section 194 of title 2 of the United      States Code     What the White House      stonewalling is preventing is conclusive evidence of who made the      decisions to fire these federal prosecutors Despite the      constitutional duty of all members of the Executive branch to take      Care that the Laws be faithfully executed the message from this      White House is that the President  Vice President  and their loyal      aides are above the law  No check  No balance  No      accountability     Given the stonewalling      by this White House  the American people are left to wonder  What is      it that the White House is so desperate to hide  As more and more      stories leak out about the involvement of Karl Rove and his      political team in political briefings of what should be nonpartisan      government offices  we seem to be getting a better sense of what      they are trying to hide     We have learned of      political briefings at over 20 government agencies  including      briefings attended by Justice Department officials  Mr  Rove      briefed diplomats on vulnerable Democratic districts before mid term      elections  Why  Senator Whitehouse properly asked at our recent      hearing  were members of our foreign service being briefed on      domestic political contests  Mr  Gonzales had no answer       Similarly  why were political operatives giving such briefings to      the Government Services Administration  which rents government      property and buys supplies  In her testimony before this Committee       the former political director at the White House ultimately had to      concede that her briefings included specific political races and      particular candidates being targeted     In this context  is      anyone surprised that the evidence in our investigation of the      firings of U S  Attorneys for political purposes points to Mr  Rove      and his political operations in the White House  Mr  Roves own      words suggest that placing loyal Bushies in key battleground      states for the next election played a significant role in these      firings  In April 2006  Mr  Rove gave a speech to the Republican      National lawyers Association where he listed 11 states he saw as      pivotal battlegrounds for the 2008 election       Pennsylvania  Michigan  Ohio  Florida  Colorado  Arkansas       Wisconsin  Minnesota  Nevada  Iowa  New Mexico       Since 2005  U S  Attorneys have been replaced in nine of these      states and considered for removal in all but one of them  Four of      the U S  Attorneys who were fired as part of the mass firing were      from these states and many now have to wonder what others did to      show they were loyal Bushies and keep their jobs    We have learned that Mr       Rove raised concerns with the Attorney General about prosecutors not      aggressively pursuing purported voter fraud cases in several of the      districts he discussed in that speech and that prior to the 2006      mid term election he sent the Attorney Generals chief of staff a      packet of information containing a 30 page report concerning voting      in Wisconsin in 2004  This evidence points to his role and the role      of those in his office in removing or trying to remove prosecutors      not considered sufficiently loyal to Republican electoral prospects       Such manipulation shows corruption of federal law enforcement for      partisan political purposes    Documents and testimony      also show that Mr  Rove had a role in shaping the Administrations      response to congressional inquiries into these dismissals  which led      to inaccurate and misleading testimony to Congress and statements to      the public  This response included an attempt to cover up the role      that he and other White House officials played in the firings    There is a cloud over      this White House and a gathering storm  Federal prosecutors      observed that such a cloud hangs over the Vice President in the      Libby case  A similar cloud now envelopes Mr  Rove and his partisan      political team at the White House  as well  In the course of      sentencing Libby to 30 months in prison  Judge Walton rightly      observed that public servants owe a duty to the American people       That duty includes telling the truth  I believe that duty also      includes not corrupting law enforcement for partisan political gain         Congress will continue      to pursue the truth behind this matter because it is our      constitutional responsibility    and it is the right thing to do       I continue to hope that the White House will stop its stonewalling      and accept my offer to negotiate a workable solution to the      Committees oversight needs  so that we can effectively get to the      bottom of what has gone on and gone wrong                 Background      on Rove Involvement         Evidence Of Karl Roves Involvement     In Plan To Target And Remove U S  Attorneys       Evidence Shows Mr  Rove Was Involved From The Beginning In Plans To      Remove U S  Attorneys               A January 9  2005 e mail released by      the Department shows that Karl Rove initiated inquiries as to how      we planned to proceed regarding U S  Attorneys  whether we were      going to allow all to stay  request resignations from all and accept      only some of them  or selectively replace them  etc    OAG 180           In his response to queries from      David Leitch  a White House official  Kyle Sampson expressly      deferred to the political judgment of Mr  Rove as to whether to      proceed with plans for the replacement of U S  Attorneys       writing  I f Karl thinks there would be political will to do it       then so do I   OAG 180       Testimony And Documents Show Mr  Rove Was Heavily Involved In Firing      Of David Iglesias  New Mexico U S  Attorney              Roves aide  Scott Jennings  set up      a meeting between White House Liaison Monica Goodling and New Mexico      Republican officials in June 2006 to talk about the U S  Attorney      situation in New Mexico  describing it as sensitive  OAG      112           Rove also discussed the performance      of Mr  Iglesias with Senator Domenici  who himself had called Mr       Iglesias before the election to ask whether he was bringing      indictments against a Democratic official in the lead up to the      election   David Iglesiass      Testimony Before Senate and House Judiciary Committees  March 6       2007           Iglesias was fired a few weeks after      Mr  Rove complained to the Attorney General about the lack of      purported voter fraud enforcement cases in his jurisdiction       David Iglesiass      Testimony Before Senate and House Judiciary Committees  March 6       2007           According to Allen Weh  Chairman of      New Mexico s Republican party chairman  when he asked Mr  Rove      during a holiday party in 2006 is anything ever going to happen to      that guy     referring to Mr  Iglesias    Mr  Rove responded  Hes

Congressional Staff  May 4  2007           Prior to the 2006 mid term election      Rove sent the Attorney Generals Chief of Staff a packet of      information containing a 30 page report concerning voting in      Wisconsin in 2004 asking the Department to look into it despite the      contradiction with Justice Department policy        Matthew Friedrichs Testimony to Congressional Staff  May 4  2007       Mr  Rove And His Deputies Were Heavily Involved In Installing Tim      Griffin After Firing Bud Cummins As U S  Attorney In Eastern      District of Arkansas           According to documents and      testimony  Sara Taylor  the head of the White House political      operation and a deputy of Mr  Roves  and Scott Jennings  another      aide to Mr  Rove  were involved in the discussions and planning that      led to the removal of Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate      confirmation process to install Tim Griffin  another former aide to      Mr  Rove  as U S  Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas       Kyle Sampsons      Testimony Before the Senate Judiciary Committee  March 29  2007           They were part of a group that      discussed using the Attorney Generals expanded authority under the      Patriot Act reauthorization to avoid the opposition of the Arkansas      Senators by appointing Mr  Griffin as interim indefinitely  in      contrast to
