       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Recent Documents Relating To   The Roberts Nomination                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      D Vt   Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Recent Documents Relating To The Roberts Nomination     August 16  2005 Since the      President announced his intention to nominate Judge John Roberts to      the Supreme Court  Democratic Senators have done our job on behalf      of the American people in trying to learn as much as possible about      the man who could replace Sandra Day OConnor for this lifetime      appointment to our highest court  As we made clear from the start       there has been no pre judgment before the facts about this important      nomination  Instead  Democratic Senators have gone about fulfilling      our constitutional duty by insisting on fair access to documents      from John Robertss time working as a senior policymaker for two      Republican Presidents  Although the Bush Administration still      refuses to provide the most important examples of Judge Robertss      policy views from his tenure as the politically appointed Principal      Deputy Solicitor General  we have been able to review thousands of      pages of documents that have been provided by the National Archives      and Records Administration in response to earlier public requests       Those papers that      we have received paint a picture of John Roberts as an eager and      aggressive advocate of policies that are deeply tinged with the      ideology of the far right wing of his party then  and now  In      influential White House and Department of Justice positions  John      Roberts expressed views that were among the most radical being      offered by a cadre intent on reversing decades of policies on civil      rights  voting rights  womens rights  privacy  and access to      justice   He advocated      overturning a Nixon era Executive Order that assures      non discrimination in federal contracting  he mocked the efforts of      women legislators to find a way to remedy the effects of sex      discrimination  he wrote of a so called right to privacy and      so called fundamental rights  he opposed efforts to make the      voting rights act more effective  and he championed efforts to strip      courts of their ability to grant remedies to civil rights      plaintiffs  taking a position more extreme than conservative      political appointees in the Reagan Justice Department  When President      Bush recently introduced Judge Roberts to the nation  we knew he was      a well educated  accomplished lawyer  but Americans had few other      facts  There is still much of Judge Robertss record that we do not      have and that would be useful in considering this lifetime      appointment to replace a most influential voice of practical reason      on the United States Supreme Court  The White House is steadfastly      refusing to follow past precedent and allow Senators to review a      good deal of the most relevant material from his work in the      Executive Branch  By doing so they raise the inference that there      is much to hide  They leave Judge Roberts with a heavier burden to      carry during his upcoming hearings before the Judiciary Committee
