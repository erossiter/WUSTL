       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Crisis Of Democracy In The Middle   East                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On     The Crisis Of Democracy In The Middle East     September 18  2006 Mr  LEAHY  I want to share with the Senate an      important analysis of the current crisis of democracy in the Middle      East by one of Egypts wisest and most courageous voices for      democracy   We all have an interest in supporting      democracy  We also recognize that countries in the Middle East       including Muslim countries with which we have close relations  are      confronting difficult and divisive social  religious and political      challenges  These challenges have no simple solutions  But we      should be concerned with the support that the Bush Administration       like many of its predecessors  gives to autocratic and corrupt      regimes in this volatile part of the world  It has contributed to      anger and disillusionment  particularly among Muslims  toward their      own governments and towards the United States  and growing support      for those who promote extremist political and religious agendas       Saad Eddin Ibrahim is a respected Egyptian      pro democracy activist and sociologist  He founded the Ibn Khaldun      Center for Development Studies at the American University of Cairo       one of the few independent research institutions in the Arab world       He has been wrongly imprisoned  and then acquitted  for his      criticism of the Egyptian government and for his relations with      international organizations  Saad Ibrahim is a respected and      principled advocate for human rights and democratic values  and he      represents a voice of reason and tolerance in an increasingly      polarized and antagonistic Muslim society  His recent Op Ed in the Washington Post      should serve as a wake up call for proponents of our current      policies in support of repressive regimes around the world  He has      had the courage to speak out against Muslim dictatorships  and he      not only represents those who oppose authoritarianism but also those      who oppose radical Islam and extremism   All Senators should take the time to consider      Saad Ibrahims perspective  and I ask unanimous consent that his Op      Ed be printed in the Record   The Washington Post     The  New Middle East  Bush Is Resisting     By Saad Eddin Ibrahim     August 23  2006 President Bush and Secretary of State      Condoleezza Rice may be quite right about a new Middle East being      born  In fact  their policies in support of the actions of their      closest regional ally  Israel  have helped midwife the newborn  But      it will not be exactly the baby they have longed for  For one thing       it will be neither secular nor friendly to the United States  For      another  it is going to be a rough birth  What is happening in the broader Middle East      and North Africa can be seen as a boomerang effect that has been      playing out slowly since the horrific events of Sept  11  2001  In      the immediate aftermath of those attacks  there was worldwide      sympathy for the United States and support for its declared war on      terrorism  including the invasion of Afghanistan  Then the cynical      exploitation of this universal goodwill by so called      neoconservatives to advance hegemonic designs was confirmed by the      war in Iraq  The Bush administration s dishonest statements about      weapons of mass destruction diminished whatever credibility the      United States might have had as liberator  while disastrous      mismanagement of Iraqi affairs after the invasion led to the      squandering of a conventional military victory  The country slid      into bloody sectarian violence  while official Washington      stonewalled and refused to admit mistakes  No wonder the world has      progressively turned against America  Against this declining moral standing       President Bush made something of a comeback in the first year of his      second term  He shifted his foreign policy rhetoric from a war on      terrorism to a war of ideas and a struggle for liberty and      democracy  Through much of 2005 it looked as if the Middle East      might finally have its long overdue spring of freedom  Lebanon      forged a Cedar Revolution  triggered by the assassination of its      popular former prime minister  Rafiq Hariri  Egypt held its first      multi candidate presidential election in 50 years  So did Palestine      and Iraq  despite harsh conditions of occupation  Qatar and Bahrain      in the Arabian Gulf continued their steady evolution into      constitutional monarchies  Even Saudi Arabia held its first      municipal elections   But there was more  Hamas mobilized candidates      and popular campaigns to win a plurality in Palestinian legislative      elections and form a new government  Hezbollah in Lebanon and the      Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt achieved similar electoral successes       And with these developments  a sudden chill fell over Washington and      other Western capitals  Instead of welcoming these particular elected      officials into the newly emerging democratic fold  Washington began      a cold war on Muslim democrats  Even the tepid pressure on      autocratic allies of the United States to democratize in 2005 had      all but disappeared by 2006  In fact  tottering Arab autocrats felt      they had a new lease on life with the West conveniently cowed by an      emerging Islamist political force  Now the cold war on Islamists has escalated      into a shooting war  first against Hamas in Gaza and then against      Hezbollah in Lebanon  Israel is perceived in the region  rightly or      wrongly  to be an agent acting on behalf of U S  interests  Some      will admit that there was provocation for Israel to strike at Hamas      and Hezbollah following the abduction of three soldiers and attacks      on military and civilian targets  But destroying Lebanon with an      overkill approach born of a desire for vengeance cannot be morally      tolerated or politically justified    and it will not work  On July 30 Arab  Muslim and world outrage      reached an unprecedented level with the Israeli bombing of a      residential building in the Lebanese village of Qana  which killed      dozens and wounded hundreds of civilians  most of them children  A      similar massacre in Qana in 1996  which Arabs remember painfully      well  proved to be the political undoing of then Prime Minister      Shimon Peres  It is too early to predict whether Prime Minister Ehud      Olmert will survive Qana II and the recent war  But Hezbollah will      survive  just as it has already outlasted five Israeli prime      ministers and three American presidents  Born in the thick of an earlier Israeli      invasion  in 1982  Hezbollah is at once a resistance movement      against foreign occupation  a social service provider for the needy      of the rural south and the slum dwellers of Beirut  and a model      actor in Lebanese and Middle Eastern politics  Despite access to      millions of dollars in resources from within and from regional      allies Syria and Iran  its three successive leaders have projected      an image of clean governance and a pious personal lifestyle  In more than four weeks of fighting against the      strongest military machine in the region  Hezbollah held its own and      won the admiration of millions of Arabs and Muslims  People in the      region have compared its steadfastness with the swift defeat of      three large Arab armies in the Six Day War of 1967  Hasan Nasrallah       its current leader  spoke several times to a wide regional audience      through his own al Manar network as well as the more popular al Jazeera       Nasrallah has become a household name in my own country  Egypt  According to the preliminary results of a      recent public opinion survey of 1 700 Egyptians by the Cairo based      Ibn Khaldun Center  Hezbollah s action garnered 75 percent approval       and Nasrallah led a list of 30 regional public figures ranked by      perceived importance  He appears on 82 percent of responses       followed by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  73 percent        Khaled Meshal of Hamas  60 percent   Osama bin Laden  52 percent       and Mohammed Mahdi Akef of Egypt s Muslim Brotherhood  45 percent   The pattern here is clear  and it is Islamic       And among the few secular public figures who made it into the top 10      are Palestinian Marwan Barghouti  31 percent  and Egypt s Ayman Nour       29 percent   both of whom are prisoners of conscience in Israeli      and Egyptian jails  respectively  None of the current heads of Arab states made      the list of the 10 most popular public figures  While subject to      future fluctuations  these Egyptian findings suggest the direction      in which the region is moving  The Arab people do not respect the      ruling regimes  perceiving them to be autocratic  corrupt and inept       They are  at best  ambivalent about the fanatical Islamists of the      bin Laden variety  More mainstream Islamists with broad support       developed civic dispositions and services to provide are the most      likely actors in building a new Middle East  In fact  they are      already doing so through the Justice and Development Party in      Turkey  the similarly named PJD in Morocco  the Muslim Brotherhood      in Egypt  Hamas in Palestine and  yes  Hezbollah in Lebanon  These groups  parties and movements are not      inimical to democracy  They have accepted electoral systems and      practiced electoral politics  probably too well for Washington s      taste  Whether we like it or not  these are the facts  The rest of      the Western world must come to grips with the new reality  even if      the U S  president and his secretary of state continue to reject the      new offspring of their own policies  The writer is an Egyptian democracy activist       professor of political sociology at the American University in      Cairo  and chairman of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development
