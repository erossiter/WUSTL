       Leahy And Stevens Urge State And DHS To Take More Time To Work Out Kinks   In WHTI Border Crossing Plans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy And     Stevens Urge State And DHS    To Take More Time To Work Out Kinks    In WHTI Border Crossing Plans   WASHINGTON  Monday  June 11         Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska   leaders     of Senate efforts to fix flaws in plans to implement the Western     Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     are asking the State and Homeland     Security Departments to use the extra time their legislation allows to     work out the problems in the border crossing scheme  before it is     implemented    They said current passport     processing backlogs that have snarled thousands of Americans travel     plans in recent weeks are a hint of worse chaos to come if the     Administration holds to its current schedule for land and water     deployment of the new border crossing scheme next January    Leahy and Stevens  senior     members of the Senate Appropriations Committee  last fall pushed through     to enactment their legislation giving the two departments up to 17 extra     months  until June 1  2009  to address WHTIs many problems  The     Leahy Stevens Amendment sets out seven requirements that must be     certified to Congress before the program can be implemented  So far      the Bush Administration has maintained that it will not use and does not     need extra time to be ready  The current passport processing backlog     followed the Administrations recent launch of WHTIs first phase  for     air travel in the Western Hemisphere  On Jan  1  the Administration     plans to begin a much larger phase  for those crossing borders by land     or by sea   In     their letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of     Homeland Security Michael Chertoff  the lawmakers write  In light of     this decision to delay implementation of the rule for air travelers  we     hope your agencies now will take all the necessary time allowed under     the law to implement the land and sea provisions properly  Air composes     a fraction of the overall cross border travel between the United States     and Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean  There is another train wreck on     the horizon if your agencies continue pushing forward with full     implementation of the WHTI before the necessary policies and procedures     are in place to handle the lengthy delays that are sure to come             We urge you to announce that your agencies will use the time allotted by     Congress  until June 2009 under current law  to execute the WHTI     sensibly   The     text of their letter follows     June 11  2007  The Honorable Condoleezza Rice    Secretary    U S  Department of State    Washington  DC 20520    The Honorable Michael Chertoff    Secretary    U S  Department of Homeland Security    Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff   As you know  on January 1  2007  the     Administration implemented a new requirement that all passengers     traveling by air to and from the United States and Canada  Mexico  and     the Caribbean must have a passport  As a direct result of this new     requirement  thousands of travelers across the country have been     discovering they cannot get their passports in time for their air     flights and many have had to cancel their plane tickets and travel     plans  Hundreds of Vermonters and Alaskans have been calling our     offices for assistance  and we know that our Senate colleagues have     experienced high levels of urgent requests from their constituents  as     well  We have been doing what we can  passport by passport   Despite Administration claims that the air     rule implementation was proceeding smoothly  the U S  Departments of     State and Homeland Security announced last week a temporary delay in     implementation of the air provisions of the Western Hemisphere Travel     Initiative  WHTI  due to the logistical failure in processing passport     applications nationwide  We feel this was a necessary adjustment in     response to these backlogs   In light of this decision to delay     implementation of the rule for air travelers  we hope your agencies now     will take all the necessary time allowed under the law to implement the     land and sea provisions properly  Air composes a fraction of the     overall cross border travel between the United States and Canada      Mexico  and the Caribbean  There is another train wreck on the horizon     if your agencies continue pushing forward with full implementation of     the WHTI before the necessary policies and procedures are in place to     handle the lengthy delays that are sure to come    Since your agencies underestimated the     passport demand with air implementation  we remain concerned that your     continued public insistence on full implementation of the land and sea     travel provisions in January 2008 is unrealistic and unachievable      Public comments by you  the U S  Ambassador to Canada  and Department of     Homeland Security spokespeople about the firmness of the January 2008     date for the land and sea deadline have not been constructive in     informing the American people about the true status of the program      Instead  such statements have added confusion and chaos to the entire     WHTI rollout  perhaps exacerbating the passport delays   Therefore  we would urge that you and all     your agency officials acknowledge that the WHTI needs additional time     for successful implementation and cease pressing the January 2008     implementation date  We urge you to announce that your agencies will     use the time allotted by Congress  until June 2009 under current law      to execute the WHTI sensibly  In addition  we hope that you will     continue working to meet the certification requirements provided in the     Leahy Stevens amendment incorporated in the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland     Security Appropriations Bill  Your work to comply with these criteria     has already produced a better designed overall WHTI program for the     future   Thank you in advance for your     consideration of these requests  We look forward to continuing our     efforts to implement the WHTI in a reasonable and prudent manner       Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY    United States Senator  TED STEVENS    United States Senator
