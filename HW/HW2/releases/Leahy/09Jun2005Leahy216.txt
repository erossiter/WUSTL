       Senate Panel Clears Cornyn Leahy FOIA Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Senate Panel Clears Cornyn Leahy FOIA Reform   Reform bill would      ensure that any future legislative FOIA exemption attempts must be      done openly  WASHINGTONThe Senate Judiciary      Committee on Thursday cleared legislation authored by U S  Sens       John Cornyn  R Texas  and Patrick Leahy  D Vt   to ensure greater      openness in the legislative process  The bill  S  1181   approved by      a voice vote  creates additional legislative transparency by      requiring that any future legislation containing exemptions to the      Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requirements be stated explicitly      within the text of the bill  It is the third open government reform      bill that Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary      Committee  and Cornyn  also a member on the panel  have joined      together to sponsor   This bipartisan legislation will help      to ensure an open and deliberate process in Congress  and todays      vote gives me optimism that we will be able to clear this bill in      the full Senate soon as well  Cornyn said following the vote  The      justification for this provision is simple  Congress should not      establish new secrecy provisions through secret means  If Congress      is to establish a new exemption to FOIA  it should do so in the open      and in the light of day   In recent years  we have seen more of      these types of exemptions tucked in legislation  and while some are      appropriate  every single one deserves scrutiny  Congress must be      diligent in reviewing any new exemptions to prevent possible      abuses  said Leahy  a longtime advocate for open government and      FOIA champion    Sens  Cornyn and Leahy introduced the      Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of      2005  OPEN Government Act  S  394  on Feb  16  and a separate bill      on March 10 to establish an advisory Commission on Freedom of      Information Act Processing Delays  Other co sponsors of the OPEN      Government Act include Sens  Russell Feingold  D Wisc    Lamar      Alexander  R Tenn    Johnny Isakson  R Ga   and Ben Nelson  D Neb     Cornyn and Leahy held a hearing on      March 15 that examined the OPEN Government Act  The last time      Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade ago  and      the Senate Judiciary Committee had not convened an oversight hearing      on compliance issues since 1992  The Senate Homeland Security and      Governmental Affairs Committee  which shares jurisdiction over      federal government information  has not held a FOIA oversight      hearing since 1980    Cornyn was      presented with the James Madison Award in 2001 for his efforts as      Texas Attorney General to promote open government by the Freedom of      Information Foundation of  Texas  Sen  Cornyn      served previously as Texas Attorney General  Texas Supreme Court      Justice  and Bexar County District Judge   Leahy sponsored      the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments  which updated      FOIA for the Internet age  and in 1996 he was installed in the      Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame   Leahy is also the sponsor of the      RESTORE FOIA Act  a bill that would restore the biggest single      rollback FOIA has suffered in its 38 year history  by clarifying an      overly broad provision that allows corporate polluters and others to      avoid public disclosure of problems simply by stamping them      critical infrastructure information                         Below is Leahys Statement from      the Committees Meeting        Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On S 1181  Cornyn Leahy      FOIA Bill  Executive Business Meeting      June 9  2005  For the third time this year  Senator      Cornyn and I have joined together to introduce common sense      proposals to strengthen open government and the Freedom of      Information Act    The bill on todays agenda was just      introduced on Tuesday  but it is simply a single section of a      broader FOIA bill that we introduced in February    This bill  S 1181  is very      straightforward  It merely requires that when Congress sees fit to      provide a statutory exemption to FOIA  it must state its intention      to do so explicitly  No one argues with the notion that some      government information is appropriately kept from public view  and      therefore  FOIA contains a number of exemptions  One provision of      FOIA  commonly known as the  b  3  exemption  states that records      that are specifically exempted by statute may be withheld from      disclosure    Many bills that are introduced contain      statutory exemptions  or contain language that is ambiguous and      might be interpreted as such by the courts  In recent years  we      have seen more and more such exemptions offered in legislation             We believe that individual statutory exemptions should be vigorously      debated before lawmakers vote in favor of them  Sometimes such      proposed exemptions are clearly delineated in proposed legislation       but other times they amount to a few lines within a highly complex      and lengthy bill  These are difficult to locate and analyze in a      timely manner  even for those of us who stand watch     Not every statutory exemption is      inappropriate  but every proposal deserves scrutiny  Congress must      be diligent in reviewing new exemptions to prevent possible abuses       Focusing more sunshine on this process is an antidote to exemption      creep  The solution is to require Congress to identify proposed      statutory FOIA exemptions in newly introduced legislation in a      uniform manner    I urge all members of the Committee to      support this bill
