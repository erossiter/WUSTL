       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate judiciary Committee    Judicial Confirmation Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Judicial Confirmation Hearing    June 20  2007 Today  the Committee will hear from four more     nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal courts  William     Lindsay Osteen  Jr  to the District Court for the Middle District of     North Carolina  Martin Karl Reidinger to the District Court for the     Western District of North Carolina  Timothy D  DeGiusti to the District     Court for the Western District of Oklahoma  and Janis Lynn Sammartino to     the District Court for the Southern District of California  All four of these nominees have the support of     their home state senators  I thank Senators Inhofe  Dole  and Burr for     agreeing to come to the hearing to introduce their home state nominees      and I thank Senator Feinstein for agreeing to chair this important     hearing  The Senate has confirmed 18 judges so far this     year  It is not yet summer  and we have already confirmed more judges     than were confirmed during the entire 1996 session when President     Clintons nominees were being reviewed by a Republican Senate majority      In that session  not a single circuit court nominee was confirmed   The Judiciary Committee has already reported 25     nominees to lifetime appointments so far this year  and is holding a     hearing today for four more  so the total number of judges confirmed     will likely increase further soon  We have already confirmed three circuit court     judges  and we are not yet halfway through this year  Those three     circuit court confirmations put us well ahead of the pace set in 1999     when a Republican led Senate was considering the nominees of a     Democratic President  At the end of that Congress  the last two years     of the Clinton Administration  the Republican led Senate returned to the     President without action 17 of his appellate court nominees  I do not     intend to duplicate that record any more than I intend to see the Senate     pocket filibuster more than 60 of President Bushs judicial nominees  as     Republicans did with President Clintons   The Senate has confirmed 118 judges while I have     served as Judiciary Chairman  It is a little known fact that during the     more than six years of the Bush Presidency  more circuit court judges      more district court judges  and more total judges have been confirmed in     less time while I served as Judiciary Chairman than during the tenures     of either of the two Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate     majorities  The Administrative     Office of the U S  Courts lists 50 judicial vacancies  yet the President     has sent us only 28 nominations for these vacancies  Twenty two of     these vacancies almost half  have no nominee  Of the 15 vacancies     deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies  the     President has yet to send us nominees for six of them  That     means that more than a third of the judicial emergency vacancies have no     nominee  Of the 13 circuit court vacancies  more than half     are without a nominee  If the President had worked with the Senators     from Rhode Island  New Jersey  Maryland  California  Michigan and the     other states with the remaining circuit vacancies  we could be in     position to make even more progress   As it is  we have cut the circuit vacancies in     half  from 26 to 13  Contrast that with the way the Republican led     Senates lack of action on President Clintons moderate and qualified     nominees resulted in circuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26      During most of the Clinton years  the Republican led Senate engaged in     strenuous efforts to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a     Republican President  To a great extent they succeeded   With the cooperation of the President and with the     cooperation of the Committee and the Senate  we can continue to make     progress  I look forward to hearing from the nominees before us today
