       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of William Myers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     WASHINGTON          Thursday  March 17     The Senate Judiciary Committee  in a 10 8         party line vote  reported out the controversial judicial nomination of         William Myers on Thursday  All eight Democratic members of the Committee         voted against the nomination  which now moves to the full Senate  Myers         is nominated to a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  The Senate         rejected his nomination in the last Congress  A statement from Senator         Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member of the panel          opposing the nomination  follows    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         On the Nomination Of William Myers       Executive Business Meeting        March 17  2005  As far as the nomination of William Myers to        the Ninth Circuit is concerned  last week it was listed prematurely  This        week I will not ask that it be held over  I will not ask that Committee        consideration on this nominee be delayed  I have only asked that it be        considered in the regular course    I note that a key difference between the way        Republicans prevented votes on more than 60 of President Clintons moderate        and qualified nominees and the manner in which we have opposed a handful of        President Bushs most extreme nominees is that we say publicly why we        oppose the nomination and are withholding consent    Little has changed in connection with this        controversial nomination since last year  I explained then  and I will        again today  that William Myers is perhaps the most anti environmental        judicial nominee we have seen nominated to the Senate  This nomination is        an example of how this President seeks to misuse his power of appointment        to the federal bench  Mr  Myers is neither qualified nor independent        enough to receive confirmation for a lifetime appointment to this federal        circuit court  His nomination is the epitome of the anti environmental        tilt of so many of President Bushs nominees and policies  This nomination        should be rejected   Chairman Specter afforded Mr  Myers an        opportunity to provide the Committee and the Senate with additional        information to show that he now merits the consent of the Senate to his        lifetime appointment as a judicial custodial of the rights of all        Americans  I found him less candid and forthcoming in his recent        appearance before the Committee than before  I urge all Senators to review        his answers  in particular  his exchange with me over his role in the        career of Robert Comer and his failure to answer Senator Feingolds        questions    Mr  Myers hometown newspaper warned that as        Solicitor at the Department of the Interior  Myers sounds less like an        attorney  and more like an apologist for his old friends in the cattle        industry  He has a record of extremism when it comes to his opposition to        environmental protections  having gone as far as comparing the federal        governments management of public lands to the tyrannical actions of King        George over the American colonies   I have reviewed the record that Mr  Myers has        logged in private practice and in the Bush Administration  We have given        Mr  Myers ample opportunity to be heard and to make his case  I am not        persuaded that he would be a fair and impartial adjudicator if confirmed to        the federal bench  Unfortunately  the conclusion I arrived at is that  if        confirmed  Mr  Myers would be an anti environmental activist on the bench         On more than one occasion  Mr  Myers advocacy has pushed the limits of the        law  As The New York Times        editorialized  Mr  Myers regularly took positions that  though legally        insupportable  would have had a devastating impact on the environment  He        has a consistent record of using whatever position and authority he has had        to benefit corporate interests at the expense of the environment and at the        expense of the interests of the American people in environmental        protections  That record has not changed in the last year     As the chief lawyer at the Department of the        Interior  Mr  Myers disregarded the law in order to make it easier for        companies to mine on public lands  a position consistent with his prior        role lobbying for mining interests while he was in private practice  He        interpreted the mining law in a way that would have allowed the reversal of        Secretary Babbitts rejection of a permit for Glamis Mining Co  on land in        the Southeastern California desert  Fortunately  an        independent review by a federal court concluded that Mr  Myers        interpretation was wrong  The court called into question his ability to        interpret a statute as he violated three well established canons of        statutory construction  In addition  he acted without        government to government consultation with the Quechan Indian Nation  a        federally recognized tribe  or other Colorado River Tribes  before taking        action to imperil their sacred places    As Solicitor General at the Interior        Department  Mr  Myers encouraged two Northern California        congressmen to sponsor legislation that would have given a private firm        eight acres of valuable federal land in Yuba County  California         Recognizing that the government did not have the right to turn over the        land without compensation  he told the landowners that the department        would support private relief legislation to accomplish that goal  The        Department has since withdrawn its support for the private relief bill        after its own agents produced readily available documents that conclusively        proved that the government owned the land   William Myers has been nominated to a circuit        court with jurisdiction over an area of the country which contains hundreds        of millions of acres of national parks  national forests and other public        lands  tribal lands  and sacred sites  Judges on the Ninth Circuit decide        legal disputes concerning the use and conservation of many of the most        spectacular and sacred lands in America and often make the final decision        on critical mining  grazing  logging  recreation  endangered species         coastal  wilderness  and other issues affecting the nations natural        heritage  These judges are also the arbiters on treaty  statutory  trust        relationship  and other issues affecting American Indian tribal        governments  Native Americans  and Alaska Native groups  The Ninth Circuit        plays an enormous and pivotal role in interpreting and applying a broad        range of environmental rules and protections that are important to millions        of Americans  and to future generations of Americans    I have no assurance that Mr  Myers would        uphold congressional power under the Constitutions Commerce Clause to        protect our air  water  and land  Mr  Myers brief in Solid Waste        Agency of Northern Cook County v  U S  Army Corps of Engineers        takes an extremely narrow view that would undermine our nations        environmental  health  safety  labor  disability and civil rights laws          I am concerned that Mr  Myers will ignore the        true meaning of the Eleventh Amendment and undercut the right of citizens        to sue to enforce environmental protections  In an era of ballooning        government deficits and cuts in environmental enforcement budgets  there is        much at stake if courts eliminate or minimize the critical role of private        attorneys general who are needed to ensure that polluters are complying        with federal mandates  Mr  Myers argues that judges should be activist and        require non profit environmental organizations to post a bond for payment        of costs and damages if they wish to sue to enforce environmental        protections  He wrote  Environmentalists are mountain biking to the        courthouse as never before  bent on stopping human activity wherever it may        promote health  safety and welfare  These positions raise concerns that        plaintiffs in his courtroom who are members of environmental organizations        will receive fair  unbiased treatment  I wonder if he would have the same        opinion of the groups that will surely turn to the courts to block the        Administrations new mercury regulation  Would he have the same view of        the many state attorneys general that have filed lawsuits to stop the Bush        Administrations assault on the Clean Air Act    If anything  over the last month or so we        have learned more about Mr  Myers poor judgment and decisions that harm        the interests of the land he was empowered to protect   He has been amply rewarded both monetarily        and by positions in the Bush Administration for his service to business        interests  He is not entitled  however  to a lifetime appointment on the        federal courts  The revolving door should not swing that far   We know that while Mr  Myers was Solicitor of        the Interior  private landowners were treated more than fairly  One        example that stands out is the one sided settlement given to a        politically connected Wyoming rancher by a lawyer who was        recruited  directly supervised and promoted by Mr  Myers  Robert Comer was        the lawyer who gave a deal so unbalanced that it was criticized by the U S         Attorneys Office in Wyoming and investigated by the Department of        Interiors Inspector General  who concluded that the case cried out for              action  Although he tried mightily not to tell us  Mr  Myers finally        admitted at his hearing and in written answers that he had already known        Comer when he chose to hire him from among the names offered by the Bush        White House  Although he tried hard to obscure the fact  Mr  Myers finally        told us that the situation of an Associate Solicitor like Comer taking on        the settlement of a local matter like he did was unique in his tenure at        Interior  And although he may now be ashamed to admit it publicly  he        eventually owned up to having chosen then political appointee Comer from        among others recommended more highly for a coveted  and more secure  career        job in the Interior Department  Was Mr  Myers aware of how politically        connected the rancher was  Did his superiors order him to make the rancher        happy or did he just not ask the hard questions when he gave his political        subordinate authority to make the case go away  Whatever the real story         it does not reflect well on Mr  Myers independence  his management skills        or his judgment    An        Administration Bent On Weakening Environmental Laws  For the last four years  the Bush        Administration has systematically  and often stealthily  set out to        undermine the basic safeguards that have been used by administrations of        both parties to protect the environment  One way the Bush Administration        has demonstrated its contempt for our nations environmental laws is in the        court system  A Defenders of Wildlife study covering the Administrations        first two years noted how its agencies argued in court  Amazingly  in        cases where the Administration had a chance to defend the National        Environmental Protection Act  NEPA   more than 50 percent of the time it        presented arguments in court which would weaken NEPA  Similarly  the        Administration argued to weaken the Endangered Species Act  ESA  more than        60 percent of the time   Despite the Administrations arguments        against the environmental laws it is entrusted with protecting  and despite        the deference customarily paid to Executive agencies in federal court  the        independent federal judiciary  thus far  has generally upheld our        longstanding environmental laws  The courts ruled against the        Administrations arguments to weaken NEPA 78 percent of the time  and ruled        against the Administrations arguments to weaken the ESA an astounding 89        percent of the time  In the past year  our federal courts resisted        efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act  the Clean Air Act  and the        Endangered Species Act  The courts protected our National Monuments from        challenges by extremist groups trying to strip them of their status  upheld        air conditioning standards which save energy and money for consumers  and        stopped Administration rollbacks that benefited industry at the expense of        our forests  The result of these court decisions is that our vital        wetlands and rivers are not yet decimated  diverse species are protected        from extinction  and the standards for air quality are still in compliance        with the law    The Bush Administration has not abandoned its        attacks on the environment as its recent rules on mercury serve to remind        us  Without an independent judiciary  the destruction of our environmental        protections is an inevitable consequence we face  There are cases pending        where the outcomes could affect whether our air is threatened by toxic        chemicals and whether our water and health are threatened by pollution and        pesticides  There are cases pending whether to allow snowmobiles in our        National Parks  whether to allow the Administration to open up 8 8 million        acres of important wildlife habitat and hunting and fishing grounds in        Alaska for oil and gas leasing  whether pumping dirty water into the        Everglades violates the Clean Water Act  whether to cut old growth forests        in Oregon and California  and whether the Administration can open our        nations largest National Forest to logging  After this weeks budget vote        there may even be cases on how to open the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling   The Bush Administration has already proposed        more rollbacks to our environmental safeguards  aiming to benefit industry        at the expense of the publics interest in clean air and water  our public        lands  and some of our most fragile wildlife populations  While today we        have a federal judiciary which has in many instances prevented this        Administrations attempts to roll back important environmental laws and        protections  in the future we may not be so fortunate  Today  the        appellate courts in this country have tilted out of balance with Republican        appointees already in control of 10 of the 13 circuit courts  The American        people expect good stewardship of the nations air  water and public lands         and the American people deserve that  Judges have a duty to enforce the        protections imposed by environmental laws  The Senate has a duty to make        sure that we do not put judges on the bench whose activism and personal        ideology would prevent fair and impartial adjudication and would circumvent        environmental protections that Congress intended to benefit the American        people and generations to come    Will the federal courts continue to stand as        a bulwark against the Administrations assault on environmental protection         Not if people like Mr  Myers are confirmed to the federal courts  I have        reason to fear that he will engage in wholesale judicial activism to serve        the corporate interests he has been serving his entire career  An        editorial in The Boston Globe        recognized  When the White House is in the clutches of the oil  coal         mining  and timber companies  as it is now  the best defenders of laws to        protect the environment are often federal judges  The editorial concludes        that if the Senate confirms William Myers  the judicial check in this        administrations unbalanced policies will be weakened   The American people have the right to expect        their federal courts to vigorously uphold their federal laws that protect        their air and water and the laws that ensure good stewardship of our parks         recreation areas and conserved lands  This nomination runs counter to what        the American people want and expect of their government and their courts                  Exceptional Concern  Strong And Widespread Opposition  The list of those who are deeply concerned        about  and who have felt compelled to oppose this nomination has been long        and it continues to lengthen  More than 175 environmental  Native        American  labor  civil rights  disability rights  womens rights and other        organizations have signed a letter opposing Mr  Myers confirmation to the        Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals  The National Congress of American Indians         a coalition of more than 250 tribal governments  unanimously approved a        resolution opposing Mr  Myers nomination  The National Wildlife        Federation  which has never opposed a judicial nomination by any president        in its 68 year history  wrote   Mr         Myers has so firmly established a public record of open hostility to        environmental protections as to undermine any contention that he could        bring an impartial perspective to the issues of wildlife and natural        resource conservation that come before the court  Indeed  Mr  Myers is        distinguished precisely by the ideological rigidity that marks his        positions on these issues    A letter from the California Legislature         signed by the Senate President Pro Tem  the Chair of the Senate Natural        Resources Committee  and the Chair of the Senate Environmental Quality        Committee  strongly opposing Mr  Myers nomination  told the Judiciary        Committee   Mr         Myers record as Interior Solicitor of favoring the interests of the        grazing and mining industries over the rights of Native Americans and the        environment  coupled with his long history as an extreme advocate for those        industries  cause serious doubts on his willingness or ability to put aside        his personal views in performing his official duties   I have great regard for the Senators from       Idaho  I have affection for the former Senator from Wyoming        who served on the Judiciary Committee for many years and who I consider a        friend  In deference to them  I have examined Mr  Myers record and asked        myself whether I could support this nomination  I cannot  I must oppose        Mr  Myers confirmation
