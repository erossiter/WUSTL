            Defense Appropriations Bill      Includes  1 3 Billion Leahy Bond Amendment      To Replenish National Guard Equipment Stocks   The Senate       Friday passed the annual Defense Appropriations Bill that       includes the  1 3 billion National Guard replenishment amendment       sponsored by Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Kit Bond  R Mo          co chairs of the Senate National Guard Caucus  The amendment        approved Sept  29 by the Senate and added to the bill  provides       funding to help fill deficiencies in available equipment for the       National Guard  Leahy and Bond wrote to President Bush on       September 13  asking him to request the funding in an upcoming       supplemental bill for the Gulf hurricanes  Leahy s statement on       the amendment  which he delivered late Sept  29 on the Senate       Floor  follows  along with news articles and other background       materials     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      National Guard Homeland Security      And Emergency Response Equipment Amendment      To The Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill      Senate Floor      September 29  2005  Mr  President  I rise today to       introduce an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense       Appropriations bill  This amendment adds  1 3 billion in       emergency funding for National Guard equipment to the       supplemental portion of the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense       Appropriations Bill  This funding will be set aside to enable       the National Guard to buy much needed items for homeland       security and natural disaster response    Hurricane Katrina exposed glaring       deficiencies in the equipment available for the National Guard       to respond to such disasters  We had barely sufficient levels       of trucks  tractors  communications  and miscellaneous equipment       to respond to the overwhelming scale of this storm  If we have       another hurricane  or God forbid  a large scale terrorist       attack  our National Guard will not have the basic level of       resources to the job right   National Guard Chief Lieutenant       General Steven Blum recently noted that the Guard has only about       35 percent of what is officially required to respond to       hurricane  natural disasters  and possible terrorist attacks at       home  Just yesterday  at an appearance in the House of       Representatives  General Blum noted that Guard members responded       to this disaster with insufficient and outdated communications        General Blum noted that we will need at least  7 billion to       procure the communications  trucks  medical supplies  and       machinery necessary to respond to future disasters   We know without a doubt that there       is an immediate need for at least  1 3 billion  We need to       procure such equipment as the Family of Medium Tractor Vehicles        new SINCGARS radios  night vision goggles  and other equipment        I ask that a recent report from the National Guard on these       critical needs be included in the Record    We find ourselves in this       situation for two reasons  First  we have traditionally       under funded the National Guards equipment levels  Secondly        much of the equipment that the Guard does have is being used in       the ongoing war efforts in Iraq  Afghanistan  and across the       Middle East and Central Asia  And there is no prospect that we       will see it again back in the States anytime soon   My friend Sen  Bond and I co chair       the U S  Senate National Guard Caucus  On September 13  we       wrote to President Bush to urge that the Administration deal       with this problem immediately  We asked that the President       include the  1 3 billion in the next supplemental spending bill       to deal with Hurricane Katrina    Yet we cannot wait for the       President to request the funding  We must act now  The date       that this next supplemental spending bill will be submitted is       still uncertain  With this defense bill  we have an       appropriations bill with billions of dollars in emergency       funding  Much of that emergency funding will go towards       insuring that our men and women in uniform abroad have the right       tools to do their job   It seems perfectly reasonable to       me that we add emergency funding to deal with the equipment       needs of our troops at home    I want to commend Senators Stevens       and Inouye for including so much equipment money for the Guard       in the supplemental and baseline bills  While most of that new       equipment will go towards the Guards overseas warfighting       needs  this funding take a big step forward  I look forward to       working with them closely in the future  For additional
