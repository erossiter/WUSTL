       Opening Floor Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Bankruptcy Abuse   Prevention And Consumer Protection Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Opening Floor Statement Of             Senator Patrick Leahy            On The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention And Consumer Protection Act Of 2005  S  256            February 28  2005  Today in the Senate we begin debate on             the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005              S  256   This is the first time in four years that the Senate has             debated bankruptcy reform legislation  I look forward to what I hope             will be a fair  informed and beneficial debate that improves this             bipartisan bill and helps us enact bankruptcy reform legislation into             law    Bankruptcy is a complex area of the law             with many competing public policy interests between debtors and             creditors and among competing creditors  The complex and competing             interests involved in achieving fair reforms of our bankruptcy system             demand that we work in a bipartisan manner throughout the legislative             process    Our nation wears a different face today             than it did the last time we considered bankruptcy reform  We have             endured the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001              immersed ourselves in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  witnessed a parade             of financial misdeeds by major U S  corporations  and watched as             pension promises were shortchanged by nearly  100 billion  All of             these factors have only deepened the financial woes of an already             struggling economy   We must discuss bankruptcy reform in the             context of these real life developments since 2001  In order for this             legislation to be appropriate and fair  the key provisions must be             carefully examined and  if necessary  modernized and amended   Earlier this month  the Judiciary             Committee held a bipartisan hearing on bankruptcy reform legislation             that was our first hearing on this complex issue in four years  It             proved to be an informed discussion that served to highlight some of             the critical issues that we face as the Senate works to pass a             balanced bankruptcy reform measure   A week later  the Judiciary Committee             held its first markup on bankruptcy legislation in four years  During             that meeting we considered 11 amendments  five of which were accepted             by unanimous consent to improve the bill  I am particularly pleased             that the Committee accepted the Leahy Grassley amendment which             clarifies that any judgment  order or settlement agreement for a             violation of securities fraud law after the filing of a bankruptcy             case is non dischargeable   During consideration of the             Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002  Senator Grassley and I worked together to             amend the Bankruptcy Code to make judgments and settlements based on             securities law violation non dischargeable  protecting victims             ability to recoup their losses and holding wrongdoers accountable for             their actions  This change in the law was based on a Judiciary             Committee amendment that Senator Grassley and I introduced to my             corporate fraud legislation  S  2010  the Corporate and Criminal Fraud             Accountability Act  which was unanimously reported by the Judiciary             Committee and latter adopted as a floor amendment by a vote of 99 0 in             2002    Recently  a bankruptcy court wrongly             interpreted the new law by finding that a securities fraud judgment              order or settlement must be in existence at the time the bankruptcy             petition is filed to be non dischargeable    This precedent could result in future             courts discharging securities fraud judgments  orders or settlements             that are entered into after a debtor files for bankruptcy  For             example  an Enron executive could avoid paying his securities fraud             judgment by filing for bankruptcy while the securities fraud             litigation is pending  That would be wrong    The Leahy Grassley amendment accepted             during Committee consideration of the bill would remedy that injustice             by making it clear that Congress intended for all securities fraud             judgments  orders or settlements to be non dischargeable               One area that we must consider is the             economic hardships faced by service members families  Calls to serve             their country in Iraq  Afghanistan or elsewhere can             cause loss of family income  the closing of a family business or             unexpected expenses  Unfortunately  it is not uncommon for service             members and their families to be forced into filing for bankruptcy             relief  We need to protect those who are fighting for us  I know             that Senator Durbin and Senator Nelson have taken an interest in this             issue and I look forward to hearing their thoughts on how we can             remedy the situation faced by service members who serve our nation and             their families   In recent years  we have been witness to             a parade of financial misdeeds by major U S              corporations  The names Enron  WorldCom  among others  have left a             bitter taste in the mouths of average Americans  damaging investor             confidence and shaking our capital markets  Senators Sarbanes              Kennedy  Durbin  Harkin and Cantwell have all prepared amendments to             address the ongoing problems caused by corporate abuses   We must strengthen the financial safety             nets for hard working American families confronting illness or             injury  Medical problems contribute to about half of all             bankruptcies  even though most of those who file had health insurance             when they first became sick  Many lose their jobs  and their             insurance  because they got sick  while others face thousands of             dollars in co payments and deductibles and for services not covered by             their insurance  Senators Kennedy  Durbin  Clinton and Corzine will             be leading our debate on this issue   Since we last considered bankruptcy             reform legislation  financially troubled companies have shortchanged             their pension promises by nearly  100 billion  putting workers              responsible companies and taxpayers at risk  I look forward to             hearing from Senators Harkin  Rockefeller and Dayton             during debate over this issue  I know that Senators Grassley  Durbin              Dodd  Feinstein and others share a commitment to include credit             industry reforms in a balanced bankruptcy bill  The millions of             credit card solicitations made to American consumers in the past years             have contributed to the rise in consumer debt and bankruptcies  It is             relatively easy to obtain credit  but not nearly enough is done to             ensure that credit is properly managed  Currently  credit card             statements fail to include all of the information necessary to allow             individuals to make fully informed financial decisions  Additional             disclosure is needed to ensure that individuals completely understand             the implications of their credit card use   Senator Akaka intends to offer the             Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act  which I am proud to be an             original cosponsor  This will provide a wake up call for consumers by             making it very clear what costs they will incur if they make only the             minimum payments on their credit cards  The personalized information             they will receive for each of their accounts will help consumers make             informed choices about their debts   Senator Feingold  a longtime protector             of working middle  and lower income families who rely on the ability             to resolve overwhelming financial burdens through bankruptcy  will be             offering several amendments to improve this bill  Senator Feingold             and I have worked together on bankruptcy reform issues for a long time             and I know his expertise and the measures he means to propose will             enhance this legislation   We must also be careful that our efforts             to ensure accountability in the bankruptcy process do not             inadvertently create problems for privacy and security  We are in an             age where personal information can be easily digitized and shared  and             when it falls into the wrong hands  easily abused  Identity theft is             one danger  as is tracking and harassing a battered spouse  We should             consider ways to minimize these possibilities while we seek             accountability   Four years ago  the Committee adopted a             Leahy Hatch amendment to protect the personal privacy of consumers             whose information is held by firms in bankruptcy as part             of bankruptcy reform legislation  I am pleased that S  256 retains             this pro privacy provision    Our bipartisan provision permits             bankruptcy courts to honor the privacy policies of business debtors             and creates a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect personal privacy             in bankruptcy proceedings  I appreciate the Senator Hatch s             efforts to add important consumer privacy protections to the             Bankruptcy Code    Unfortunately  the Leahy Hatch amendment             is needed because the customer lists and databases of failed firms now             can be put up for sale in bankruptcy without any privacy             considerations  B and             even in violation of the failed firm s             own public privacy policy against sale of personal customer             information to third parties  That is wrong    Toysmart com  for example  a failed             online toy store  filed for bankruptcy in 2000 and its databases and             customer lists were put up for sale as part of the bankruptcy             proceeding  This personal customer information was put on the auction             block even though Toysmart com promised on its web site that   Apersonal             information voluntarily submitted by visitors to our site  such as             name  address  billing information and shopping preferences  is never             shared with a third party    The Leahy Hatch provision included in             this legislation adds privacy protections and a Consumer Privacy             Ombudsman to the Bankruptcy Code to prevent future cases like             Toysmart com    The ChoicePoint Inc  breach is just the             latest example of why we need to take special care with databases             containing Americans personal information  It is             astounding that a company in the business of providing data for             background checks and law enforcement purposes failed to assess the             legitimacy of its own customers  selling personal data on 145 000             individuals to scam artists  Even worse  many of those victims had no             idea ChoicePoint existed  let alone that the company compiled data on             them    It is becoming an all too familiar story             of compromises  In recent years  headlines have recounted that             personal information has been compromised in database             breaches at government contractors  banks  universities  and even a             blood bank  This all puts Americans most private information at risk             not only for financial crimes or stalking  but creates a potential             avenue for terrorists to masquerade as an innocent person    I have called for a series of hearings             on how we ensure data security  privacy and proper use in the  information age  I am pleased that Chairman Specter has agreed             to my request for hearings  and I look forward to these opportunities             to consider these issues closely   We need to take reasonable measures in             the bankruptcy process to guide what information will be             available publicly and to whom  Debtors are often required to submit             documents containing highly personal information  Declaring             bankruptcy is challenging enough for those find themselves in that             circumstance  we shouldnt make it worse by creating the possibility             that they will be victimized later on  I am submitting an amendment             to provide protections in handling personal data in those             submissions  These changes reflect current Judicial Conference policy             and were included in last terms Hatch Leahy Federal Courts             Improvement Act    First  my amendment expands the courts             discretion to protect information such as Social             Security numbers and passport numbers  The bankruptcy courts are in a             unique position to properly balance the need to share information with             the need to protect privacy  and we should rely on their good judgment             and discretion as much as possible  The amendment draws from the             current civil procedure discovery rules to set a standard against             which the court can apply its discretion  The amendment also allows             individuals to request that the court protect sensitive information             before it is placed in the public record  This protection is             particularly important given our increasing reliance on electronic             filing  where information is immediately available to the public               Second  my amendment provides important             protection for Social Security numbers  Originally promised to be             narrow in purpose and use  Social Security numbers are now the             universal identifier with the key to unlock access to bank accounts             and other highly sensitive areas  We must treat these numbers             commensurate with their power  and ensure that they are only accessed             in appropriate situations by authorized users  My amendment would             allow debtors to limit disclosure to only the last four digits of his             or her Social Security number in the notices that are filed with the             court  The amendment still protects creditors where necessary  and             specifies that creditors who are on the schedule of assets and             liabilities should receive the full tax payer identification number in             the notices sent specifically to the creditor    This idea of truncation isnt new  Just             last year  we passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of             2003  and that Act required truncation of credit card and debit card             numbers on receipts given to cardholders  Requiring truncation of             Social Security numbers is similarly reasonable  It provides             protection against abuse  but still allows for important  information sharing to take place   These are just some of the reforms that             should be included in this bill  I hope that all Senators will give             fair and thoughtful consideration to amendments proposed on either             side of the aisle  When the Senate works productively and             constructively  we can improve legislation on a bipartisan basis  I             have worked with Senator Grassley and others to make bipartisan             improvements in the past and I hope that we can do that again on this             bankruptcy reform legislation   In particular  I urge my colleagues give             full consideration to an amendment Senator Schumer will offer to make             sure debts incurred through violence and other illegal acts at health             clinics may not be discharged in bankruptcy  Senator Schumer has been             the leader on ending this bankruptcy abuse and I have always been             proud to support his efforts  Any fair bankruptcy reform measure             should end abusive bankruptcy filings used to avoid the legal             consequences of violence  vandalism and obstruction to deny access to             legal health services   As we move forward with reforms that are             appropriate to eliminate abuses in the system  we need to remember the             people who use the system  both the debtor and the creditor  We need             to balance the interests of creditors with those of the poor and             middle class who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming             financial burdens   These are important subjects that have a             real impact on the lives of many people who have already suffered from             illnesses or divorce or job loss  We should utilize the expertise of             our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Senate             passes balanced legislation   I look forward to continuing to work             with Senator Grassley  Senator Specter and the rest of my colleagues             to make more bipartisan improvements on the Senate floor to enact             balanced bankruptcy reform legislation into law
