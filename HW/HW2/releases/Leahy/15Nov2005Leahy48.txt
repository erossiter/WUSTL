       Senate Okays Leahy Bills Targeting Counterfeit Goods                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Senate Okays Leahy Bills Targeting      Counterfeit Goods      Bill Takes Aim At Costly Crime     Of Pirating That Plagues Many Vermont Companies  WASHINGTON       Wednesday  Nov  16   Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   led efforts in the      Senate to win passage of two key bipartisan anti counterfeiting      bills targeting the pernicious and costly problems of piracy and      illegal trafficking of goods and servicesthat plague several      Vermont companies   Leahy  the      ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  teamed up with      leading Republican senators on the measures Sen  Arlen Specter       R Pa    the panels chairman  is the principal cosponsor of the      Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act  while Sen  John      Cornyn  R Texas   a member of the committee  joined Leahy in      sponsoring the Protecting American Goods and Services Act   The Senate      passed both bills by unanimous consent on Nov  10  sending them to      the House for consideration  Piracy has had a      particularly negative effect on a number of Vermont businesses who      have worked with Leahy on combating the crime  including Burton      Snowboards  Vermont Tubbs of Rutland  SB Electronics of Barre  and      Hubbardton Forge of Castleton  A representative form Burton      Snowboards testified before the Committee last year on the issue       A longtime      leader in Congress on anti piracy issues and the ranking member on      the Intellectual Property Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee       Leahy stressed the importance of the bills  Product counterfeiting      hurts our workers and our consumers and our economy  These are      useful tools to help beat back this threat  Leahy noted that      more than  200 billion in tax revenue is lost annually to      counterfeiting and piracy operations  and estimates show that more      than 5 percent of trade worldwide is illegally conducted in the      trafficking of counterfeited goods  In addition to its damage to      the economy  counterfeiting has been linked to organized crime       including terrorist organizations   Below are      Leahys statements on passage of the bills                    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Senate Passage Of S  1699       The Stop Counterfeiting In Manufactured Goods Act     November 10  2005 MR  LEAHY  Counterfeiting threatens the      American economy  our workers  and our consumers  I am pleased that      the Senate has today taken an important step towards beating back      that threat  by passing S  1699  the Stop Counterfeiting in      Manufactured Goods Act  Senator Specter is the principal      co sponsor  and I know that he shares with me the conviction that      this bill that will give law enforcement improved tools to fight      counterfeit trademarks  and that it could work a significant change      in the efforts to combat this type of theft  So are all our      co sponsors  and I thank them  Senators Alexander  Bayh  Brownback       Coburn  Cornyn  DeWine  Durbin  Feingold  Feinstein  Hatch  Kyl       Levin  Reed  Stabenow  and Voinovich  It is all too easy to think of counterfeiting      as a victimless crime  a means of buying sunglasses or a purse that      would otherwise strain a monthly budget  The reality  however  is      far different  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation       counterfeiting costs the U S  between  200 billion and  250 billion      annually  In Vermont  companies like Burton Snowboards  Vermont      Tubbs  SB Electronics  and Hubbardton Forge  all of which have      cultivated their good names through pure hard work and creativity       have felt keenly the damage of intellectual property theft on their      businesses  This is wrong  It is simply not fair to the businesses      who innovate and to the people whose economic livelihoods depend on      these companies   The threat posed by counterfeiting is more than      a matter of economics  Inferior products can threaten the safety of      those who use them  When a driver taps a cars brake pedals there      should be no uncertainty about whether the brake linings are made of      compressed grass  sawdust  or cardboard  Sick patients should not      have to that they will ingest counterfeit prescription drugs and  at      best  have no effect  The World Health Organization estimates that      the market for counterfeit drugs is about  32 billion each year       Knock off parts have even been found in NATO helicopters  Whats      more  according to Interpol  there is an identifiable link between      counterfeit goods and the financing of terrorist operations   S  1699 makes several improvements to the U S       Code  The bill strengthens 18 U S C  2318  the part of the criminal      code that deals with counterfeit goods and services  to make it a      crime to traffic in counterfeit labels or packaging  even when      counterfeit labels or packaging are shipped separately from the      goods to which they will ultimately be attached  Savvy      counterfeiters have exploited this loophole to escape liability       This bill closes that loophole   The bill will also make counterfeit labels and      goods  and any equipment used in facilitating a crime under this      part of the code  subject to forfeiture upon conviction  Any      forfeited goods or machinery would then be destroyed  and the      convicted infringer would have to pay restitution to the lawful      owner of the trademark  Finally  although the bill is tough  it is      also fair  It states that nothing shall entitle the United States      to bring a cause of action under this section for the repackaging of      genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or      confuse  It is truly just the bad actors we want to punish   Those who profit from anothers innovation have      proved their creativity only at escaping responsibility for their      actions  As legislators it is important that we provide law      enforcement with the tools needed to capture these thieves  I am      committed to this effort  and will continue to sponsor legislation      that will support law enforcement in the protection of the      intellectual property rights that are so important to the American      economy and its creative culture                   Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Senate Passage Of S  1095       The Protecting American Goods and Services Act Of 2005      November 10  2005 MR  LEAHY  Today  I am pleased that the Senate      has passed S  1095  the Protecting American Goods and Services Act      of 2005  which is the latest of the bipartisan efforts that Senator      Cornyn and I have made to improve the lives of Americans through      effective and efficient government  The Protecting American Goods      and Services Act of 2005 will strengthen our ability to combat the      escalating problem of counterfeiting worldwide  In order to      effectively fight intellectual property theft  we need stiff      penalties for counterfeiters and those who are caught with      counterfeit goods with the intent to traffic their false wares       Ours is a short bill  indeed  it is only two pages long  but it      will have powerful global implications in the fight against piracy  Counterfeiting is a growing problem that costs      our economy hundreds of billions of dollars every year and has been      linked to organized crime  including terrorist organizations       According to the International Anti Counterfeiting Coalition       counterfeit parts have been discovered in helicopters sold to NATO       in jet engines  bridge joints  brake pads  and fasteners in      equipment designed to prevent nuclear reactor meltdowns  The World      Health Organization estimates that the market for counterfeit drugs      is about  32 billion each year   Several years ago  Senator Hatch joined me in      sponsoring the Anti counterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of      1996  which addressed counterfeiting by amending several sections      of our criminal and tariff codes  That law made important changes       particularly by expanding RICO  the federal anti racketeering law       to cover crimes involving counterfeiting and copyright and trademark      infringement  Then  as now  trafficking in counterfeit goods hurts      purchasers  state and federal governments  and economies at every      level   Perhaps most disturbingly  the U S  Customs      Service reports that terrorists have used transnational      counterfeiting operations to fund their activities  The sale of      counterfeit and pirated music  movies  software  T shirts  clothing       and fake drugs accounts for much of the money the international      terrorist network depends on to feed its operations   Last year  as in years past  I worked with      Senator Allen on an amendment to the Foreign Operations bill that      provides the State Department with vital resources to combat piracy      of U S  goods abroad  The bill we ultimately passed included  3      million for this important purpose  Yet more work both at home and      abroad remains  When you consider that the economic impact of      tangible piracy in counterfeit goods is estimated to be roughly  350      billion a year and to constitute between 5 percent and 7 percent of      worldwide trade  a few million dollars is a worthwhile investment       We have certainly seen how this form of theft      touches the lives of hard working Vermonters  Burton Snowboards is      a small company  whose innovation has made it an industry leader in      snowboarding equipment and apparel  Unfortunately  knock off      products carrying Burtons name have been found across the globe       Vanessa Price  a representative of Burton  testified about      counterfeiting at the Judiciary Committees March 23  2004  hearing      on this topic  In addition to learning about the economic costs of      counterfeiting  I asked her after the hearing about the risks posed      to consumers by these goods  Her answer was chilling  In the weeks      since my Senate testimony  I discovered a shipment of counterfeit      Burton boots for sale through a discount sports outfit After      examining the poor quality of the counterfeit boots  we determined      that anyone using the boots for snowboarding risks injury due to a      lack of reinforcement and support in the products construction   Customers and businesses lose out to      counterfeiters in other ways  too  SB Electronics in Barre  Vt  has      seen its capacitors reverse engineered and its customers lost to      inferior copycat models  Vermont Tubbs  a furniture manufacturer in      Rutland  has seen its designs copied  produced offshore with      inferior craftsmanship and materials  and then reimported  so that      the company is competing against cheaper versions of its own      products  And Hubbardton Forge in Castleton  Vt  has seen its      beautiful and original lamps counterfeited and then sold within the      United States at prices  and quality  far below their own  This      is wrong  It is unfair to consumers who deserve the high quality      goods they think they are paying for  and it is unfair to innovators      who play by the rules and deserve to profit from their labor   The Protecting American Goods and Services Act      of 2005 will help to combat this growing scourge  It amends the      definition of trafficking in the counterfeit law to criminalize      the possession of counterfeit goods with the intent to sell or      traffic in those goods  as well as to include any distribution of      counterfeits with the expectation of gaining something of value       criminals should not be able to skirt the law simply because they      barter illegal goods and services in exchange for their illicit      wares  Finally  the bills new definition will criminalize the      importation and exportation of counterfeit goods  as well as of      bootleg copies of copyrighted works into and out of the United      States   By tying off these loopholes and improving U S       laws on counterfeiting  we will be sending a powerful message to the      criminals who belong in jail  and to our innovators
