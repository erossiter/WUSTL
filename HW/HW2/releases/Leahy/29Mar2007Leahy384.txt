Statement Of     Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On    Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is The Department Of Justice     Politicizing The Hiring and Firing Of U S  Attorneys    Part III    March 29  2007    Today the Committee     proceeds with another hearing into the mass replacements of U S      attorneys  This morning we will hear testimony from D  Kyle Sampson      the former chief of staff to Attorney General Gonzales  He is     represented by another attorney who served in the White House Counsels     office for this White House  Bradford Berenson  We thank Mr  Sampson     for appearing voluntarily and testifying   I hope that this     hearing will provide us with an opportunity to learn additional facts     and help us get beyond the shifting stories to the truth  Our goal is     to get to the bottom of what happened  why it happened  and who was     involved in devising and implementing this plan to replace so many     United States attorneys across the country   At his press     conference two weeks ago    and again this week in an interview        Attorney General Gonzales seemed to heap much of the responsibility for     this matter on Mr  Sampson  The mistakes the Attorney General admits     were made seem  according to him  to have been made mostly by Mr      Sampson  He was one of the people in charge of assembling the list of     U S  attorneys to be fired  The Attorney General indicated he was also     one of the people who concealed information from others at the     Department of Justice so that there was  in the words of the Attorney     General  consequently information shared with the Congress that was     incomplete   This hearing gives     Mr  Sampson a chance to answer these charges by the Attorney General and     present the facts as he knows them  We ask only that Mr  Sampson share     with us the truth and the whole truth with regard to these matters   I want the American people to have a     Justice Department and United States Attorneys offices that enforce the     law without regard to political influence and partisanship  I want the     American people to have confidence in federal law enforcement and I want     our federal law enforcement officers to have the independence they need     to be effective and to consistently merit the trust of the American     people  Regrettably  what we have heard from the Administration has     been a series of shifting explanations and excuses and a lack of     accountability or acknowledgement of the seriousness of this matter      This investigation     stems from this Committees responsibilities to the American people  The     Judiciary Committee has the authority to conduct oversight and     investigations related to the Department of Justice and U S  attorneys     offices  We have the authority to examine whether inaccurate or     incomplete testimony was provided to this Committee  to consider     legislation within our jurisdiction  and to protect our role in     evaluating nominations pursuant to the Senates constitutional     responsibility to provide advice and consent  Indeed  it was in light     of this jurisdiction    the confirmation power vested in the Senate  and     the jurisdiction of this Committee over the review of U S  attorney     nominations    that our Ranking Member observed early on that we have     primary responsibility to investigate this matter  The answers to our     questions at the January 18 hearing with the Attorney General and the     February 6 hearing with the Deputy Attorney General  as well as a series     of statements by White House spokespeople and other Justice Department     officials in private briefings  have been contradicted by the testimony     of the former United States Attorneys  They have been contradicted also     by the limited e mails and other documents we have obtained from the     Department of Justice  Despite the initial denials of White House     involvement  it is now apparent that White House officials were involved     in the planning and replacement of U S  attorneys and the subsequent     misleading explanations from Justice Department officials       U S  attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President  But justice does     not serve at the pleasure of this or any White House  Our law enforcement     and justice system is the envy of the world  It is one of our countrys     greatest strengths  It is built on a foundation of checks and balances     and the peoples faith in the rule of law without fear or favor  That     foundation can be easily eroded  and we need to be vigilant in     protecting it   The dismissed U S      attorneys have testified under oath and said in public that they believe     political influence was applied  They have given chapter and verse and     specific examples  If they are right  that mixing of partisan political     goals into federal law enforcement is highly improper  It corrodes the     publics trust in our system of justice  It is wrong  That is what we     are seeking to determine through our investigation of the facts  We     need a thorough and fair investigation into what happened and why and     who was involved
