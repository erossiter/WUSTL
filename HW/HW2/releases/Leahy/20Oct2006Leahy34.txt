ranking Democratic member of the     Committee  and Kennedy      a senior member of the panel  sent the letter following news reports     that registered voters in Orange County  California      were being warned they could be jailed or deported if they voted in     November  The California Attorney Generals office is also     investigating the matter    Longtime civil rights champions in Congress      Leahy and Kennedy led efforts in the 109th  Congress to     reauthorize key provisions of the Voting Rights Act   Below is the text of the letter  followed by     relevant news articles  A pdf version of the letter is available upon     request                  October 20  2006  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales    Attorney General    United States Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   We are deeply concerned by recent news reports     describing the use of voter suppression techniques targeting Latino     citizens in southern California in the mid term elections  We enclose     some of those accounts  Registered voters in Orange County  California      apparently are being warned in letters that they could be jailed or     deported if they vote in the November election  Although in press     reports Republican candidate Tan Nguyen acknowledges that an employee in     his campaign was involved in sending out the controversial letter  he     claims to have no personal knowledge of the letter  According to a     Los Angeles Times article of October 19  2006  however  Orange     County Republican Chairman Scott Baugh states that representatives of     the Huntington Beach mail house that produced the letter told him that     Nguyen was directly involved with the letter  calling and asking that it     be sent out as soon as possible  The California Attorney General has     launched an investigation into this matter  We ask that you send us and     the Senate Judiciary Committee a written response detailing the     immediate actions being taken by the Department to investigate this     matter  prosecute those responsible  and notify naturalized citizens in     Orange County of their right to vote    Our specific concern is that a letter  written     in Spanish and sent to an unknown number of Latinos in Orange County      was distributed with the clear purpose of keeping voters from the polls     on the basis of their race or ethnicity  According to press reports  the letter states that if       you are an emigrant  voting in a     federal election is a crime that can result in incarceration  and     possible deportation         The letter also states that the U S      government is installing a new computerized system to verify names of     all newly registered voters who participate in the elections in October     and November  Organizations against emigration will be able to request     information from this new computerized system    During the recent reauthorization of the     Voting Rights Act  the 109th Congress acknowledged that our     nation has a long and unfortunate history of imposing barriers to voting     rights  particularly with regard to racial  ethnic  language  and other     minorities  Although many of the most blatant vote suppression tactics     of the Jim Crow era have ended  our Committee received an abundance of     evidence during the Voting Rights Act hearings documenting that more     subtle and sophisticated vote suppression tactics persist  By     reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  the Congress reaffirmed our     nations commitment to eliminating all vestiges of voter intimidation      oppression  and suppression  whether overt or subtle    This matter demonstrates the urgent need for     vigorous enforcement of our nations civil rights laws  As you know  we     have previously expressed concerns regarding the current priorities of     the Civil Rights Division and whether those priorities are aligned with     recent trends away from vigorous civil rights enforcement  We remain     concerned about a reported a sharp decline in the number of traditional     civil rights cases filed by the Division under this Administration      particularly in the area of voting rights    Because our nation is less than three weeks     away from an important election  the Justice Department must conduct a     thorough  complete  and speedy investigation into this matter  We     request that you provide us with your report on or before October 27      2006   Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY    Ranking Member    United States Senator   EDWARD KENNEDY    United States Senator   cc  Chairman Arlen Specter     Rep  Loretta Sanchez                  Los Angeles Times  GOP Worker Fired for Role in Latino Voter     Intimidation  By Mai Tran  Jennifer Delson and Christian     Berthelsen    Times Staff Writers     1 34 PM PDT  October 19  2006  Republican     congressional candidate Tan Nguyen acknowledged today that an employee     in his campaign was involved in sending out a letter intended to     suppress Latino voter turnout in Orange County in next month s election      but said he had no knowledge of it and that the employee has been fired      The disclosure came one day after the state attorney general s office     began focusing on Nguyen s campaign as the source of the letter  At the     same time  Republican officials today distanced themselves from Nguyen      with several calling for him to bow out of his underdog campaign to     unseat Democratic Rep  Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove      Nguyen has hired a lawyer and said that he expected to meet with     investigators from the state attorney general s office today      Addressing questions about the letter for the first time  Nguyen said     his office manager took it upon herself to allow our database to be     used to send out the letter      It was disseminated without my authorization or approval  he said      The office manager  whose name was not released  had been working for     Nguyen since the campaign office was opened  Nguyen said she had access     to the database of Democratic voters that he purchased to send out     mailers to 73 000 households  He said he did not know who wrote the     letter  which was in Spanish      People are pointing fingers  saying that I did it and that s going to     get cleared  Nguyen said  I want to get the truth out so people can     vote for candidates for the right reasons      In an interview today  Orange County GOP Chairman Scott Baugh said     representatives of the Huntington Beach mail house that produced the     letter told him that Nguyen was directly involved with the letter      calling and asking that it be sent out as soon as possible      Today  a host of Republicans called on Nguyen to drop out of the race      Baugh  who called the letter reprehensible and stupid  said the     party s executive committee voted unanimously to ask Nguyen to withdraw     from the race      Gov  Arnold Schwarzenegger has called the letter a despicable act of     political intimidation and a hate crime      Nguyen said he will not withdraw      We re winning and we re going to win  he said      Also today  the owner of the mail house  Mailing Pros  acknowledged that     his firm sent out the mailers and that he spoke with investigators from     the attorney general s office      He declined to discuss details of his talk with the agents but said     Nguyen was not the person he dealt with  He would not identify the     person      The only thing I can say is that the client involved in this is a     one shot customer  Christopher West said  I haven t seen the person     before  and I guess it s unlikely I will see them again      Nguyen has made halting illegal immigration part of his campaign against     Sanchez  who is Orange County s only Democratic member of Congress      In a fast moving examination that began just days after the letters were     mailed  sources said investigators estimated that the letter was mailed     to 14 000 Democratic voters in central Orange County      The letter  which purports to be from a Huntington Beach based group      warns that immigrants will not be permitted to vote in the election  It     also warns that the state has developed a tracking system that will     allow the names of Latino voters to be handed over to anti immigrant     groups      You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or     you are an immigrant  voting in a federal election is a crime that could     result in jail time  the letter  written in Spanish  says      The information in the letter is false  Immigrants who become     naturalized citizens  such as Schwarzenegger  can vote  An illegal     immigrant who voted could be subject to deportation and jail  The     letter s assertion that the state had developed a computer system that     would make it easy to track down immigrants and illegal residents is     also false      Until now  the campaign for the 47th Congressional District had     generated little notice  Though it has historically been a competitive     seat  Sanchez is expected to cruise to reelection  Democrats hold a     5 percentage point voter registration advantage  despite a large number     of decline to state voters  Latinos make up 35  of registered voters in     the district  Asians make up 18       Nguyen is not popular with the Republican Party down there  said Allan     Hoffenblum  a longtime Republican consultant and publisher of the     California Target Book  an insiders guide to handicapping political     races  Nobody seems to be paying any attention to it      The district partly overlaps with the 34th state Senate District  where     Supervisor Lou Correa  a Democrat  is locked in a tough election battle     with former Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher  a Republican      The stationary the controversial letter was written on resembles that of     the California Coalition for Immigration Reform  a group that advocates     tightening the border  The group s founder  Barbara Coe  said she did     not know the Sergio Ramirez who supposedly signed the letter      She said she did not authorize it and was unaware of anyone in her group     who might have  Coe said two investigators from the attorney general s     office questioned her Wednesday      Investigators asked if I knew Loretta Sanchez  Coe said  I said I     know of her  I told them it s been a tried and failed relationship  San Francisco     Chronicle Intimidating voting     letter to SoCal Hispanics investigated    By PETER PRENGAMAN  Associated Press     Writer    Tuesday  October 17  2006  They ve     been naturalized U S  citizens for nearly 20 years  but Benny Diaz says     he and his wife felt intimidated when they each received a letter over     the weekend warning that some immigrants could be jailed or deported for     voting next month  The     letter  written in Spanish and sent to an unknown number of Hispanics in     Orange County  also says the government has developed a computer system     to track down the names of immigrant voters  A lot     of Latino families have called me to say they ripped up the letter     because they felt so insulted  said Diaz  49  who is originally from     Peru  His wife  Nellie  is from Mexico  Diaz is     running for a seat on the Garden Grove City Council  and he believes the     letter could scare many new citizens away from the polls  We     spend a lot of money to communicate with Latino voters  but do you think     they are going to come out now  he asked  It s     unclear who sent the letter  Meanwhile  authorities say they are     investigating  adding those responsible could be charged with a felony  Why     send something like this  said state Sen  Gloria Romero  D Los Angeles      The intention is clearly to shed fear and intimidation  and ultimately     suppress a vote that is critical in the elections  In a     letter Tuesday to state Attorney General Bill Lockyer  Gov  Arnold     Schwarzenegger called the letters racist and despicable  and argued     the perpetrators should be tried for a hate crime  Lockyer     spokesman Nathan Barankin said the letter was something we are     investigating aggressively right now  The     sender could face as much as three years in state prison  he said  Ana     Maria Patino  a lawyer representing the Diaz family  said families in     Santa Ana and Anaheim had also received letters  She said they were     being collected and handed over to authorities  The     FBI s criminal division in Los Angeles obtained a copy of the letter     Tuesday and was reviewing it  said Special Agent Kenneth Smith  a bureau     spokesman  The     note s letterhead resembles that of the California Coalition for     Immigration Reform  an anti illegal immigration group based in     Huntington Beach  and contains the signature Sergio Ramirez  The     group s founder  Barbara Coe  told the Los Angeles Times she did not     know anyone named Sergio Ramirez  adding she did not authorize the     letter and was unaware of anyone in her group who did  Over the last     several days  Coe said  she has taken dozens of calls from Orange County     Hispanics who received a letter  It puts     a shadow on our credibility  that we would target certain people who     might be citizens of our country  she said  She did     not immediately return calls Tuesday from The Associated Press  Coe s     group was investigated by the FBI in the late 1990s because members held     signs near polls stating only citizens can vote  The     letter is correct in saying only immigrants who are naturalized U S      citizens can vote  but many of its other contentions are false  It also     contains several grammatical errors and reads like a literal translation     from English to Spanish  suggesting it was not written by a native     Spanish speaker  Be     advised that the government of the United States is installing a new     computer system to verify the names of all registered voters         Anti immigration organization can ask for information from this new     computer system  the letter states  John     Trasvina  interim president and general counsel for the Mexican American     Legal Defense and Education Fund  suggested the letter might have a     backlash effect  A lot     of people will get angered by this and say   No you can t take away my     right to vote   said Trasvina  New York Times October 18  2006  California Letter Investigated for Warning     to Immigrants  By JESSE McKINLEY SAN     FRANCISCO  Oct  17  Federal and state authorities are trying to     determine who sent a letter to some Latinos in Southern California that     falsely suggested that it would be a crime for immigrants to vote in the     coming election  The     letter  written in formal  sometimes clumsy Spanish and signed Sergio     Ramirez  was mailed last week to an undetermined number of people with     Spanish surnames in Orange County  the authorities said  It advised     recipients that if youre an immigrant  voting in a federal election is     a crime that can result in incarceration  or deportation   While     illegal immigrants are barred from voting  legal immigrants who have     become citizens are permitted to do so   The     letter also stated that the federal government had installed a computer     system to verify the names of new registered voters who vote in October     and November and that anti immigration groups would be able to access     that information  Election Day is Nov  7  but early voting is allowed     Oct  20 29 in Orange County      Cynthia Magnuson  a spokeswoman for the Justice Department  which along     with the California attorney generals office is investigating the     letters source  said there was no such database   The     letter contains false information  Ms  Magnuson said   The     letter was printed on stationery labeled with the name of the California     Coalition for Immigration Reform  a strident anti illegal immigration     group whose Web site features a video on how illegal immigrants bring     disease to the United States  But     Barbara Coe  the groups leader  told The Los Angeles Times  which first     reported the letter on Tuesday  that her group had not sent or     authorized it  and that she did not know a Sergio Ramirez  On Tuesday      Ms  Coe did not return repeated phone calls and e mail seeking comment      Some     Latino leaders expressed doubts on Tuesday about Ms  Coes denial and     said they suspected the letter was part of a concerted  long term effort     on the part of groups like hers to intimidate voters       Theyre taking as much action as they can to make the lives of Latinos     as miserable as possible  said Brent Wilkes  the national executive     director of the League of United Latin American Citizens  a civil rights     group   Gov      Arnold Schwarzenegger called the letter racist and urged Bill Lockyer      the California attorney general  to prosecute those responsible with a     hate crime  A collection of other civil rights groups also called on     Attorney General Alberto R  Gonzales to investigate the letter as a     violation of federal voting laws       Nathan Barankin  a spokesman for Mr  Lockyer  said his office had been     alerted to the letter on Monday morning  after a weekend in which Latino     leaders fielded calls from outraged constituents   They     could be naturalized citizens or they could be fourth generation     Californians  Mr  Barankin said of the recipients  What we do know is     that some of the recipients of this letter are legal and longtime     registered voters in California   Mr      Barankin said the letter could have violated two California laws  One     bans the use of coercion or intimidation in an effort to prevent someone     from voting  the other makes it illegal to knowingly challenge a     persons right to vote on fraudulent and spurious grounds  It     was unclear  Mr  Barankin said  how many of the letters were     distributed  but his office expected more complaints      Were going to determine who sent it  and why they sent it and then     from that  if theres enough evidence to prosecute  Mr  Barankin said          Orange County  between Los Angeles and San Diego  has seen a substantial     increase in its Latino population over the last two decades  A 2005     estimate by the Census Bureau reported that nearly one in three Orange     County residents was of Latino or Hispanic origin       Representative Loretta Sanchez  a Democrat from Garden Grove  in     northern Orange County  said that she had heard from a handful of     constituents in her district who received a letter  and that she feared     it could scare off first time voters      Santa Ana and Anaheim are the new Ellis Island of the United States      Ms  Sanchez said  mentioning two Orange County cities with large Latino     populations  New people are becoming citizens every day  and who knows     the sophistication level when they get a letter like this  But     others thought the letter would have little effect   I     think Latino voters are astute enough not to be intimidated  said John     Trasvi  a  the interim president and general counsel for the Mexican     American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Los Angeles  And theyve     seen the same tactics used against them in the recent past as well as     the farther ago past  And they wont take it   San Diego Union Tribune  Orange Co  candidate denies sending     threatening letter to Hispanic voters By Peter Prengaman ASSOCIATED PRESS   11 14 a m  October 19      2006  LOS     ANGELES  A Republican congressional candidate said Thursday that he was     not personally involved in sending a letter warning Hispanic immigrants     they could go to jail or be deported if they vote next month  a mailing     that prompted a state investigation    I did not do this  I did     not approve of any letter  Tan D  Nguyen  the GOP challenger to     Democratic U S  Rep  Loretta Sanchez  told The Associated Press   The investigation is     focused on Nguyen s campaign  according to a law enforcement official     who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to     publicly discuss it  The Los Angeles Times and The Orange     County Register also indicated the Nguyen s campaign was the target   Nguyen said he believed an     employee in his office might have used his voter data base to send out     the letter without his knowledge  He said that employee has been     discharged   The letter  written in     Spanish and mailed last week to an estimated 14 000 Democratic voters in     central Orange County  tells recipients  You are advised that if your     residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant  voting in     a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time   In fact  immigrants who     are naturalized U S  citizens can legally vote   It is illegal to threaten     or intimidate voters  though  and the complaints about the letters that     began surfacing this week prompted state and federal investigations   I will do whatever I can     do to encourage all citizens in this district to vote  Nguyen said  He     said he was cooperating with authorities and promised more details of     what happened during a news conference Friday   In an interview Thursday     morning  Sanchez told the AP she had never spoken to Nguyen because her     campaign didn t see him as a threat to her re election   She said she didn t know     who did it  but if it was Nguyen  it was especially troubling that the     culprit might have been an immigrant  Nguyen immigrated to the U S  from     Vietnam as a child  His campaign Web site says he opposes illegal     immigration   If it is in fact this     guy  the most disgusting and saddest thing about it is that it comes     from another immigrant  said Sanchez  who was born in the U S  to     Mexican parents  These communities have spent years trying to get     naturalized immigrants to vote   The owner of Huntington     Beach based Mailing Pros  Christopher West  told The Orange County     Register that he was hired to do the mailings but didn t know what they     said and didn t know any laws were being broken when the mailer was     sent  He said he gave investigators the name of the person who hired     him   I m the one that     processed it  and I don t read Spanish  West said  Until the     investigator read it to me  I didn t know the content   Scott Baugh  chairman of     the Orange County Republican Party  condemned the letter as an     obnoxious  grotesque piece of work   Regardless of who did it      Republican or Democrat  if it s a crime  then whoever did it should     be prosecuted  Baugh said   The note s letterhead     resembles that of an anti illegal immigration group  California     Coalition for Immigration Reform  but group leader Barbara Coe said she     told investigators for the attorney general s office Wednesday that her     group didn t authorize the letter and she didn t know who sent it   The letterhead was     altered and I ve never head of any Sergio Ramirez  the name signed to     the letter  Coe said
