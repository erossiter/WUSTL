       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  The Hatch Leahy Amendment To The   Trademark Dilution Revision Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     The Hatch Leahy Amendment      To The Trademark Dilution Revision Act Of 2005  HR 683      February 16  2006 As we work to      strengthen our intellectual property laws  to protect consumers and      to crack down on companies that ignore these laws  I am pleased that      we are able to address trademark dilution  This bill will protect      the basic principles of trademark laws by protecting certain words       images  and logos that convey important information  such as the      source  quality  and value of a product to the public   Consumers have a      right to know that they are in fact receiving what they think they      are purchasing  Moreover  companies that have expended efforts at      creating durable products worthy of a solid reputation deserve to      have their trademark  and that reputation  respected   In 1995  I worked      closely with members of the House Judiciary Committee to enact the      Federal Trademark Dilution Act  The goal of this bill was to unify      differing state trademark dilution laws by expanding the scope of      rights granted to famous and distinctive trademarks under the Lanham      Act   However  in 2003       the Supreme Court decided the case of Moseley v  V Secret      Catalogue  Inc  The Court held that trademark holders had to      show actual harm  not the likelihood of harm  from dilution before      they could seek injunctions  So trademark holders are now forced to      wait until actual injury is complete  and possibly irreparable      damage is done    before they can seek to halt the illegal dilution This is contrary      to what Congress intended when it passed the dilution statue  What      we did intend was to stop diluting before actual harm could be      realized and the value of any reputable trademark debased    H R  683      clarifies Congress intentions when it passed the dilution act a      decade ago  allowing an owner of a famous trademark to seek an      injunction against a person who attempts to use the mark in a way      that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or tarnishment  It      lets the court consider all relevant factors in determining      whether a mark is famous  It also clarifies the fair use exemption      to trademark dilution to ensure that innocent search engines are not      caught up in the liability net   Importantly  it      also responds to concerns that mark holders would seek to assert      dilution protection over otherwise non famous trade dress by      attaching their famous marks to the dress  Lastly  it restores the      important non commercial use exemption that has long protected      important expressive and First Amendment activities  which the House      bill would have restricted  The legislative      process is functioning well when we work with our colleagues across      the aisle  and it is at its best when we work on a bipartisan basis      with the other chamber  This bill has benefited from broad      bi partisan support in the House  It is my hope we will continue in      the spirit of bi partisanship and move swiftly to enact this bill
