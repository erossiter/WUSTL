Consumer Federation of America       Awards Dinner       Presentation of Philip Hart Award to Senator Patrick Leahy        D VT    Introduction by       Jim Guest      President and Chief Executive Officer      Consumers Union  Publisher of Consumer Reports  And       ConsumerReports org      Thursday Night  June 15  2006  I have the wonderful distinction       of having known Pat Leahy before he was Senator Leahy  In the       early 1970s  he was States Attorney in Vermonts largest       county  and I was a consumer advocate in Vermont state       government  Pat had a well earned reputation as a tough        hard working  fair minded  highly effective prosecutor  And then       he ran for United States Senator in 1974 against great odds and       became one of the youngest Senators ever  As one of your       original constituents from Vermont  Senator  and as an advocate       today on national consumer issues  I couldnt be more proud of       what youve achieved for Vermont and for the nation in your       nearly 32 years of service in the Senate   Senator Leahy has a long record as       an outspoken champion for protecting consumers rights        especially when it comes to privacy  whether financial        personal  medical  or online  Many of us  in fact  are       currently working with him on legislation to increase consumer       protections in the case of identity theft and data security       breaches   Senator Leahy is a staunch       defender of the First Amendment  Hes fought repeatedly to       shield whistleblowers from the crushing consequences that can       result from coming forward in the name of the public good   Senator Leahy is the father and       persistent watchdog of the 1990 organic food law that created       the national program that supports a more sustainable way of       living  When the program came under assault by special interests       who want the benefit of the lucrative organic label without       the burden of producing truly organic foods  Senator Leahy       fought back successfully   Senator Leahy is not afraid to       take the vote less traveled  He was one of the few senators to       vote against the 1996 Telecom Act that a decade later has       spawned skyrocketing cable rates  massive consolidation in the       telephone and cable industries  and now the demise of long       distance  the best competitors to local phone monopolies  Hes       been a long time anti trust watchdog  blowing the whistle on       media mergers that he thought would hurt consumers pocketbooks   The list goes on  But I want to       say something about Pat Leahy the person  Hes a strong family       man who cares deeply about his wife and children  and loves to       escape to his homestead in rural Vermont and spend time there       with family and friends  Hes always had a special interest in       children  his own and youngsters everywhere  recognizing the       importance of fostering civic engagement in the next generation       of Americans   I was talking with my 28 year old       daughter last night  Senator  and told her Id be introducing       you  She related a vivid memory of when she was an eight year       old schoolgirl in Burlington  Vermont  who approached you after       a public function and interviewed you for a grade school project       on the environment  You took the time to listen  you gave       thoughtful responses  and heres how she described the lasting       impression you made on this young schoolgirl 20 years ago        Senator Leahy was both feisty and laid back  He clearly had       strong convictions  and he knew what he was talking about  He       actually had something to say  and he actually meant what he       said  I thought he was lovable   Feisty  laid back  strong       convictions  knows what hes talking about  lovable  All of       these apply today  And what also applies is that Pat Leahy is       that rare 21st Century phenomenon    a Renaissance       man   To give just one example  hes a       passionate and accomplished photographer  A Vermont friend who       saw a recent exhibit of his photos was struck not only by their       quality but by their range  There were photos of Ronald Reagan        Hugh Scott  the Pope  Tibet under Chinese occupation  and many       more  It strikes me that a lot of the skills that make Senator       Leahy a talented photographer are the same ones that make him an       effective lawmaker    an eye for detail  the ability to look at       a situation from many angles  the aptitude for grasping depth       and breadth  and the desire to capture as many perspectives as       possible   Senator Pat Leahy    homegrown       Vermonter  consumer champion  feisty legislator  Renaissance       man  United States Senator extraordinaire    its my great honor       to present you with the Consumer Federation of Americas Philip       Hart Public Service Award for your unswerving dedication and       profound achievements on behalf of the American consumer
