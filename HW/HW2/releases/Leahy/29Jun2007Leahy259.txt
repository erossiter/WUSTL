       FY 2008 State Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill Includes   Leahy Feinstein Legislation To Restrict The Sale Or Transfer Of Cluster Bombs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              FY 2008 State Foreign Operations     Appropriations Bill    Includes Leahy Feinstein Legislation    To Restrict The Sale Or Transfer Of Cluster Bombs  WASHINGTON  June 29     The Fiscal Year 2008 State Foreign Operations     Appropriations Bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee     includes a measure  sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and     Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    that would restrict the sale or transfer of     cluster bombs   Leahy chairs the State Foreign Operations Appropriations     Subcommittee  and Feinstein is also a leading member of the     Appropriations Committee  The vehicle for their legislation  the annual     funding bill for the State Department and for U S  foreign aid and     foreign operations  was approved by the panel on June 28 and heads next     to the full Senate for debate and votes  The State Foreign Operations     Appropriations Bill is also where Leahy passed his legislation in 1992     banning the export of anti personnel landmines  Leahys legislation was     a catalyst that helped launch what became an international treaty     banning the use of landmines  A similar worldwide treaty writing effort     was recently launched to limit the use of cluster munitions   Specifically  the Leahy Feinstein legislation requires that no     military funds will be used for the sale or transfer or cluster bombs      unless    The cluster bombs have a failure rate of 1 percent or less  and      The sale or transfer agreement specifies that the cluster bombs      will be used only against clearly defined military targets and not      where civilians are known to be present    There are compelling reasons and there is rising urgency to protect     innocent civilians when and where these weapons are used  said Leahy      We live in an era in which innocent civilians increasingly are made the     victims of war  When we have the chance to slow that trend  we should     take it  I am gratified that Congress is beginning to take the lead in     setting these appropriate standards  This is a sensible and workable     step to set a high reliability standard for cluster munitions that are     transferred or sold  and to keep them from being used among civilians      This will reduce the threat to innocent people by outdated weapons that     have too often been used in ways that cause terrible civilian     casualties  It is our hope that the Administration will support this     approach  which would then encourage other nations to follow our     example   Cluster bombs were originally designed for attacking large scale     enemy formations  but they have instead become a lethal threat to     civilians  said Feinstein  The volatile remnants of millions of     unexploded cluster bombs have had a deadly impact on civilian     populations around the world  from Vietnam  Laos  Cambodia  Kosovo      Iraq  Afghanistan  and the Middle East  I believe that the time has come     for the United States to implement a new policy to ensure that civilians     are no longer needlessly endangered by these de facto landmines  Thats     why its so important that the Senate Appropriations Committee has     approved a measure that would restrict the sale or transfer of cluster     bombs and help to minimize the threat to civilians   Currently  the arsenal of the U S  military contains 5 5 million     cluster bombs  or 728 million bomblets  many of which have a failure     rate of 1 percent or higher   Background  Cluster bombs are designed to come apart in the air before making     contact  dispersing between 200 and 400 small bomblets that can saturate     a wide radius of 250 yards  They are intended for military use when     attacking large scale enemy troop formations  However  in practice      cluster bombs have increasingly been used in or near populated areas      Handicap International studied the effects of cluster bombs in 24     countries and regions  including Afghanistan  Chechnya  Laos  and     Lebanon  Its report found that civilians make up 98 percent of those     killed or injured by cluster bombs  Children account for 27 percent of     the casualties   The senators said the civilian toll has been staggering   Combining the first and second Gulf Wars  the total number of     unexploded bomblets in the region is approximately 1 2 million  An     estimated 1 220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed since     1991    In Iraq in 2003  13 000 cluster bombs with nearly 2 million bomblets     were used    In Afghanistan in 2001  1 228 cluster bombs with 248 056 bomblets     were used  Between October 2001 and November 2002  127 civilians were     killed  70 percent of them under the age of 18    Between nine and 27 million unexploded cluster bombs remain in Laos     from U S  bombing campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s  Approximately 11 000     people  30 percent of them children  have been killed or injured since     the war ended    Most recently  it is estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets     in southern Lebanon  and 1 million of these bomblets failed to explode      And reports indicate that Hezbollah retaliated with cluster bomb strikes     of their own
