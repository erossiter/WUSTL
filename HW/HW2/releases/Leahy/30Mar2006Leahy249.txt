       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Debate On immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Debate On Immigration Reform     Senate Floor     March 30  2006  Yesterday the Senate began debate on      immigration reform legislation  Chairman Specter and I followed the      opening statement of the Republican leader with a discussion of how      the Judiciary Committee  in a bipartisan manner  worked successfully      to meet the deadline set by the Senates Republican leadership  I      understood that the Majority Leader had committed to turn to the      Committee bill if we were able to meet his deadline  That is what I      heard our Chairman reiterate again on the Senate floor yesterday        Well  we completed that difficult task      and we did it by working together  Republicans and Democrats  Under      the steady leadership of the Chairman and Senator  Kennedy and with the hard work and      dedication of so many Members of the Committee  we worked through      the long hours and numerous amendments and accomplished what had      seemed the impossible  The Judiciary Committee sent a resounding      message  approving a bill by a bipartisan vote of 12 6  with strong      bipartisan support of every key amendment    It is a bill that is strong on      enforcement  In some ways it is stronger than the bill passed by      the House  It is tough on employer enforcement and tough on      traffickers  It is stronger than the bill introduced by the senior      Senator from Tennessee       who started from the same place as the Committee bill but did not      include some of the enforcement measures added by amendment during      Committee consideration or any of the other improvements that we      made  For example  neither of those other bills includes a      provision added by the Committee at the urging of Senator Feinstein       to make tunneling under our borders a federal crime  The Committee      bill adds new criminal penalties for evading immigration officers      and it added manslaughter to the definition of aggravated felony       Finally  on Monday morning  the Committee adopted a Feinstein      amendment to add 12 000 new Border Patrol Agents  at 2 400 each year      for the next five years    The Committee bill is enforcement      plus  It starts with strong enforcement provisions and border      security to be sure  but it is also comprehensive and balanced  It      confronts the problem of 12 million undocumented immigrants who live      in the shadows  It values work  It respects human dignity  It      includes guest worker provisions supported by business and labor       It includes a way to pay fines and earn citizenship that has the      support of religious and leading Hispanic organizations     Yesterday Senator  Kennedy  Senator Durbin and Senator      Harkin made excellent and persuasive statements in favor of the      Committee bill  Senator Domenici and Senator Martinez also spoke of      their personal journeys and reminded us all that we are a country of      immigrants  I thank them for speaking in terms favorable to the      comprehensive approach we have adopted  I look forward to their      support for the bill  I look forward to working with Chairman      Specter in a bipartisan way to pass the Committee bill  That bill      provides a realistic and reasonable system for immigration  That      bill protects Americas borders  strengthens enforcement and remains      true to American values    The Committee bill wisely dropped      controversial provisions that would have exposed those who provide      humanitarian relief  medical care  shelter  counseling and other      basic services to undocumented aliens to possible prosecution under      felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal law  I thank so      many in the relief and religious communities for speaking out on      this matter  Those criminal provisions should be focused on the      smugglers and under the Committee bill that is what we did  The      Committee also voted down a measure that would have criminalized      mere presence in an undocumented status in the  United States  Illegal status is      currently a civil offense with very serious consequences  including      deportation  but criminalizing that status was punitive and wrong       It would have led to further harsh consequences and trapped people      in permanent underclass status  These criminalization measures       which were included in the House passed bill supported by      congressional Republicans and are reflected in the Frist bill  have      understandable sparked nationwide protests  They are viewed by many      as anti immigrant and inconsistent with American values and      history  The Committee bill  while tough on enforcement and on the      smugglers  is smarter and fairer   The Judiciary Committee has confronted      the challenging problem of how to fix our broken immigration system      head on and has sent the Senate a good product  That product will      be offered to the Senate at  noon today as a substitute for the      pending placeholder  The Democratic leader noted on Tuesday  as we      prepared to proceed to this debate  that based on the assurances he      had received  the foundation of the Senates upcoming debate on      immigration policy will be the bipartisan Committee bill  The      Committee bill is worthy of Senate support   Opponents of a fair  comprehensive      approach are quick to claim that anything but the most punitive      provisions is amnesty  They are wrong  This is not an amnesty      bill  An editorial in yesterdays  New York Times entitled      It Isnt Amnesty makes the point that painting the word deer on      a cow and taking it into the woods does not make the cow a deer       Our Committee bill should not be falsely labeled  Our bill is      more properly called what it is  a smart  tough bill     The provisions in the Committee bill      are not amnesty  Undocumented immigrants already in the country      would not get to cut to the front of the line  but  in accordance      with the Committees bipartisan plan  will need to pay fines  pay      back taxes  work hard  and wait in line for green cards  They must      pass background checks and play by the rules  With fines and hard      work and going to the back of the line  after 11 years  by following      a regularized path to legal status  the currently undocumented will      join as full participants in American society  Following this plan       we can create an orderly system for immigration that is consistent      with traditional American values and our history     The Committee included in the bill a      new version of the Agricultural Job Opportunities  Benefits  and      Security Act  or Ag Jobs  a bill that I have long supported and      that has been championed by Senator Craig  Ag Jobs will reform the      H2A visa program for temporary agricultural labor  This new version      will help dairy farmers in  Vermont and other states to hire      workers legally    The Committee also adopted an      amendment to include the bipartisan Development  Relief  and      Education for Alien Minors Act  called the DREAM Act  This      provision will allow immigrant students to attend college and to      become permanent residents if they follow the rules established in      the Act  It will free eligible students from the constant fear of      deportation  while allowing them to work so they can afford to pay      for college  By our bipartisan Committee vote  we hope to extend to      Hispanic young people greater educational opportunities so that they      may realize the American dream and achieve their potential   The Committee wisely agreed to drop      several controversial provisions  I have already referenced the      criminalization of the status of being undocumented and of providing      humanitarian assistance to immigrants that prompted demonstrations      across the country  Early in the process  I led an effort to remove      a provision directing the Department of Homeland Security to study      building a barrier  fence or wall along the Northern Border with     Canada  I thank the      Chairman for setting aside provisions in the mark that would have      consolidated all immigration appeals from around the Nation into the      jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit  That is a court of specialized      jurisdiction created to hear patent appeals and cases involving      technical intellectual property issues  The Judicial Conference and      Federal judges from across the country expressed serious concerns      with these proposals  The Chairman did the right thing when he      agreed to hold a hearing and further consider what provisions will      best correct the problems created by Attorney General Ashcrofts      ill conceived actions with respect to these matters    The peaceful demonstrations around the      country over the last weeks call on the Congress to recognize the      human dignity of all and to do the right thing  in keeping with      longstanding American values  We need a comprehensive solution to a      national problem  We need a fair  realistic and reasonable system      that includes both tough enforcement and immigration reform      provisions  All Senators  Republicans and Democrats should be able      to agree with these principles  The bill reported by the Judiciary      Committee is that bill    I am glad to hear that President Bush      is  again  speaking about the need for a path to citizenship and the      need for a comprehensive bill  Of course  as we proceed through      their sixth year in office  the Bush Cheney Administration has still      not sent a legislative proposal to the Congress on these matters       Instead of waiting  we have done the hard work and written a tough       smart  comprehensive bill  The Judiciary Committees debate has      produced a bill that  I believe  would make my immigrant      grandparents proud and is worthy of our support  It already has      the support of labor unions  business groups  leading Hispanic      organizations and many in our religious communities  Now is the      time for the Senate to do its part and adopt the Committee bill so      that we can bring hardworking people out of the shadows  end the      permanent underclass status of so many who have contributed so much       better protect our security and our borders  and allow the American      dream to becomes a reality for our neighbors
