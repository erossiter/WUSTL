       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Trademark Dilution Revision Act   Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Trademark Dilution Revision Act Of 2005  HR 683      March 8  2006 Mr  President  I      am pleased that today the Senate has passed the Trademark Dilution      Revision Act  an important piece of legislation that should clarify      Congress intentions when it first passed the Federal Trademark      Dilution Act over a decade ago   In 2003  the      Supreme Court decided the case of Moseley v  V Secret Catalogue       Inc  The Court held that trademark holders had to show actual      harm  not the likelihood of harm  before they could seek injunctions      against those who were diluting their trademarks   As an original author      and sponsor of the Act  I know firsthand that this is not what      Congress intended when it passed the dilution statue  In fact  our      objective was to stop diluting before actual  and often      irreversible  harm came about  before the value of any reputable      trademark was debased   H  R  683 makes      clear Congresss intent and corrects the law to provide that owners      of famous trademarks can seek injunctions against anyone whose      attempt to use a mark is likely to cause dilution  It also grants      the court the power to consider all relevant factors when      determining whether a mark is famous  However  this legislation      is not intended to provide for such relief against legitimate  third      party trade in products manufacturedunder authority of the U S       trademark owner of the famous mark  Furthermore       Senator Hatch and I were successful in including language that      definitively shelters important constitutionally protected First      Amendment activity from being caught up in the liability net  by      preserving the current law  which protects non commercial use of      trademarks I would like to      thank Senators Hatch and Specter for their support in bringing this      much needed bipartisan legislation through the Judiciary Committee      and to the floor
