       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Department Of Homeland Security   Privacy Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt   Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Department Of Homeland Security Privacy Office Report     On DHSs Breach Of The Privacy Act     In Development Of The Secure Flight Database Program     Friday  Dec  22  2006  This further documents the cavalier      way the Bush Administration treats Americans privacy  To them       following the law and protecting the security of the publics      personal information have become just afterthoughts  or worse  With      this database program  first they ignored the Privacy Act  and now       two years later  they still have a hard time admitting it  Right      now Congress knows little about these mushrooming federal databases      and about how the Bush Administration wants to use them  That needs      to change  and in the new Congress we will work to change it   The problem is not technology  The      problem is a lack of safeguards and oversight to prevent abuses by      an Administration that apparently feels it can ignore Congress and      break privacy laws with impunity  Data mining technology has great      potential  but history shows that without adequate checks and balances and oversight  misuse and abuse of      the publics personal information will be inevitable
