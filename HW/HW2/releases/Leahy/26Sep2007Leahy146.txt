       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Rise In Violent Crime                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Remarks Of  Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Rise In Violent Crime News Conference     U S  Capitol Grounds     September 26  2007     For the second year in a row  the rate      of violent crime again is on the rise  The uptick that the Bush      Administration last year tried to dismiss as a glitch is solidifying      into a troubling pattern    Its no coincidence that for years       the Bush Administration and earlier Republican Congresses have      systematically tried to dismantle front line support for our local      and state law enforcement in our communities  like the successful      COPS community policing program  along with other targeted help to      the police officers who are in the trenches  fighting crime  The      White House has also tried to minimize support for local first      responders    Remember how the federal government      was a help  instead of a hindrance  in bringing down rising crime      rates a decade ago  Back then  the Clinton Administration and      Congress forged successful responses like the COPS program  to put      more police on the beat  using proven techniques like community      policing  Local and state law enforcement is where the rubber meets      the road in fighting crime  But step by step  the Bush      Administration has squandered those gains  Incompetence and a      dysfunctional Justice Department are part of the picture  but the      core problem is that this vital partnership with local police      departments just isnt a priority for the Bush Administration    Budget decisions are the expression of      a governments real priorities  and the Bush Administration has      shown that their real priorities are in Iraq  not here at home  For      them  no expense is too large for the blank checks they want from      Congress    for the Iraqi police force  or for the Iraqi national      guard  Its a different story for our own police departments and      our own National Guard  We could fully fund the COPS Program at the      full level of  1 15 billion authorized in the bill the Senate      Judiciary Committee has approved  for what we spend on the Iraq War      in just three and a half days  That alone would put 8 000 new      police officers on the beat to make our communities safer    We have spent about  19 billion since      2003 on the Iraqi police  according to the Jones Commission  For      less than a third of that amount  we could have fully funded the      COPS Program since then    Eight days worth of Iraq spending      would fully fund the Department of Justice appropriations bill for      all state and local law enforcement assistance programs       Unfortunately  this is one of the bills the President has vowed to      veto   For a tiny fraction of the money we      spend each year on the Iraq war  we could make our own towns and      cities safer in practical and proven ways  Instead  the Bush      Administration sends us a 2008 budget that would cut the help to      state and local law enforcement agencies by 54 percent  thats      right  by more than half   The CJS Appropriations Subcommittee       under the leadership of Senator Mikulski  is taking solid strides to      restore the  1 5 billion in cuts proposed by the President to state      and local law enforcement programs  The CJS Appropriations Bill       which was reported out of the Appropriations Committee by an      overwhelming bipartisan majority  rejects these proposed cuts and      recommends a total of  2 7 billion for state and local enforcement   Im pleased to report that the Senate      Judiciary Committee also has been working to reverse this trend by      moving forward with tangible steps like the COPS Improvement Act       the reauthorization of the Edward Byrne Memorial Assistance Grant      Program  a package of school safety measures  and a gang abatement      and prevention bill   We cant afford to let the White House      keep the federal government on the sidelines while violent crime      makes a comeback  Fighting crime and partnering with local police      once again needs to be a high priority  and the Democratic Congress      is determined to once again make fighting crime the high priority      the American people need and deserve it to be
