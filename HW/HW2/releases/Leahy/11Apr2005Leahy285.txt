  Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy    National Crime Victims Rights Week    April 11  2005 Mr  LEAHY      Mr  President  yesterday marked the beginning of National Crime Victims     Rights Week  For a quarter of a century  we have set this week aside     each year to renew our commitment to address the needs of victims and     their families and to promote victims rights  This years commemoration comes at a critical     juncture in the history of the victims rights movement  Much has been     achieved in the past 25 years to provide victims with greater rights and     assistance  but perhaps none so important as the passage of the Victims     of Crime Act of 1984  VOCA  and its establishment of a dedicated source     of funds to support victims services  The Crime Victims Fund provides     critical funding that helps millions of victims of all types of crime     every year  The future of the Fund is in doubt  however  and 25 years     of progress may be at risk due to the Administrations proposal to     rescind all amounts remaining in the Fund at the end of FY 2006  an     estimated  1 267 billion  That would dry up the Fund  leaving it with a     balance of zero going into FY 2007 to support vital victim services  Our new Attorney General  upon his confirmation      gave a speech to discuss his priorities for the Department of Justice      He stated  As we battle crime  we must also defend the rights of crime     victims and assist them in their recovery  While I agree on the     importance of this goal  rescinding the Crime Victims Fund is not the     way to achieve it  The Crime Victims Fund is the nations premier     vehicle for the support of victims services  Nearly 90 percent of the     Fund is used to award State crime victim compensation and victim     assistance formula grants  VOCA funded victim assistance programs serve     nearly 4 million crime victims each year  including victims of domestic     violence  sexual assault  child abuse  elder abuse  and drunk driving      as well as survivors of homicide victims  VOCA funded compensation     programs have helped hundreds of thousands of victims of violent crime      The Crime Victims Fund also serves victims of     federal crimes  VOCA funding supports victim assistance services     provided by U S  Attorneys Offices and the FBI  as well as the federal     victim notification system  It is used for child abuse prevention and     treatment grants  and it is also used to provide emergency relief to     victims of terrorism and mass violence  Since FY 2000  Congress has set a cap on annual     Fund obligations expressly for the purpose of ensuring that a stable     level of funding will remain available for these programs in future     years  The rainy day fund created by this spending cap has been used     to make up the difference between annual deposits and distributions     three times during the past six years   When Congress began considering caps on Fund     obligations  I proposed and Congress enacted an amendment to the Victims     of Crime Act to clarify our intent to stabilize and preserve the Fund     for the benefit of victims  The amendment  now codified at section     10601 c  of title 42  requires that all sums deposited in the Fund in     any fiscal year that are not made available for obligation by Congress     in the subsequent fiscal year shall remain in the Fund for obligation in     future fiscal years  without fiscal year limitation  Thus  in both the     authorization and the appropriations processes  Congress has clearly and     emphatically stated its intent to maintain a stable source of federal     support for essential victim services  Over the past four years  the Bush Administration     and this Republican Congress have squandered record surpluses and racked     up  7 6 trillion in Federal debt as a result of reckless spending and     budget busting tax cuts  Now the Bush Administration proposes to reduce     the deficit by siphoning off resources that we set aside to assist     victims of crime  In this regard  it bears emphasis that the Crime     Victims Fund does not receive appropriated funding  deposits come from     federal criminal fines  forfeited bail bonds  penalties  and special     assessments  not from the pockets of American taxpayers  Together with Senators Biden and Schumer  I wrote     to President Bush on March 11  2005  to urge him to reconsider and     withdraw his proposal to rescind the Crime Victims Fund  We received no     response to that letter  On March 17  2005  I offered and the Senate     approved by voice vote a budget resolution amendment intended to head     off the Administrations plans to raid the Crime Victims Fund  I was     joined Senators Kennedy  Mikulski  Feingold  Biden  Durbin  Obama and     Dodd  and I thank them again for their support  As amended  the budget     resolution passed by the Senate rejects the proposed rescission by     assuming that all amounts that have been and will be deposited into the     Crime Victims Fund  including all amounts to be deposited in FY 2006 and     thereafter  will remain in the Fund for use as authorized by the Victims     of Crime Act  In every State and every community across the     country  the Crime Victims Fund plays an essential role in helping crime     victims and their families meet critical expenses  recover from the     horrific crimes they endured  and move forward with their lives  I ask     unanimous consent to put in the Record a letter from a number of     victims organizations  representing the millions of Americans who     become victims of crime every year  They wrote that rescinding the     Crime Victims Fund at the end of FY 2006 would create a disastrous     situation for victim service providers and their clients  National Crime Victims Rights Week is upon us  I     urge my colleagues to honor our longstanding commitment to crime victims     by working together to preserve the Crime Victims Fund                National Crime Victim Organizations Contact Groups    720 7th St  N W    300    Washington D C  20001     202  448 1710 March 12  2005 The Honorable Daniel K  Akaka    141 Hart Senate Office Building    Washington  DC 20510 Dear Senator Akaka  We  the undersigned members of the National Crime     Victim Organizations Contact Group  represent the millions of citizens     that become victims of crime every year in our nation and the agencies     that provide supportive services to them  The Crime Victims Fund     provides crucial support to thousands of nonprofit organizations and     public agencies who help millions of crime victims  We have joined     together to urge all members of Congress to oppose the Administrations     proposal to remove  1 2 billion from this essential and life saving     fund  The Fund was created under the Victims of Crime Act     in 1984 as a separate account meaning that the revenues in the Fund     are intended to be used solely for financial support of victim services      primarily through State crime victim compensation and State victim     assistance formula grants  The Fund comes from the collection of Federal     criminal fines  forfeitures and assessments  it does not depend on     general taxpayer appropriations  Since the Funds inception  Congress     directed that all amounts deposited into the Fund would remain available     to support victim services without fiscal year limitation  Over 4 400 victim service agencies in every state     and every district depend upon VOCA funding for essential victim     services  such as emergency shelters  counseling  legal advocacy  and     assistance participating in the criminal justice system  In FY 2003  3 8     million crime victims received VOCA funded assistance  including victims     of domestic violence  sexual assault  child abuse  elder abuse      survivors of homicide victims and drunk driving crashes  Hundreds of     thousands of victims were provided financial assistance through VOCA     grants to State crime victim compensation programs  Initially  the money collected every year was     released to states the following year  When collections grew to nearly      1 billion in fines in FY 1999  Congress placed a cap on the amount that     was distributed each year  Congress began limiting annual Fund     obligations expressly to ensure that a stable level of funding will     remain available for these programs in future years  Conference Report     106 479   Capping annual Fund obligations created a Fund     balancea rainy day fund consisting of amounts that otherwise would     have been used by States to support immediate victim assistance needs      The Fund balance was used to make up the difference between annual     deposits and Congressional caps three times over the past six years  Having recently recognized the 20th    anniversary of this successful and effective program  we were     shocked to learn that the Administration now proposes rescinding the     entire Fund at the end of FY 2006  including the amounts that Congress     promised and  in fact  needed to protect against Fund fluctuations and     to ensure the Funds stability as well as deposits made during FY 2006      More stable long term sources of funding are already required to     maintain a sufficient amount in the Fund  Rescinding the Fund will zero     out the Fund going into FY 2007 and unquestionably create a disastrous     situation for victim service providers and their clients  The entire     crime victims field stands united in its opposition to the proposed     rescission  We ask Congress to reject the Administrations     recommendation to rescind the Fund and to work with us to guarantee the     Funds future viability and support for victim services   Sincerely  David Beatty Contact Group Coordinator    Justice
