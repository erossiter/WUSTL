                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy Announces Bulletproof Vest      Grants     For Vermont Law Enforcement Officers WASHINGTON       Aug  25   Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has announced more than       90 000 in grants to 19 Vermont police departments to help them buy      bulletproof vests for their officers  The grants  secured under a      program that Leahy established  the Bulletproof Vest Partnership  BVP       Program  are coming from the U S  Department of Justice    Since it began      in 1999  the BVP Program has provided officers in 11 500      jurisdictions across the country with nearly 450 000 new bulletproof      vests  Leahy is the Democratic leader of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  which has jurisdiction over the Justice Department and      its programs  He authored the legislation that chartered the      program and subsequent bills that have extended it through 2007  and      he also has led each year in securing funds for the grant program to      promote use of the safety vests  Leahys Bulletproof Vest Grant      Partnership Act of 1998 responded to a situation that became      apparent in the tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the      Vermont New Hampshire border  in which two state troopers who did      not have bulletproof vests were killed  The federal officers who      responded to the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped with      life saving body armor  but the state and local law enforcement      officers lacked protective vests because of the cost  Bulletproof      vests remain one of the foremost defenses for our uniformed      officers  Leahy said  Congress has renewed its pledge to protect      the men and women who protect us every day  and I am pleased that      more than 700 new vests will be purchased for Vermont police      officers  bringing us that much closer to ensuring that every      officer who needs a bulletproof vest can have and use one  The BVP Program      funds up to 50 percent of cost of replacing or purchasing new      vests  The program is required to fully fund the 50 percent of      requested vest needs for jurisdictions under 100 000  Remaining      funds are distributed to jurisdictions of over 100 000  In addition      to the 2005 BVP grants  the Department of Justice also is adding  10      million to the overall program to help in the replacement of Zylon based      body armor vests  which were deemed by DOJ to lack the intended      level of ballistic resistance   The Vermont communities receiving      grants to purchase vests are     Town         Contact         Federal Funding   Number of Vests Funded    Barre        City  Chief        Trevor Whipple         802  476 6613    794 00  4    Barre        Town  Chief        Michael Stevens         802  479 0509   685 50  3    Bellows        Falls Village  Chief        Keith Clark   802         463 1234   997 48  3           Bennington County  Sheriff        Gary Forrest         802  442 4900   1 378 33  5           Bennington Town  Chief        Richard Gauthier         802  442 1030   3 199 00  14           Burlington City  Ms  Lise        Veronneau         802  658 2704   9 900 50  43    Chester        Town   Chief        Rick Cloud         802  875 2035   2 593 50  5    Essex        Junction Village   Mr         Robert Lagrow         802  878 1335   1 050 00  3    Franklin        County   Sheriff        Robert Norris         802  524 2121   2 285 00  10    Hardwick        Town   Chief        James Dziobek         802  472 5475   686 93  2    Hinesburg        Town   Chief        Chris Morrell         802  482 3397   350 00  1    Milton        Town  Chief        Brett Van Noordt         802  893 6171   417 50  2           Morristown Town  Chief        Richard Keith         802  888 4211   729 99  2    Orange        County   Sheriff        William Bohnyak          802  685 4875   1 010 00  4           Springfield Town  Chief        David Glidden         802  885 2112   480 00  2    St         Albans City  Chief        Ruth Miller         802  524 2166   689 25  3    Vermont        State Police  Sergeant        Michael Heston         802  241 5277          60 611 43  600    Winhall        Town  Chief        Jeffery Whitesell         802  297 2121   1 825 00  5    Winooski        City  Chief        Stephen McQueen         802  655 0221   1 587 00  6    TOTALS            91 270 41  717
