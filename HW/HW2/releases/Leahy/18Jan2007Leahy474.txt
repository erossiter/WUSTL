       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Department Of Justice   Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary     Hearing On Department Of Justice Oversight    January 18  2007    Today  this Committee holds an important hearing to     examine the operations of the Department of Justice  the federal agency     entrusted with ensuring the fair and impartial administration of justice     for all Americans  I take our oversight responsibility very seriously          Restoring Privacy and Civil Liberties In the 32 years since I first came to the Senate      during the era of Watergate and Vietnam  I have never seen a time when     our Constitution and fundamental rights as Americans were more     threatened by their own government  Just this last weekend  the     President and Vice President indicated that they intended to override     the will of the American people  as expressed in the most recent     national elections  and ignore actions of Congress in order to escalate     the war in Iraq  This Administration has circumvented express     congressional prohibitions on creating databanks of information on     law abiding Americans over the last five years   For years  this     Administration has engaged in warrantless wiretapping of Americans     contrary to the law  Since this troubling program was first revealed  I     have urged this Administration to inform Congress about what the     government is doing and to comply with the checks and balances Congress     wrote into law in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  I welcome     the Presidents change of course yesterday to not reauthorize this     program and to  instead  seek approval for all wiretaps from the Foreign     Intelligence Surveillance Court  as the law requires  We must engage in     all surveillance necessary to prevent acts of terrorism  but we can and     should do so in ways that protect the basic rights of all Americans      including the right to privacy  The issue has never been whether to     monitor suspected terrorists but doing it legally and with proper checks     and balances to prevent abuses  This reversal is a good first step  but     there are still several outstanding questions that remain  To ensure     the balance necessary to achieve both security and liberty for our     Nation  the President must also fully inform Congress and the American     people about the contours of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court     order authorizing this surveillance program and of the program itself      The President has     issued signing statement after signing statement declaring the law to be     not what Congress passed and he has signed  but what he finds     convenient  And  regrettably  the Administration has all too often     refused to answer the legitimate oversight questions of the duly elected     representatives of the American people  Unfortunately  this Justice     Department has been complicit in advancing these government policies     which threaten our basic liberties and overstep the bounds of our     Constitution   Human Rights The Department has     also played a pivotal role  in my view  in eroding basic human rights     and undercutting Americas leading role as an advocate for human rights     throughout the world  Last week  the world marked the fifth anniversary     of the arrival of the first prisoners at Guantanamo Bay with protests      That facility has replaced Abu Ghraib in the eyes of many  including     some of our closest allies  as a symbol of repression  Although the     President had said that he wanted to close it down  he is now proposing     stepped up use and construction projects that threaten to make the     detention center at Guantanamo Bay a permanent fixture in the world   For more than two     years  we have sought answers from the Department of Justice about     reported and  in some instances  documented cases of the abuse of     detainees in U S  custody  I wrote to Attorney General Gonzales     regarding press reports that the Central Intelligence Agency has finally     acknowledged the existence of additional classified documents detailing     the Bush Administrations interrogation and detention policy for     terrorism suspects  I am glad that  after initially refusing to provide     any new information in response to my inquiries  the Attorney General     wrote to me last week to say that he would work to develop an     accommodation that provides the Judiciary Committee with a sufficient     understanding of the Departments position on legal questions related to     the CIA program  That is a good first step  and I will work with him     to reach the accommodation that he suggested  But  I remain     disappointed that the Department of Justice and the White House have     continued to refuse to provide the requested documents to the     Committee   We have a democratic     government in which Congress is entitled to know and review government     actions  The President and Vice President of the United States should     not be operating a secret and separate regime in which their official     acts and policies cannot be known by the peoples elected     representatives   The Administrations     secret policies have not only reduced Americas standing around the     world to one of the lowest point in our history  but these policies also     jeopardize the Departments own efforts to prosecute terrorism  Last     week  USA Today reported that the Departments terrorism case     against Jose Padilla is imperiled by concerns that Mr  Padillas     treatment during his lengthy detention and back and forth designations     as a defendant and enemy combatant have eroded his mental capacity to     such a great extent that he cannot fairly be tried  Any trial of     Khalid Sheikh Mohammad as the mastermind of 9 11 will have to overcome     challenges based on his treatment and detention   And  after the     Administration and the Republican led Congress eviscerated the Great     Writ of habeas corpus    not just for detainees but for millions     of permanent residents living in the United States    this Department of     Justice filed a legal brief expressly supporting that result  raising     the specter that millions living in the United States today can now be     subjected to indefinite government detention    Civil Rights and Crime This week we     commemorated the life and contributions of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr      Sadly  the while the Department has defended the constitutionality of     the Voting Rights Act  I am concerned that it is backing away from the     vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act that the President     promised only a few months ago  I am concerned that  in nearly six     years of power  the Bush Administration has filed only one suit on     behalf of African American voters under Section 2 of the Voting Rights     Act  the key section that provides a cause of action for discrimination     against minority voters   I am also deeply     concerned that the Department of Justice is retreating from its core     mission to hold those who would violate our criminal laws accountable      Last week  the President told us that he plans to spend  1 2 billion     more  on top of the billions already sent to Iraq for reconstruction      Despite mounting evidence of widespread corruption  contracting fraud     and billions unaccounted for  the Department of Justice has not brought     a single criminal case against a corporate contractor in Iraq   The Department must     also do better at addressing the dangers that Americans face at home      According to the FBIs preliminary crime statistics for the first half     of 2006  violent crimes in the United States rose  again  Some of us     are concerned that this Administration has forgotten the lessons that     led to our success during the Clinton years and that the rise in violent     crime is related to this Administrations  2 billion cut in aid to state     and local law enforcement programs  While it is more than willing to     spend more and more American taxpayers funds for police in Iraq  this     Administration is cutting back funding for our state and local police at     home   Conclusion This Committee has a     special stewardship role to protect our most cherished rights and     liberties as Americans and to make sure that our fundamental freedoms     are preserved for future generations  There is much work to be done to     repair the damage inflicted on our Constitution and civil liberties     during the last six years   Attorney General     Gonzales  I thank you for agreeing to come here today  I look forward     to hearing your views and answers to our questions  We need to work     together to move forward
