       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of The Violence   Against Women Act of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Introduction      Of The Violence Against Women Act of 2005     June 8  2005 I am proud to      join Senators Biden  Hatch  Specter and other cosponsors to      introduce today the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act  VAWA  of      2005  Our Nation has      made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in recognizing that      domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes  providing legal      remedies  social supports and coordinated community responses       Millions of women  men  children and families  however  continue to      be traumatized by abuse  leading to increased rates of crime       violence and suffering  I witnessed the      devastating effects of domestic violence early in my career as the      Vermont States Attorney for Chittenden County  Violence and abuse      affect people of all walks of life every day and regardless of      gender  race  culture  age  class or sexuality  Such violence is a      crime and it is always wrong  whether the abuser is a family member       someone the victim is dating  a current or past spouse  boyfriend       or girlfriend  an acquaintance or a stranger  The National      Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691 710 non fatal       violent incidents committed against victims by current and former      spouses  boyfriends or girlfriends  now termed intimate partners by      DOJ  during 2001  Eight five percent of those incidents were      against women  The rate of non fatal intimate partner violence      against women has fallen steadily since 1993  when the rate was 9 8      incidents per 1 000 people  In 2001  the number fell to 5 0      incidents per 1 000 people  nearly a 50 percent reduction       Tragically  however  the survey found that 1 600 women were killed      in 1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend  while in 2000      some 1 247 women were killed by their intimate partners  VAWA became law      in 1994 and was reauthorized in 2000  It has provided aid to law      enforcement officers and prosecutors  encouraged arrest policies       stemmed domestic violence and child abuse  established training      programs for victim advocates and counselors  and trained probation      and parole officers who work with released sex offenders  This      Congress we have the opportunity to reauthorize VAWA and make      improvements to vital core programs  tighten criminal penalties      against domestic abusers  and create new solutions to challenges in      other crucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault  such      as treating children victims of violence  augmenting health care for      rape victims  holding repeat offenders and Internet stalkers      accountable  and helping domestic violence victims keep their jobs  I am particularly      proud to note that included in VAWA 2005 are reauthorizations for      two programs that I authored  In a small  rural state like Vermont       our county and local law enforcement agencies rely on cooperative       interagency efforts to combat and solve significant problems  That      is why I authored the Rural Domestic Violence and Child      Victimization Enforcement Grant Program as part of the original VAWA       This program helps services available to rural victims and children      by encouraging community involvement in developing a coordinated      response to combat domestic violence  dating violence and child      abuse  Adequate resources combined with sustained commitment will      bring about significant improvements in rural areas to the lives of      those victimized by domestic and sexual violence  The Rural Grants      Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and expands the existing      education  training and services grant programs that address      violence against women in rural areas  This provision renews the      rural VAWA program  extends direct grants to state and local      governments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include      community collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or      expansion of additional victim services  This provision includes      new language that expands the program coverage to sexual assault       child sexual assault and stalking  It also expands eligibility from      rural states to rural communities  increasing access to rural      sections of otherwise highly populated states  This section      authorizes  55 000 000 annually for 2006 through 2010  which is an      increase of  15 million per year  The second grant      program I authored that is included in VAWA 2005 is the Transitional      Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence  Dating      Violence  Sexual Assault or Stalking  This program  which became      law as part of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the      Exploitation of Children Today  PROTECT  Act of 2003  authorizes      grants for transitional housing and related services for people      fleeing domestic violence  sexual assault or stalkers  At a time      when the availability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows       transitional housing for victims is especially needed  Today more      than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children      fleeing domestic violence  We have a clear problem that is in dire      need of a solution  I want this program to be part of the solution  Transitional      housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving violence in      their homes and becoming self sufficient  VAWA 2005 amends the      existing transitional housing program administered by the Office on      Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice  This section      expands the current direct assistance grants to include funds for      operational  capital and renovation costs  Other changes include      providing services to victims of dating violence  sexual assault and      stalking  extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to      match that used by Housing and Urban Development transitional      housing programs  and updating the existing program to reflect the      concerns of the service provision community  The provision would      increase the authorized funding for the grant from  30 000 000 to       40 000 000   Now it is time to      strengthen the prevention of violence against women and children and      its devastating costs and consequences  This legislation goes      beyond simple words of recognition and efforts to increase awareness      of the problem of violence to save the lives of battered women  rape      victims and children who grow up with violence  I look forward to      working further with fellow Senators on VAWA 2005 and I urge the      Senate to take prompt action on this legislation
