       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Between A Rock And A Hard Place    Housing And Wages In Vermont                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        On Between A Rock And A Hard Place  Housing And Wages In Vermont     And On The Bush Budget Cuts To Affordable Housing     Wednesday  February 15  2006  For an      unprecedented sixth year in a row  the Bush Administration has again      decided that affordable housing is not a national priority  The      Presidents budget proposal says to ordinary Americans families      struggling to make ends meet and needing help in affording basic      housing  Sorry  but putting a roof over your head is no longer our      concern  That attitude is short sighted  has real consequences in      real communities for real people and is anything but compassionate       It is wrong   After      squandering record surpluses  converting them overnight into a      record national debt  through irresponsible tax and spending      policies  the White Houses solution is to slash funds for      affordable housing programs that help hard working Americans and      their families who are stuck in a financial cul de sac  as the gap      between housing costs and wages continues to widen  At the same      time  the White House calls for more massive tax cuts for the      wealthiest individuals and corporations  Our children and      grandchildren  who cannot possibly afford such irresponsibility       will reap the true legacy of the Bush Administrations abysmal      fiscal management   This      report confirms what we have all known for quite some time  It is      becoming harder and harder for Vermonters to find basic  affordable      housing  If we fail to address this problem head on  it will become      increasingly difficult for our teachers  police officers and fire      and rescue workers to afford places to live in the communities where      we need them  We will continue to see the ranks of homeless      families in Vermont grow  There are good  workable solutions to      this problem  but it takes effort at all levels of our society       from local organizations to the Governors office  from community      groups to lenders  and from the White House to Congress   At a      time when federal leadership is needed more than ever before  the      Bush Administration is running in the other direction  The      President has sent a budget to Congress that would hurt affordable      housing programs by cutting funds for public housing and weakening      the Section 8 program  and he would slash funding for one of the      most successful initiatives that supports affordable housing  the      Community Development Block Grant Program  I will fight these      short sighted cuts as I have in the past  We need to make      affordable housing the priority that it needs to be for all people      and our communities
