       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations      June 19  2006  Today the Senate will confirm       another lifetime appointment to our federal courts  Sandra       Segal Ikuta  who has been nominated to a seat on the Court of       Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  has the support of her home state       Senators  Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer  Her nomination       was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last month       as we expedited consideration through the Committee    I am pleased that the Republican       leadership has scheduled debate and consideration of this       nomination and am glad that the Republican leadership is this       month taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift       consideration and confirmation of consensus nominations        Working together  we confirmed five judges in one week earlier       this month  All of them could have been confirmed last month if       the Republican leadership had chosen to make progress instead of       picking a fight on a controversial nomination  I look forward to       working with the Republican leadership to schedule debate and       consideration of Andrew Guilford  who has been nominated to the       United States District Court for the Central District of       California    I  again  commend the Republican       Senate leadership for wisely passing over the controversial       nominations of William Gerry Myers III  Terrence W  Boyle  and       Norman Randy Smith  The Republican leadership is right to have       avoided an unnecessarily divisive debate over these nominations       that were reported on a party line vote    During the 17 months I was       Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate was under       Democratic control  we confirmed 100 of President Bushs       nominees  After today  in the last 17 months under Republican       control  the Senate will have confirmed 44  With this       nomination  the Senate has confirmed 22 judicial nominations       this year and equaled its total for all of last year     Judicial vacancies continue to       hover just under the 50 mark  but more than half       of these vacancies have no nominee  I urge the White House to       work with Senators from both parties to select nominees who can       be expeditiously considered and confirmed like Ms  Ikuta    I am particularly pleased that       they have chosen to turn to the nomination of Ms  Ikuta who        like Judge Milan Smith  is a nominee to the Ninth Circuit  Ms        Ikuta is a consensus nominee who can be easily confirmed        Unfortunately  the same cannot be said about another pending       Ninth Circuit nominee  Norman Randy Smith  In nominating Judge       Smith of Idaho for a lifetime appointment to the       Ninth Circuit  President Bush broke with the longstanding       precedent of replacing each circuit court vacancy with a nominee       from the same State  taking away a California seat on the Ninth       Circuit  Senators Feinstein and Boxer expressed their strong       opposition to this nomination in a January 30  2006  letter to       Chairman Specter    I have urged President Bush to       resolve this impasse by doing the right thing and nominating       Judge Smith not for a California seat but for the       vacancy created by the retirement of Judge Thomas G  Nelson from       Idaho  Regrettably  he has not done so   In their letter to Chairman       Specter  Senators Feinstein and Boxer expressed their concerns       that the confirmation of Judge Smith to the Ninth Circuit would       transfer a judgeship from California to Idaho        violating historical precedent  Judge Smith has been nominated       to fill the seat last occupied by Judge Stephen Trott  an       appointee of President Ronald Reagan from California  whose       retirement in 2004 created this vacancy  Judge Trott was from       California  where he had practiced for much of his career prior       to becoming a judge  In fact  he was nominated to fill the seat       of another Californian  Judge Joseph Sneed  At the time of his       nomination  while he worked at the Department of Justice in       Washington  the Senators from California were consulted and it       was understood to be a California seat   While an agreement can sometimes       be worked out among Senators and the White House to proceed with       someone from another State within the circuit first  so long as       the subsequent nomination comes from the first State  I do not       know of any precedent for shifting a circuit seat based on a       judges personal decision to change his or her personal       residence  If that were to become the rule  I expect that      Vermont might well benefit from judges initially       named as from New York or Connecticut recognizing the beauty and       lifestyle that Vermont has to offer and moving to the Green       Mountain State  But that is not the rule and has never been the       rule  Instead  we have worked out circuit court allocations       among the States based on tradition and history    Of course this White House has       attempted to steal a seat before  when it attempted to replace a       Maryland Fourth Circuit judge with someone from       Virginia  That attempt was unsuccessful  That was the       ill fated nomination of Claude Allen  a White House insider who       has since resigned his high ranking position and been arrested       on charges of retail theft   I am sensitive that every State       within a circuit should have at least one judge come from that       State  I supported legislation to ensure that and to afford      Hawaii a seat on the Ninth Circuit  I will defend       Idahos right to a seat on the Ninth Circuit  just as I defend       Vermonts right to a seat on the Second Circuit  However  Judge       Smith was not nominated to Idahos seat  If the President would       take my suggestion and renominate him to that Idaho vacancy        that would resolve this problem    Judge Ikuta will occupy a  California seat on the Ninth Circuit previously held by       Judge James R  Browning  Judge Browning was an extraordinary       jurist for whom the Ninth Circuits building in San Francisco       was recently named  She has a great tradition to uphold and I       wish her well  I congratulate her and her family on her       confirmation    While I am pleased that the Senate       will today confirm Ms  Ikuta to the Ninth Circuit  I note that       President Bush has yet to nominate a single Asian Pacific       American candidate to any of the dozens of vacancies that have       arisen on our federal circuit courts  Indeed  President Bush       has nominated only one Asian American candidate out of the       hundreds of federal judicial nominees he has named overall        There are many  many qualified Asian American attorneys and       judges  There is no quota or requirement that the federal bench       be diverse  but it is surprising that given the nominations he       has had the opportunity to make  which are approaching 300  I       can remember only a single Asian Pacific American judicial       nominee  and not one Asian Pacific American appellate nominee        This lack of diversity in nominees is quite a contrast with the       record of President Clinton  who appointed several Asian Pacific       nominees to the district and appellate courts  President       Clinton appointed Judge Denny Chinn  Judge George H  King  Judge       Anthony W  Ishii  and Judge Susan Oki Mollway to federal       district courts in New York  California and       Hawaii  and who elevated Judge A  Wallace Tashima to the United       States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  The current       President is more interested in naming White House insiders and       ideologues  In fact  he has nominated more people associated       with the Federalist Society than African American  Hispanic  and       Asian Pacific American nominees combined    With the retirement of Judge       Tashima from the Ninth Circuit  there are no Asian American       circuit court judges  Despite the opportunity presented with       two Supreme Court vacancies in the past year to make the       Nations highest court better reflect Americas diversity  the       President has made the Supreme Court less diverse  failing even       to fill the seat of the Courts first female Justice  Sandra Day       OConnor  with a qualified woman  Of course he was forced by       the extreme faction of his own party to withdraw his nomination       of his friend and counsel Harriet Miers before she even had a       hearing   President Clinton sought to add       diversity to the federal bench  This President is more focused       on guaranteed results and making sure certain circuits will be       stocked with those who tilt the courts to the right and rule in       his favor
