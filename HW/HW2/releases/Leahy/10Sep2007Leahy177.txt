       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Judicial Nominations    September 10  2007 The Senate continues as     we have all year to make progress filling judicial vacancies when the     White House will work with us  The nominations before us today     for lifetime appointments to the federal bench are William Lindsey     Osteen  Jr   for the Middle District of North Carolina  Martin Karl     Reidinger for the Western District of North Carolina  and Janis Lynn     Sammartino  for the Southern District of California  They each have the     support of both home state Senators  I thank Senators Dole and Burr and     Senators Feinstein and Boxer for working with us  I also thank Senator     Feinstein for chairing the hearing on these nominations  When we confirm the nominations we consider today      the Senate will have confirmed 29 nominations for lifetime appointments     by the middle of September this year  which is seven more than were     confirmed in all of 2005 when the Senate  with a Republican Chairman and     Republican majority  was considering the nominees of this Republican     President  It is 12 more confirmations than were achieved during the     entire1996 session when Republicans stalled consideration of President     Clintons nominations  The Judiciary Committee has already this year     reported out 33 lifetime appointments to the federal courts   It is a little known fact that during the Bush     Presidency  more circuit judges  more district judges and more total     judges have been confirmed while I have served as Judiciary Chairman     than during the tenures of either of the two Republican Chairmen working     with Republican Senate majorities  Taking into account todays confirmations  the     Administrative Office of the U S  Courts lists 46 judicial vacancies      The President has sent us only 24 nominations for these 46 remaining     vacancies  Twenty two of these remaining vacancies  almost half  have     no nominee  Of the 19 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to     be judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees for     eight of them  more than a third  Of the 16 circuit court vacancies      six  more than a third  are without a nominee  If the     President had worked with the Senators from Michigan  Rhode Island      Maryland  California  New Jersey  and Virginia  we could be in position     to make even more progress  Of the 22 vacancies without any nominee  the     President has violated the timeline he set for himself at least 13 times        13 have been vacant without so much as a nominee for more than 180     days  The number of violations may in fact be much higher since the     President said he would nominate within 180 days of receiving notice     that there would be a vacancy or intended retirement rather than from     the vacancy itself  We conservatively estimate that he also violated     his own rule 11 times in connection with the nominations he has made      That would mean that with respect to the 46 vacancies  the President is     out of compliance with his own rule more than half of the time   William L  Osteen  Jr   is a Partner at the     two person law firm of Adams  Osteen in Greensboro  North Carolina      where he has worked for his entire legal career  His practice focuses     primarily on federal criminal litigation and state civil litigation   Martin K  Reidinger is a Partner at the Asheville      North Carolina law firm of Adams  Hendon  Carson  Crow  Saenger  where     he has worked his entire 23 year legal career as a civil litigator  His     legal practice concentrates primarily in the areas of general business     litigation  land disputes  municipal matters  and employment law   Janis L  Sammartino is the Presiding Judge in the     Superior Court of San Diego County in California  For 12 years  she     served on the state trial court bench as a Municipal Court Judge in San     Diego  and she worked for 18 years as a Deputy City Attorney in the San     Diego City Attorneys Office   I congratulate the nominees and their families on     their confirmations today
