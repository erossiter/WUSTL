       Leahy  Passport Delays A Preview Of Even Worse To Come                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy  Passport Delays   A Preview Of Even Worse To Come   If Bush Administration Continues To Ignore   Problems With WHTI Border Crossing Plans  FRIDAY  June 8     Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    who has    led congressional efforts to fix flaws in plans to implement the Western    Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   said the passport processing backlogs    that have snarled thousands of Americans travel plans in recent weeks are a    harbinger of far worse chaos to come if the Bush Administration holds to its    current schedule for further deployment of the new border crossing scheme  Leahy and Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska  last fall pushed    through to enactment their legislation that gives the Departments of    Homeland Security and State up to 17 extra months  until June 1  2009  to    address WHTIs many problems  Their amendment sets out seven requirements    that must be certified to Congress before the program can be implemented     So far  the Bush Administration has maintained that it will not use and    does not need extra time to be ready  The current passport processing    backlog followed the Administrations recent launch of WHTIs first phase     for air travel in the Western Hemisphere  On Jan  1  the Administration    plans to begin a much larger phase  for those crossing borders by land or by    ferry  What weve been seeing is just a taste of the chaos    that is likely in January  said Leahy  Vermonters have been calling my    office for help  and we have been doing what we can  passport by passport     And the same thing is happening all across the country  Despite the Bush    Administrations repeated claims that the air rule was proceeding smoothly     the facts have clearly shown otherwise  There is another train wreck on the    horizon if these agencies continue pushing forward with full implementation    of WHTI before the necessary policies and procedures are in place to handle    the surge in applications and the lengthy delays that are in the offing     Theyve been warned again and again  and even this    passport debacle hasnt knocked sense into them  Leahy continued  In the    very same announcement about emergency steps to deal with this crisis  DHS    maintains the fiction that they will be ready to implement the biggest phase    of this program next January  They are recklessly risking the travel plans    of millions of Americans and the economies of scores of states and    communities
