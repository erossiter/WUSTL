       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Day Of Action To Restore Law And   Justice                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Day Of Action To Restore Law And Justice    Upper Senate Park    Capitol Hill    June 26  2007  Last year  Congress committed an historic     mistake by suspending the Great Writ of habeas corpus  not just for     those confined at Guantanamo  but for millions of legal residents in the     United States  I am working with Senator Specter  and several other     Senate and House members  some here today  to try to right this wrong     and restore a basic protection to American law   Today  we mark a Day of Action to     Restore Law and Justice  Restoring habeas corpus is a starting point     for doing just that  We need your help to be successful      Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last years Military     Commissions Act  Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World     War II  the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear     and a stain on Americas reputation in the world  This is a time of     testing  Future generations will look back to examine the choices we     made  the choices we made during a time when security too often is used     as a watchword to convince us to slacken our defense of liberty and the     rule of law      Habeas corpus guarantees an opportunity to go to court and challenge the     abuse of power by the Government  The Military Commissions Act rolled     back these protections by eliminating that right  permanently  for any     non citizen labeled an enemy combatant  even someone awaiting     determination of that status      The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the few hundred     detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay  and includes an estimated 12     million lawful permanent residents in the United States today  These     are people who work and pay taxes  people who abide by our laws and     should be entitled to fair treatment  Under this law  any of these     people can be detained  forever  without any ability to challenge their     detention in court      Since last fall  I have been talking about a nightmare scenario  It     involved a hard working legal permanent resident picked up on a tenuous     factual basis  who could be held with no ability to go to court to plead     his or her innocence  for years  for decades  forever   Last November  just after enactment of     these provisions  the Department of Justice confirmed this sad scenario     in a legal brief submitted in federal court in Virginia  They asserted     that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any     non citizen designated as an enemy combatant  even someone arrested and     held in the United States  without giving that person any ability to     challenge his detention in court      This is wrong  It is unconstitutional  It is un American      Top conservative thinkers like David Keene  head of the American     Conservative Union  who is here today  agree that this change betrays     centuries of legal tradition and practice      Perhaps most powerful for me at last months Senate hearing was the     testimony of Rear Admiral Donald Guter  who was working in his office in     the Pentagon on September 11  2001  and saw first hand the effects of     terrorism  Admiral Guter declared  As we limit the rights of human     beings  even those of the enemy  we become more like the enemy  That     makes us weaker and imperils our valiant troops  serving not just in     Iraq and Afghanistan  but around the globe   He was right  Whether youre a soldier      or a great and good nation like ours  its hard to defend the higher     ground by taking the lower road  The world knows what our enemies stand     for  The world also knows what this great and good country has tried to     stand for and live up to  in the best of times  and the worst of times   I hope all of you will join me in a     grassroots crusade to restore habeas rights  The elimination of basic     legal rights undermines  not strengthens  our ability to achieve     justice  It is from strength that America should defend our values and     our way of life  It is from the strength of our freedoms  our     Constitution  and the rule of law that we shall prevail   Thank you for coming out today
