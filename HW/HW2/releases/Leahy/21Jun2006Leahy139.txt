       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Changing Course In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             VIDEO           Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    Changing Course In Iraq    Senate Floor    June 21  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I intend to vote for the Levin Reed     amendment on Iraq  and I will also vote for the Kerry amendment  of     which I am a cosponsor   Both amendments are a step in the right direction  as they     finally begin the process of winding down what has been the most     poorly conceived  costly  and tragic misuse of United States     military power since Vietnam   We got into this war for reasons that bear little if any     resemblance to the reasons the White House gives for keeping our     troops there today at a cost of more than a billion dollars every     week   First it was weapons of mass destruction  There were none  Anyone     who urged continued monitoring by United Nations inspectors was     ridiculed by the White House as being naive   Then it was Saddam Hussein s supposed ties to al Qaida  which was     a blatant  calculated distortion  There was none  yet the Vice     President continues to say there was  Today  thanks to the policy of     the President and the rubber stamping by the Congress  Iraq and     Guantanamo are the rallying cry for terrorists around the world   Then it was because Saddam Hussein  who posed no threat to the     United States  was a brutal dictator  which he was  He was also     supported by the Reagan administration   That  however  is not a justification for a war that has cost the     lives and limbs of thousands of young Americans and tens of     thousands of Iraqi civilians   Winning against terrorism  like stopping the proliferation of     dangerous weapons  promoting peace between Arabs and Israelis  or     solving any other regional or global problem  requires the trust      the respect  the cooperation and the support of our allies   Unfortunately  these  too  are casualties of this war  Squandered     away   The damage that this reckless adventure has caused to our     reputation  particularly among the world s Muslims in countries like     Turkey  Jordan  Indonesia  Egypt and other traditional allies  is     incalculable   We have heard a lot of partisan rhetoric about cutting and     running  How easy it is to ask others to fight and die from the     safety and comfort of an office in Washington   How easy it is to vote for tax cuts and to self righteously wave     the flag  while our troops are scavenging for scraps of metal to     protect themselves from IEDs  They were sent to fight and die     without armor  by top Pentagon officials back home who proudly      dismissively and resolutely insisted they were ready  when they were     not   How easy it is to mislead the country  with patriotic     pronouncements by the President like   mission accomplished    or     that we are seeing the   last throes   of the insurgency   Contrary to the blatantly partisan and false attacks of the     President s political advisors  no one questions the threat that al Qaida     and other terrorist networks pose to the security of Americans and     to the people of other nations   No one questions that we need an effective strategy to combat it      The issue is how best to combat it   This administration has shown the world how not to do it      creating a lengthening catalogue of squander   You don t do it by starting a war with selective  faulty     intelligence  by dismissing thoughtful criticism as unpatriotic      without enough troops  with no plan to win the peace  by cavalierly     discounting the risks   You don t do it by repeatedly misleading the American people   You don t do it by creating and fueling a terrorism problem where     there was none   And you don t do it by shamelessly denigrating the Geneva     Conventions and the rights and values that distinguish us from the     terrorists   Unlike the war to defeat the Taliban  which continues to this day     and shows no signs of abating  the invasion of Iraq had nothing to     do with Osama bin Laden or the attacks on the World Trade Center and     the Pentagon   It has degraded our military in ways that will cost us     trillions  not billions  trillions of dollars to rebuild   It has left a legacy of thousands of maimed and crippled young     veterans with medical and other needs that they  their families  and     their communities will cope with for the rest of their lives  Our     troops have fought bravely in the harshest of conditions  They are     our constituents  They are the sons and daughters of our friends and     neighbors  They have carried out extraordinarily difficult missions      including tracking down and capturing Saddam Hussein and killing Abu     Musab al Zarqawi   They have sacrificed so much  We support them unequivocally      Democrats and Republicans  The question is how we can best support     them   This was to be the year of transition  That was what the Congress     voted last year  and what the President signed into law  Yet  the     Administration continues to simply stay the course  This course is     not in America s best interest   Iraq has a new constitution  It has had elections  It has a     democratically elected government   We have trained and equipped more than 100 000 Iraqi soldiers      It has been more than three years since the overthrow of Saddam     Hussein  More than 2 500 Americans have died  We have been there as     long as we were in World War II   The Iraqi people need to take responsibility for their own     country  It will not happen immediately  but both the Levin     amendment and the Kerry amendment move us toward that goal   I have cast over 12 000 votes in this Senate  I am as proud of my     vote against the open ended resolution that gave the President the     authority to invade Iraq as any I have cast in 32 years  It is time     for the Congress to change the course of a policy that has cost us     hundreds of billions of dollars that would have been far better     spent here at home  that has weakened our leadership  that is     dividing our country  and that has not made us safer   I yield back the remainder of my time
