       Opening Statement Of Patrick Leahy On The Conference Report On H R    3100  The USA PATRIOT Improvement And Reauthorization Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Opening       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee        On The Conference Report On       H R 3199      The       USA PATRIOT Improvement And       Reauthorization Act Of 2005        December 15  2005   A Need To       Balance Security and  Liberty     Earlier this week  I spoke about       how the world changed on  September 11  2001        Nearly 3 000 lives were lost on American soil  In the aftermath       of the attacks  Congress moved quickly to pass anti terrorism       legislation  The fires were still smoldering at Ground Zero       when the USA PATRIOT Act became law on October 30  2001  just       six weeks after that horrible day   Security and liberty are always in       tension in our free society  and especially so in the wake of       the attacks of 9 11  The American people today and the next       generations of citizens depend on their elected representatives       to strike the right balance  Preventing the needless erosion of       liberty and privacy requires constant vigilance and vision from       those who the people have entrusted with writing the laws         I negotiated many of the       provisions of the PATRIOT Act and am gratified to have been able       to add several checks and balances that were not contained in       the initial proposal  But as I said at the time  the PATRIOT       Act was not the final bill that I  or any of the sponsors  would       have written if compromise had been unnecessary     In reviewing the PATRIOT Act this       year  Congress once again tried to strike the right balance       between the security and the liberty that is the birthright of       every American  The public expects and deserves that we will       diligently fight to achieve that balance  Regrettably  the       PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that is now before the Senate       does not accomplish that goal  The bipartisan Senate bill        which the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate adopted       unanimously  reached a better balance  It was not a perfect       bill by any means and there were matters others insisted be       added to it that I hoped to improve in conference  The Senate       bill  like the PATRIOT Act itself  was a legislative compromise       achieved through good faith  bipartisan negotiations  Chairman       Specter and I were able to achieve a good enough bipartisan       compromise that we were able to gain the support of all the       Republicans and Democrats serving on the Judiciary Committee        including Senators who had sponsored the SAFE Act  It was       passed unanimously by the Senate last July    A Troubled       Conference  Delays  One Sided Discussion  In July  the Senate moved promptly       to appoint conferees  Unfortunately  the House did not act as       swiftly and we lost several months that could have been used to       seek common ground between the two versions of the bill  The       House delayed appointing conferees for several months and pushed       us up against the December 31st deadline from the       sunsets in the PATRIOT Act   It was only last month that the       House acted to name conferees  However  the conference met only       once and then only for opening statements  There was never a       working meeting of the conference in which positions were       debated and the conferees were able to offer improvements and       vote  There was no opportunity to debate this conference report       in a public meeting of conferees  and no opportunity to offer       improving amendments for consideration of the House Senate       conference and votes    Instead  there came a point where       Democratic conferees were shut out of the process and key       negotiations took place only among Republican conferees and the       Administration  The earlier  informal  bipartisan discussions       in which I had been involved had been promising  A good deal of       progress was being made  Much of what is good about the       conference report that is before us is owed to those       discussions  I thank Chairman Sensenbrenner for acknowledging       this week that we came to those discussions with good ideas for       accountability  for sunshine  for increased oversight and       judicial review  and for better standards by which to measure       the authorities being considered for the government        Tentative agreements were also being reached on removing a       number of extraneous provisions  particularly from the       House passed bill    The House version of the bill was       loaded with extras  many of which had no connection to       fighting terrorism  These provisions were tacked on to the bill       as floor amendments with little or no debate  Some raised very       serious concerns  For example  the original House bill made       significant procedural changes to Federal death penalty laws        including the opportunity for Federal prosecutors to convene a       new jury and effectively get a do over whenever they failed to       persuade a jury to impose a death sentence  This and other       controversial provisions were dropped or substantially modified       during those early days of bipartisan meetings   No one will be surprised to hear       that after Democrats were excluded  the negotiations took a turn       and resulted in a one sided draft conference report  The media       reported in banner headlines on November 17 that Congress had       arrived at a deal on the PATRIOT Act  In fact  that first draft       conference report was widely criticized by Members of Congress       on both the right and left sides of the political spectrum        Among the Republican Senate conferees there was not the minimum       support needed    Since that time  I have continued       to work with other Senate conferees to push for improvements  I       also reached out to the White House  I had many discussions       with Chairman Specter  I especially want to commend the other       Senate Democratic conferees  Senators Kennedy  Rockefeller and       Levin  They have been constructive throughout the process        which was made more difficult by the injection of needless       partisanship from the other side    Since November 17 our efforts has       led to significant improvements in the conference report  We       succeeded in making this a better bill than the earlier one       being insisted upon before Thanksgiving  The current bill       contains 4 year sunsets and no longer contains a provision that       would have made it a crime merely to disclose the receipt of a       national security letter  The ban against talking to a lawyer       without first notifying the government in connection with the       receipt of a national security letter was modified  Our       efforts have produced some improvements and better balance and       for that Americans will be better protected    A Bipartisan       Bid For More Time To Achieve A Better Bill    I believe that there is still more       that we can do and should do before finalizing this important       measure  There are more improvements that we can make and  I       believe  would have made in an open  bipartisan conference        There are more assurances we can include in the law so that the       American people can have greater confidence in the law  how it       will be utilized and how Congress and the courts will ensure       their rights are protected    This week  along with Senator       Sununu  Senator Craig  Senator Murkowski  Senator Hagel and       others  including my fellow Democratic conferees  I cosponsored       a bill to provide a short term extension of the expiring PATRIOT       Act provisions so that we can continue working to make       additional improvements to the law  I was disappointed to hear       that some are saying that unless this conference report is       passed in this form  they would stand by to allow the PATRIOT       Act provisions like that regarding sharing of important       information with our intelligence community to expire  Those of       us working to improve the bill are not taking that position        We want the best bill we can achieve and the greater protection       of Americans civil liberties    In an editorial just yesterday        USA Today chided the Bush Administration and its allies in       Congress for resist ing  calls for more meaningful protection       against invasion of privacy and abuse of civil liberties  It       supported the proposal that Senator Sununu and I have advanced       to extend the PATRIOT Act for three months to allow more time to       fix whats wrong   I am encouraged that FBI spokesman       are now endorsing the improvements we have been able to achieve       over the last month and which the Administration had initially       opposed  I know that together we can do better     I did not sign the conference       report in its current form  I understand that on Wednesday more       than 200 Members of the House  both Republicans and Democrats       voted to recommit this conference report and continue working to       improve it  I have spoken to Senators on both sides of the       aisle who would like to see us work out a better bill and       stronger protections for the American people  I agree and will       continue working to achieve that  I believe that the approach       Chairman Specter and I took of working together in a bipartisan       manner is the better approach  I think that had we followed       through with that approach we would have reached a better       balanced bill and the American people would have more confidence       in it    It is not just the provisions of       the law itself but the way they are administered and enforced       and the perception of the American people that matter  Let me       give you an example  As librarians and others across the       country raised concerns about the use of the business records       subpoena authority in the PATRIOT Act  Attorney General Ashcroft       could have defused the situation from the outset  Instead he       was secretive and scared the American people  He would not work       with or share information with the Congress  He claimed       variously that the provision had not been used with libraries       but then obfuscated when asked whether national security letters       were being used in connection with library records  He then       classified even the number of subpoenas served upon libraries        When that number was later unclassified  is there any wonder       that people remained concerned    He could and should have worked       with Congress to develop better standards and review and       oversight  This could have been done administratively or with a       legislative correction  Instead  he hoarded the information        raised suspicions and attacked anyone who raised questions about       how government power was being used   I want to express my appreciation        in particular to Chairman Specter  but also to Chairman       Sensenbrenner  I do not question their motivation  I respect       them  Together they have worked with us to correct several of       the problems and concerns about earlier drafts of this       conference report  As I have noted  Chairman Specter did speak       with me and we had many  many discussions about these issues       throughout this process  I appreciate his efforts  I regret       that we were not able to achieve more of what we had achieved       both the bipartisan process and some of the specifics of the       Senate passed bill   Both Chairman Sensenbrenner and       Chairman Specter share my interest in congressional oversight        and the conference report is a better bill because of it        Throughout the early informal  bicameral discussions and earlier       during the Senates bipartisan consideration of this matter  I       advanced several sunshine provisions to facilitate oversight       and ensure some measure of public accountability for how the       government uses its powers  The conference report contains most       of these proposals  including public reporting and comprehensive       audits on the use of two controversial PATRIOT Act       provisionsboth business record subpoenas and national security       letters   In addition to sunshine       provisions  I proposed that we retain the sunset mechanism that       worked so well in the original PATRIOT Act  Back in the fall of       2001  Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted       on 4 year sunsets for certain PATRIOT Act powers with great       potential to affect the civil liberties of Americans  Those       sunsets contributed greatly to congressional oversight  The       fact that they were included is the reason we are going through       this important review and renewal process now   This year  I proposed and the       Senate agreed to 4 year sunsets on three key provisions  The       House initially approved 10 year sunsets on two provisions        With steadfastness and hard work on the part of Senate conferees       we were able to achieve the 4 year sunsets that were in the       Senate bill  I commend  as well  Representative Conyers and the       House for passing an instruction to the House conferees to abide       by the 4 year sunsets  Despite strong majority support in both       bodies for 4 year sunsets and even after the House had voted to       instruct its conferees  it took weeks to persuade Republican       leaders in the House and the Administration to accept this       commonsense measure    The enhanced oversight provisions       and 4 year sunsets are positive features of the conference       report to be sure  but many problems remain  Let me touch       briefly on some of the flaws in this conference report that are       still troubling to Senators from both sides of the aisle and to       those concerned about civil liberties advocates from both the       right and the left          Weaker Checks on Secret Orders for Business Records  I will start with the conference       reports treatment of Section 215 of the PATRIOT       Act  the so called library provision  Under Section 215  the       government can obtain a secret order that compels access to       sensitive records of American citizens  and also imposes a       permanent gag order on the recipient   Before passage of the PATRIOT Act        there were two significant limitations on the FBIs power to       seize business records  First  it could be used only for a few       discrete categories of travel records  such as records held by       hotels  motels  and vehicle rental facilities  Second  the       legal standard for obtaining the order was demanding  The       government had to present specific and articulable facts giving       reason to believe that the subject of the investigation was a       foreign power or an agent of a foreign power     The PATRIOT Act did away with       these limitations  It both expanded what the FBI may obtain       with a Section 215 order and it lowered the       standard for obtaining it  Under current law  the government       need only assert that something    anything    is sought for an       authorized investigation to protect against terrorism or       espionage  and the judge will order its production  Under this       provision  what counts as an authorized investigation is within       the discretion of the Executive branch   The Senate  in its reauthorization       bill  rightly re established a significant check on this power        Under the Senate bill  relevance to an authorized investigation       is not enough  the government must also show some connection       between the records sought and a suspected terrorist or spy        This is a fundamental protection that would not hamstring the       government  but would do much to prevent overreaching in       government surveillance  Unfortunately  it was stripped out in       conference    The conference report is deficient       with respect to Section 215 in two other       respects  First  unlike the Senate bill  the conference report       does not permit the recipient of a Section 215 order to       challenge its automatic  permanent gag order  Courts have held       that similar restrictions violate the First Amendment  Second        the conference report allows the government to use secret       evidence to oppose a judicial challenge to a Section 215 order        At the governments request  the court must review any       government submission in secret  regardless of whether it       contains classified material  This has the potential to turn an       adversarial process into a kangaroo court  and will at a minimum       make it extremely difficult for the recipient of a Section 215       order to obtain meaningful judicial review that comports with       due process          Inadequate Safeguards For National Security Letters  The conference report also falls       short on its treatment of National Security Letters  or NSLs        These are  in effect  a form of secret administrative subpoena        They are documents issued by FBI agents without the approval of       a judge  grand jury  or prosecutor  They allow the agents to       obtain certain types of sensitive information about innocent       Americans simply by certifying its relevance to a terrorism or       espionage investigation  Like Section 215 orders        NSLs come with a permanent gag  The recipient of an NSL is       prohibited from telling anyone that he has been served   Proponents of this conference       report have made much of the fact that it creates an explicit       right to challenge an NSL in court  But even under current law        NSLs can be  and have been  successfully challenged  Indeed  in       recent litigation  the government has taken the position that       NSL recipients have an implied right to judicial review  Making       this right explicit makes sense  but it does not  in itself        offer significant protection   That is particularly so given the       one sided procedures set forth in the conference report  which       do not allow meaningful judicial review of NSLs gag order  The       conference report requires a court to accept as conclusive the       governments assertion that the gag is needed  unless the court       finds the government is acting in bad faith  This raises       serious First Amendment and due process concerns  I cannot       understand why anyone would insist on provisions that tie the       hands of Federal judges and further reduce our confidence in the       use of these tools  Yet  despite strong opposition to this       provision from the right and the left sides of the political       spectrum  House Republicans refused to strip it out     In an editorial this week  The       Washington Post noted the conference reports deficiencies with       respect to Section 215 orders and NSLs  but called       them not unsolvable  adding its hard to believe the       government is today getting much data through uses of these       powers that would be forbidden were they written more       accurately   Alternatively  Democratic       conferees proposed a 4 year sunset on the NSL authority  While       a sunset is no substitute for substantive improvement  it would       at least have ensured that Congress would revisit this issue in       depth  We would have had an opportunity  then  to study how       these judicial review procedures worked in practice  Again        House Republicans rejected this path to bipartisan compromise    Excessive Delay       For Sneak and Peak Searches The conference       reports treatment of the PATRIOT Acts so called sneak and       peek provision is another area of concern  Section 213 of the       PATRIOT Act authorized the government to carry out secret       searches in ordinary criminal investigations  Armed with a       Section 213 search warrant  FBI agents may enter and search a       home or office and not tell anyone about it until weeks or       months later     It is interesting to recall that       four years ago  the House Judiciary Committee took one look at       the Administrations original proposal for sneak and peak       authority and dropped it entirely from its version of the       legislation  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I       was able to make some significant improvements in the       Administrations proposal  but problems remained  In       particular  Section 213 says that notice may be delayed for a       reasonable period  a flexible standard that has been used to       justify delays of a year or more  Pre PATRIOT Act case law       stated that the appropriate period of delay was no more than 7       days   The Senate voted to replace this       standard with a basic 7 day rule  while permitting the       government to obtain additional 90 day extensions of the delay        The conference report sets a 30 day rule for the initial delay        more than three times what the Senate  and pre PATRIOT Act       courts  deemed appropriate  The shorter period would better       protect Fourth Amendment rights without in any way impeding       legitimate government investigations  The availability of       additional 90 day extensions means that a shorter initial time       frame should not be a hardship on the government    Controversial       Extras  This conference report also is       loaded with extraneous provisions that have nothing to do with       the expiring PATRIOT Act authorities  or even with terrorism         I am particularly concerned that       the conference report modifies habeas corpus law  a highly       controversial move that is wholly improper to consider in this       context  The changes to habeas added here at the insistence of       a small number of Republican conferees have nothing to do with       terrorism or even more general tools of federal enforcement        These changes were not included in the PATRIOT Act       reauthorization bill of either the House or the Senate  They       were added late in the conference process  after all Democratic       conferees were shut out of discussions  They received no       serious consideration by either bodys Judiciary Committee  and       have been strongly opposed by the U S  Judicial Conference and       others  And yet  these modifications could have       very serious consequences  possibly unintended consequences        in habeas cases that are already pending in California and other       States   The conference report includes a       version of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005        a bill that  like the habeas provisions  is extraneous to the       PATRIOT Act reauthorization  The version in the conference       report contains troubling provisions that I wish could have been       debated fully before we were forced to vote on them in this       context  A portion of the bill lowers the threshold of the       amount of money or drugs necessary for a defendant to qualify as       a kingpin and to therefore be subject to a mandatory life       sentence  This is an excessively harsh sentence for a pool of       people who are not truly drug kingpins  No one has sympathy for       producers and dealers of methamphetamines  but the punishment       must fit the crime  and in these cases  mandatory life is       disproportionate     During early negotiations on the       conference report  I fought to strike title II of the House       bill  which included provisions that vastly expanded the federal       death penalty and removed important protections for the       criminally accused  I already noted one particularly       problematic provision  which allowed federal prosecutors a       do over whenever they failed to persuade a jury to impose a       death sentence  Another provision was   designed to carve out a category of homicides that would be       eligible for capital punishment despite the fact that the       defendant did not himself kill  intend to kill  or knowingly       create a grave risk of death  Yet another provision  would have substantially narrowed the jurys power to       consider  as a reason not to impose the death penalty  the fact       that other equally guilty offenders in the same case were       escaping such punishment  These extraneous and ill considered       provisions were ultimately dropped from the conference report        for which we should all be grateful   House Republicans did  however        insist on keeping other death penalty provisions in the       conference report  The most objectionable of these will revive       a small group of pending death penalty prosecutions for aircraft       hijacking murders committed in the 1970s and 80s        Specifically  it is designed to overrule the district court       decision in United  States v  Safarini        which struck the death penalty for a 1986 hijacking offense on       the grounds that the Federal Death Penalty Procedures Act of       1994 could not be retroactively applied to a pre 1994 crime  at       least absent clear Congressional intent to do so      To my knowledge  Congress has       never enacted death penalty legislation intended to allow the       execution of a tiny number of known offenders for crimes they       are alleged to have committed from one to three decades       previously  Whether the government can ultimately persuade the       courts that this does not violate the letter of the Ex Post       Facto and Bill of Attainder clauses  it certainly violates their       spirit  It is telling that the Department of Justice  in its       testimony before the House Judiciary Committee  strongly       recommended adding in a severability clause  in case this       provision was ultimately held invalid by a court of law  I       share the Departments skepticism regarding the       constitutionality of this wrong headed provision  and deeply       regret its inclusion in the conference report    The Way Forward  The reauthorization of the PATRIOT       Act must have the confidence of the American people  I believe       what we passed in the Senate would have the confidence of the       American people  This conference report would not   Congress should not rush ahead to       enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our       power to extend  We owe it to the American people to get this       right   The bipartisan bill I introduced       with Senator Sununu and others to provide a three month       extension for the expiring provisions of the original PATRIOT       Act will give us the time to achieve the best bill for all       Americans   This is a vital debate  It should       be  These are vital issues to all Americans  If a brief       extension is needed to produce a better bill that would better       serve all of our citizens then by all means  let us take that       time   We should not finalize the       conference report on the PATRIOT Act without fully addressing       the privacy and civil liberties concerns that remain in the       conference report  It is our job in Congress to work as hard as       it takes to protect both the security and the freedoms of the       people we represent   A nation built on freedom  as      America is  can do better  and if we work       together  we will do better
