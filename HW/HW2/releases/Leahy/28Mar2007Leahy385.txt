       Committee Chairmen Leahy  Conyers Push For White House Cooperation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Committee Chairmen Leahy       Conyers Push For White House Cooperation WASHINGTON        Wednesday  March 28    Today  House and Senate Judiciary Committee      Chairmen John Conyers  Jr   D MI  and Patrick Leahy  D VT  sent a      letter to the White House to encourage continued negotiations in      their ongoing U S  Attorney oversight investigations  The Chairmen      wrote that the White House has not produced documents previously      offered and has not been forthcoming in efforts to negotiate      interviews with White House officials  When we met      recently  each of us agreed to continue to talk and keep the lines      of communication open  the Chairmen wrote  Nevertheless  we have      not heard from you  It is now more than a week since the last set of      meetings and almost a week since you received March 23rd letters      from each of us inviting the White House to agree to provide the      investigating committees of the Congress  both House and Senate       with access to witnesses  information and relevant documents  The Chairmen      detailed their areas of interest in which the White House has failed      to respond  including  communication between the White House and the      Justice Department  further discussions on interviews with White      House officials  internal White House documents  and  newly      discussed communication that may have taken place under political      email addresses regarding official government business  Regarding document      production  the letter states  We hope that you will reconsider      your all or nothing approach with respect to documents you      identified that you would be willing to provide    In addition  we      have become increasingly sensitized over the last several days to      the White House staff wearing several hats and using Republican      National Committee and campaign e mail addresses   Accordingly  we      trust that you will be collecting and producing e mails and      documents from all e mail accounts  addresses and domains and that      you are not artificially limiting your production to the official      White House e mail and document retention system  On interviews with      White House officials  Senators Hatch and Sessions suggested that      the Committee proceed with preliminary interviews of the White House      senior staff and then consider whether to authorize subpoenas and      compel testimony  Given the terms included in your March 20 letter       that seemed to us disingenuous  to appear to accept your limited      proposal and then ultimately to ignore the limitation that there be      no follow up testimony to the off the record interview you      demanded  Both committees have      authorized subpoenas for White House and Justice officials  as well      as documents  Neither Chairman has issued subpoenas  as the      committees continue to focus first on negotiation and cooperation      with all parties involved as they move forward with the      investigations   Text of the letter      is below  A      is also available    March 28  2007  Fred Fielding  Esq      Counsel to the President     The White House     1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington       D C  20500  Dear Mr  Fielding   When we met recently  each of us      agreed to continue to talk and keep the lines of communication      open  Nevertheless  we have not heard from you  It is now more      than a week since the last set of meetings and almost a week since      you received March 23rd letters from each of us inviting      the White House to agree to provide the investigating committees of      the Congress  both House and Senate  with access to witnesses       information and relevant documents    As we have previously noted  political      influence in federal law enforcement is a serious matter  We need      to get to the bottom of what happened  why  how and who was involved      in the mass firings of United States attorneys  the criteria used to      retain U S  Attorneys  and possible misstatements to Congress  The      fact that recent disclosures have called into question previous      statements made by the Attorney General and a high ranking      Department of Justice official asserted her fifth amendment rights      magnifies the need for a prompt  thorough  and fair investigation   Allow us to share another step you      might consider  At the most recent Senate Judiciary Committee      business meeting  Senators from both sides of the aisle made a      number of statements seeking White House cooperation  Senator      Specter  the Committees Ranking Republican  said that despite what      you  the President and the Presidents spokesman have been saying       the President was  in fact  willing to negotiate  Senators Hatch      and Sessions suggested that the Committee proceed with preliminary      interviews of the White House senior staff and then consider whether      to authorize subpoenas and compel testimony  Given the terms      included in your March 20 letter  that seemed to us disingenuous  to      appear to accept your limited proposal and then ultimately to ignore      the limitation that there be no follow up testimony to the      off the record interview you demanded    We do believe your willingness to      provide documents is worth pursuing  We hope that you will      reconsider your all or nothing approach with respect to documents      you identified that you would be willing to provide  We urge you to      provide all relevant documents without delay  The White House      documents to and from the Department of Justice and with third      parties  such as Republican state party officials  should be      provided without delay  You have acknowledged your willingness to      provide those to us previously   That would narrow the dispute over      White House documents to those you refer to as internal  We      believe that these are important to our investigation  as well  For      example  if there is a memorandum or an e mail from Karl Rove to      Harriet Miers initiating consideration of firing some United States      attorneys in order to impede an investigation  that would be very      important for the Committees to know  Thus  while we do not agree      with you that what you describe as internal White House documents      should be off limits  we recognize that you view them as a separate      category and you disagree whether those should be shared with the      Committees  Recognizing we have a dispute over those documents      should not delay the Committees receiving the other documents that      you indicate you are willing to provide    If we can narrow our dispute  we may      then be able to work through it by agreeing  for example  that we      initially designate as Committee Confidential what you refer to as      internal White House documents  We could then consider a process      by which we would consult with you prior to making them public        In addition  we have become      increasingly sensitized over the last several days to the White      House staff wearing several hats and using Republican National      Committee and campaign e mail addresses  In fact  as Chairman      Waxman has recently pointed out  congressional investigations       including this one  have uncovered evidence that White House staff      have used nongovernmental e mail accounts to conduct official      government business    As Chairman Waxman has also pointed      out  many exchanges between Jack Abramoff and White House officials      were conducted via non government e mail accounts  Indeed  he quotes      exchanges that suggest that Mr  Abramoff and White House officials      were using the nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid      creating a White House record of the communications     We hope you agree that such sleight of      hand should not be used to circumvent and compromise the      comprehensiveness of our investigation  In this matter we have      already received a document showing communications between D  Kyle      Sampson  the Attorney Generals former chief of staff  and J  Scott      Jennings  the Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director      of Political Affairs at the White House  who you offered for an      off the record interview   in which Mr  Jennings does not use his      White House e mail account but an e mail account at the Republican      National Committee designated gwb43 com  There is another       similar use of a nongovernmental e mail account in an exchange      including Mr  Jennings and Monica Goodling  the Justice Department      official who was the White House liaison and who recently invoked      her privilege against self incrimination    Accordingly  we trust that you will be      collecting and producing e mails and documents from all e mail      accounts  addresses and domains and that you are not artificially      limiting your production to the official White House e mail and      document retention system   Again  we urge you to continue to work      with us so that we can achieve our mutual goal of getting to the      truth in this matter    Sincerely      PATRICK LEAHY       JOHN CONYERS       JR      Chairman       Chairman     Senate Judiciary Committee       House Judiciary Committee   cc  The Hon  Arlen      Specter      The Hon  Lamar Smith
