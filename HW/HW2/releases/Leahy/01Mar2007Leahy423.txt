       Senate Judiciary Panel Approves Bipartisan Court Security Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Senate Judiciary Panel      Approves Bipartisan Court Security Bill  WASHINGTON  Thursday       March 1   The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday approved a      bipartisan bill to strengthen and expand protections for judges and      their families in the wake of increasingly violent threats  The      Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 would create new criminal      penalties for threatening judges and their families and provide      additional resources for keeping judges and law enforcement officers      safe    Threats against our      judges and their families put the men and women who serve in our      justice system at risk and are a repugnant assault on our      independent judiciary  said Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman      of the panel and chief sponsor of the bill  We owe it to our      judges to better protect them and their families from violence and      to ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary to do their      vital and difficult jobs   The Court Security Bill      is a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Senators Arlen Specter  R Pa         the panels Ranking Member  Richard Durbin  D Ill    Edward Kennedy       D Mass    Orrin Hatch  R Utah   Charles Schumer  D N Y    John      Cornyn  R Texas   and Benjamin Cardin  D Md    Rep  John Conyers       D  Mich    the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee       introduced a companion bill in the House earlier this year  That      bipartisan bill  sponsored by Chairman Conyers  Rep  Robert C       Bobby Scott  D Va    and Rep  Louie Gohmert  R Texas   was      reported out of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week        Key provisions of the      Senate measure include    New criminal penalties for       the misuse of restricted personal information to threaten to       seriously harm judges  their families or other individuals       performing official duties   Enhancing penalties for       tampering with or retaliating against witnesses   New resources for state       courts to improve security for state and local courts   Provisions extending life       insurance benefits to bankruptcy  magistrate and territorial       judges     The bill was first      introduced in 2005 after a spate of increasingly violent threats      against judges and their families  including the tragic murder of      the family of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago  That bill passed the      Senate last Congress  but not the House   Below      is Chairman Leahys statement from the committees business meeting      earlier today    Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On S  378  Court Security Improvement Act of 2007     Executive Business Meeting     March 1  2007  One bill on our agenda today  the      Court Security Improvement Act of 2007  is legislation that should      have been enacted after it passed the Senate last year  This is a      bipartisan measure I introduced along with Senator Specter  the      Majority Leader  Senator Durbin and other Members of this      Committee  House Judiciary Chairman Conyers introduced an identical      measure in the House also with bipartisan support  We hoped to send      a signal with our bicameral  bipartisan introduction that we      intended to move quickly to complete action on our work and increase      legal protections for the Judiciary and their families  Despite our      remarkable hearing with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy two      weeks ago  this bill was held over before the recess  The Committee      should complete our work and pass out this bill without delay   Justice Kennedys testimony regarding      issues of judicial security and independence was a welcome reminder      of the need to provide resources and protections crucial to the      preservation of the independence of our federal Judiciary so that it      can continue to serve as a bulwark protecting individual rights and      liberty    We received another much more terrible      reminder two years ago when the mother and husband of Judge Joan      Lefkow of Chicago were murdered in their home  Our efforts gained      increased urgency after this tragedy  Judge Lefkows courageous      testimony in our hearing on judicial security in May 2005 is      something none of us will forget   Regrettably  these reminders come all      too often  as with the shooting last summer of a State judge in      Nevada provided another terrible reminder of the vulnerable position      of our Nations state and federal judges  We cannot tolerate or      excuse violence against judges  and no one should seek to minimize      its corrosive damage to our system  That is why we should rise to      the occasion without further delay or distraction and not only      report  but pass and enact the Court Security Improvement Act   As we discussed in our hearing  the      independent Judiciary faces many and varied types of threats  I      take all of these threats seriously  but none more than threats to      judges physical security  institutional security and independence      by rhetorical attack by some affiliated with the political      branches    The kind of heated rhetoric we have      seen lately to describe judges is not just misguided  it is      irresponsible and dangerous  In the last few years  even as judges      have come under physical attack  we have seen federal judges      compared to the Ku Klux Klan  called the focus of evil and in one      unbelievable instance referred to as a threat more serious than a      few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings  A prominent      television evangelist even proclaimed the federal judiciary the      worst threat American has faced in 400 years  worse than Nazi      Germany  Japan and the Civil War  Perhaps most regrettably  we      have seen some in Congress threaten the mass impeachments of judges      with whom they disagree and even suggest that violence against      judges has been brought on by their own rulings   Justice Sandra Day OConnor has spoken      out in recent years about the danger of this rhetoric  Like Justice      OConnor  Justice Kennedy urged us to find a more civil discourse      about judges and their decisions  This high pitched rhetoric should      stop  not just for the sake of our judges  but also for the      independence of the Judiciary  Judicial fairness and independence      are essential if we are to maintain our freedoms  During the last      few years it has been the courts that have acted to protect our      liberties and our Constitution  We ought to be protecting them       physically and institutionally    We can take a significant step by      reporting the Court Security Improvement Act today  This bill      responds to the needs expressed by the federal Judiciary for a      greater voice in working with the United States Marshals Service to      determine their security needs  It would enact new criminal      penalties for the protections of judges  their families  and others      performing official duties  expand resources available to state      courts for their security  and provide additional protections for      law enforcement officers  Included are provisions that have passed      the Senate several times extending and expanding to family members      the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact certain      information from a federal judges mandatory financial disclosure       This expired redaction authority was used in circumstances in which      the release of the information could endanger the filer or the      filers family    Our Nations founders knew that      without an independent Judiciary to protect individual rights from      the political branches of government  those rights and privileges      would not be preserved  The courts are the ultimate check and      balance in our system of government in times of heated political      rhetoric  We need to do our part to ensure that the dedicated women      and men of our judiciary have the resources  security  and      independence necessary to fulfill their crucial responsibilities       Our independent Judiciary is the envy of the world  and we must take      care to protect it
