       Leahy  Cornyn Introduce Bill To Step Up Enforcement Of Laws That Protect   America s Intellectual Property                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Leahy  Cornyn Introduce Bill   To Step Up Enforcement Of Laws   That Protect Americas       Intellectual Property      Judiciary       Committee Holds Hearing       To Explore Governments Anti Piracy Efforts      WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Nov  7         Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and       Committee member Sen  John Cornyn  R Texas  Wednesday       to strengthen U S        government efforts to combat copyright infringement and       counterfeiting at home and abroad  The Judiciary Committee       Wednesday also held a hearing to examine current enforcement       efforts  Improving enforcement is a central component of       Leahys intellectual property agenda this year       The Intellectual Property       Enforcement Act introduced Wednesday by Leahy and Cornyn would       strengthen law enforcement capabilities and resources in       thwarting copyright theft  The bill would give civil copyright       enforcement powers to the Attorney General and the Department of       Justice  and it would authorize additional funding to       investigate and prosecute intellectual property crimes involving       computers and the Internet  The bill also requires the Federal       Bureau of Investigation to assign a minimum of 10 agents to work       on intellectual property crimes  and it classifies both the       importation and exportation of pirated works as infringement       Copyright infringement silently       drains Americas economy and undermines the talent  creativity       and initiative that are a great source of strength to our       nation  said Leahy  When we protect intellectual property       from copyright infringement  we protect our economy and our       ideas  Im pleased to join with Senator Cornyn as we launch our       examination of how we can better protect those ideas and       products from illegal piracy  infringement and theft       This bill takes important steps       to protect American innovators and consumers  said Cornyn  By       working together in a bipartisan manner  weve made significant       strides to strengthen and safeguard intellectual property rights       in Texas and throughout America  This latest effort builds on       that strong record  Our bill gives the law enforcement       community the additional tools needed to meet the growing threat       to Americas innovation economy posed by intellectual property       pirates and counterfeiters  I hope my colleagues will support       it       The Judiciary Committee Wednesday       also heard from a panel of government witnesses who testified       about federal enforcement efforts  Also testifying Wednesday       was Sen  Evan Bayh  D Ind    who earlier this year introduced       legislation with Sen  George Voinovich  R Ohio  to restructure       the current inter agency intellectual property enforcement       structure                                        A PDF of the bill is                 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENFORCEMENT       ACT OF 2007      SECTION BY SECTION      Sec  1  Short       Title  Cites the short title of the bill as       the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007       Sec  2        Authorization of Civil Copyright Enforcement by Attorney       General  Allows the Attorney General to       commence a civil action against any person who engages in       conduct constituting an offense under section 506  The       Attorney General therefore is limited in this new authority to       bringing civil actions for conduct that would currently qualify       as a crime        If the Attorney General is       successful in a suit under this Act  the defendant may be fined       an amount equal to the amount that would be awarded under 18       U S C 3663 a  1  B   the criminal restitution statute  Thus  the       civil penalties that could be imposed are no greater than the       monetary penalties that would be imposed at the end of a       criminal proceeding        The language of this section is       substantively similar to the PIRATE Act        Sec  3        Improved Investigative and Forensic Resources for Enforcement of       Laws Related to Intellectual Property Crimes        Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to dedicate a       minimum of 10 agents to work with the Department of Justice on       intellectual property crimes  Also requires the assignment of       one agent located in Budapest and one agent located in Hong       Kong  to assist in the coordination of enforcement of       intellectual property laws between the United States and foreign       nations     Finally  the section requires       implementation of a comprehensive training program focused on       intellectual property crimes  and the formation of an Organized       Crime Task Force with directions to study organized crime       relating to intellectual property theft   12 million is       authored for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011         Section 4        Additional Funding For Resources to Investigate and Prosecute       Criminal Activity Involving Computers        Authorizes an additional  10 million for the FBI and DOJ to hire       and train additional agents and prosecutors to investigate and       prosecute criminals for intellectual property crimes        Section 5        Registration in Civil Infringement Actions        Amends section 411 of the Copyright Act  First  it amends 411       to apply only to civil infringement actions  as opposed to the       current  more general infringement actions       Second  and more importantly        section 2 inserts into 411 a harmless error provision  411       provides that no action for infringement of copyright in any       United States work shall be instituted until registration of       copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title        In such actions  certificates of registration provide prima       facie evidence of copyright ownership  Section 2 preserves the       validity of certificates of registration  even if the       certificate contains inaccurate information  unless the       inaccurate information was included intentionally and  had the       inaccuracy been known  the registration would have been       refused        Section 6        Civil Remedies for Infringement  Amends       section 503 of the Copyright Act  which concerns the seizing of       documents and records in civil infringement actions  In       addition to seizing materials used in copyright violation        courts may now also order records documenting the manufacture        sale  or receipt of things involved in such a violation        Section 3 amends impounding       provisions in both the Copyright and the Lanham Act in allowing       for courts to enter into appropriate protective orders with       respect to discovery       Section 7        Criminal Infringement  Amends the forfeiture       provisions of section 506 b  and 509 a  to refer to a general       forfeiture provision added in this measure        Section 8        Importation and Exportation  Amends 17 U S C        602 a  by adding exportation to the provision  thus importation      or exportation of       pirated works constitutes an infringement under sections 501 and       506        Section 9        Defining Terms Related to Circumvention of Copyright Protection       Systems  Defines the terms traffic in and       financial gain in the DMCA  17 U S C  1201   The definition       for financial gain can be found in 17 U S C  101        Traffic in means to transport        transfer  or otherwise dispose of  to another  for purposes of       commercial advantage or private financial gain  or to make        import  export  obtain control of  or possess  with intent to so       transport  transfer  or otherwise dispose of       Section 10        Forfeiture Under Economic Espionage Act        Amends criminal forfeiture language in 18 U S C  1834 in order       to conform to the new forfeiture provision added in this       measure       Section 11        Trafficking in Counterfeit Labels  Illicit Labels  or       Counterfeit Documentation or Packaging For Works That Can Be       Copyrighted  Amends forfeiture language in 18       U S C  2318 in order to conform to the new forfeiture provision       added in this measure       Section 12        Unauthorized Recording of Motion Pictures        Amends forfeiture language in 18 U S C  2319B in order to       conform to the new forfeiture provision added in this measure       Section 13        Trafficking in Counterfeit Goods or Services        Amends forfeiture language in 18 U S C  2320 in order to conform       to the new forfeiture provision added in this measure       Section 14        Forfeiture  Destruction  and Restitution        Creates a new forfeiture section  18 U S C  2323  governing       civil and criminal forfeiture for offenses committed under       section 506 or 1204 of title 17  or section 2318  2319  2319A        2319B  or 2320  or chapter 90  of title 18        For civil forfeitures  property       subject to forfeiture includes property used to facilitate the       commission of an offense and property derived from any proceeds       obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the commission of       an offense  At the conclusion of forfeiture proceedings  the       court shall order that any property be destroyed unless       otherwise requested by an agency of the United States       For criminal forfeitures  any       proceedings shall be governed by section 413 of the       Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970  At the       conclusion of forfeiture proceedings  the court shall order that       any property be destroyed unless otherwise requested by an       agency of the United States  Convicted persons must pay       restitution to any victim of the offense       Section 15        Technical Amendments                             Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  On Introduction Of The      Intellectual Property Enforcement Bill Of 2007  November 7  2007         I am pleased to introduce the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act      of 2007  Congress is charged to promote the progress of science      and useful arts  and part of promotion is protection  This      legislation will enhance existing intellectual property enforcement      laws  provide more resources to combat infringement  and harmonize      copyright and trademark laws  I thank Senator Cornyn for joining me      in this effort  which is a high priority of mine  and also of the      creative communities and industries across the county                 Each year  counterfeiting and copyright infringement cost the U S       economy billions of dollars  The International Anti Counterfeiting      Coalition estimates that counterfeiting and piracy cost American      businesses  250 billion a year  and hundreds of thousands of jobs      as well  Clearly  IP theft is big business  and that can devastate      small businesses  No one knows this better than Vermont companies      such as Hubbardton Forge  Vermont Teddy Bear Company  and Burton      Snowboards  Each of these companies  and many others like them      across the nation  invests time  money  and effort in the      development of new products  When their products are infringed  it      devalues the product and threatens the company                Senator Cornyn and I have heard from a myriad of interested parties      about the importance of protecting intellectual property  and have      seen many enforcement proposals  The legislation we introduce today      will serve as the core of our legislative effort this year  It will      start the process of considering how to ensure that our enforcement      laws are up to the task  and that the necessary resources are in      place to enforce them  Other Senators have introduced legislation      to address these issues  and the Department of Justice and others      have suggested legislative language  These are all helpful to the      debate  and I expect there will be more to come  Introduction of      the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007 is the beginning      of this important effort               The centerpiece of the bill we introduce today gives the Department      of Justice the ability to bring civil actions against copyright      infringers  Punishment should fit the crime  and a civil action is      often more appropriate to the wrong being done in such cases than is      criminal prosecution  This concept has passed the Senate on three      separate occasions  as the PIRATE Act  Next  this bill adds      resources for agents to combat infringement  It does not matter how      strong our laws are  if there are not enough agents  or if our      agents do not have the proper expertise to investigate and prosecute      crimes  piracy will flourish and harm our economy  Third  this bill      allows for harmless errors on copyright registration forms       Copyright registration should not be voided by innocently checking      the wrong box or misspelling a word on a form  Finally  this bill      harmonizes the forfeiture provisions in the copyright and trademark      statutes                By enacting well balanced enforcement laws  we can protect both the      creators and the consumers of intellectual property  It is      impossible to put a price tag on creativity  but we must do all we      can to protect the fruits of creative labor            I ask unanimous consent that      the full bill text be included in the Record                                 Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee  Hearing On Examining U S        Government Enforcement      Of Intellectual Property Rights  November 7  2007     Intellectual property        copyrighted works  trademarked goods  and patented inventions        fuels the engine that drives the U S  economy  Intellectual       property reportedly accounts for 40  of our nations exports        Just as importantly  we consume IP voraciously here at home  IP       is the medicine that cures us  the movies that thrill us  the       music that inspires us  the software that empowers us  the       technology that aids us  It is everywhere in our lives  and it       is evermore important in our economy       Unfortunately  the piracy and       counterfeiting of intellectual property has reached       unprecedented levels  Copyright infringement alone costs the       U S  economy at least  200 billion and approximately 750 000       jobs each year  Such theft is unacceptable  but counterfeiting       goods not only infringe IP rights  they can endanger our health       and safety  Fake drugs that look just like the real thing        tainted infant formula sold to unsuspecting parents  electrical       appliances with shoddy insulation  automobile parts that fail       under stress  such counterfeit goods are proliferating  and are       often difficult to distinguish from their real  and safe        counterparts       I have worked for years both to       strengthen our existing laws and to give our law enforcement       agents the necessary tools to combat infringement  In the last       Congress  we passed the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured       Goods Act  which expanded the prohibition on trafficking in       counterfeit goods to include trafficking in labels or similar       packaging with knowledge that a counterfeit mark had been       applied to those goods  I have regularly authored amendments to       the State Departments appropriations bill to provide millions       to the Department in order to send staff overseas to       specifically combat piracy in countries that are not members of       the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development  or       OECD  Just this morning  I reintroduced  with my Judiciary       Committee colleague Senator Cornyn  the PIRATE Act  This       legislation is a simple bill that would give the Department of       Justice the authority to prosecute copyright violations as civil       wrongs  The PIRATE Act has passed the Senate on three separate       occasions  this should be the Congress in which it becomes law       In the current Congress  there are       a number of other bills designed to combat intellectual property       infringement  Senator Bayh  who has joined us here today        introduced a bill focused on interagency coordination on       intellectual property  Senator Biden recently introduced       omnibus crime legislation that includes many provisions       suggested by the Department of Justice  No doubt others will       join the effort  as we get the legislative conversation started       on the critical issue of law enforcement in the realm of       intellectual property       This issue is too important to be       addressed piecemeal  In order to effect the greatest change  we       must examine enforcement efforts from the top down  Helping us       do so is our second panel today  I look forward to hearing from       these distinguished government officials about the current state       of enforcement  and what needs to be improved to protect our       creators and innovators  as well as our economy
