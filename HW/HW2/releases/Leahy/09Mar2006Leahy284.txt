       Leahy Questions Rumsfeld About Defense Department Intelligence Gathering   Programs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy Questions      Rumsfeld About     Defense Department Intelligence Gathering Programs     March 9  2006  Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt   questioned Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld Thursday      at a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee  Leahy      has written to Rumsfeld extensively about the Defense Department s      TALON Reporting System  Press reports in December 2005      indicated that intelligence was being gathered on Vermont residents      through the TALON program  Below is a list of correspondence      between Leahy and Rumsfeld  followed by a transcript of Leahy s      questioning at the March 9 hearing               Transcript      March 9  2006  Senate Appropriations Committee       Hearing      Budget Request For Operations In Iraq And Afghanistan  LEAHY Thank       you  Mr  Chairman And I m glad we re having this hearing I m       finding it very interesting  both the things requested and some       of the things not requested  I notice in the       supplemental there are some areas    well  the agencies       requested money that s not in there They mention first the       request  inaudible   60 million to continue what I believe is a       very cost effective program in Iraq  USAID s Community Action       Program  Four U S  NGOs are doing it Only  15 million       each In fact  one was named after a young woman who was killed       there  Marla Rezeka  ph   And they restore       basic services  they create jobs What I ve been told by       commanders in the field  these funds have been extraordinarily       helpful to our military over there  Now  I want to       help Iraq s provincial councils  but this is some area that we       ought to be looking at If we re going to shut down programs        let s pick some of the ones that are not working    and I can       give you a list of those    not those that have been a success       and the Iraqi people appreciate  Mr  Chairman        I ll work with you and Senator McConnell to try to find the       money needed to continue this   LEAHY        And  secondly  Liberia and Haiti  We ve talked about that        They ve recently elected new leaders  have daunting challenges        Secretary Rice  you and the first lady were in Liberia for the       inauguration of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  the first woman African       head of state I think I shared the pride you had in that         But I look at the supplemental        There s only a small amount for returning refugees  I think we       should be doing more to help that government  It costs us an       awful lot of money because of the failures in the last       government  inaudible  avoid those failures     And  of course  Secretary Rumsfeld        you mentioned the cost effectiveness of the U N  peacekeeping       mission in Haiti  but this supplemental has no money in it for       that peacekeeping mission    even though you read the reports       out of Haiti  it s obviously needed    The supplemental does include  51       million for refugees  In FY 2006  the administration requested        893 million  Congress provided only  782 million  So we re low       on that  not just in Sudan  but in many other countries around       the world    I mention these as areas    you       know  we get the request  a lot of money is lumped out that       everybody knows we need  and then the Congress has to figure out       how to find the money    Secretary Rumsfeld  you did       mention the limitation aid to the Indonesian military  Of       course  during that period  they were behaving sort of like a       criminal enterprise    all types of corruption and killings of       political dissidents and so on  If this country stands for       something    I believe it does    we have to show that we do       have limitations on help we will give    Mr  Secretary  when you came in       here this morning  I mentioned something to you    or  I ve       written several letters  I ve gotten back several very nice       form letters  but didn t answer any questions  It s about the       Talon program    We find from the press  not from       our own government  that a number of peaceful protest groups        like the Quakers   have somehow ended up in the department       database  And I worry about the department spying on citizens       that goes beyond any reasonable or legal effort to protect       Defense Department personnel or installation     I worry that we re getting back       into the COINTELPRO days of Vietnam  My letters ask for       specific things that  one  should have been very easy to       answer  Is the press right that there was surveillance of       citizens in my home state of Vermont    I would think that senators that       have been here for 31 years ought to be able to get an answer to       a simple question like that  For months  everybody s refused to       answer my question    So I ll ask you  did they have       surveillance of citizens in Vermont    RUMSFELD        Senator  I m told that the Department of Defense did not conduct       any investigations of the domestic activities of persons in       Vermont  nor did it target any groups in Vermont for the       collection of intelligence    Apparently  the Department of       Defense did receive two reports that came to it from the       Department of Homeland Security  and they were reports about       protests  or potential protests  against DOD recruiters by       Vermont groups    Subsequently  the report came to       the Department of Defense  The Army personnel generated a       report based on that information  that they had not generated       themselves  and placed it into the database     The first TALON report contained       information about a potential protest action against military       recruiters attending a career function on March 8th       LEAHY        March 8th of what year    RUMSFELD        I m sorry  of 2005  in an unidentified Vermont town  Two       participating groups were named in the report  The second       report focused on a protest at an Army recruiting office in       Washington  D C   and also noted that another protest was       planned that day in an armed forces recruiting center in       Williston  Vermont  but no group was mentioned     So what happened was       LEAHY        So the press account saying that Quakers were under surveillance       by the Department of Defense is inaccurate    RUMSFELD  I didn t see the       press report  therefore I would not want to characterize           LEAHY        But if there was a press report that said that Vermont groups       were under surveillance by the Department of Defense  such a       press report would be inaccurate    if there was such a press       report  it would be inaccurate    RUMSFELD        I m reluctant to heave charges around    LEAHY        I m not asking for charges  That s a simple yes or no     RUMSFELD        Well  it isn t for me    Let me explain this program  The       program is for the purpose of force protection of the United       States military facilities in the United States of America        which is a legal obligation of the Department of Defense  to       protect their forces and their bases    So they have a program that allows       information to be sent to them that raises questions about       possible threats to their bases    If that information comes in and       is not evaluated  it sits there      LEAHY        Mr  Secretary  that s not my question  The question is  if       there was a report of surveillance of Vermont groups protesting       the war in Vermont by the Department of Defense  that report is       inaccurate  Yes or no    RUMSFELD        I would have to see the report  I have read to you the fact       that some reports about Vermont groups came into the department        but they were not originated by the Department of Defense         LEAHY        I should point out  we have    I know there are a number of       Quakers  some older than you and I  who peacefully protest once       a week in Vermont on the war  There are some in Vermont who do       not support the war in Iraq  And if the intent is to surveil       them  you could save your time    I ll speak against the war on the       floor and you can just take it off CSPAN and save your money         Let me speak about the Darfur       peacekeeping because Senator Cochran spoke about this  A lot of       people call for more  Secretary Rice  for more peacekeeping       troops in Darfur    The administration does not       support that  I see this as genocide  I don t know how you       could call it anything else  The African Union peacekeepers are       incapable of performing some of the basic functions  There seem       to be no consequences for attacking civilians  And some of the       attacks are just horrendous    I mean  they re nightmarish  when       you hear the descriptions  And I will not go into them  You ve       read the same intelligence reports    actually  some of the same       press reports I have    Now  the  161 million you ve       requested as a supplemental for peacekeeping in Darfur will       cover our share of sustaining the current inadequate number of       troops  It doesn t do anything to help pay for the doubling of       U N  troops  even though the president has acknowledged that s       needed    Do we need more money     RICE        Senator  I think  at this time  we believe that this is an       appropriate amount of money for the coverage of the U N        peacekeeping force that is likely to be available in this period       of time    As you know  we would authorize       the U N  peacekeeping force in the Security Council  There       would then be an effort to actually raise that force  And we       believe that this funding from the supplemental can help us with       the first stages of that    But we certainly will need to have       our contribution be adequate to cover the peacekeeping force         LEAHY        Let me ask  just so you can add to your answer  Can we stop the       genocide in Darfur    RICE        Well  Senator  I hope that we can stop the violence and the       genocide in Darfur  That s certainly what we are attempting to       do  There are really three prongs to this policy     Let me first say that we do  in       fact  favor both a U N  peacekeeping force and an expansion of       the numbers of peacekeepers that are now on the ground     And one reason that we want to go       to a blue hatted force is that we believe we would have a more       sustainable way to attract enough forces to have a doubling of       the force in Darfur  So we do favor that    We also favor  as the president       has said  a role for NATO in the planning and logistics and       support to that force  And General Jones is working within NATO       to see what we can do to effectively bring that O piece into it         So we want a more robust       peacekeeping force in Darfur   The president       himself has spoken to that  But it s going       to require more than a peacekeeping force in Darfur to end the       violence there It is also going to require an effort at a       peace agreement between the parties And we are spending a lot       of time in the Abuja talks trying to bring a peace agreement       between the parties  We also        Senator  are trying to make certain that the comprehensive peace       agreement for the agreement between the south and the north is       fully implemented  because that ended a civil war that      killed millions of people over decades  And so there are       many pieces to our policy in Darfur  but we do favor a more       robust peacekeeping force for Darfur
