       State Of Sen  Patrick LEahy On The Leahy Thomas Amendment TO Restore The   Minimum Allocation For States Under The State Homeland Security Grant Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    On The    333     To Restore The Minimum Allocation For States    Under The State Homeland Security Grant Program    March 6  2007    Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I rise to speak on     behalf of the bipartisan amendment offered by myself and Senators     Thomas  Stevens  Roberts  Pryor  Sanders  Enzi and Hatch to restore the     minimum allocation for states under the State Homeland Security Grant     Program from 0 45 percent  which is proposed by the underlying bill  to     0 75 percent  which is current law  As with current law  the state     minimum under our amendment would continue to apply only to 40 percent     of the overall funding under this program  The majority of the funds     would continue to be allocated based on risk assessment criteria  as are     the funds under the several separate discretionary programs that     Congress has established for solely urban and high risk areas  which     also are governed by risk assessment calculations  The underlying bill now before the Senate would     reduce the all state minimum for SHSGP and the Law Enforcement Terrorism     Prevention Program to 0 45 percent  The House bill reduces it even     further to 0 25 percent  Due to the formula differences  there is no     guarantee that the minimum will not be even further reduced during     conference negotiations  Small  and medium sized states face the loss     of millions of dollars for our first responders if the minimum is     lowered  By reducing the all state minimum to 0 45 percent      the underlying bill would reduce the guaranteed dollar amount for each     state by 40 percent  With appropriations for formula grants having been     cut by 60 percent since 2003  from  2 3 billion in 2003  to  900     million in FY07  further reductions in first responder funding would     hamper even more each states efforts to prevent and deal with potential     terrorist attacks  In FY07 State Homeland Security and Law Enforcement     Terrorism grants were funded at  525 million and  375 million      respectively  for a total of  900 million  Under the current all state     minimum of 0 75 percent  the base amount states receive is  6 75     million  Based on FY07 levels  each state would face a loss of an     estimated  2 7 million  or 40 percent  under the new 0 45 percent     formula  which would be a real blow to our first responders  And the cuts will be even deeper should the     Presidents budget request for next year be approved  The President has     requested only  250 million for these two important first responder     grant programs  Under the 0 45 percent minimum proposed by the     underlying bill and the 0 25 percent minimum proposed by the Feinstein     and Obama amendments  the guaranteed amount for each state would drop to      1 125 million and  625 thousand  respectively  Not only would these     proposed changes in the formula result in the loss of millions in     homeland security funding for the fire  police and rescue departments in     small  and medium sized states  it also would deal a crippling blow to     their efforts to launch federally mandated multi year plans to build and     sustain their terrorism preparedness  Even if the current 0 75 percent     minimum is applied to the Presidents budget request  states would be     guaranteed a minimum amount of  1 875 million  which is a drop of  4 875     million from the FY07 guaranteed minimum amount   My colleagues from our largest states seem to     forget that the terrorist attacks of 9 11 added to the responsibilities     and risks of first responders nationwide  I wrote the current all state     minimum formula as part of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to guarantee that     each state receives at least 0 75 percent of the national allotment to     help meet their national domestic security needs  Every state  rural or urban  small or large  has     basic domestic security needs and deserves to receive Federal funds     under this partnership to meet both those needs and the new homeland     security responsibilities the Federal government demands  Of course      high density urban areas and high risk centers have even greater needs      which is why this year alone we provided  1 3 billion for homeland     security programs for which only a small number of urban areas are     eligible to apply  All of these needs deserve and need to be met  I     have worked hard over the years to help address the needs of larger     states and high density areas  and I have opposed the Bush     Administrations efforts to pit our states against each other  as they     have tried to mask their efforts to cut overall funding for first     responders   Smaller states  especially  would never be able to     fulfill those essential duties on top of their daily responsibilities     without Federal support  especially given that DHS is currently     suggesting that states will pay for REAL ID implementation  an estimated      16 billion  with first responder grants  My colleagues should be     warned that if the minimum drops further  compounded by substantial     drops in overall first responder funding  then small  and medium sized     states will not be able to meet those Federal mandates for terrorism     prevention  preparedness and response  Some from urban states argue that Federal money to     fight terrorism is being sent to areas that do not need it and is     wasted in small towns  They claim the formula highly politicized and     insist on the redirection of funds to urban areas that they believe face     heightened threat of terrorist attacks  What critics of the all state minimum seem to     forget is that since the September 11 terrorist attacks  the Federal     government has asked ALL State and local first responders     to defend us as never before on the front lines in the war against     terrorism  Emergency responders in one state have been given the same     obligation as those in any other state to provide enhanced protection      preparedness and response against terrorists  The attacks of 9 11 added to the responsibilities     and risks of first responders across the country  In recent years  due     to the 0 75 percent all state minimum allocation for formula grants      first responders have received resources to help them meet their new     responsibilities have made our neighborhoods safer and our communities     better prepared  There is much left undone in securing our Nation  I     hope my colleagues will support my amendment to restore the 0 75 percent     minimum base and ensure continued support and resources for our police      fire and EMS services in every state if we expect them to continue     protecting us from terrorists or responding to terrorist attacks  as     well as carrying out their ongoing responsibilities in helping to keep     our communities safe and prepared
