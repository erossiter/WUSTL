       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On DOJ s Data Mining Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On DOJs Data Mining Report     July 10  2007 This report      raises more questions than it answers and demonstrates just how      dramatically the Bush Administration has expanded the use of this      technology  often in secret  to collect and sift through Americans      most sensitive personal information  Unfortunately  the Congress      and the American public know very little about these and other data      mining programs  making them ripe for abuse   The report  filed four months after it      was due  is an important and all too rare ray of sunshine on the      Departments data mining activities and provides Congress with an      opportunity to conduct meaningful oversight of this powerful      technological tool  I look forward to thoroughly examining the      findings in this report with the Attorney General and the FBI      Director in the coming weeks
