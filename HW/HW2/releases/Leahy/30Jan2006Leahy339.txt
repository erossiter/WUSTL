       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito    Jr  To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr       To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United States     January 30  2006 I began the      hearing on this nomination by putting forward what for me was the      ultimate question during the consideration of a successor to Justice      Sandra Day OConnor  Would Judge Alito  if confirmed by the Senate      to the Supreme Court  protect the rights and liberties of all      Americans and serve as an effective check on Government      overreaching   Since this debate began last      Wednesday  I have posed the fundamental question that this      nomination raises for this body  Whether the Senate will serve its      constitutional role as a check on Executive power by preserving the      Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion of      presidential power    This is a nomination that I fear      threatens the fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans now       and for generations to come  As astonishing as the facts may seem       it does not overstate them to point out that the President is in the      midst of a radical realignment of the powers of the government and      of its intrusiveness into the private lives of Americans  This      nomination is part and parcel of that plan  I am concerned that if      confirmed this nominee will further erode the checks and balances      that have protected our constitutional rights for more than 200      years  This is a critical nomination  one that can tip the balance      on the Supreme Court radically away from constitutional checks and      balances and the protection of Americans fundamental rights   The procedural      vote just taken was in large measure symbolic  Its result was      foreseen by Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of      the question  The next vote the Senate takes on this critical      nomination is not symbolic  It has real consequences in the lives      of the 295 million Americans alive today  and it will influence the      lives of generations of Americans to come  It will affect not only      our rights but the fundamental rights and liberties of our children      and our childrens children  In short  it matters  and it matters      greatly  The vote the Senate will take tomorrow will determine      whether Samuel A  Alito  Jr   replaces Justice Sandra Day OConnor      on the Supreme Court of the United States  I appreciate why Senators who voted against      cloture believe this matter deserves more searching attention by      Senators and the American people  Among Democratic Senators  each      is voting his or her conscience and best judgment  There will be      many Democratic Senators who  like the Democratic Members of the      Judiciary Committee who have closely studied the record of this      nominee  will be voting against the nomination  There will be some      Democratic Senators who will vote to confirm the nominee  Among      those voting against  there are some who feel that it is not      appropriate to withhold the Senates consent by extending debate       The Senate debated Chief Justice Roberts nomination during eight      days and over a 10 day calendar period  Although much more divisive      and controversial  the Alito nomination will be debated for just      five days over a 7 day calendar period by the time the vote is      called tomorrow   It is true that Democratic Senators do not all      vote in lockstep  Each Democratic Senator individually gives these      questions serious consideration  They honor their constitutional      duty  I am proud of the Democratic Members of the Judiciary      Committee for the statements they made last week when the Committee      considered this nomination and during the course of the last few      days  Their hard work in preparing for three Supreme Court      nominations over the last few months is to be commended  I thank      and commend the many Democratic Senators who came to the floor  who      spoke  who set forth their concerns and their views  That includes      Democratic Senators opposing the nomination and those in favor  It      is quite a roster  Senators Kennedy  Durbin  Mikulski  Clinton       Kerry  Nelson of Florida  Reed  Murray  Feinstein  Inouye  Harkin       Bingaman  Lincoln  Lieberman  Salazar  Carper  Levin  Obama  Dayton       Feingold  Johnson  Sarbanes  Stabenow  Lautenberg  Menendez and  in      addition  Senator Jeffords  These Senators approached the matter      seriously  in contrast to those partisan cheerleaders who rallied      behind this White Houses pick long before the first day of      hearings  I respect those Senators who are giving this      critical nomination serious consideration but come to a different      conclusion than I  just as I continue to respect the 22 Senators who      voted against the Roberts nomination  I have candidly acknowledged      that over the course of history their judgment and vote may prove      right  I took Judge Roberts at his word in the belief that his      words and the impressions he understood them to be creating had      meaning  I continue to hope that as Chief Justice he will fulfill      his promise and steer the Court to serve as an appropriate check on      abuses of presidential power and protect the fundamental liberties      and rights of all Americans   Filibusters of judicial nominees    and  in      particular  of Supreme Court nominees    are hardly something new       When Justice Fortas was nominated by President Johnson to be the      Chief Justice  a filibuster led by Strom Thurmond and the Republican      leader resulted in an unsuccessful cloture vote and in that      nomination being withdrawn  That was the most recent successful      filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee  But that was not the first      or last Supreme Court nomination to be defeated  President George      Washington  the Nations first and most popular President  saw the      Senate reject his nomination of John Rutledge to the Supreme Court      at the outset of our history  Over time approximately one fifth of      Presidents Supreme Court nominees have not been confirmed   The last time the country was faced with the      retirement of the pivotal vote on the Supreme Court was when Justice      Lewis Powell resigned in 1987  A Republican President sought to use      that opportunity to reshape the United States Supreme Court with his      nomination of Judge Robert Bork  Judge Bork had been a law      professor  a partner in one of the Nations leading law firms  a      judge on the D C  Circuit for five years  and he had served as      Solicitor General of the United States and even as the Acting      Attorney General at a critical juncture of our history   Many myths have arisen about why the Senate      rejected that nomination  I was here and along with the others      Senators  both Republican and Democratic  who voted to defeat that      nomination  I know that the nominees views were the decisive factor      in his failure  His rejection of the constitutional right to      privacy was a large part of his own undoing  Soon thereafter       President Reagan announced and withdrew the nomination of Judge      Ginsburg and then turned to a conservative federal appellate court      judge from California named Anthony Kennedy  Justice Kennedy       though conservative  was confirmed overwhelmingly and in bipartisan      fashion  He continues to serve as a respected Justice who has      authored key decisions protecting Americans from unfair      discrimination because of their sexual orientation   When the Senate was considering a successor to      Justice Powell almost 20 years ago I said that I believed a Supreme      Court nominees judicial philosophy should play a central role in      our consideration  I noted   There is no question      that the nominee who is confirmed to succeed Justice Lewis Powell      will be uniquely influential in determining the direction of the      Supreme Courts interpretation of the Constitution for years to      come  There can hardly be an issue closer to the heart of the      Senates role than a full and public exposition of the nominees      approach to the Constitution and to the rule of the courts in      discerning and enforcing its commands  That is what I mean by      judicial philosophy  The same remains true today as we consider a      successor to Justice Sandra Day OConnor  I strongly believe that      Judge Alitos judicial philosophy is too deferential to the      Government and too unprotective of the fundamental liberties and      rights of ordinary Americans for his nomination by President Bush to      be confirmed by the Senate as the replacement for Justice OConnor       Judicial philosophy comes into play      time and again as Supreme Court justices wrestle with serious      questions about which they do not all agree  These include      fundamental questions about how far the Government may intrude into      our personal lives  Senators need to assess whether a nominee will      protect fundamental rights if confirmed to be on the Supreme Court       Several Republican Senators said that judicial      philosophy and personal views do not matter because judges should      just apply the rule of law as if it were some mechanical      calculation  Senator Feinstein made this point exceptionally well      during the debate  Personal views and judicial philosophy often      come into play on close and controversial cases  We all know this      to be true  Why else did Republican supporters force President Bush      to withdraw his previous nominee for this vacancy  Harriet Miers       before she even had a hearing  She failed their judicial philosophy      litmus test  Indeed  Harriet Miers is the most recent      Supreme Court nominee not to have been confirmed  It was last      October that President Bush nominated his White House Counsel      Harriet Miers to succeed Justice OConnor  He did so after the      death of the Chief Justice and withdrawing his earlier nomination of      Judge Roberts to succeed Justice OConnor  The Democratic Leader of      the Senate quickly endorsed the selection of Ms  Miers as the kind      of person  with the kind of background  he found appealing       Democratic Senators went about the serious business of preparing      for hearings on the Miers nomination  But there were those from      among the Presidents supporters who castigated Ms  Miers and the      President for the nomination  The President succumbed to the      partisan pressure from the extreme right wing of his own party by      withdrawing his nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court      after repeatedly saying that he would never do so  In essence  he      allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his      party  before hearings or a vote  As Chairman Specter has often      said  they ran her out of town on a rail  In fact  of course  she      has remained in town as the Presidents counsel  but his point is      correct  Like the more than 60 moderate and qualified judicial      nominees of President Clinton on whom Republicans would neither hold      hearings or votes  the Miers nomination was killed by Republicans      without a vote  by what was in essence a pocket filibuster  That      eye opening experience for the country demonstrated what a vocal      faction of the Republican Party really wants  Their right wing      litmus test demands justice and judges who will guarantee the      results that they want  They do not want an independent federal      judiciary  They want certain results   Instead of uniting the country through his      third choice to succeed Justice OConnor  the President has chosen      to reward one faction of his party  at the risk of dividing the      country  Those so critical of his choice of Harriet Miers as a      nominee were the very people who rushed to endorse the nomination of      Judge Alito  Instead of rewarding his most virulent supporters  the      President should have rewarded the American people with a unifying      choice that would have broad support  America could have done      better through consultation to select one of the many consensus      conservative Republican candidates who could have been      overwhelmingly approved by the Senate  Instead  without      consultation  the President withdrew the Miers nomination and the      next day announced that his third choice to succeed Justice OConnor      was Judge Alito   At his hearing       Judge Alito began by asking how he got this critical nomination       Over the course of the hearings  I think we began to understand the      real answer to that question  It has little to do with Judge      Alitos family story and a great deal to do with the pressures that      forced the President to withdraw the nomination of Harriet Miers and      this Presidents efforts to avoid any check on his expansive claims      to power  This is a President who has been conducting      secret and warrantless eavesdropping on Americans for more than four      years  This President has made the most expansive claims of power      since American patriots fought the war of independence to rid      themselves of the overbearing power of King George III  He has done      so to justify illegal spying on Americans  to justify actions that      violate our values and laws against torture and protecting human      rights  and in order to detain U S  citizens and others on his say      so without judicial review or due process  This is a time in our      history when the protections of Americans liberties are at risk as      are the checks and balances that have served to constrain abuses of      power for more than 200 years   Judge Alitos opening statement skipped over      the reasons he was chosen  He ignored his seeking political      appointment within the Meese Justice Department by proclaiming his      commitment to an extreme and activist right wing legal philosophy       His testimony sought to minimize the Federalist Society and his      seeking to use membership in Concerned Alumni of Princeton for      advancement  He attempted to revise and redefine the theory of the      Unitary Executive  That is a legal underpinning being used by      this President and his supporters to attempt to justify his      assertions of virtually unlimited power  The President wanted a      reliable justice who would uphold his assertions of power  his most      extreme supporters want someone who will revisit the constitutional      protection of privacy rights  and the business supporters wanted      someone favorable to powerful special interests  Supreme Court nominations should not be      conducted through a series of winks and nods designed to reassure      the most extreme Republican factions while leaving the American      people in the dark  No President should be allowed to pack the      courts  and especially the Supreme Court  with nominees selected to      enshrine presidential claims of Government power  The checks and      balances that should be provided by the courts  Congress and the      Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow       partisan agenda  The Senate stood up to President Roosevelt when he      proposed a court packing scheme and should not be a rubber stamp to      this Presidents effort to move the law dramatically to the right       I do not intend to lend my support to an effort by this President      to undermine checks and balances or to move the Supreme Court and      the law radically to the right   So what do we know about the Samuel Alito who      graduated from Princeton University and Yale law school and obtained      a plum job in the office of the Solicitor General of the United      States  We know that he wanted political advancement and was      committed to the radical legal theories of the Meese Justice      Department  The job application that was the subject of some      question at the hearing is most revealing  I ask that a copy of      that job application be included in the Record at the conclusion of      my statement so that the American people can see it   This confirmation process is the opportunity      for the American people to learn what Samuel Alito thinks about      their fundamental constitutional rights and whether he will serve to      protect their liberty  their privacy and their autonomy from      Government intrusion  The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans       not just the person occupying the White House  and not just to a      narrow faction of a political party   We have heard from Judge Alitos supporters      that those opposing this nomination were smearing him by asking      substantive and probing questions at the hearing and by addressing      concerns about his record during this debate  The Republican leader      opened the debate with that attack  He said this before a single      minute of debate or opening statement by any Democratic Senator       These Republican talking points ring hollow and are particularly      inappropriate after President Bush was forced by an extreme faction      in his own party to withdraw his nomination of Harriet Miers   Democratic Senators should not be criticized      for taking seriously their constitutional role in trying to assess      whether Judge Alito is suitable for a lifetime position on the      Supreme Court  Democrats also asked tough questions of Justices      Ginsburg and Breyer during their confirmation hearings  which is in      stark contrast to the free pass given to Judge Alito by Republican      Senators during his hearing   Those critical of the Democrats have a short      and selective historical memory  Republican Senators engaged in a      party line vote in Committee against the nomination of Louis      Brandeis to the Supreme Court  Republican Senators  in an      unprecedented party line vote  blocked the nomination in 1999 of      Missouri Supreme Court Justice Ronnie White  an extremely qualified      nominee for a federal district court judgeship  In fact       Republicans pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clintons      judicial nominees by holding them up in the Judiciary Committee       This President continues to choose      confrontation over consensus and to be a divider rather than being      the uniter that he promised to be  This is in stark contrast to      President Clintons selection of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer after      real consultation  In his book  Square Peg  Senator Hatch      described how in 1993  as the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate      Judiciary Committee  he advised President Clinton about possible      Supreme Court nominees  Senator Hatch recounted that he warned      President Clinton away from a nominee whose confirmation he believed      would not be easy  He wrote that he then suggested the names of      Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg  both of whom were eventually      nominated and confirmed with relative ease  President Bush  who      had promised to be a uniter  not a divider  failed to live up to his      promise or to the example of his predecessor  as described by      Senator Hatch  The result is that  rather than sending us a nominee      for all Americans  the President chose a divisive nominee who raises      grave concerns about whether he will be a check on presidential      power and whether he understands the role of the courts in      protecting fundamental rights  The Supreme Court      is the ultimate check and balance in our system  Independence of      the courts and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of      life  The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp       and neither should the Supreme Court   This is a nomination to a lifetime seat on the      Nations highest court that has often represented the decisive vote      on constitutional issues  The Senate needs to make an informed      decision about this nomination  This process is the only      opportunity that the American people and their representatives have      to consider the suitability of the nominee to serve as a final      arbiter of the meaning of Constitution and the law  Has he      demonstrated a commitment to the fundamental rights of all      Americans  Will he allow the Government to intrude on Americans      personal privacy and freedoms   In a time when this Administration seems intent      on accumulating unchecked power  Judge Alitos views on Government      power are especially important  It is important to know whether he      would serve with judicial independence or as a surrogate for the      President who nominated him  Based on a thorough review of his      record and that from his hearing  I have no confidence that he will      act as an effective check on Government overreaching and abuses of      power   As we began the      hearings  I recalled the photograph that hangs in the National      Constitution Center in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  It shows the      first woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States      taking the oath of office in 1981  Justice Sandra Day OConnor      served as a model Supreme Court Justice   She is widely      recognized as a jurist with practical values and a sense of the      consequences of the legal decisions being made by the Supreme      Court  I regret that some on the extreme right have been so      critical of Justice OConnor and have adamantly opposed the naming      of a successor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities       Their criticism reflects poorly upon them  It does nothing to      tarnish the record of the first woman to serve as an Associate      Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  She is a Justice      whose graciousness and sense of duty fuels her continued service      nearly seven months after she announced her intention to retire       As the Senate      prepares to vote on President Bushs current nomination    his third         for a successor to Justice OConnor  we should be mindful of her      critical role on the Supreme Court  Her legacy is one of fairness      that I want to see preserved  Justice OConnor has been a guardian      of the protections the Constitution provides the American people       Of fundamental      importance  she has come to provide balance and a check on      Government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms  In the     Hamdi decision  she rejected the Bush Administrations claim      that it could indefinitely detain a United States citizen  She      upheld the fundamental principle of judicial review over the      exercise of Government power and wrote that even war is not a blank      check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nations      citizens  She held that even this President is not above the law       Her judgment has      also been crucial in protecting our environmental rights  She      joined in 5 4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom  religious      freedom and the Voting Rights Act  Each of these cases makes clear      how important a single Supreme Court Justice is   It is as the      elected representatives of the American people  all of the people         that we in the Senate are charged with the responsibility to      examine whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to      this nominee  The Constitution is their document  It guarantees      their rights from the heavy hand of Government intrusion and their      individual liberties to freedom of speech and religion  to equal      treatment  to due process and to privacy   The federal      judiciary is unlike the other branches of Government  Once      confirmed  federal judges serve for life  There is no court above      the Supreme Court of the United States  The American people deserve      a Supreme Court Justice who inspires confidence that he  or she       will not be beholden to the President but will be immune to      pressures from the Government or from partisan interests  The stakes for the American people could not be      higher  At this critical moment  Democratic Senators are performing      our constitutional Advice and Consent responsibility with heightened      vigilance  I urge all Senators    Republicans  Democrats and      Independents    to join with us  The Supreme Court is the guarantor      of the liberties of all Americans  The appointment of the next      Supreme Court Justice must be made in the peoples interest and in      the Nations interest  not to serve the special interests of a      partisan faction   I have voted for      the vast majority of President Reagans  President Bushs and      President Bushs judicial nominees  I recommended a Republican to      President Clinton to fill Vermonts seat on the Second Circuit       Judge Fred Parker  and recommended another Republican to President      Bush to fill that seat after Judger Parkers death  Judge Peter      Hall  I voted for President Reagans nomination of Justice Sandra      Day OConnor  for President Reagans nomination of Justice Anthony      Kennedy  for President Bushs nomination of Justice Souter  and for      this Presidents recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts  In      fact  I have voted for eight of the nine current Justices of the      Supreme Court  I want all Americans to know that the Supreme      Court will protect their rights and will respect the authority of      Congress to act in their interest  I want a Supreme Court that acts      in its finest tradition as a source of justice  The Supreme Court      must be an institution where the Bill or Rights and human dignity      are honored  In good conscience  based on the record  I cannot vote      for this nomination  I urge all Senators to use this last night of      debate to consult their consciences and their best judgment before      casting their votes tomorrow  That vote will matter   In my 30 years in the Senate  I have cast      almost 12 000 votes here in the Senate  Few will be as important as      the vote we cast tomorrow
