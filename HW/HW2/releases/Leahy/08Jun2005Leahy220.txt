       Closing Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Janice   Rogers Brown To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Closing Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Janice Rogers Brown     To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit     June 8  2005  Over the course of the Senates      consideration of the nomination of  Janice Rogers Brown to be a judge on      the United States Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  I have      publicly explained why I cannot support it  My opposition is based      on Justice Browns extensive record  which raises unavoidable      concerns about her pursuit from the bench of her extremist judicial      philosophy and therefore about her fitness for this lifetime      appointment  Justice Brown failed to gain the consent of the Senate      last year  As I explained in April when voting against her      confirmation in the Senate Judiciary Committee  not only has Justice      Brown failed to resolve any of my concerns since her hearing in late      2003  but Justice Browns opinions issued since that time reinforce      and deepen the troubling patterns in her record   Through bipartisan action  the Senate      has deterred the misguided bid by some on the other side of the      aisle for one party rule by means of their nuclear option  Thanks      to the hard work of a bipartisan group of 14 Senators  we have  for      now  preserved the system of checks and balances  designed by the      Founders  that are so integral to the function of the Senate and to      its role  As we turn now to the nomination of  Janice Rogers Brown  I urge all      Senators to take seriously the Senates constitutionally mandated      role as a partner with the Executive Branch in determining who will      serve lifetime appointments in the federal judiciary  I urge all      Senators  Republicans and Democrats alike  to take these matters      seriously and vote their consciences  Republican Senators and      Democratic Senators alike will need to evaluate  with clear eyes       the fitness of Justice Brown for this lifetime judicial appointment      before casting a difficult vote on this problematic and highly      controversial nominee  My opposition to Justice Browns nomination      is based  as it has always been  on her record    Justice Brown is a consummate judicial      activist whose record shows that she favors rolling back the clock      100 years on workers and consumers rights and taking the side of      corporations against average Americans  Her record shows she does      not believe in clean air and clean water protections for Americans      and their communities  she does not believe in laws providing      affordable housing  and that she would  if she could  wipe out      zoning laws that protect homeowners by keeping porn shops and      factories from moving in next door  Her record shows she takes an      extremely narrow view of protections against sexual harassment  race      discrimination  employment discrimination  and  most of all  age      discrimination  In fact  Justice Brown has a hostility toward such      programs as Social Security that is so great that she has argued      that Social Security is unconstitutional  and has said that    A t oday s      senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren   We have heard a great deal from      Justice Browns supporters about her life accomplishments  It is an      impressive story  and Justice Browns accomplishments in the face of      so much adversity are commendable  But we cannot base our votes on      the confirmation of a lifetime appointee to a federal court on      biography alone  If this were a vote on a Senate resolution      commemorating her life story  I am sure the entire Senate would      gladly support it  But instead  this is a vote about the lives of      multiple millions of other Americans whose lives would be affected      by this nominees ideological penchants    I hope that  as we debate Justice      Browns nomination  we will not    as we did two and a half years      ago    hear the whispering of unfounded smears against those who      oppose this nomination  I have spoken recently about my      disappointment in the White House and Republican partisans for      fanning the flames of bigotry and refusing to tamp down unfounded      claims that amount to religious McCarthyism  I urged the White      House  Republican leaders and moderate Republicans to join me in      condemning the injection of such smears into the consideration of      nominations  The failure to do so risks subverting this      constitutional process and the independence of our federal courts   The unfounded charges of bigotry are      belied by the numbers of major African American leaders  newspapers      and law professors across the country  who also oppose this      nomination based on Justice Browns record of extremism  The list      of the African American organizations and individuals who oppose      Justice Browns nomination is a clear indication that this is      another divisive  ideologically driven nomination  The 39 members      of the Congressional Black Caucus oppose Justice Browns nomination       including the respected congressional delegate from the  District of Columbia  Eleanor      Holmes Norton  and Representatives Charles Rangel  Elijah Cummings      and John Conyers  and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus       Representative Mel Watt  The nations oldest and largest      association of predominantly African American lawyers and judges         the National Bar Association    and its State counterpart    the      California Association of Black Lawyers    both oppose this      nomination  The foremost national civil rights organization  the      Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  opposes this nomination  The      women of Delta Sigma Theta oppose this nomination  Dr  Dorothy      Height  Dr  Joseph Lowery and Julian Bond  historic leaders in the      fight for equal rights  have spoken out against this nomination  I      ask that letters detailing this opposition  as well as a list of      other such letters of opposition to the Brown nomination  be entered      in the Record    The baseless smears that we have heard      are irresponsible  harmful and demonstrably false  Democrats have      voted to confirm each of the other 15      African American judges nominated by President Bush and brought to      the Senate for a vote  including all four of the other      African Americans confirmed to appellate courts  Democrats have      fought hard to integrate the Fourth Circuit  working with Senator      Warner through the confirmation of Judge Roger Gregory  and with      Senator Edwards on the confirmation of Judge Allyson Duncan  And it      was Democratic members who were outraged at the Republicans      party line vote against Justice Ronnie White  and Republican pocket      filibusters of Judge Beatty  Judge Wynn  Kathleen McCree Lewis and      so many outstanding African Americans judges and lawyers blocked      during the Clinton years    Let us not see that shameful card      dealt from the deck of unfounded charges that some stalwarts of this      Presidents most extreme nominees have come more and more to rely      upon  Let us stick to the merits  As so many have explained in      such detail over the last few days  those who oppose her do so      because they retain serious doubts about her nomination and see her      as an ideologue or a judicial activist    Opposition To      Justice Brown  The basis for my opposition is the      extremism of Justice Browns record  That  too  is the reason both      of her home state Senators oppose her  As we have heard in the      Judiciary Committee and here on the Senate Floor  both Senators from     California  who arguable      know this nominee and her record better than most  strongly oppose      Justice Browns confirmation  There was a time in the Senate  not      that long ago  when opposition by a nominees home state Senators       no matter how late in the day it was announced  was enough to halt a      nomination  I remember how that tradition was adhered to      scrupulously by Republican Senators five and a half years ago when      the Senate voted on the confirmation of Ronnie White to be a judge      in Missouri  Even though one of his home state Senators had warmly      endorsed him at his hearing  an eleventh hour reversal by that      Senator led to every Republican Senator voting against Justice      White  Thirty six of those Senators are still serving in the Senate      today  and if the approval of a nominees home state Senator is as      important today as it was in 1999  then the Senate will reject this      nomination  The former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee came to      the Senate after the defeat of Justice Whites nomination to explain      explicitly the importance of home state opposition in that      unprecedented party line vote    As I have detailed  Justice Browns      home state Senators are not the only ones who oppose her  Her      views  both in speeches and in opinions issued from the bench  are      so extreme that more than 200 law school professors from around the      country wrote to the Committee  prior to her hearing  expressing      their opposition    The Senate is faced with several      extreme nominees who have clear records of trying to rewrite the law      from the bench  In Justice Browns hearing before the Committee       then Chairman Hatch began the hearing by referring to President      Bushs description of his judicial nomination standard  Every      judge I appoint will be a person who clearly understands the role of      the judge is to interpret the law  not to legislate from the bench       My judicial nominees will know the difference  Regretfully       Justice Brown  a practitioner of a results oriented brand of      judicial activism so radical she is frequently the lone dissenter      from a 6 1 Republican majority court  represents the antithesis of      the Presidents purported standard  In re nominating Justice Brown      after she failed to gain consent of the Senate  the President has       again  selected a judicial nominee who deeply divides the American      people and the Senate   After Justice Browns record was      examined in the hearing on her nomination  editorial pages across      the country came to the same conclusion  Justice Browns home state      newspaper  The Los Angeles      Times       concluded she is a bad fit for a key court  after finding that in      opinions and speeches  Brown has articulated disdainful views of the      Constitution and government that are so strong and so far from the      mainstream as to raise questions about whether they would control      her decisions  The Detroit      Free Press concluded  Brown has all but hung a banner      above her head declaring herself a foe to privacy rights  civil      rights  legal precedent and even colleagues who dont share her      extremist leanings  The      Atlanta Journal and Constitution concluded that Janice      Rogers Brown is not qualified for the U S  Court of Appeals for the      D C  Circuit  The Washington      Post found that Justice Brown is one of the most      unapologetically ideological nominees of either party in many      years  And The New York Times      concluded that  based on Justice Browns record as a judge  she has      let ideology be her guide in deciding cases  I would ask that      these editorials expressing opposition  as well as a list of all of      the editorials opposing the Brown nomination be entered in the      Record     An Extreme Agenda       An Extreme Record  Justice Brown has a lengthy record of      opinions  of speeches and of writings  She has very strong      opinions  and there is little mystery about her views  even though      she sought to moderate them when she appeared before the Judiciary      Committee  I come to my decision  after reviewing Justice Browns      record  her judicial opinions  her speeches and writings    and      considering her testimony and oral and written answers provided to      the Senate Judiciary Committee    My opposition is not about whether      Justice Brown would vote like me if she were a member of the United      States Senate  I have voted to confirm probably hundreds of      nominees with whom I differ  Nor is this about one dissent or one      speech  This is about Justice Browns approach to the law  an      approach which she has consistently used to promote her own      ideological agenda that is out of the mainstream  Her hostility      both to Supreme Court precedent and to the intent of the legislature      does not entitle her to a lifetime appointment to this highly      important appellate court     Jurisprudence      Of Convenience  As I have said    and as remains true      today    Janice Rogers      Browns approach to the law can be best described as a      jurisprudence of convenience  Justice Brown has proven herself to      be a results oriented  agenda driven judge whose respect for      precedent and rules of judicial interpretation change and shift      depending on the subject matter before her and the results she wants      to reach    Hers is a record of sharp elbowed      ideological activism   While Justice Browns approach to the      law has been inconsistent  she has taken whatever approach she      needs to in order to get to a result she desires  the results which      she has worked toward have been very consistent  throughout her      public record   At her hearing  Justice Brown      attempted to separate her speeches from her role as a judge       However  on issue after issue    the protection of the elderly       workers and consumers  equal protection  the takings clause  privacy      rights  free speech  civil liberties  remedies  the use of      peremptory challenges  and many more  Justice Brown has inserted      her radical views into her judicial opinions time and time again       In fact  Justice Browns comments to groups across the country over      the last 10 years repeated the same themes  sometimes even the same      words    as she has written in her bench opinions     In Santa Monica Beach v  Superior      Court of L A  County  Justice Brown wrote of the demise of the     Lochner era  claiming the  revolution of 1937 ended the era      of economic substantive due process but it did not dampen the      courts penchant for rewriting the Constitution  Similarly  in a      speech to the Federalist Society  she said of the year 1937  it      marks the triumph of our own socialist revolution          In San Remo Hotel v  City and County of San Francisco       Justice Brown wrote   t urning a democracy into a kleptocracy does      not enhance the stature of the thieves  it only diminishes the      legitimacy of the government  Similarly  two years earlier  she      told an audience at the Institute for Justice  If we can invoke no      ultimate limits on the power of government  a democracy is      inevitably transformed into a kleptocracy  a license to steal  a      warrant for oppression   As Berkeley Law School Professor      Stephen Barnett pointed out about Justice Browns apparent claim      that these are  just speeches that exist in an entirely different      world from her judicial opinions  that defense not only is      implausible but trivializes the judicial role  I agree with      Professor Barnett on this and understand his determination to oppose      her nomination  Justice Browns provocative speeches are disturbing      in their own right  and they are made more so by their reprise in      her opinions     Disregarding      Precedent  During her hearing  Justice Brown told      the Committee that she will follow the law  However  her opinions      from the bench speak much louder than her words to the Committee       In such a judicial dissent she wrote  We cannot simply cloak      ourselves in the doctrine of      stare decisis   Justice Browns disregard for      precedent in her opinions in order to expand the rights of      corporations and wealthy property owners  at the expense of workers      and individuals who have been the victims of discrimination  stands      among the clearest illustrations of Justice Browns results oriented      jurisprudence  In several dissents  Justice Brown called for      overturning an exception to at will employment that has been long      recognized by the California Supreme Court  and was created to      protect workers from discrimination  She has repeatedly argued for      overturning precedent to provide more leeway for corporations      against attempts to stop the sale of cigarettes to minors  prevent      consumer fraud  and prevent the exclusion of women and homosexuals   Justice Brown has also been      inconsistent in the application of rules of judicial interpretation       again depending on the result that she wants to reach in order to      fulfill her extremist ideological agenda     A Consummate      Judicial Activist  These legal trends  her disregard for      precedent  her inconsistency in judicial interpretation  and her      tendency to inject her personal opinions into her judicial opinions       lead to no other conclusion but that Janice Rogers Brown is    in      the true sense of the words  a judicial activist     When it is needed to reach a      conclusion that meets her own ideological beliefs  Justice Brown      stresses the need for deference to the legislature and the      electorate  However  when the laws  as passed by legislators and      voters  are different than laws she believes are necessary  she has      shown no deference  presses her own agenda and advocates for      judicial activism    One stark example comes in an opinion      she wrote where in order to support her view that judges should be      able to limit damages in employment discrimination cases  she      concluded that creativity was a permissible judicial practice and      that all judges make law    Justice Browns approach to the law      has led to many opinions which are highly troubling  She repeatedly      and consistently has advocated turning back the clock 100 years to      return to an era where worker protection laws were found      unconstitutional  She has attacked the New Deal  an era which      created Social Security  fair labor standards and child labor laws       by calling it fundamentally incompatible with the vision that      undergirded this countrys founding  Justice Browns antipathy to      the New Deal and Social Security is so strong  that she stated  in     Santa Monica Beach v  Superior Court of L A  County  19 Cal       4th 952  1999   that 1937  the year in which much of      President Roosevelts New Deal legislation took effect    marks the      triumph of our own socialist revolution     Justice Browns hostility toward      Social Security is part of larger hostility toward the needs and the      rights of senior citizens       In a 2000 speech to a right wing group  Justice Brown claimed that    AToday s      senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because      they have a right to get as much  free       stuff as the political system will permit them to extract        Justice Brown has injected this hostility into her opinions  In      Stevenson v  Superior Court of Los Angeles County  16 Cal  4th      880  1997   Justice Brown was the only member of the court to find      that age discrimination victims cannot sue under common law because       as she stated in that case  she does not believe age discrimination      stigmatizes senior citizens   And she has repeatedly opposed      protections against discrimination of individuals  in their jobs      and in their homes  Justice Browns claims that her words do not      mean what they say are simply unconvincing   Another troubling aspect of Justice      Browns nomination is the court for which she has been nominated       She is being considered for a position on the premier administrative      law court in the nation    a court that is charged with overseeing      the actions of federal agencies that are responsible for worker      protections  environmental standards  consumer safeguards  and civil      rights protections    I am concerned about her ability to be      a fair arbitrator on this court  Justice Brown has made no secret      of her disdain for governments role in upholding protections      against the abuse of the powerless  those who struggle in our      society  and our environment  She has said  where government      moves in  community retreats  civil society disintegrates  and our      ability to control our own destiny atrophies    How can someone who has demonstrated      her activism be entrusted to make fair and neutral decisions when      faced with the responsibility of interpreting the powers of the      federal government and the breadth of regulatory statutes  Justice      Brown responded to this question at her hearing by calling on us to      review her record as a judge to see that she does not hate      government  Well  I did review her record  And  what I found was      disturbing  She has used her position on and off the bench to argue      for the dismantling of government from the inside out    Recent Opinions      Continue Pattern Of Troubling Jurisprudence  Since the Senate last considered      Justice Browns nomination  her troubling jurisprudence has not      changed  As demonstrated by her recent opinions  Justice Brown has      continued to be a results oriented judge with little consistency in      judicial interpretation who gives great deference to her own agenda      rather than to precedent  to the intent of the legislature  or to      the Constitution   In the last 18 months  since Justice      Brown appeared before the Judiciary Committee   She has expressly ignored Supreme      Court precedent in seeking judicial repeal of a state      anti discrimination statute giving drug benefits to women  despite      her own finding that the statute met the Supreme Courts test        She has denigrated the constitutional      right to privacy and bodily integrity as mere sympathy by the      majority    She has shown deference to the intent      of employers rather than to precedent  to the detriment of the      retirement benefits of long term workers    She has sought to replace the      legislatures judgment regarding the value of expert testimony      related to Battered Womens Syndrome with her own judgment that      domestic violence is simply a label  now codified  which would      make it more difficult to prosecute domestic violence     She has sought to overturn a long line      of precedent that African American women are considered a      cognizable group for the purpose of assessing where a prosecuting      attorney has violated equal protection in the use of peremptory      challenges   She has demonstrated her hostility to      common law by overturning  Californias century old second degree      felony murder rule   She has sought to make it more      difficult for a worker to pursue a sexual harassment claim against      her employer by strictly enforcing release language in a separate      workers compensation settlement  even though this result would       according to the majority  create a trap for the unwary worker        Justice Browns record since her      hearing  and since she was last rejected by the Senate  has only      brought into sharper focus the radicalism of her opinions and only      deepened my concern about her extremism    Indeed  in the last several days the      United States Supreme Court decision in a regulatory takings case      demonstrates anew just how far out of the mainstream she is  In      this case  a strong majority of the Supreme Court rejected the      approach that Justice Brown has endorsed in her efforts to expand      the takings clause of the Constitution to thwart local government      regulation for health  safety  controlled growth and economic      development    Janice Rogers      Browns Vision  America      would look like and be a very different place if Justice Brown had      her way  She would do away with many of the core protections      Americans count on to keep their jobs and communities safe and their      retirements secure  There would be few if any laws protecting      Americans from race discrimination  employment discrimination or age      discrimination  or protecting a womans right to choose  Corporate      speech would be protected  but not the First Amendment rights of      employees to criticize an employers practices  Corporations would      be protected against suits for stock fraud and for illegally selling      cigarettes to minors  but  private employers would      not be required to provide contraceptive drug benefits for women        Justice Browns  America would mean a return to the      widely and justifiably discredited Lochner era  an era named after a      Supreme Court decision so widely derided that even Robert Bork      called its judicial activism an   abomination        A return to the Lochner era would mean a return to a time without      protections against child labor  It would mean a return to a time      without zoning protections to prevent porn shops and factories and      rat infested slaughterhouses from moving in next door to Americans      homes  a time without consumer protection and laws providing for      affordable housing  a time without worker safety laws and without      fair labor standards  and a time without laws protecting clean air      and clean water  And it would mean a return to a time without      Social Security    Conclusion  It is no small irony that this      President  who spoke of being a uniter  has used his position to      re nominate Justice Brown and others after they failed to gain      consent of the Senate  These provocative nominees have divided the      Senate and the American people and brought the Senate to the edge of      a nuclear winter  His divisiveness has continued  despite the      confirmation of 209 out of his 218 judicial nominees  It is no      small irony that this President  who spoke with disdain of judicial      activism  has nominated several of the most consummate judicial      activists ever chosen by any President  None of the Presidents      nominees is more in the mold of a judicial activist than this      nominee   I oppose giving Justice Brown this      lifetime promotion to the second highest court in our land because      the American people deserve judges who will interpret the law fairly      and objectively  Janice      Rogers Brown is a committed judicial activist who has a consistent      record of using her position as a member of the court to put her      views above the law and above the interests of working men and women      and families across the Nation  We should not enable her to bring      her jurisprudence of convenience to one of the most important      federal courts in the Nation
