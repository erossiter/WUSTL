       Independent Library Of Congress Study Confirms That Bush Mercury Rules   Let Industry Off The Hook                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Independent Library Of Congress      Study     Confirms That Bush Mercury Rules Let Industry Off The Hook  FRIDAY  April 22     A new Congressional      Research Service  Library of Congress  report requested by Sen      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   confirms that most power plantswill      have to do nothing to reduce toxic mercury pollution from power      plants for at least ten years under the Bush Administration s new      mercury rules  The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA       finalized a set of two rules on March 15  The first rulereversed a      2000 EPA decision that it isnecessaryand appropriate to      regulate mercury from coal fired power plants  The second rule      established a cap and tradesystemunder which utilities can      either control mercury pollution or buy allowances from other      plants  The new independent reportreleased by Leahy validates many      of the concerns about the Bush Administrations mercury rule that      were raised by states  public health officials and sportsmen      ataDemocratic Policy Committee hearing chaired by Senator Leahy on      April 19 on Capitol Hill   This adds to the mountain of evidence that      confirms the Bush Administrations mercury rule is fatally flawed      and steeped with favoritism to the big polluters  said Leahy   The key findings of the report include     The cap and trade system will allow      utilities to delay compliance with the full 70 percent reduction      target until well beyond 2018  and compliance may be delayed until      as late as 2030     By 2015  less than 1 percent of coal fired      power plant capacity will have installed mercury specifc controls       and only 4 percent will have such equipment by 2020      The cap and trade method will allow      facilities to avoid any emission controls and to do nothing to      reduce hot spots of mercury in the most contaminated areas  Under      a pre existing 2000 EPA decision  reductions would have been      required at all plants and would have improved conditions at hot      spots     The final rule completely changed the health      benefits of controlling mercury pollution  The proposed rule      estimated annual benefits of more than  15 billion  versus only  43      million per year under the final rule  For a full copy of the report        Toreadtestimony from the      hearing
