       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel A    Alito  Jr   To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr       To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United States     January 9  2006   The challenge for Judge Alito in       the course of these hearings is to demonstrate that he will       protect the rights and liberties of all Americans and serve as       an effective check on Government overreaching  The President       has not helped his cause by withdrawing his earlier nomination       of Harriet Miers in the face of criticism from a narrow faction       of his own party  Supreme Court nominations should not be       conducted through a series of winks and nods designed to       reassure Republican factions while leaving the American people       in the dark  No President should be allowed to pack the courts        and especially the Supreme Court  with nominees selected to       enshrine presidential claims of Government power  The checks       and balances that should be provided by the courts  Congress and       the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow        partisan agenda    This hearing is the opportunity       for the American people to learn what Samuel Alito thinks about       their fundamental constitutional rights and whether he will       serve to protect their liberty  their privacy and their autonomy       from Government intrusion  The Supreme Court belongs to all       Americans  not just the person occupying the White House  and       not just to a narrow faction of a political party    The Supreme Court is the ultimate       check and balance in our system   Independence of the courts and its       members is crucial to our democracy and way of life  The Senate       should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp  and neither       should the Supreme Court  I will ask Judge Alito to demonstrate       his independence from the interests of the President     This is a nomination to a lifetime       seat on the nations highest court that has often represented       the decisive vote on constitutional issues  The Senate needs to       make an informed decision about this nomination  That means       knowing more about Samuel Alitos work in the Government and       knowing more about his views  I intend to ask about the       disturbing memorandum he wrote to become a political appointee       in the Meese Justice Department  in which he professes concern       with the fundamental principle of one person  one vote  a       principle of the equality that is the bedrock of our laws   This hearing is the only       opportunity that the American people and their representatives       have to consider the suitability of the nominee to serve as a       final arbiter of the meaning of Constitution and the law  Has       he demonstrated a commitment to the fundamental rights of all       Americans  Will he allow the Government to intrude on       Americans personal privacy and freedoms  In a time when this       Administration seems intent on accumulating unchecked power        Judge Alitos views on Executive power are especially       important  It is important to know whether he would serve with       judicial independence or as a surrogate for the President who       nominated him     The public conversation with Judge       Alito in this hearing room over the next several days is       important  It is the peoples Constitution and the peoples       rights that we are all charged with protecting and preserving        Through this hearing we embark on the constitutional process       that was designed to protect those rights   As we begin these hearings  I am       reminded of a photograph that hangs in the  National Constitution Center in       Philadelphia  Pennsylvania  the home of our Chairman  It shows       the first woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United       States taking the oath of office in 1981  Justice Sandra Day       OConnor serves as a model Supreme Court Justice    She is widely recognized as a       jurist with practical values and a sense of the consequences of       the legal decisions being made by the Supreme Court  I regret       that some on the extreme right have been so critical of Justice       OConnor and have adamantly opposed the naming of a successor       who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities  Their       criticism reflects poorly upon them  It does nothing to tarnish       the record of the first woman to serve as an Associate Justice       of the Supreme Court of the  United States  She is a Justice       whose graciousness and sense of duty fuels her continued service       more than six months after she announced her intention to       retire     The Court that serves  America should reflect       America  but with this nomination the Court has lost a measure       of diversity  There was no dearth of highly qualified women        Hispanics  African Americans and other individuals who could       well have served as unifying nominees while adding to the       diversity of the Supreme Court  I look forward to the time when       the membership of the Supreme Court is more reflective of the       country it serves    As the Senate begins its       consideration of President Bushs current nomination  his third        of a successor to Justice OConnor  we do so mindful of her       critical role on the Supreme Court  Her legacy is one of       fairness that I want to see preserved  Justice OConnor has       been a guardian of the protections the Constitution provides the       American people    Of fundamental importance  she has       come to provide balance and a check on Government intrusion into       our personal privacy and freedoms  In the Hamdi       decision  she rejected the Bush Administrations claim that it       could indefinitely detain a  United States citizen  She upheld       the fundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise       of Government power and wrote that even war is not a blank       check for the President when it comes to the rights of the       Nations citizens  She held that even this President is not       above the law    Her judgment has also been       critical in protecting our environmental rights  She joined in       5 4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom  religious freedom       and the Voting Rights Act  Each of these cases makes clear how       important a single Supreme Court Justice is  It is crucial that       we determine what kind of Justice Samuel Alito would be  if       confirmed  and if he would be an independent justice   It is as the elected       representatives of the American people  all the people  that we       in the Senate are charged with the responsibility to examine       whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to this       nominee  The Constitution is their document  It guarantees       their rights from the heavy hand of Government intrusion and       their individual liberties to freedom of speech and religion  to       equal treatment  to due process and to privacy  This is their       process    The federal judiciary is unlike       the other branches of Government  Once confirmed  federal       judges serve for life  There is no court above the Supreme       Court of the United       States  The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who       inspires confidence that he  or she  will not be beholden to the       President but will be immune to pressures from the Government or       from partisan interests   Last October  the President       succumbed to partisan pressure from the extreme right of his       party by withdrawing his nomination of Harriet Miers  By       withdrawing her nomination and substituting this one  the       President has allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme       faction within his party  before hearings or a vote  That       eye opening experience for the country demonstrated what a vocal       faction of the Republican Party really wants  They do not want       an independent federal judiciary  They demand judges who will       guarantee the results that they want    This nomination is being       considered against the backdrop of another recent revelation          that the President has  outside the law  been conducting secret       and warrantless spying on Americans for more than four years        It comes as members of the Bush Administration and Republican       congressional leadership face criminal investigations and       indictments in corruption probes  This is a time when the       protections of Americans liberties are directly at risk  as are       the checks and balances that have served to constrain abuses of       power for more than 200 years  The Supreme Court is relied upon       by all Americans to protect their fundamental rights   I have yet to decide how I will       vote on this nomination  I will base my determination on the       whole record at the conclusion of these hearings    just as I       did in connection with the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts       whose nomination I came to support    The stakes for the American people       could not be higher  At this critical moment  Senate Democrats       serving on this Committee will perform our constitutional Advice       and Consent responsibility with heightened vigilance  I urge       all Senators  Republicans  Democrats and Independents  to join       with us in a serious consideration of this pivotal nomination        The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the liberties of all       Americans  The appointment of the next Supreme Court Justice       must be made in the peoples interest and in the Nations       interest  not to serve the special interests of a partisan       faction
