       Leahy  Vermont Guard Base Clears First Hurdle In Base Closure Round                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  Vermont Guard Base Clears      First Hurdle In Base Closure Round  Defense Dept  Recommends Adding 56 New Positions     At Vermont Air Guard Base In Burlington     Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    It was a pleasure      to be able to call Governor Douglas this morning and report that the      Vermont Air National Guard base in Burlington is not on the base      closure list  In fact  the Pentagon recommends adding 56 new      positions to our base in Burlington  This vastly reduces the threat      our Guard base will be closed or cut back  This is only the first      step in the base closure process  but this list is the most      important step     The yardstick for      deciding whether a base remains open is its military value  Today      if you look at our base in Burlington  you see a lot of military      value  We have worked long  hard and effectively together to      upgrade the facilities and modernize its aircraft  These      improvements have allowed the superb men and women in Burlington to      carry out any mission  whether flying round the clock air patrols      over New York City and Washington after September 11th       taking on the air alert detachment in the South  or deploying to the      Persian Gulf to support troops on the ground in Iraq  The skill and      experience of our people  the facilities they work in and the      missions theyve been given help set us apart      From many years of      meeting with the Air Forces senior leadership about Vermont Guard      projects  I know that they recognize the strengths of our Air      National Guard  Thats one of the reasons why the Air Force tapped      the Vermont Air Guard above all others to host its community basing      initiative that will bring active duty service members to serve      side by side with the Vermont Air Guard  I have had many      discussions about this groundbreaking initiative  all the way up the      Air Force chief of staff  and there is a strong recognition up and      down the chain of command that the country has a real gem in the      Vermont Air National Guard            NEWS BACKGROUNDER            Base Upgrades  New Equipment And New Missions     Help Vermont Air National Guard Dodge Base Closures     That Threaten Other F 16 Units     In First Step Of Base Closure Process   Vermonts      Air National Guard and its Burlington facilities stand in better      stead than other Guard F 16 bases around the country because of the      Vermont bases skilled and experienced pilots and ground crew and      the added missions and steady modernization accomplished through a      long and impressive list of special appropriations secured by Sen       Patrick Leahy for Vermont Air National Guard facilities  These      investments and new missions fostered through Leahys partnership      with the Vermont Guard have helped make the 158th Fighter      Wing one of the Air Forces gems     The Burlington      International Airport based unit  which flies the Block 25 version      of the F 16 Fighting Falcon aircraft  is one of best  and      best equipped  fighter units in the Air Force  always at the ready      to handle any mission  The Vermont Guard has benefited from Leahys      leading roles on Guard issues in the Senate  where he is the      co chair of the U S  Senate National Guard Caucus  and also a senior      member of the Senates Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  which      handles the Senates work in writing the annual defense budget      bill          SECURING ADVANCED INFRASTRUCTURE AT VT  AIR GUARD BASE      Improvement      projects secured by Leahy and Sen  Jim Jeffords in the Appropriations Committee in recent      years that have boosted the wings capabilities include      5 5 million maintenance supply       center in Fiscal Year 1999      9 6 million for an Aviation       Maintenance Facility in Fiscal Year 2001      4 2 million for a vehicle       maintenance complex in Fiscal Year 2002  and     5 4 million for a       state of the art deployment facility in Fiscal Year 2005        Senator Leahy also secured  35 million in Fiscal Year 2003 and       2004 for a new Vermont Army Guard aviation flight facility that       will have a large  thick ramp which can accommodate large       aircraft      Leahy also secured      almost  15 million since Fiscal Year 2001 for the Vermont Air      National Guard to develop a capability to train other Guard       Reserve  and Active units in the finer arts of computer information      assurance and information operations  This has allowed the      installation of a unique high speed communications and secure      teleconference system at Burlington  as well as at the Air National      Guards headquarters outside Washington          ENHANCED ROLE AFTER 9 11      In December 2001       within three months of the terrorist attacks  Leahy secured  55      million in the Fiscal Year 2001 Emergency Supplemental      Appropriations Bill to develop new technologies for the Air National      Guards F 16s  including those of the Vermont Air National Guard       Almost  20 million went toward the development the so called      Transparent Mult Platform Gateway  TMPG   which connects together      various datalink systems and later provided a decisive technology      during air operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom  Almost       35 million went toward development of the next generation Advanced      Identification Friend or Foe  IFF  system for F 16s flying the air      cover mission  This technology will allow the Air Guard aircraft to      identify hostile aircraft quickly    Senator Leahy has      secured more than  300 million in new equipment for the Air National      Guard through the appropriations process  In the Fiscal Year 2003      Defense Appropriations Bill  Leahy  working with fellow Guard Caucus      co chair Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo    secured  200 million for the Guard      and Reserve Equipment Account  which flexibly allows the Air      National Guard to procure such critical systems the LITENING II       which allowed the Air Guard to provide superior precision attack      capability during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  He secured      similarly high levels of funding during the annual defense      appropriations bills in Fiscal Year 2004 and Fiscal Year 2005              ADDING NEW MISSIONS FOR THE VT  AIR NATIONAL GUARD      Senator Leahy has      always worked closely with the Vermont Air National Guard for the      unit to take on roles and mission it is well positioned to handle       including the realm of air defense and working more closely with the      active Air Force    SHAW AFB ASSIGNMENT         In May 2003  Senator Leahy announced with the Vermont National      Guard that the 158th Fighter Wing would assume a remote      air defense detachment at Shaw Air Force Base  South Carolina       providing necessary air protection across the Southeast  The      announcement came after intense behind the scenes discussions among      Senator Leahy  the Vermont Air National Guard  Air National Guard      Headquarters  and the Active Duty Air Force to ensure that the      Vermont Air Guard contributed to this critical mission after its      accomplishments after September 11    COMMUNITY BASING      INITIATIVE  In December 2004  Senator Leahy announced the Air      Forces Community Basing Initiative with the Vermont Air National      Guard  The basing regimen allows the active Air Force to station      active duty personnel with the 158th Fighter Wing and      take advantage of the Vermont Air National Guards enormous level of      experience  while giving the active duty personnel a high quality of      life experience in Burlington before heading on to other      assignments  Air Force only approved the idea    which was      originally developed by Assistant Adjutant General for Air      Activities  Brigadier General William Etter    after fierce lobbying      from Senator Leahy  Leahyquestioned Air Force Chief of Staff      General John Jumper and then Air Force Secretary Jim Roche about      moving forward with the plan during several phone conversations       office calls and public meetings  including an open hearing of the      Defense Appropriations Subcommittee               Contact  David Carle       202 224 3693
