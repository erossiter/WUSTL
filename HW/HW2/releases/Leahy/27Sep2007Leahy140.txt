       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On U S  Attorney Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On U S  Attorney Nominations    Senate Judiciary Committee    Executive Business Meeting    September 27  2007  Today  the Committee considers the nomination of     James Russell Dedrick to be United States Attorney for the Eastern     District of Tennessee  I thank the Senators from Tennessee for their     work in connection with this nomination  In the course of the Committees investigation into     the unprecedented mass firings of U S  Attorneys by the President who     appointed them  we uncovered an effort by officials at the White House     and the Justice Department to exploit an obscure provision enacted     during to the Patriot Act reauthorization to do an end run around the     Senates constitutional authority to confirm U S  Attorneys  The     result was the firing of well performing U S  Attorneys for not bending     to the political will of political operatives at the White House   I had hoped when the Senate voted overwhelmingly to     close this loophole  passing S 214  the Preserving United States     Attorney Independence Act of 2007  by a vote of 97 0  it would send a     clear message to the Administration to nominate Senate confirmable U S      Attorneys and begin to restore an important check on the partisan     influence in law enforcement  Regrettably  the Administration seems to have     chosen to ignore that message  It has made an abysmal effort to send     nominees to the Senate to replace the fired U S  Attorneys and to fill     vacancies in those districts and many others  There are now 23     districts with acting or interim U S  Attorneys instead of     Senate confirmed U S  Attorneys  That is over a quarter of all     districts  Yet the White House has nominated only five people for these     23 spots   When it comes to the United States Department of     Justice and to the U S  Attorneys in our home states  Senators have a     say and a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in order to     insulate the federal law enforcement function from untoward political     influence  That is why the law and the practice has always been that     these appointments require Senate confirmation  The advice and consent     check on the appointment power for U S  Attorneys is a critical function     of the Senate   Even as we closed one loophole  the Administration     has been exploiting others to continue to avoid coming to the Senate      Under the guidance of an erroneous opinion of the Justice Departments     Office of Legal Counsel  the Administration has been employing the     Vacancies Act authority to use acting U S  Attorneys and the power to     appoint interim U S  Attorneys sequentially  They have used this     misguided approach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the     advice and consent of the Senate  This approach runs afoul of     congressional intent and the law
