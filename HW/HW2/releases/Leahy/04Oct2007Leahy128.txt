       Attorney General Consulation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy To Begin Consultation With     Committee Members    To Set Hearing Date For Attorney General Nominee  The Senate Judiciary Committee today held an     executive business meeting to complete its debate on the Free Flow of     Information Act  In a statement at the start of the meeting  Chairman     Patrick Leahy  D Vt   indicated he would work with ranking member Arlen     Specter  R Pa   and other Committee Senators to finalize a date to begin     the confirmation proceedings for Attorney General nominee Judge Michael     Mukasey  In a letter sent Tuesday  Leahy requested an October 16     meeting with the nominee  and today indicated that hearings could begin     soon after  as early as October 17  Below is Leahys opening     statement        Opening Statement of Chairman Patrick Leahy     Senate Judiciary Committee    Executive Business Meeting    October 4  2007  Providing a new direction and new leadership at the     Department of Justice are important to me and to all of us  and to the     country  We need to restore the Department of Justice to be worthy of     its name and tradition  As Senator Whitehouse put it during our hearing     earlier this week with Jack Goldsmith  the time honored practices and     traditions that had long guided the Department of Justice and protected     it from political influence need to be restored   Regrettably the White House has chosen not to clear     the decks of ongoing concerns and not to produce the information and     material they should have and could have about the ongoing scandals that     have shaken the Department and led to the exodus of its former     leadership  Those matters now encumber the Mukasey nomination and  as     he knows  he will be asked about them  Fundamentally  as Senator     Sessions  a former U S  Attorney  also indicated this week  we need to     ensure the independence of federal law     enforcement from political pressure  Among the next attorney generals     challenges will be to restore morale at the Department and the     publics trust in the Department   This morning  The New     York Times reports that the     Department of Justice secretly endorsed combinations of the harshest     interrogation tactics as legal    after telling us and the world that     torture is abhorrent  After leading us and the American people to     believe that they had withdrawn the infamous Bybee memo  it appears that     under Attorney General Gonzales they reversed themselves and reinstated     a secret regime by  in essence  reinterpreting the law in secret  We on     this Committee have been seeking that information without cooperation     from the Administration for two years  I suspect that former Deputy     Attorney General Comey will again prove to be right in his prediction     that the Department of Justice will be ashamed when we learn  more     about all  that they have done   I look forward to meeting with former Judge Mukasey     on October 16  if that date is convenient to him  I anticipate that     following our meeting the Committee will commence the confirmation     hearing on his nomination to be Attorney General of the United States      That could begin as soon as Wednesday  October 17  Before finalizing     the date  I want to consult with Senator Specter  and I also want to see     whether there are objections from other Senators on this Committee  I     apologize to the hardworking Senators and their staffs who serve this     Committee that this tentative schedule will necessitate their working     intensely through another recess period of the Senate in order to be     prepared to proceed our first week back in session  Now to the matters at hand this morning  We need     to complete our consideration of the Free Flow of Information Act  I     hope that we will not be delayed and can also consider and report the     bill that I have cosponsored with Senator Cornyn clarifying the scope of     copyright protection for vessel hull designs  We have a bipartisan     resolution establishing a day of remembrance for murder victims and a     resolution recognizing hunters commitment to safety  There are two     U S  Attorney nominations and another lifetime judicial nomination that     we are also seeking to expedite today  I had hoped to have the     nomination of Julie Myers of Homeland Security and Michael Sullivan of     ATF on the agenda today but have been asked to list them at our next     meeting in order to allow Senators to send written questions to these     nominees   Senator Specter  do you have an opening statement
