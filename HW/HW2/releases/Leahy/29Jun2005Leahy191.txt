Of Disapproval     Relating To EPAs Mercury Rule     June 29  2005  Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Susan Collins  R Maine   and Jim Jeffords  I Vt    joined by 27      other senators  will introduce a resolution to halt EPAs rule to      delist power plants as a source of hazardous air pollutants  such as      mercury  under the Clean Air Act  The resolution will be introduced      pursuant to the Congressional Review Act  CRA    BACKGROUND ON THE CONGRESSIONAL      REVIEW ACT    The discharge petition is the next step in the      procedural process under the CRA to ensure the resolution is      considered by the full Senate  The resolution of disapproval will be      referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  If      the resolution of disapproval is not acted on by the Committee  then      a discharge petition signed by 30 senators will automatically      discharge the resolution  If 30 senators submit a petition for this      purpose  the measure is automatically discharged and placed on the      Senate calendar  from which it may be called up for floor      consideration  Though the CRA is not explicit  the Senate has      treated motions to take up and consider disapproval resolutions  by      whomever makes such a motion  as privileged matters that are not      debatable  That would assure a Senate vote on the resolution    BACKGROUND ON EPAS RULE         The Environmental Protection Agency recently issued two new      controversial mercury emissions rules  The first rule  the      delisting rule  revokes a 2000 EPA decision that it is necessary      and appropriate to require that each power plant apply technology      to reduce mercury emissions  The other scheme gives utilities an      extra 13 years before they would have to install any      mercury specific controls on power plants  Further  many plants will      never have to install controls if they choose to simply buy their      way out by purchasing allowances from other plants  The      Leahy Collins resolution deals only with EPAs delisting rule       MERCURYS THREATS TO PUBLIC      HEALTH    Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that damages fetuses       and children s developing nervous systems  At least 44 states have      issued warnings urging residents to avoid or limit their consumption      of mercury laden fish caught in local waters  and the federal      government has recommended that children and women of childbearing      age eat no more than two meals of low mercury fish per week and      avoid eating certain fish altogether   Recent analyses show that the      estimate of infants with unsafe mercury levels in their blood has      doubled to 630 000  The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed      scientific research demonstrating that maternal consumption of      unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause neuro developmental harm      in children  resulting in learning disabilities  poor motor      function  mental retardation  seizures and cerebral palsy    While Administration officials      claimed stronger safeguards would exceed the benefits to public      health  they failed to consider an EPA funded  peer reviewed Harvard      University study showing that more stringent limits on power plant      mercury pollution are both cost effective and necessary to protect      public health  While ignoring the new EPA funded Harvard study  EPA      clearly considered input from polluting industries  In fact  EPAs      first proposal for these rules lifted exact texts from memorandum      provided by utility industry lobbyists   The resolution is offered to ensure      that the health and safety of the American public is fully      considered  before EPA is able to rescind its statutory commitment      to protect public health from the dangers of mercury pollution       Leahy  chief sponsor of the resolution  believes that it is wrong to      leave power plants as the only source of mercury and other toxic air      pollution that is allowed to avoid rigorous emissions standards      under the Clean Air Act  Doing that  he believes  poses undue risks      to the publics health that the nation need not and should not      accept   This petition  he noted  will now      allow the full Senate to debate the merits of the EPA rule                        Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Introduction Of A Resolution     To Disapprove The Administrations Mercury Rule     June 29  2005 Mr  President  along with Senator Collins and      28 of our colleagues  today I am introducing this resolution to halt      the Bush Administrations flawed and dangerous new rule on toxic      mercury emissions  I am pleased that another leading cosponsor of      this resolution is the Ranking Member of the Committee on      Environment and Public Works  Senator Jeffords  The Bush Administrations new rule will      continue to allow mercury  a substance so toxic that it causes birth      defects and IQ loss  to continue to poison children and pregnant      women  This disastrous rule should not be allowed to stand as the      law of the land  The bipartisan work that produced the Clean Air      Act and the 1990 Amendments established a process for us to begin      cleaning up the toxic mercury spewing out of dirty power plants      across the country  The 1990 Amendments require the Environmental      Protection Agency  EPA  to control each power plant s emissions of      mercury and other toxics by 2008 at the latest  The Act requires      each plant to use the maximum achievable control technology on      every generating unit  That is the law of the land  Anything less      means more pollution  But instead of working to enforce and implement      the Clean Air Act  as two previous Administrations had  the Bush      Administration has turned the Clean Air Act on its head  With this      rule the Administration revokes a 2000 EPA finding that it is      necessary and appropriate to require that each power plant apply      technology to reduce mercury emissions   Let me repeat those plain  startling facts  By      revoking the earlier EPA finding and deciding instead to coddle the      biggest mercury polluters  the Administration is saying it is no      longer necessary or appropriate to adequately control mercury      emissions  Although I am somewhat impressed that they can make this      statement with straight faces  I am appalled at their audacious      disregard for the health of the American people  and  like the      scientific community  I am baffled by their gymnastic arguments   The plain and simple truth is that this rule      will allow more mercury into our environment than does the current      law  Hundreds of the oldest  dirtiest power plants will not even      control mercury emissions for more than a decade  That is what this      rule gives us  More pollution  for longer than the Clean Air Act      allows   This rule is all the more shameful because the      evidence of public health and environmental damage from mercury and      other toxics is clear enough for action right now  We do not need      to wait ten or 20 years to know the facts about mercurys threats to      human health  In fact EPA itself admits these threats  Look at      EPAs own estimate of the      number of newborns at risk of elevated mercury exposure  which has      doubled to 630 000      EPA also found      that one in six pregnant women has mercury levels in her blood above      EPAs safe threshold  The National Academy of Sciences has      confirmed scientific research showing that maternal consumption of      unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause neuro developmental harm      in children  resulting in learning disabilities  poor motor      function  mental retardation  seizures and cerebral palsy   Yet      it seems the majority in Congress and this Administration      want to avoid any public daylight on this flawed rule  The      Environment and Public Works Committee has refused to even hold a      single hearing on this rule  Their aim is to keep the public in the      dark  and I would guess that most Americans in fact do not yet know      what EPA and the big polluters have been up to with this rule  One reason for the Administrations lack of      candor clearly is the discovery that this rule has polluting      industries fingerprints all over it  EPAs first proposal for      these rules lifted exact texts from memorandum provided by utility      industry lobbyists  Another reason may be because the American      people would find a process where the lobbyists are shut in and the      public is shut out  where the scientific and economic analysis was      manipulated  and where the publics health was ignored   But the Administrations arrogance does not      stop there  EPAs own Inspector General and the General      Accountability Office criticized almost every aspect of how EPA      drafted this rule  Unfortunately  their recommendations to improve      it were also ignored  So were more than 680 000 public comments  a      record for any EPA rule  So were the comments of many state      environment departments  attorneys general  doctors  educators       sportsmen groups and EPAs own advisory committees  And  although      it should not come as a surprise after four years working with this      Administration  the comments of 45 Senate and 184 House members were      also ignored  Many of us in the Senate have spent the past      two years  working with three different administrators  trying to      make the Administration follow the Clean Air Act and produce a rule      that puts the publics health over the profits of special      interests  A rule that heeds the science and encourages available      technologies to solve this problem  They failed on all fronts  big      time  Instead they produced a rule that will do      nothing for at least a decade  despite years of analysis by EPA      showing the need for quick action  According to EPAs own      Regulatory Impact Analysis  we will be lucky if one percent of power      plant capacity will have mercury controls by 2015  and only three      percent by 2020   As a Vermonter I know it is appropriate and      necessary to limit the pollution plumes from grandfathered power      plants  You cannot even see my state on EPAs maps showing mercury      pollution because so much of it is being dumped on us from upwind      power plants  Vermonters and New Englanders have been waiting for      decades for EPA to take action so that our lakes can be cleaned up  For      all their talk of family values  the Administration has yet again      put the value of corporate contributions    not families    first       It is not a family value to tell a whole generation of women that      their health is not important  It is not a family value to put      another generation of young kids at risk of learning disabilities       These mercury rules do just that  It is time to put people first  and to stop      letting the big polluters and the special interests write the rules      and run the show over at EPA  This      resolution will ensure that the health and safety of U S  citizens      are fully considered  before EPA rescinds its commitment to protect      public health from the dangers of mercury pollution  To leave      mercury pollution from power plants as the only source of toxic air      pollution that is allowed to avoid rigorous emissions standards      under the Clean Air Act is a risk to the publics health that we      need not  and should not  accept  I      urge my colleagues to support this
