       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Reporters  Shield   Legislation  Issues And Complications                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Reporters Shield Legislation  Issues And Implications     July 20  2005  I am pleased the Committee is      holding this hearing today on such an important matter  While a      small number of cases have garnered significant national attention       the question of whether or not to enact some form of privilege for      journalists has vexed us since      Branzburg v  Hayes was decided by the Supreme Court in      1972  Since that time  31 states and the  District of Columbia      have enacted statutes granting some form of privilege to      journalists  Efforts have been made from time to time to codify a      reporters privilege in federal law  but these attempts failed  in      part because supporters of the concept found it difficult to agree      on how to define the scope of what it means to be a journalist       With bloggers now participating fully in the 24 hour news cycle  we      might face similar challenges in defining terms today     I have long been a champion of a      vibrant and independent press  My interest comes honestly and early      as the son of a struggling  Vermont printer from Montpelier  In      my many years in the Senate  I have aspired to fulfill the ideals of      my father  fighting for a free press and greater transparency in      government  For example  I have long championed the Freedom of      Information Act  which shines a light on the workings of government      and has proven to be an invaluable tool for both reporters and      ordinary citizens  Earlier this year  I introduced legislation with      Senator Cornyn to improve implementation of that critical      legislation  Open government goes hand in hand with freedom of the      press and that is why I have advocated so strongly for it        As a former county prosecutor  I      also understand that our democracy is nothing without a healthy      respect for the law  The issue before us today is especially      important because it requires us to carefully weigh the public      interest in First Amendment press protection and the public interest      in solving crime  Indeed  recent high profile cases have shown just      how thorny this issue can be    This hearing was not called to      address the Valerie Plame leak case in particular  but it is      impossible to imagine that the investigation will not be discussed      today  I have heard from several supporters of a privilege that      they recognize that the facts of the Plame case are not      particularly sympathetic to the cause because they involve an      alleged national security leak from the highest level of government       I hope that our discussion also delves into the many different      circumstances under which a privilege might be raised  both in civil      and criminal cases    I look forward to hearing from the      witnesses broad range of experience and expertise on all sides of      the question  I also want to commend the members who have done the      hard work of drafting legislation that attempts to address this      problem and am eager to hear their statements   We learned just about  9 oclock this      morning that Deputy Attorney General Comey cancelled his appearance      before the Committee  I am disappointed by this  I looked forward      to a meaningful exchange on the issues    Thank you Mr  Chairman
