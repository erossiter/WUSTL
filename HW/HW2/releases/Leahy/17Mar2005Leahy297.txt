       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Budget Resolution                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The FY 2006 Budget Resolution        March 17  2005 The President is setting a        course that jettisons sound stewardship of fiscal policy and that ignores        Americas real needs  from education to first responders  and this budget        resolution largely facilitates that reckless course   Iraqs needs fare well in        the Presidents spending priorities  but Americas needs deserve to fare        better  In record time the Administrations policies already have        converted record surpluses into record deficits  and if these new policies        are enacted  the worst is yet to come  More tax cuts for the wealthy  more        borrowing  more deficits  and fewer investments in the priorities that        really count in the everyday lives of Americas families and communities         We hear a lot in this town about compassionate        conservatism  We hear speeches about declining family values and the        breakdown of the traditional family  And we hear about streamlining        government and making it run more like a business based on cost benefit        analysis   But the truth is  Mr  President  this budget we have        before the Senate today is neither compassionate nor conservative  On the        one hand it slashes  freezes  or totally eliminates funding for programs        that help the poorest and the most vulnerable Americans  and on the other        it uses smoke and mirrors to conceal the creation of a federal deficit        larger than any other in our nations history   This is a difficult time for many Americans  and this        budget will only make things worse  Fifteen million American households        cannot find affordable housing  yet this budget would force housing costs        onto state and local governments   Forty four million Americans do not have health        insurance  yet the budget that was brought to the floor would force the        costs of Medicaid right back onto our cash strapped state and local        governments  I am pleased that we were able to soften this crushing blow        to our states Medicaid programs  for now  with a successful amendment         But there will be determined efforts to undo that vote at every step of the        legislative process that lies ahead   At a time when American companies are forced to hire        from abroad because the students here lag behind in math and science        skills  this budget would eliminate education programs by the dozen and        severely under fund No Child Left Behind programs and funding for        low income schools  Perhaps most disturbingly  as we see more and more        young troops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan in need of long term        medical and psychological care  this budget would dramatically reduce        benefits and services to veterans   I recently received a letter from a charitable        organization that I believe does great work  Catholic Charities USA         describing their views on the proposed budget  I think it will surprise        many members what they say  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of        the March 8  2005  Catholic Charities letter addressed to me be printed in        the Record  What does this charitable religious group ask  Less        funding for family planning efforts  No  More tax cuts for the wealthy         No  Tougher bankruptcy standards to help credit card companies  No         Class action relief for big corporations  No  Yet those have been the        White Houses and the Congresss priorities so far this year  and those are        their priorities in this budget  But what this charitable religious group        convincingly asks that we do is far different  They ask for the        following  They ask Congress and the President to make a higher priority        in the budget of federal programs that protect and support low income        families and other vulnerable people in our society  Oppose the inclusion        of Medicaid cuts in Fiscal Year 2006 budget reconciliation  The budget        resolution should not place arbitrary caps on discretionary spending  And        if Pay As You Go rules are included in budget reconciliation  they should        be balanced   Now  these sound like reasonable proposals that would        help the neediest among us  Those sound like priorities that would benefit        the 35 million people  including 12 million children  now living below        the federal poverty line  These proposals truly sound compassionate   Some claim that the        cuts in this budget are steps toward fiscal responsibility  But anyone who        looks closely at this budget will see that any semblance of fiscal        responsibility is lost because this budget leaves out a number of        governmental costs in the out years  It leaves out the costs of on going        U S  responsibilities in Iraq and Afghanistan  It leaves out the cost of        any repair of the Alternative Minimum Tax system  It leaves out the cost        of extending the Presidents tax cuts  And most incredibly  it leaves out        any of the expected  4 5 trillion in costs for the Presidents plan to        privatize Social Security  With these costs factored in to the equation         the non partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that by 2015 the        United States deficit will reach  527 billion  making each familys share        of the debt an astonishing  85 967   I take very seriously this warning from the Government        Accountability Office in their February 2005 report titled 21st Century        Challenges  Reexamining the Base of the Federal Government   Absent significant changes        on the spending and or revenue sides of the budget  these long term        deficits will encumber a growing share of federal resources and test the        capacity of current and future generations to afford both todays and        tomorrows commitments  Continuing on this unsustainable path will        gradually erode  if not suddenly damage  our economy  our standard of        living and ultimately our national security  Mr  President  this budget will plunge the United        States into red ink as far as the eye can see  We have an obligation to be        honest about the true costs of our budget to the people who are paying for        it  If we continue to follow this path of fiscal irresponsibility  we will        be leaving our children and grandchildren with a debt that they cannot        possibly begin to afford  We need to turn around the massive loss in        total revenues that we have seen during the Bush years  We need to        strengthen our current Social Security system so that less money is drained        from the Trust Fund  And we need to realign our budget priorities with the        real needs of the American people and discard these politically motivated        budget cuts  I may be seen in this town as a progressive Senator        from Vermont  but I have a conservative message for my colleagues today         We cannot continue down this reckless path of financial irresponsibility        that we have been led down for the past four years  We need to get our        fiscal house in order  Foreign investors are growing weary of our record        debt  Our sons and daughters in uniform  including those in our National        Guard and Reserves  are in harms way overseas and need to be properly        equipped and to have the health insurance they deserve  And essential        programs for disadvantaged people across the country are being slashed to        squeeze out more money for tax cuts to the wealthiest among us  This is        not the American way  We are a more compassionate people than this budget        resolution assumes we are   The American people deserve better than fiscal and        budget policies like these  and I will vote against this budget resolution
