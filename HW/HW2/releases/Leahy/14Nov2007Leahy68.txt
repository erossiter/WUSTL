       Statement of Sen  Leahy On Delay In Senate Passage Of The Identity Theft   Enforcement And Restitution Act of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary      On Delay In Senate Passage Of      The Identity Theft Enforcement And Restitution Act Of 2007     November 13  2007 MR  PRESIDENT  I am disappointed that some Senator      is preventing the Senate from taking an important step forward to      combat identity theft and to protect the privacy rights of all      Americans by passing the Leahy Specter Identity Theft Enforcement      and Restitution Act of 2007  This bipartisan cyber crime bill  which      was requested by the Department of Justice  will provide new tools      to federal prosecutors to combat identity theft and other computer      crimes  I know that it is cleared for passage by all Democratic      Senators        The dangers of identity theft and other cyber crimes continue to      increase as our Nation becomes more dependent on high technology  In      fact  just last week  FBI Director Robert Mueller stated that       c yber threats will continue to grow as people become more and      more dependent upon digital technology and we will be vulnerable      to terrible attacks  Prompt Senate action on this bill will brings      us one step closer to providing greatly needed tools to the federal      prosecutors and investigators who are on the front lines of the      battle against identity theft and other cyber crimes  I urge those      objecting to proceeding on this bill to reconsider their actions and      allow the bill to be considered and passed        I thank Senator Specter  who has been a valuable partner in      combating the growing problem of identity theft for many years  for      joining with me to introduce this important privacy bill  I have      once again worked in a bipartisan manner with a group of Senators on      both sides of the aisle to draft this legislation  I thank Senators      Durbin  Grassley  Schumer  Bill Nelson  Inouye  Stevens and      Feinstein for joining with us as cosponsors of this important      legislation        I commend Senators Biden and Hatch for their contributions in this      area  I am pleased that several provisions they have suggested to      further strengthen this cyber crime legislation were included by      amendment in this bill when it was considered and reported by the      Judiciary Committee and that they  too  have now cosponsored our      bill       Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of      Justice in crafting this bill and the Leahy Specter Identity Theft      Enforcement and Restitution Act has the strong support of the      Department of Justice and the Secret Service  This bill is also      supported by a broad coalition of business  high tech and consumer      groups  including Microsoft  Consumers Union  the Cyber Security      Industry Alliance  the Business Software Alliance  AARP and the      Chamber of Commerce        The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act takes several      important and long overdue steps to protect Americans from the      growing and evolving threat of identity theft and other cyber      crimes  First  to better protect American consumers  our bill      provides the victims of identity theft with the ability to seek      restitution in federal court for the loss of time and money spent      restoring their credit and remedying the harms of identity theft  so      that identity theft victims can be made whole        Second  because identity theft schemes are much more sophisticated      and cunning in todays digital era  our bill also expands the scope      of the federal identity theft statutes so that the law keeps up with      the ingenuity of todays identity thieves  Our bill adds three new      crimes  passing counterfeit securities  mail theft  and tax fraud       to the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft       And  in order to better deter this kind of criminal activity  our      bill also significantly increases the criminal penalties for these      crimes  To address the increasing number of computer hacking crimes      that involve computers located within the same State  our bill also      eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that a computers      information must be stolen through an interstate or foreign      communication in order to federally prosecute this crime       Our bill also addresses the growing problem of the malicious use of      spyware to steal sensitive personal information  by eliminating the      requirement that the loss resulting from the damage to a victims      computer must exceed  5 000 in order to federally prosecute this      offense  The bill also carefully balances this necessary change with      the legitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous      prosecutions  and clarifies that the elimination of the  5 000      threshold applies only to criminal cases  In addition  our bill      addresses the increasing number of cyber attacks on multiple      computers  by making it a felony to employ spyware or keyloggers to      damage 10 or more computers  regardless of the aggregate amount of      damage caused  By making this crime a felony  the bill ensures that      the most egregious identity thieves will not escape with minimal      punishment under federal cyber crime laws       Lastly  our bill strengthens the protections for American      businesses  which are more and more becoming the focus of identity      thieves  by adding two new causes of action under the cyber      extortion statute    threatening to obtain or release information      from a protected computer and demanding money in relation to a      protected computer    so that this bad conduct can be federally      prosecuted  In addition  because a business as well as an individual      can be a prime target for identity theft  our bill closes several      gaps in the federal identity theft and the aggravated identity theft      statutes to ensure that identity thieves who target a small business      or a corporation can be prosecuted under these laws  The bill also      adds the remedy of civil and criminal forfeiture to the arsenal of      tools to combat cyber crime and our bill directs the United States      Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines for identity theft      and cyber crime offenses       The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act is a good       bipartisan measure to help combat the growing threat of identity      theft and other cyber crimes to all Americans  This carefully      balanced bill protects the privacy rights of American consumers  the      interests of and business and the legitimate needs of law      enforcement  This privacy bill also builds upon our prior efforts to      enact comprehensive data privacy legislation  The Leahy Specter      Personal Data Privacy and Security Act  S  495  which Senator      Specter and I reintroduced earlier this year  would address the      growing dangers of identity theft at its source  lax data security      and inadequate breach notification  Protecting the privacy and      security of American consumers should be one of the Senates top      legislative priorities and I urge the Majority Leader to take up      that measure at the earliest opportunity       Again  I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have joined      Senator Specter and me in supporting this important privacy      legislation  as well as the many consumer and business groups that      support this bill  I urge whoever is holding up this bipartisan bill      to stop delaying this measure  so that the Senate can promptly pass      this important and much needed privacy bill before the Thanksgiving      recess       I request that a support letter from the Chamber of Commerce be      printed in the record following my remarks
