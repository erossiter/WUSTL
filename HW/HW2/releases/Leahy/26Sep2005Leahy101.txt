       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts    Jr  To Be Chief Justice Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts  Jr        To Be Chief Justice Of The United States      Senate Floor      September 26  2005  There are few decisions we face       here in the Senate that are as consequential and enduring as the       one we take up today  Few in our Nations history have served       as Chief Justice of the  United States  It is a unique and       significant position  and once one assumes it  he or she holds       it for life  We have had 43 Presidents  and only 16 Chief       Justices    I explained last week why I was       supporting John Robertss nomination to be Chief Justice  It       was neither an easy nor a hurried decision  but one that my       conscience led me toward  I thank Senators Reid  Kennedy        Kerry  Lautenberg  Boxer  Obama  and others  for their       thoughtful remarks these past few days  I commend to the Senate       each of the statements made at the Judiciary Committee meeting       on Thursday  The Democratic Senators distinguished themselves       by the thoughtful manner in which they have proceeded  The       hearing record upon which the Senate can draw in making this       decision is as full as it is largely through their diligence        Now each Senator must carefully weigh this question and decide       it for himself or herself    Regardless of how Senators decide       to vote on this nomination  the Democratic members of the       Judiciary Committee can all be proud that we have done our job       and fulfilled our constitutional responsibility to fully  fairly       and openly review this nomination on its merits  For that  I       thank them all  It is true that Democratic Senators are not all       voting in lockstep  Each Senator individually gave this       nomination serious consideration  They have each honored their       constitutional duty and obligation to the American people in       reviewing this nomination  Democratic senators kept open minds       throughout this process  unlike those partisan cheerleaders who       rallied to endorse the White Houses decision long before the       first day of hearings opened    I have served in the Senate for       more than three decades  much of that time on the Judiciary       Committee  This is the 11th Supreme Court justice       nomination on which I cast my vote  I am one vote out of 100        but I recognize that those 100 of us privileged to serve in the       Senate are entrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million       of our fellow citizens  There is no entitlement to confirmation       for lifetime appointments on any court for any nomination by any       President  Democratic or Republican  Americans deserve a       Supreme Court that acts in its finest tradition as a source of       justice  The Supreme Court must be an institution where the       Bill of Rights and human dignity are honored     As I considered this nomination  I       reflected on the hearings and my meetings with Judge Roberts        While I believe Judge Roberts could and should have been more       forthcoming  I was encouraged by his answers to some of my       questions at the hearings and during our meetings     I took Judge Roberts at his word       when he gave the Committee assurances that he would respect       congressional authority  His steadfast reliance on the Supreme       Courts recent Raich decision as significant precedent        contravening further implications from Lopez and Morrison  was       intended to reassure us that he will not join the assault on       congressional authority  I heard him and rely on him to be true       to the impression that he created  To do otherwise would       greatly undermine Congresss ability to serve the interests of       Americans and to protect the environment  ensure equal justice       and provide health care and other basic resources that are so       vitally important to some of our neediest citizens  I think he       knows that now   I was also struck by Judge       Robertss admiration for Justice Robert Jackson  Justice       Jacksons protection of fundamental rights  including unpopular       speech under the First Amendment  and his willingness to serve       as a check on presidential authority are among the finest       actions by any Justice in our history  I expect Judge Roberts       to act in the tradition of Justice Jackson and serve as an       independent check on the President  When he joins the Supreme       Court he can no longer simply defer to presidential authority        We know that we are in a period in which the Executive has a       complicit and compliant Republican Congress that refuses to       serve as an effective check or balance  Without the courts to       fulfill its own constitutional role  excess will continue  and       the balance will be further tilted    The purpose of the law is to serve       justice  A justice on our highest court needs to know in his       core that the words engraved in the  Vermont marble on the Supreme       Court building are not just Under Law but Equal Justice under       Law  Under our great national charter  it is not just the rule       of law that a justice must serve  but the cause of justice   As Chief Justice  John Roberts       will be responsible for the way in which the Judicial Branch       administers justice for all Americans  I was encouraged that he       said he would provide the fifth vote in staying an execution       when four other Justices voted to review a capital case        Effective judicial review is all the more important in an era       in which so many innocent citizens have been sent to death row         I respect those who have come to       different conclusions about this nomination  and I readily       acknowledge the unknowable at this moment  that perhaps they are       right and I am wrong  Only time will tell    In my judgment  in my experience        but especially in my conscience  I find it is better to vote yes       than no  My Vermont       roots have always told me to go with my conscience  and that is       what I have done in this decision    Judge Roberts is a man of       integrity  For me  a vote to confirm requires faith that the       words he spoke to us have meaning  I take him at his word that       he does not have an ideological agenda and that he will be his       own man as Chief Justice  I take him at his word that he will       steer the court to serve as an appropriate check on potential       abuses of presidential power  I hope and trust that he will         This nomination process that we       complete this week provides some important lessons for the       President as he renews his efforts to select a successor to       Justice O Connor  Last week Chairman Specter and I  along with       the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate  met with       the President  I urged him to follow through with meaningful       consultation this time and to share with us his intentions and       seek our advice before he chooses    I remain concerned by the       Administrations lack of cooperation with the Senate on Judge       Robertss nomination  Although we started off well with some       early efforts at consultation  it never resulted in any       meaningful discussions  The Presidents naming of Judge Roberts       first to replace Justice OConnor  and then swapping that       nomination for the vacancy left by Chief Justice Rehnquist  came       as a surprise  not as a result of meaningful consultation        There could and should have been consultation with the Senate       on the nomination of someone to serve as the 17th       Chief Justice of the  United States  and there was not   Other Senators  including       Republican Senators  have offered similar advice  Chairman       Specter has appropriately counseled that the next nominee should       be someone who promotes stability on the court  much like       Justice O Connor  Senator Graham urged the President to listen       to Democratic Senators and what we have to say as he considers       his next nominee  What we are saying is that the President       should be a uniter  not a divider    The White House disserved the       Roberts nomination by withholding information that has       traditionally been shared with the Senate  The Bush       Administration treated Senators requests for information with       little respect for the constitutional role the Senate is       expected to fill in this process  They stonewalled entirely the       narrowly tailored request for the most important work papers       from John Robertss time as the principal deputy to Kenneth       Starr at the Solicitor Generals office  That should not be       allowed to establish a new standard and override the precedent       from Chief Justice Rehnquists hearing and others  Previous       Presidents have paid the appropriate respect to the       constitutional process and the Senate by working with the Senate       to provide such materials  I urge the Administration to work       with us and cooperate on any future nomination     Finally  some Republican Senators       disserved the confirmation process by urging the nominee not to       provide fuller answers during the course of this hearing  The       hearings we hold in the Senate are the best and only opportunity       for the American people to hear from the nominee on important       issues that affect all of us  The hearings we hold are the best       and only opportunity to hear directly from the nominee about his       or her judicial philosophy  Unfortunately  Judge Roberts heeded       that advice to too great a degree and should have been more       forthcoming in his answers    The President asked for a       dignified process and an up or down vote  That is what we       accomplished in the Judiciary Committee  With the Senate vote       this week  we will complete our action and grant the Senates       consent  The hearings were dignified and they were fair        Chairman Specter has every reason to be proud of what the       Committee accomplished under his leadership    With the benefit of lessons       learned from this nomination  the President is facing a new       opportunity to unite this country around a nominee to succeed       Justice O Connor  Now more than ever  with Americans fighting       and dying in Iraq       every day  and hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced by       disasters here at home  it is the time to unite rather than       divide the Nation  The Supreme Court belongs to each and every       American  not to any political party or faction  For our       countrys sake  and for the sake of American people  I urge the       President to live up to his promise  and to unite us with his       next choice
