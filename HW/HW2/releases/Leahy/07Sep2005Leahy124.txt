       Democratic Senators Renew Request For Key Information On Judge John   Roberts                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Democratic Senators      Renew Request     For Key Information On Judge John Roberts  New Nomination to Chief Justice      Adds Greater Significance To Information Administration Refuses To      Share With Senate  Similar Documents Shared During Rehnquist      Hearings  WASHINGTON        Wednesday  Sept  7   The Democratic members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee Wednesday renewed their request for key      information relating to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge John      Roberts Jr   Soon after      receiving the new nomination of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice of      the Supreme Court  the senators sent a letter to Attorney General      Alberto Gonzales Wednesday urging him to reconsider his blanket      refusal to disclose any information based on their targeted      request  The Democratic members of the committee have requested      information relating to only 16 of the hundreds of Supreme Court      cases that Judge Roberts handled as a Principal Deputy to Solicitor      General Ken Starr during the former Bush Administration  Last week       Senate Democratic leaders sent a letter to President Bush supporting      the Committee members request for this information and urged the      Administration to comply     In their      letter  the senators also noted that in previous reviews of Supreme      Court nominees  similar documents were requested and received by the      Judiciary Committee    most notably when the panel was considering      the nomination of the Justice William Rehnquist to be the Chief      Justice of the Supreme Court  During that review  the committee      received internal memoranda from the Department of Justice    Below is the      letter from senators  followed by background articles on the      sensitive documents and information released to the Senate Judiciary      Committee in 1986  during the late Chief Justice Rehnquists      nomination hearing             September 7       2005 The Honorable      Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C       20530 Dear Attorney      General Gonzales  We are      disappointed in the Department of Justices response to our letter      of August 12th suggesting a meeting with you to discuss      our limited request for documents relating to Judge John G  Roberts       Jr s work on a select set of cases when he served as Principal      Deputy Solicitor General  We sought an opportunity to meet with you      to work out a solution to the impasse  Instead  we received a      letter from an Assistant Attorney General who was delegated the task      of once again flatly refusing even to discuss our narrowly tailored      document request  That was a wholly inadequate response to our      efforts  to our offer to work with you to resolve confidentiality      concerns  and to the other points we made in our letter    We will not      belabor the arguments we set out in our previous letter  The      documents we have requested from Judge Robertss time in the most      senior Executive Branch position he held are of unparalleled      relevance to our evaluation of his fitness for the position to which      the President has now decided to nominate him  that of Chief Justice      of the United States  There is no precedent for applying      attorney client privilege to the Senates requests for documents       and much precedent in the opposite direction that supports our      request  including the statements of prominent Republican Senators      and the production of similar documents for past nominees  including      the late Chief Justice  Your      predecessor  Attorney General Robert H  Jackson  who was a Solicitor      General and later became one of our finest Supreme Court Justices       and coincidentally one of Judge Robertss favorites  directly      contradicted your newfound position  In an Attorney General      Opinion  he wrote that when the Senate is called upon to consider a      nomination  confidential information should be provided because no      person should be submitted whose entire history will not stand      light  40 U S  Op  Atty  Gen  45  1941    These      principles are especially true in the evaluation of Judge Roberts       who was a political appointee in a leadership position within the      government  This was a key distinction noted by Walter Dellinger in      a recent column in The Washington Post and by The      Washington Post editorial board in urging administration      cooperation  as well  In fact  Judge Roberts was willing to speak      candidly in public about his role within the Office of the Solicitor      General and his part in the deliberations about certain specific      cases at a 2003 conference about the Office   See Rex E  Lee      Conference on the Office of the Solicitor General of the United      States  2003 B Y U  Law Review 1    Indeed  the      most recent letter we received from the Department of Justice      indicates that  even in your view  there is a balancing process      applicable to the determination of which documents should be turned      over  and we suggest that  especially with Judge Roberts now      nominated to the position of Chief Justice  that balance falls      clearly on the side of disclosure  With respect to      protecting the confidentiality of other attorneys in the Office of      the Solicitor General whose memos were reviewed and commented upon      by Roberts  we remain willing to work with you to address these and      any other confidentiality concerns  For example  we could work out      a system of redacting the names of staff attorneys  For the last      several weeks  we have been asking you to work with us  We are      increasingly concerned about the inference raised by your continued      refusal even to speak with us about accommodating our reasonable      request for documents which are entirely within your control  As      the D C  Circuit has stated  when a      party has relevant evidence within his control which he fails to      produce  that failure gives rise to an inference that the evidence      is unfavorable to him  International Union v  National Labor      Relations Board  459 F 2d 1329  1336  D C  Cir  1972   see      also Evans v  Robbins  897 F 2d 966  970  8th      Cir  1990   Gumbs v  International Harvester  Inc   718 F 2d      88  96  3d Cir  1983    The Presidents      recent decision to nominate Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice makes      obtaining these documents all the more important to our performing a      fair and complete evaluation of Judge Roberts nomination  We urge      you to reconsider your decision to withhold these critical      documents  Sincerely  Patrick Leahy     Edward Kennedy     Joseph Biden     Herb Kohl     Dianne Feinstein      Russ Feingold     Charles Schumer     Richard Durbin               Background  1986

PANEL GETS MORE MEMOS      BYLINE  By LINDA GREENHOUSE  Special to the New York Times      DATELINE  WASHINGTON  Aug  7      BODY      Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today requested      and received access to additional documents dating from William H       Rehnquist s service as head of the Justice Department s Office of      Legal Counsel       But despite the widening inquiry  several key senators said that      nothing appeared likely to emerge that could threaten Justice      Rehnquist s confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States  It      seemed unlikely that Justice Rehnquist would be asked to appear      again before the committee  which is to vote next Thursday on his      nomination and that of Judge Antonin Scalia to be an Associate      Justice       Senator Paul Simon  an Illinois Democrat  said the new request was      prompted by references in the initial 24 documents  delivered to the      committee Tuesday night  to other conversations and memorandums        Senator Simon  who played a key role in pressing the initial      request  described the request for some two dozen additional      documents as a follow up  adding    I don t anticipate there will be      anything sensational         The Justice Department complied with the request late today       providing four additional documents under the same conditions of      secrecy by which it gave the committee access to the initial      documents  The Administration  facing the likelihood of a vote by      the Judiciary Committee to subpoena the original group of documents       backed down Tuesday from its position that it would not supply the      material         Thus far I have not found a smoking gun    Senator Joseph R  Biden      Jr  of Delaware  the committee s ranking Democrat  said today       Senator Patrick J  Leahy  a Vermont Democrat  said    I don t see      anything there that would lead to having anyone run down shouting        Look at this           Senator Arlen Specter  a Pennsylvania Republican  said he saw   no      reason to question the ultimate confirmation   of Justice Rehnquist       Senator Specter provided key support for the committee s Democrats      in the effort to obtain the documents           Prepared in 1969 71      The documents at issue were prepared by or for Mr  Rehnquist in the      period from 1969 to 1971 when he served as an Assistant Attorney      General in the Nixon Administration  As head of the Office of Legal      Counsel  he provided legal advice to the Attorney General  John N       Mitchell  and other Administration officials       For example  there is a memorandum from Mr  Rehnquist to John W       Dean 3d  then the White House counsel  discussing executive orders      dealing with access to classified information  Another memorandum to      Mr  Dean summarizes Supreme Court cases dealing with the      constitutional rights of criminal defendants       None of the documents have been made public  and senators have been      noticeably circumspect in describing the material in any detail  The      most vivid description was provided by Senator Edward M  Kennedy       who has been the strongest opponent of the Rehnquist nomination       Senator Kennedy said that after reviewing the material he had   no      question   that Mr  Rehnquist   was very much involved in fashioning      and shaping Government policy in spying on domestic groups and      individuals during the antiwar period and in the use of the Army and      the F B I  during the May Day period    He was referring to a mass      protest against the Vietnam War in Washington on May 1  1971           Kennedy Plans Investigation      The Massachusetts Democrat said his staff would spend the next few      days determining precisely what the documents showed about Mr       Rehnquist s role in those activities and how that portrait compared      to various statements he made over the years    It gets back to the      issue of how forthcoming he has been before committees of      Congress    Senator Kennedy said       Senator Howard M  Metzenbaum  an Ohio Democrat  said he also had      unresolved questions about Justice Rehnquist s   candor    He said      some Democrats might move to have Justice Rehnquist called back to      the committee for further questioning       But Senator Strom Thurmond  the South Carolina Republican who heads      the Judiciary Committee  said that while Justice Rehnquist was      welcome to come before the committee  his appearance would not be      requested  A majority of the 18 members would have to vote to      overrule the chairman       Asked whether Justice Rehnquist would be called back before the      committee  Senator Leahy said    As a practical matter  he s not      coming back    He added  however  that he was sorry he had not seen      the documents before Justice Rehnquist s confirmation hearing last      week    I could have asked better questions and we could have had a      better hearing    Senator Leahy said              The New York Times     August 8  1986  Friday  Late City Final Edition       SECTION
