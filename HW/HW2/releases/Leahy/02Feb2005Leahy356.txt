       Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy on the Dismissal of the Nepalese  Government                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT        Statement of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee     A Step Backwards in Nepal      Congressional Record     February 2  2005    MR  LEAHY  Mr  President       yesterday  for the second time in less than three years  King      Gyanendra of Nepal dismissed the multiparty government and      declared a state of emergency suspending fundamental      constitutional rights  Apparently  he will assume the duties of      the deposed Prime Minister and appoint a new Cabinet       Throughout its troubled past  Nepal has suffered from the      neglect and often violent and corrupt misrule of many monarchs       For that reason  those familiar with its history may not be      completely surprised by this unfortunate development        Yet one would have thought that in the 21st Century  this type      of thing would  by now  be a distant memory  At a time when a      vicious Maoist insurgency is gaining ground in Nepal  it would      be hard to conceive of a worse time for the King to repeat his      past mistake        There is no military solution to this conflict  Nepal is a place      where  not unlike Afghanistan  a handful of extremists with      rifles and explosives can wreak havoc and easily disappear into      the rugged countryside  By terrorizing rural villagers and      exploiting the Governments neglect of them  the Maoists have      steadily extended their reach to large areas of the country        The Nepalese Army  while somewhat more effective than a few      years ago when it performed little more than ceremonial duties       has likewise alienated much of the rural population by      arbitrarily arresting  disappearing and killing civilians      suspected of sympathizing with the Maoists  Today  the Army       rather than defending democracy  is defending the King  It is      clear that the King and the Army concocted this together       despite having assured the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights      last week that concerns about violations of human rights would      be addressed        This year  the United States plans to provide some  40 million      in economic aid to Nepal  Much of this is channeled by USAID      through nongovernmental organizations  But we are also providing      support to the Nepalese Government  as well as training and      equipment to the Army  In fact  several months ago we approved      the transfer of  1 million in fiscal year 2004 military      equipment that had not initially been appropriated for Nepal       The Indian Government  to its credit  issued a strong statement      critical of the Kings actions  The State Department has also      called for the immediate restoration of multiparty democracy       King Gyanendra is on notice that he will be held responsible for      infringement of the rights of free speech and assembly  or      abuses of citizens who have defended human rights and democracy            The State Department should also make clear that unless      democratic government and fundamental rights are promptly      restored  the United States will cut off aid to the Government      and the Army under Section 508 of the Foreign Operations Act      which was designed to deter and punish this type of act       Regardless of whether or not the King may have acted within his      authority under Nepals Constitution  and I do not know if he      did or not  that is not the issue  The intent of our law to      safeguard democracy is clear  The price is losing U S  aid       Furthermore  if the  1 million in military equipment previously      transferred has not yet been delivered  it should be withheld            Everyone who has followed Nepals recent history would agree      that its ten year experiment with democracy has not been easy       Democracy is never easy  and no one should minimize the threat      the Maoists pose  But the answer is not to undermine democracy       The answer  as President Bush expressed in his Inaugural      Address  is to work  with help from the international community       to strengthen democracy  I believe the United States Congress      would welcome that opportunity       Mr  President  King Gyanendra has made a tragic blunder  He      still has time to prevent a momentary crisis from becoming a      disaster for his country and perhaps for the monarchy itself
