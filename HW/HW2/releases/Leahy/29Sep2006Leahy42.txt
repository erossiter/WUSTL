       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Preventing Civilian Casualities In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy     Preventing Civilian Casualties In Iraq    September 29  2006  Mr  LEAHY  The heart wrenching reports of civilian     casualties in Iraq  each one of whom represents a mother  father  son or     daughter who has been injured or killed in the crossfire or as a result     of deliberate attacks  should deeply concern us  Thousands of innocent     Iraqi men  women and children have died as a result of suicide bombs      shootings  improvised explosive devices  or from tragic mistakes at U S      military checkpoints   There is not enough time today to discuss this     issue in depth  There are too many incidents  and too many issues  from     the widespread and inappropriate use of cluster munitions in populated     areas which indiscriminately and disproportionately injure and kill     civilians  to the despicable acts of terrorism that are designed to     cause the maximum amount of suffering among innocent people   I do want to mention that both the Department of     Defense and the U S  Agency for International Development have programs     in both Iraq and Afghanistan to provide condolence payments or     assistance to civilians who have been injured or the families of those     killed as a result of U S  military operations  The USAID program is     named after Marla Ruzicka who died in a car bombing in Baghdad on April     16  2005  at the age of 28  Marla devoted the last years of her life     getting assistance to innocent victims of the military operations in     Afghanistan and Iraq  and the organization she founded  Campaign for     Innocent Victims in Conflict  continues to work on these issues in both     countries   The Pentagon s condolence program  which is     administered by Judge Advocate General officers in the field  provides     limited amounts of compensation depending on the nature of the loss  The     program has suffered from some administrative weaknesses which I will     speak about at greater length at another time  However  it does     represent an acknowledgement by U S  military commanders that it is     neither right  nor is it in our interest  to turn our backs on innocent     people who have been harmed as a result of our mistakes   I also want to mention a June 6  2006  Wall Street     Journal article entitled   U S  Curbs Iraqi Civilian Deaths In     Checkpoint  Convoy Incidents    and I ask unanimous consent that it be     printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks   The PRESIDING OFFICER  Without objection  it is so     ordered    See Exhibit 1    Mr  LEAHY  This article describes laudable efforts     by the Department of Defense to reduce civilian casualties that have so     often resulted from mistakes that could have been avoided with     relatively simple precautions at checkpoints   For years  I and others urged the Pentagon to     ensure that U S  checkpoints were clearly marked and that soldiers at     checkpoints in Iraq are trained to warn drivers in ways that avoid     confusion  not simply with lights or by firing their guns into the air     which a driver might not see or that could cause a driver to panic  For     years  we were ignored  with horrific incident after horrific incident      whole families gunned down  or only young children left alive after     their parents in the front seat were riddled with bullets   Iraq is an extraordinarily dangerous place and     attacks against our troops often happen without a moment s notice  Split     second decisions are sometimes necessary  No one suggests that our     troops should not be able to defend themselves or that they should be     penalized for unavoidable mistakes  But Pentagon officials stubbornly     refused to heed the most reasonable  constructive suggestions  always     insisting that they were acting according to procedures   Those procedures were woefully inadequate and they     devalued innocent Iraqi lives  It is inexcusable  because it was so     obvious and many casualties could have been avoided with the changes     that field commanders have recently made  All it took was caring enough     to do it   The article also mentions that the Pentagon has     finally been investigating and reporting on civilian casualties  It is     not an exact science  since sometimes a person dressed like a civilian     is actually an enemy combatant  but it is vitally important that we do     our best to determine the cause of civilian casualties that result from     our actions   Section 1223 of H R  1815  the fiscal year 2006     Defense Authorization Act  requires a report on the Pentagon s     procedures for recording civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan      That report  a copy of which I only just received  is an embarrassment      It totals just two pages and it makes clear that the Pentagon does very     little to determine the cause of civilian casualties or to keep a record     of civilian victims   No one expects our troops to be forensic     investigators  but we do expect the Pentagon to take this issue     seriously and to do its best to document and maintain a record of     civilian casualties  By doing so we can make clear that we value     innocent lives  we are better able to know when and how to assist the     families of those injured or killed  and we can make changes to     procedures to prevent such mistakes in the future    From the     Wall Street Journal  June 6  2006  U S  Curbs Iraqi Civilian Deaths     In Checkpoint  Convoy Incidents   By Greg Jaffe  WASHINGTON  The U S  military has cut the number of     Iraqi civilians killed at U S  checkpoints or shot by U S  convoys to     about one a week today from about seven a week in July  according to     U S  defense officials in Iraq   The reduction in civilian casualties shows that     months before the killing of 24 Iraqis in the western Iraqi town of     Haditha came to light  the military was pushing to reduce the number of     Iraqi civilians killed or wounded at the hands of U S  forces  The drop     since July  however  suggests that hundreds of Iraqi civilians were     killed at U S  checkpoints or on Iraqi highways during the first two     years of the war   The shooting of civilians in such instances has     angered Iraqi civilians and political leaders  It also likely has helped     fuel the insurgency  Last week  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki     lashed out at U S  forces for showing   no respect for citizens      smashing civilian cars and killing on a suspicion or a hunch    Mr      Maliki s comments were driven in part by the news that U S  military     investigators had opened a pair of formal probes into the mid November     incident in Haditha in which Marines allegedly killed two dozen unarmed     civilians  including several women and children without provocation      Evidence indicates that the Marines tried to blame the incident on a     roadside bomb and an ambush from insurgents  say lawmakers and U S      officials familiar with the probes   In contrast with the Haditha incident  where the     killings are alleged to be intentional  checkpoint and convoy shootings     are almost always the result of mistakes in which confused or     disoriented Iraqi drivers don t respond to initial warnings from U S      forces to slow down or back off  U S  officials say  U S  forces      worried about their own security and that of their colleagues  must make     split second decisions to fire warning shots or open fire   Such shooting incidents  or escalation of force     incidents  as military officials call them  result in civilian     casualties in 12  of the cases  The numbers don t include civilians     killed in raids resulting from bad intelligence or Iraqis killed in the     crossfire of battles with insurgents   Until July 2005  the U S  military didn t track     civilian casualties in these incidents  senior military officials say      In December  President Bush estimated that about 30 000 Iraqi civilians     had been killed since the war started  His spokesman  however  said the     estimate was based on media reports and not a formal military count   The military s failure to track such killings has     drawn criticism from human rights experts    If you don t keep track of     the civilians you harm  you don t know how you are doing    said Sarah     Sewall  director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard     University  She praised the military for paying more attention to the     problem but lamented that it took so long   Since arriving in Iraq as the No 2 military     official in January  Lt  Gen  Peter Chiarelli has made reducing Iraqi     civilian casualties in escalation of force incidents a bigger priority      Gen  Chiarelli has been critical of the U S  military for using force     too quickly     It is something he has been pushing since we got     into theater  and we have been making good progress    said a military     officer familiar with the general s efforts  Some of the decrease has     been the result of changes in tactics and training  Military commanders     have been ordered to ensure that their checkpoints all use the same     signs and setup to minimize confusion   U S  soldiers have been given new equipment such as     sirens and green lasers that allow them to get Iraqi drivers  attention     without firing warning shots  Soldiers also have been schooled in new     ways of spotting suicide bombers   In April  Gen  Chiarelli directed his subordinate     commanders to investigate all escalation of force incidents that result     in an Iraqi being seriously wounded or killed or cause more than  10 000     in property damage  The results must be sent to Gen  Chiarelli s Baghdad     headquarters  Before his order  such incidents weren t always     investigated   In recent months  senior military officials have     focused less on finding insurgents and more on keeping soldiers in one     place  where they provide daily security for the population    They are     getting into small towns more and staying for a longer period of time      That cuts down on mistakes    says Andrew Krepinevich  executive     director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments  a     Washington defense think tank
