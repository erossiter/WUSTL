       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Reauthorizing The Voting Rights Act s   Temporary Provisions                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Reauthorizing The Voting Rights Act s Temporary Provisions       Policy Perspectives And Views From The Field      Hearing Before The Subcommittee      On the Constitution  Civil Rights And Property Rights      June 21  2006  This afternoon the Chairman of       this Subcommittee has called for  a hearing with a very broad scope        In the full Judiciary Committee  we have already held six       hearings on various aspects of S  3274  the Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments of 2006  We have heard from       dozens of academics  practitioners and local election       administrators in the course of these hearings  They have       provided hours of testimony and represented many different       perspectives  I anticipate we will receive similar testimony at       this subcommittee hearing today      I regret that       despite Chairman Sensenbrenners strong leadership in holding a       dozen hearings and building a strong bipartisan consensus in       favor of H R  9  the House of Representatives postponed their       vote on the Voting Rights Act this afternoon  We all know it       would have received overwhelming bipartisan support and we need       to act now  I expect that they will move forward very soon       because the Voting Rights Act is a keystone of the body of civil       rights laws that changed our country  Congresses since then       have come together in bipartisanship to renew the Act        recognizing its continuing vitality and importance  It would be       a travesty for the 109th Congress to break that historic       solidarity with American values and with the importance of       protecting the foundational right to vote    The Chairman of the       Judiciary Committee has stated that he intends to complete       hearings on reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act by early next       week  We have dedicated significant time to this matter over       the course of three months now and I hope we can complete       consideration of the bill at executive sessions before the       Independence Day recess  Despite todays unnecessary delay  we       expect the House of Representatives to vote soon on final       passage of its bill  and we expect that bipartisan vote to be       overwhelmingly in support of the bill  Now  the spotlight turns       to us and time is of the essence  Instead of holding hearing       after hearing on the very same provisions  Members can invite       witnesses to submit written testimony that they believe to be       relevant to this most important civil rights issue      In his famous I       have a dream speech  Martin Luther King  Jr  noted that  w hen       the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of       the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence  they were       signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall       heir  The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important       methods of enforcing this promise  Congress has reauthorized       and revitalized the Act four times  each time with       overwhelmingly bipartisan support pursuant to its constitutional       powers    The enactment of the       Voting Rights Act in 1965       transformed the landscape of political inclusion  As people are       able to register  vote  and elect candidates of their choice        their interests get attention and their rights are protected        Prior to the Act  minorities of all races faced major barriers       to participation in the political process  through the use of       such devices as poll taxes  exclusionary primaries  intimidation       by voting officials  language barriers  and systematic vote       dilution  We have made significant progress toward a more       inclusive democracy but the obstacles to full enjoyment of the       franchise have morphed over time  Fortunately  instances of       blatant denials of the right to vote are far less common but the       abridgment of the right is still a major problem in some parts       of the country  We should not let this historic Act sunset       merely because the obstacles have becomes more subtle        Abridgement of the right to vote is a violation of the       promissory note that our nations founders embedded in the       Constitution and that their successors wrote into the 15th       Amendment     We have heard from       numerous witnesses that if we fail to reauthorize the Acts       expiring provisions  in particular Sections  5 and 203  we       risk our Nation backsliding on fundamental freedoms        Unfortunately  the work of the expiring provisions to remedy the       denial of voting rights remains incomplete in many parts of the       country  We must give these provisions time to solidify the       gains that we have been making as a Nation     Our Committee record       is full of modern instances of discriminatory tactics employed       since the Act was last reauthorized in jurisdictions covered by       the temporary provisions  The state reports prepared by civil       rights experts and practitioners set forth in great detail       evidence of recurring problems in those jurisdictions  I look       forward to the completion of the remaining state reports and       their inclusion in the Senate hearing record      The Chairman of this       Subcommittee is one of the leading Republican co sponsors of       Senate Bill 2703  I look forward to working with him to pass       this legislation to reauthorize and revitalize the Voting Rights       Act  I extend a warm welcome today to the witnesses who have       traveled here to testify and look forward to receiving their       testimony
