       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy In Support Of The Confirmation Of Gen    Michael V  Hayden To Be Director Of The Central Intelligence Agency                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      In Support Of The Confirmation      Of Gen  Michael V  Hayden      To Be Director Of The Central Intelligence Agency      May 26  2006  In several crucial respects  the       CIA today is in disarray  and fixing our premier intelligence       agency must be a top priority  The CIA must become as effective       as we need it to be in combating terrorism and in serving all of       our national security interests  The keys to a strong and       competent CIA are the independence and proficiency of its       leadership   I had a lengthy private discussion       with General Hayden in deciding how I would vote on his       confirmation  Our discussion confirmed the confidence that I       have long had in General Haydens professionalism and       competence  I remain outraged about the controversial domestic       surveillance initiatives that the NSA has overseen at the White       Houses direction  but the fact remains that President Bush and       Vice President Cheney  not General Hayden    were the       deciders in ordering this surveillance of Americans  with       then White House Counsel Gonzales acting in his capacity to       validate a program that was structured and operated outside the       checks and balances of existing law   The CIA right now is in desperate       need of professionalism after the debacle of the agencys       outgoing leadership  and my discussions with General Hayden have       led me to conclude that he has the competence  the experience       and the independence to serve capably in helping to repair the       damage that has been done to the Agency  I will vote for his       confirmation
