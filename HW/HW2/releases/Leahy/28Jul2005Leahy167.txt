       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The United States And Nepal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The United States And Nepal     July 28  2005 I rise to speak      about the situation in Nepal  which has received too little      attention by the Congress   I will not take      the time to discuss in detail the history of this tiny country      wedged between China and India  Suffice it to say that not only is      Nepal among the worlds least developed countries  it is also facing      a ruthless Maoist insurgency and a political crisis instigated by      King Gyanendra which together threaten to turn Nepal into a failed      state   Last year  after      receiving disturbing reports of widespread human rights violations      by the Royal Nepalese Army  including arrests  disappearances       torture and extrajudicial killings of civilians  the Congress      imposed a number of conditions on our military aid to Nepal  Those      conditions required the Nepalese Government to  1  comply with      habeas corpus orders issued by the Supreme Court of Nepal   2       cooperate with the National Human Rights Commission to identify and      resolve all security related cases of individuals in government      custody   3  grant the National Human Rights Commission unimpeded      access to all places of detention  and  4  take effective steps to      end torture by security forces and prosecute members of such forces      who are responsible for gross violations of human rights  Unfortunately       not only have those conditions not been met  the situation was made      significantly worse on February 1st when King Gyanendra       with the backing of the security forces  dissolved the multiparty      government  arrested and jailed political opponents  human rights      activists and journalists  and declared a state of emergency  The      state of emergency has since been lifted  but civil liberties       including freedom of the press and association  remain restricted       the former Prime Minister has been jailed for corruption by an      extrajudicial  politically motivated anti corruption commission  and      arrests of journalists and democracy activists continue  Speaking with one      voice  the United States  Great Britain  and India condemned the      Kings actions as a setback for democracy  They said it would make      it more difficult to resolve the Maoist problem  and each country      imposed varying types of restrictions on military aid  Since then       however  the American Embassy has adopted a more nuanced approach       sending mixed messages that have been widely interpreted as giving      equal consideration and validity to the views and actions of the      King and the political parties  Unfortunately  the impression today      of Nepalese pro democracy and human rights activists is that the      United States is not fully behind them  The army insists      it is complying with habeas corpus orders of the Supreme Court       This is deceiving  however  because the security forces  often in      plain clothes  have been re arresting people who the court has      ordered released  In some instances they have waited at the      courthouse steps to take people back into custody immediately after      they are set free by the court  Since these arrests are often made      without charges  the whereabouts and treatment of these people is      often unknown   In April  the      term of the National Human Rights Commission expired and the      government reconstituted the Commission in a manner that was      incompatible with the 1990 Nepalese Constitution  The membership of      the Commission has also changed  with the exception of the      chairman  Not surprisingly  none of the current members  appointed      by the palace  expressed publicly any disagreement with the Kings      February 1st actions  including the arrests and      curtailing of civil liberties  The chairman of the Commission even      expressed support for the Kings actions  This has caused      legitimate concerns about the Commissions independence  There is      conflicting information about the governments cooperation with the      National Human Rights Commission in resolving security related cases      of persons in custody  According to human rights groups  the      situation has not improved  The Commission has said it is getting      better access to places of detention  but it is not clear how      meaningful this access is  We know there are large numbers of      people who have disappeared  yet we are informed that when members      of the Commission visit army barracks they have seen few detainees       are led around by army escorts  and that some barracks where      detainees were reported to be held were completely empty  There is      a concern that the army is summarily executing prisoners       Meanwhile  the International Red Cross has suspended its visits to      prisoners because of the armys failure to provide the access it      requires  The issue of      ending torture and prosecuting members of the security forces who      commit gross violations of human rights  is also difficult to      assess  According to human rights groups  torture is routinely      practiced and impunity remains the norm  The army claims it      disciplines its members who violate human rights  but many of the      cases it cites do not involve human rights violations  According to      the army officer who heads the armys human rights cell  complaints      about human rights violations by the army are much ado about      nothing  Those words speak volumes  Under our law       the Secretary of State is to determine whether the conditions have      been met  As a sponsor of the law  I would expect that prior to      making any determination she would consult with representatives of      reputable human rights groups  including the UN High Commissioner      for Human Rights  as well as with the British and Indian      governments  It is important that we and they be seen as united on      these issues  In that regard  I would hope that she would consider      the implications of such a determination in the context of the      larger political crisis  We do not want to do anything that could      be seen as further evidence that the United States supports the King      when he is using the army and police to crush the forces of      democracy  Last week  the      Senate revisited the conditions on our military aid for Nepal       Since those conditions were enacted prior to February 1st       they have in large measure been eclipsed by subsequent events  The      Senate determined that modifications were needed  and those changes      were adopted unanimously on July 20  2005  in an amendment to the      fiscal year 2006 State  Foreign Operations Appropriations bill  I      ask unanimous consent that the amendment  which if agreed to by the      Senate House conference committee will apply to United States      military aid for Nepal for the fiscal year beginning October 1       2005  be printed in the Record at the end of these remarks  Nepal is a      breathtakingly beautiful country facing immense challenges  The      majority of its people are illiterate  subsistence farmers who are      caught between the Maoists  who extort money and food  forcibly      recruit their children  and commit atrocities  and the army which      mistreats and often shoots those suspected of sympathizing with the      Maoists   The King  while      professing to support democracy  seems determined to take the      country back to the pre 1990 feudal days  This is not the first      time he has dismissed the Prime Minister  and since February 1st      he has surrounded himself with elderly advisors from the Panchayat      era  He has ignored repeated urgings by our ambassador  and other      governments  to sit down with representatives of the political      parties to develop a plan for the prompt restoration of multiparty      democracy   As in any country      where multiparty democracy has existed for only a decade and a half       Nepals fledgling political parties suffer from internal divisions      and are struggling to establish their credibility with the Nepalese      people  This should surprise no one  Democracy is never perfect       and that is particularly true in an impoverished  isolated kingdom      whose people have been ruled by a monarchy that ignored their needs      for centuries  Yet  despite these obstacles  Nepalese journalists       political activists and civil society continue to speak out    What is the      alternative  A Maoist peoples republic that could plunge Nepal      into darkness  A return to an active monarchy that is accountable      to no one   Nepal is at an      historic juncture  The Maoists have made steady gains over the past      decade  Once a minor irritant  today they are a national menace       Even since 2001  when King Gyanendra ascended the throne and became      commander in chief of the army  the Maoists have grown stronger       Although they are unable to hold territory or to seize power in      Katmandu  they pose an increasing threat to the security and      livelihoods of Nepals people   The King has made      a tragic blunder  and the Nepalese people are paying a heavy price       Former Prime      Minister Deuba is in prison  which the State Department has rightly      called a setback for democracy  This week there were new arrests       On July 25  several dozen journalists and civil society leaders were      arrested and detained for over 24 hours during a peaceful protest       On July 27  a pro democracy student leader  Gagan Thapa  was      arrested while attempting to visit fellow detained student leaders       Mr  Thapa is reportedly being held on suspicion of sedition  His      arrest is a threat to all democracy activists and should be strongly      condemned by the State Department  The Kings      strongest card is the army  but it lacks an effective      counterinsurgency capability  it cannot defeat the Maoists in      territory as rugged and isolated as parts of Afghanistan  and it has      abused and alienated the very people it is supposed to protect  The      army needs to demonstrate that it is worthy  if it wants U S       support   Earlier this      year  in order to avoid criticism at the UN Human Rights Commission       the King agreed to permit the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights      to open an office in Nepal and deploy human rights monitors  This      is a welcome development  which the U S  should strongly support       If the UN monitors are provided with unimpeded access  they should      be able to determine if the Maoists are prepared to stop attacking      civilians and recruiting children  and if the army is serious about      respecting international humanitarian law   Recently  the UN      Secretary Generals Special Advisor traveled to Nepal to assess the      situation  He concluded that a solution to the crisis rests on      three elements  a return to constitutional order and multiparty      democracy  an end to hostilities  and inclusive national dialogue      towards a negotiated solution to the underlying causes of      conflict  The UN has a long history in Nepal  and it could play a      key facilitating role on each of these elements  I would hope that      the State Department would publicly support this  No one should      minimize the challenges  The Maoists have yet to demonstrate that      they are ready to abide by a ceasefire  which should be a      prerequisite for negotiations on their political demands  But our      policy should be unambiguous  Democracy is the only viable      alternative  and we should make clear that we unequivocally reject      the Kings imperial ambitions  that the days of an active monarchy      are over  and that we support the political parties  Whether that      means the restoration of the 1999 Parliament or the formation of a      new constituent assembly  is for the Nepalese people to decide  but      there should be no doubt that we support a political process that is      open  transparent  inclusive and accountable to the people  Democracy and      dialogue are the key to peace in Nepal  and we should do everything      possible to reaffirm our willingness to work with the political      parties  with Nepalese civil society  the Indian government  the      British government  other key countries  and with the United      Nations  towards that end
