       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Reauthorization Of The Temporary   Provisions Of The Voting Rights Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of      Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Opening Statement On The Reauthorization     Of The Temporary Provisions      Of The Voting Rights Act     April 27  2006  I extend a warm welcome today to our      distinguished witnesses  the House Judiciary Chairman and Ranking      Member  and we thank them for appearing before this Committee as we      begin our Senate hearings on the Voting Rights Act  I also want to      express my appreciation to the rest of the House Judiciary      Committee  especially Representatives Nadler  Chabot and Watt  for      their hard work on 10 hearings on the effectiveness and continuing      need for the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act     There are few things as critical to      the fabric of our nation  and to American citizenship  as voting       The right to vote and to have your vote count is a foundational      right  like our First Amendment rights  because it secures the      effectiveness of other protections  The legitimacy of our      government is dependent on the access all Americans have to the      political process    As we begin Senate hearings on the      Voting Rights Act  we are reminded of the historic struggle for      civil rights led by such American heroes as Dr  Martin Luther King       Jr  and Coretta Scott King  We remember the courageous act of Rosa      Parks  who refused to be treated as a second class citizen  And we      recall how on March 7  1965  in Selma  Alabama  John Lewis and his      fellow civil rights marchers fought for their right to vote but were      attacked brutally by state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge        The events of that day  now known as      Bloody Sunday  were captured in news photos and on television  and      those powerful images marked a crucial turning point in securing the      right to vote for all Americans  A few days after the violence of      Bloody Sunday  President Lyndon Johnson outlined the proposed Voting      Rights Act of 1965  before a joint session of Congress  Within      months  Congress passed it so that the Constitutions guarantees of      equal access to the electoral process  regardless of race  would not      be undermined by discriminatory practices    The pervasive discriminatory tactics      that led to the original Voting Rights Act were deeply rooted  As a      nation  this fight dated back almost 100 years  to the      ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870  the last of      the post Civil War Reconstruction amendments  It took      implementation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for people of all      races in many parts of our country to gain the effective exercise of      rights guaranteed 95 years earlier by the 15th      Amendment    Congress has reauthorized and      revitalized the Act four times  each time with overwhelmingly      bipartisan support  I am particularly pleased that today we are      repeating the bicameral and bipartisan process of the 1982      reauthorization  a process in which the Chairman and I were both      Members of this Committee  along with Senators Kennedy  Biden  Hatch      and Grassley  Under the chairmanship of Senator Strom Thurmond       reauthorization was reported by this Committee and passed both      houses of Congress         The      Expiring Provisions  The enactment of the Voting Rights Act      in 1965 transformed the landscape of political inclusion  As people      are able to register  vote  and elect candidates of their choice       their interests and rights get attention  Prior to the Act       minorities of all races faced major barriers to participation in the      political process  through the use of such devices as poll taxes       exclusionary primaries  intimidation by voting officials  language      barriers  and systematic vote dilution  We have made significant      progress toward a more inclusive democracy    Still  I fear that if we fail to      reauthorize the Acts expiring provisions  in particular Sections 5      and 203  our country is likely to backslide  Unfortunately  the      work of the expiring provisions to remedy the denial of voting      rights in many parts of the country remains incomplete  We must      give these provisions time to solidify the gains that we have been      making as a nation    The record compiled in the House is      replete with modern examples of discriminatory tactics employed      since the Act was last reauthorized in jurisdictions covered by the      temporary provisions  The state reports prepared by civil rights      experts and practitioners set forth in great detail evidence of      recurring problems in those jurisdictions  I look forward to the      completion of the remaining state reports and their inclusion in the      Senate hearing record  I also look forward to receiving the      testimony of more witnesses and considering additional evidence on      the need for continuation of the the expiring provisions    Protection of      Language Minorities  As part of the Voting Rights Act      reauthorization in 1975  Congress added Section 203  which requires      bilingual voting assistance for certain language minority groups       It has been a key factor expanding the inclusiveness of democracy      and has led to extraordinary gains in representation and      participation made by Asian American and Hispanic American      populations   In this debate  we are      talking about American citizens  It is imperative that all citizens      be able to exercise their rights as citizens  particularly a right      as fundamental as the right to vote   Renewing the      language provisions of the Voting Rights Act that are expiring will      help make that a reality         Conclusion  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped      to usher the country out of a history of discrimination into the      greater inclusion of all Americans in the decisions about our      nations future  Our democracy and our nation are better and richer      for it  I urge this Committee to build on the work done in the      House of Representatives  Congress should extend the expiring      provisions this year so that we can eliminate recurring      discrimination and make sure that the gains we have made are not      lost  This is about making our democracy reflect the will of all of      the American people
