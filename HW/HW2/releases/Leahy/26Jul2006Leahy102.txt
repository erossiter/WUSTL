Accountability       Committee On Government Reform       U S  House Of Representatives      Hearing On Implementing FOIA       Does The Bush Administrations Executive Order Improve       Processing       July 26  2006 Good       afternoon Chairman Platts  Vice Chairwoman Foxx  Ranking Member       Towns  and members of the Committee  Thank you for inviting me       to appear before this Committee to discuss the importance of       transparency in government and the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA         an issue that I have advocated for since my early days in the       Senate  I am pleased to join Representative Sherman and my       friend  the distinguished Senator from Texas  Senator Cornyn        here today   Senator       Cornyn has been a great partner and ally in our efforts to       strengthen and improve our open government laws  Together we       have forged an effective bipartisan partnership  having now       together cosponsored three FOIA bills  one of which has passed       the Senate and another that has been reported out of the       Judiciary Committee  You can be sure that we will keep working       on this important issue  The publics       need to know is a constant in our democracy  But fulfillment of       the publics right to know ebbs and flows  This month as we       mark the 40th anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act        the current ebb tide of public access to government information       has been especially severe  After four decades  FOIA  a       bulwark of open government  is under a targeted assault        The setbacks       to FOIA and to open government include the overly broad FOIA       waiver in the charter for the Department of Homeland Security        the biggest single rollback of FOIA in its history  These       setbacks also include muzzling government scientists on issues       from climate change to drug approvals  shifting the burden of       proof in the FOIA process from federal agencies to the public        the expanding use of government secrecy stamps  threats of       criminal prosecutions of journalists  and undermining       whistleblowers and the laws that protect them  These setbacks       are all especially troubling to those who value transparency in       government  But  more importantly  these setbacks are evidence       of deeper problems with the implementation of FOIA that have       plagued this law for some time   Chief among       the problems with FOIAs implementation is the major delay       encountered by FOIA requestors when they seek information from       the government  According to a recent report on FOIA by the       National Security Archive  the oldest outstanding FOIA requests       date back to 1989  before the collapse of the Soviet Union  In       fact  according to this report  the oldest of these outstanding       FOIA requests was submitted to the Defense Department in March       1989 by a graduate student who is now a tenured law professor        Of course  this is an example of a more extreme case  but even       extreme cases are reflective of the very real problem that       delays in FOIA matters are all too commonplace in our       government   Another key       concern is the growing use of the exemptions under FOIA to       withhold information from the public  Today  federal agencies       operate under a 2001 directive from former Attorney General John       Ashcroft that gives them the upper hand in FOIA requests        reversing the presumption of compliance directive issued earlier       by former Attorney General Janet Reno  Also  there is a growing        and troubling    practice of hiding new exemptions in the laws       passed by Congress  Under Section  b  3  of FOIA  Congress can       exempt additional records from FOIA by statute  But  often the       language creating these exemptions is buried deep in       legislation  circumventing public scrutiny until after the bill       becomes law   Another       recent FOIA unfriendly move is the placement of limits on the       fee waivers afforded to journalists who seek information under       FOIA  FOIA provides a search fee waiver for journalists because       the news media publishes information to keep the public       informed  However  more and more members of the news media are       being denied the benefit of this waiver because they are not       affiliated with a recognized news organization  For example        earlier this month we learned that the CIA has threatened to       rescind the search fee waivers long granted to the National       Security Archive  an independent non government research group       that has been a valued information clearinghouse for the press       and the public for many years  This change could cost the       National Security Archive hundreds of thousands of dollars         When       President Bush issued Executive Order 13392 in December 2005  I       said at the time that it was a constructive first step  but not       the comprehensive reforms that are needed to properly enforce       our federal FOIA law  It is helpful to look inward and examine       how federal agencies view their own performance in responding to       FOIA requests  but a truly meaningful review of FOIA must also       look outward and get input from FOIA requestors in order to       effectively address the shortcomings that I have briefly       outlined today  That is the       approach that Senator Cornyn and I took with legislation that we       have proposed to strengthen and improve FOIA  Last year Senator       Cornyn and I introduced S 394  the OPEN Government Act of 2005        This bill is a collection of commonsense modifications designed       to update FOIA and to improve the timely processing of FOIA       requests by federal agencies  A provision contained in Section       8 of that bill  which requires that the statutory exemptions       under FOIA from now on would cite specifically to the FOIA law          passed in the Senate last year  Senator       Cornyn and I also introduced a second bill last year  S 589  the       Faster FOIA Act  which would create a commission to study agency       delay  That bill was favorably reported out of the Judiciary       Committee last year and we hope the Senate will act on this       legislation before the current congressional session ends  As I mentioned      earlier  we saw the single greatest rollback of FOIA in history      tucked into the charter for the Department of Homeland Security       This provision created an opportunity for big polluters or other      offenders to hide mistakes from public view just by stamping      critical infrastructure information at the top of the page when      they submit information to the Department  I am fighting to repeal      this law and to replace it with a reasonable compromise called the      Restore FOIA Act  which would protect both sensitive information and      the publics right to know  FOIA is 40 years      young  but the laws values of openness and transparency in      government are timeless in their importance to a government of  by      and for the people  No generation can afford to take these      protections for granted and it should be the goal of each generation      of Americans to hand over to the next the legacy of a stronger and      more vibrant FOIA than the one we inherited  I thank the Committee      for inviting me to appear at this important hearing and I would be      happy to answer any questions
