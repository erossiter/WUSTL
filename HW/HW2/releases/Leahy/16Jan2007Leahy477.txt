       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The White House Decision To Nominate   Norman Randy Smith To The Idaho Seat                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The White House Decision To Nominate Norman Randy Smith      To The Idaho Seat On The Ninth Circuit Court Of Appeals      January 16  2007  This is a welcome and sensible      adjustment from the White House  By agreeing to nominate Norman      Randy Smith to the Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit  President Bush      has avoided a needless fight over a judicial nominee     I had urged President Bush to make      this decision last year when he insisted on resubmitting Mr  Smith      for the California seat on the Court despite Mr  Smiths Idaho      residency  I had also discussed this more recently with Idaho      Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo  who were exceedingly helpful in      achieving this commonsense solution    This is another good step in the      direction of making a fresh start on judicial nominations  by      emphasizing qualifications and bipartisan consensus over partisan      bickering  I look forward to the President working with both      Democratic and Republican Senators on filling judicial vacancies by      consensus with qualified nominees
