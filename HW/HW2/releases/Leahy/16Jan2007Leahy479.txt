       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Plight Of IRaqi   Refugees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Hearing On The Plight Of Iraqi Refugees      Judiciary Committee     January 16  2007  Today the Committee focuses its      attention on the current refugee crisis caused by the deteriorating      situation in Iraq  Our hearing comes at a time when momentum for      bipartisan reform to address this crisis has never been stronger       and it continues to grow  I thank our witnesses for being here  two      of whom are appearing at considerable personal risk  In a moment  I      will turn this hearing over to Senator Kennedy  who will chair the      Immigration Subcommittee when the Committee organizes  First  I      would like to make a few observations    Among the estimated 1 8 million Iraqis      who have fled their country are hundreds of thousands of destitute      refugees who escaped to neighboring countries with little more than      they could carry  Many have been denied refugee status and even      forced back into Iraq    I am particularly concerned that we      have not made provisions or created the legal authority necessary in      this country to secure those Iraqis who have aided American efforts      there  We should not repeat the tragic and immoral mistake from the      Vietnam era and leave friends without a refuge and subject to      violent reprisals    I am also concerned about Iraqs      scholars  Many have been killed or been targeted for assassination       Others have gone into hiding  Iraqs best hope is its younger      generation  and if they are unable to continue their academic      studies  their ability to contribute to Iraqs future will be      severely damaged    Secretary Sauerbrey  I would like to      meet with you soon to discuss ways that we can assist those who have      aided our forces in Iraq  I also want to discuss with you the      special plight of Iraqi scholars along with ways we can help them      resettle outside Iraq where they can safely continue their academic      research and instruction    I would hope that todays hearing also      highlights all that still needs to be done to help other asylum      seekers and refugees  I believe congressional action is overdue to      prevent further injustice resulting from the material support bar      to refugee admissions  This is an issue that is fundamental to      Americas role as a leading protector of fundamental human rights       These guiding principles and our national security are not mutually      exclusive     Hundreds of people      already in the United States are being denied asylum and now face      being returned to persecution  Thousands more who had previously      been granted asylum are now being denied legal resident status  And      several hundred previously admitted refugees and asylees are now      being denied reunification with their loved ones  This is perverse       It should also be an embarrassment to us as stewards of the      principles of a country that has been known throughout our history      as a safe haven for refugees   I am heartened that the editorial      boards of our nations leading newspapers have spoken out strongly      in recognizing the injustice the current law is causing  In      addition  conservative religious activists have recently joined our      efforts  I welcome them to the issue and ask that a copy of a      January 11 letter to me and Senator Specter from a broad range of      organizationswhich includes Human Rights Watch and Human Rights      First as well as the Hudson Institute and the Southern Baptist      Conventionbe included in the record  Changing the material      support bar to make it consistent with our nations commitment to      human rights is something that should unite us across ideological      and party lines  It      is time to bring our laws back in line with our values   The material support bar is causing      unnecessary and unintended hardships       Let me give an example uring the      war in Liberia rebels came to a womans home  shot and killed her      father  raped and abducted her  and forced her to perform household      tasks like laundry and cooking  She eventually escaped and made her      way to a refugee camp  where she sought admission to the United      States  But the tasks she performed for the rebels  like doing      laundry  were considered to be material support and her case was      placed on indefinite hold     Some have argued that      there is no need to amend the law because the Administration has the      authority to waive the law in extreme cases  But in the four years      since these bars were expanded  and after months of bureaucratic      wrangling  the Administration has used its waiver authority only      under pressure  and exceedingly sparingly    The waiver  process is cumbersome  requiring the      agreement of three different agencies that rarely agree  the      Department of State  Department of Justice  and Department of      Defense  It is also limited  And the waiver authority  although      available  has never been used in cases of coercion  like the case      of the Liberian woman  that cry out for relief  This is not right        The Administration has been abysmally      slow to recognize the hardship this law has created  Last Congress      when I proposed an amendment to create a sensible reworking of the      law  the Administration opposed it with misrepresentations and      overstatements rather than engaging in accurate and meaningful      debate  Only when the pressure has become too great to resist has      the Administration acted  But they have acted in such a way as to      exclude any input from the Congress  On January 12  2007  with no      prior consultation whatsoever with my office  nor  I believe with      Senator Kennedys office  and at a hurried briefing for      congressional staff  the Administration announced its unilateral      solution  a solution that in my view falls short of what is      needed  This is no way for President Bush to maintain his recently      stated commitment to bipartisan cooperation  We need legislative      action arrived at through meaningful give and takenot more      unilateral promises from the Administration for vague and open ended      solutions    Regrettably  the Administrations      latest proposal contains no provision for duress cases  Although      representatives have assured us that procedures will be put in place      to evaluate duress claims with respect to tier III undesignated      groups  there is no provision for the victim who is forced into      providing even the most minimal assistance to a group designated a      tier I or tier II terrorist group  In my judgment  this remains      insufficient and we should enact clear statutory guidance     The Administrations proposal also      contains no process for individuals to apply for a waiver  nor is      there any timeline for waiver determinations to be made  The      proposal also      strips asylum seekers of the ability to go to court to review a      revocation of a waiver or any other administrative decision      regarding the waiver  The Administrations proposal also requires      concurrence between the Departments of Justice  Homeland Security       and State before any determination can be made that a tier III group      be granted a waiver  I am concerned that this will merely serve to      perpetuate the Administrations glacial pace and nonaction     Last week  Secretary Chertoff issued a      press release stating his intention to use his authority to exempt      eight groups from the reach of the material support bar  and      called on Congress to enact legislation to augment these efforts  I      hope the Secretarys statement signals a sincere desire to work with      Congress to enact the necessary changes to the existing law     There are Senators on      both sides of the aisle who care about this issue  including myself      and Senators Kennedy  Coleman  and Brownback  We need to fix this      problem in a manner that provides predictability  defines reasonable      time periods  and ensures fairness  We do not want half measures       If we work together  I am confident we can craft a solution that      will put an end to the unintended consequences of the current law      without compromising our national security
