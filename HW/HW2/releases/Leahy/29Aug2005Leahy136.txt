       Vermont Farmers To Receive Added Conservation Funds                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Vermont Farmers To Receive Added      Conservation Funds  MONDAY  Aug       29     Sen  Patrick Leahy says the U S  Department of Agriculture       USDA  will provide an additional  407 493 to Vermont farmers to      help them improve their environmental stewardship  in particular       by reducing runoff into streams  rivers and lakes  The funds come      under two grant programs that Leahy authored and championed  Leahy was      joined by Sen  Jim Jeffords and Rep  Bernie Sanders in a June 14      letter to Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns in making the      request for additional conservation funds for Vermont farmers   Vermont farmers      will receive an additional  373 455 in Environmental Quality      Incentives Program  EQIP  funding  EQIP  created by Leahy in an      earlier farm bill  helps farmers reduce agricultural runoff  EQIP      and the funds it provides have become a major factor in ongoing      efforts to clean up Lake Champlain  Vermont will also receive       34 040 in Agriculture Management Assistance  AMA  funds to help      farmers meet locally developed conservation needs  The new funds      mean Vermont has received more than  12 million in agriculture      conservation programs for the second year in a row  Key to      Vermonts increased agriculture conservation funding was a      Leahy authored regional equity farm bill provision that guarantees      smaller states like Vermont  12 million in conservation funding each      year  Earlier this      year  Leahy led the Vermont Congressional Delegation in urging the      Administration to allocate additional funding to help Vermont before      the end of the fiscal year  Leahy  Jeffords and Sanders argued that      these funds were needed to meet the rising demand from farmers in      Vermont who are facing increasing environmental concerns and rising      land prices  Since 1996  when Leahy worked to charter the EQIP      program  these funds have helped more than 500 farmers in Vermont      install manure pits and construct buffer zones between their farms      and streams  along with other environmentally friendly steps        More than a      decade ago we convinced Congress that farmers want to be stewards      not just of their land  but also of the environment  said Leahy  a      senior member of the Senate Agriculture  Forestry and Nutrition      Committee  These funds have long helped Vermont farmers in their      stewardship of the land  and in our current economy  this help in      saving farm land is needed more than ever  I am especially pleased      this extra boost will continue to let us tackle the water quality      issues that we face in Missisquoi Bay and St  Albans Bay               The June 14 letter follows       for reference   June 14  2005 The Honorable Michael Johanns      Secretary of Agriculture     U S  Department of Agriculture      14th and Independence Ave  S W     Washington  DC 20250 Dear Secretary Johanns  We are writing to urge you to support the      additional Environmental Quality Incentive Program  EQIP  funding      request made by the Vermont office of the USDA Natural Resource      Conservation Service   As you know  the Vermont delegation actively      supported the 2002 Farm Bill  which successfully provided an      unprecedented level of funding for working lands conservation      programs  We  along with Members from other states that were      traditionally underserved by USDA conservation programs  were      particularly pleased to support the regional equity requirements in      that legislation  Thus after a yearlong delay  we were encouraged      that the Department began implementing the regional equity      requirement in fiscal year 2004  which provided producers in      Vermont  and other underserved states  some measure of conservation      funding equity  We were heartened to learn that NRCS was able to      move from funding only 20 per cent of its Vermont EQIP applications      to nearly 40 per cent and were hopeful that the agency would be able      to eliminate much of the backlog within the duration of the 2002      Farm Bill   Unfortunately  we were very concerned with the      low initial EQIP allocation Vermont received for fiscal year 2005       The fiscal year 2005 EQIP allocation represent a decreased of      approximately  1 5 million from the previous year  Yet Congress      approved an additional  100 million nationally for EQIP in fiscal      year 2005  Furthermore  due to a legislative correction regarding      conservation technical assistance funding  which the Vermont      delegation assisted in enacting  EQIP retained approximately  70      million which in previous years had been diverted to land retirement      programs   The low initial allocation to Vermont is even      more disappointing given the strong leadership and excellent      partnerships Vermonters have demonstrated in improving water      quality  a central goal of EQIP  Last year the State of Vermont      undertook a major effort to improve water quality and reduce      phosphorus runoff with Governor Douglas Clean and Clear Plan  Yet       with an EQIP backlog for fiscal year 2005 of 138 contracts over  10      million  an unacceptably large number of Vermont producers and      landowners continue to be rejected when they seek conservation cost      share assistance from EQIP due to the low allocation  We therefore urge you to grant the request for      additional funds to the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service      Vermont office as soon as possible to assist Vermont farmers and      landowners  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter   Sincerely  Senator Patrick Leahy Senator      James Jeffords  Congressman Bernie Sanders
