       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Anti Lynching Resolution                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Anti Lynching Resolution  S  Res  39      June 13  2005     The Senate on      Monday      considered a resolution publicly apologizing for failing to adopt      anti lynching legislation  Senator Leahy co sponsored the      bipartisan resolution  The full Senate is expected to pass the resolution by a voice vote    MR  PRESIDENT  The resolution for      consideration today details the Senates shameful failure to pass      anti lynching legislation despite several attempts  Even as seven      Presidents called for anti lynching legislation  and the House three      times passed such bills  the Senate has steadfastly refused to act        At least 4 749 people were reported      lynched between 1881 and 1964 with the vast majority of the victims      being African American  Shockingly  99 percent of the perpetrators      of these horrible acts escaped punishment from State or local      authorities    I have cosponsored this resolution      because an apology is surely in order  and I believe Senator      Landrieu deserves great credit for bringing this important issue to      the Senates attention    This public act of contrition is an      important gesture today to take responsibility for the civil rights      misdeeds of the past  But it is also an opportunity for Congress to      show the country that we will not tolerate similar offenses  As we      pass this resolution  it is fitting to carry this principle to the      present and act in kind to prevent civil rights and human rights      abuses occurring now in this country and around the world     As we pass this resolution we should      also recognize that it is long past the time to pass the Local Law      Enforcement Enhancement Act  which would strengthen and extend our      Federal hate crimes law  The Senate has repeatedly passed this      bill  with 65 votes in the last Congress  The Republican leadership      in the House  with the acquiescence of the Bush White House  has      killed it  It is fitting that we apologize for past inaction  but      that does not obviate the need to solve today s problems   By the same token  we should      reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in this Congress and not wait for      2007  We need to ensure that this law  one of the most important      bills of the 20th century  remains in effect to safeguard the      fundamental right of all citizens to participate fully in our      democracy   We should also remember the leading      role this country played in drafting the Universal Declaration of      Human Rights  which was modeled on our own Bill of Rights  As the      country that  especially since the Second World War  has been looked      to around the world as a beacon of hope for victims of arbitrary      arrest  torture  and the denial of fundamental freedoms  we need to      set a far better example than we are today  The atrocities and      dehumanizing mistreatment that have occurred in  U S  military detention facilities in      Afghanistan  Iraq and Guantanamo  are eerily reminiscent of some of      the despicable acts described in this resolution  In addition  the      continued assistance the Administration is providing to foreign      security forces that violate human rights  directly contradict the      message we are trying to send with this resolution  We should not      be satisfied with long overdue apologies  There are serious human      rights problems that we need to address today   A few years ago  I had the opportunity      to examine the book Without Sanctuary  Lynching Photography in     America  which is      referred to in this resolution  The haunting photographs in this      book make plain the evil that lurked in this nation not very long      ago  and make it impossible to accept the fact that the individuals      and mobs that committed these heinous acts by and large suffered no      consequences  This resolution deserves our immediate approval  and      I hope it provides some comfort to the descendants of the victims of      these horrible crimes
