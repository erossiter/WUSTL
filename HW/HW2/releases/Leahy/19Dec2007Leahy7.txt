       Senate Passes Legislation To Improve National Firearms Background Check   System                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Senate Passes Legislation       To Improve      National Firearms Background Check System     Leahy Schumer Led Amendment To       Fix NICS System   Unanimously Passes Senate     WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Dec  19        2007   The Senate Wednesday unanimously passed legislation       designed to improve the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System  NICS   the countrys foremost background check       system for gun purchases  The Senate version of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was championed by Senate       Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Judiciary       Committee member Chuck Schumer  D N Y   and makes improvements       to the Federal and State participation in the national       background check program       The Senate amendment to the       House passed legislation  crafted in part to respond to the       tragic shootings at Virginia Tech earlier this year  makes clear       that only correct records will be incorporated into the NICS       system  and that incorrect records will be promptly removed from       the national system  The legislation seeks to enlist the States       as partners in the effort to prevent unlawful gun purchases       through increased resources and support for States in the       improvement of information systems  The Senate Judiciary       Committee first passed reforms to NICS in August when it       reported the School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act       to the full Senate  The bill approved by the Senate on       Wednesday contains provisions to direct Federal and State       agencies to establish relief from disabilities programs through       which individuals who have overcome a disqualifying mental       illness or disability may reclaim their right to purchase or       possess a firearm  Leahy and Schumer successfully shepherded       the legislation through the Senate before Congress recessed for       the year       A credible  comprehensive        up to date federal database to provide accurate background       checks benefits everyone  said Leahy  At the same time  this       legislation also recognizes the importance of not unduly       infringing Americans constitutional rights  and it takes steps       to ensure that those rights are respected  Tragic shootings       across our country are too often breaking news  Improving       NICS will help curb the number of firearms that get into the       hands of troubled individuals who should already be disqualified       under Federal law       Other sections in the legislation       will    Create a legal regime where        the reporting of disqualifying mental health records on both        the State and Federal level will be improved     Require Federal agencies to        report mental health and other disqualifying records into        NICS    Create new incentives for        States to report mental health and other disqualifying        records    Provide States support to meet        the goals outlined in the NICS Amendments Act          The Leahy Schumer legislation will       now return to the House for final approval before heading to the       Presidents desk for signing                      Leahys statement on Senate       passage of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 is below      Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy  On Passage Of       Leahy Schumer Amendment To Improve H R  2640   The NICS Amendments       Improvement Act Of 2007  December 19  2007     Today  the Senate took an       important step forward to improve the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System  NICS   the nations background check       system for gun purchases  Along with Senator Schumer  I have       worked hard to craft this compromise legislation that respects       the rights of gun owners and  at the same time  makes sure that       the NICS system will work more effectively  This compromise has       not been easy  as many have strong views on issues surrounding       this bill  but working with Senators on both sides of the aisle        we have forged strong  fair legislation to address serious       shortcomings in the Federal program  Throughout the process  we       have taken great care to make sure Federal law governing who can       own or possess a firearm remains unchanged  The Senate language       makes clear that the correct records will go into the NICS       system  that any records improperly in NICS will be removed       promptly  that legal notice and due process considerations will       be required in Federal proceedings  and that the States have       sufficient support to meet the goals of the bill  We have been       responsive to the legitimate concerns of veterans and advocates       on both sides of the issue  and at the same time  we have worked       hard to correct weaknesses that have been exposed by the tragic       events of the last year        The senseless loss of life at       Virginia Tech this spring revealed serious flaws in the NICS       system  particularly in the transfer of mental health       information relevant to gun purchases between the States and the       Federal Government  Deficiencies in the current NICS system        including a significant lack of funding  permitted the       perpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain firearms and       ammunition despite having a mental health history that made him       ineligible to buy or possess a firearm under Federal law  He       was able to pass a background check and purchase the weapons he       used in his attacks because data was missing from the NICS       system        In response to this devastating       tragedy  the Judiciary Committee worked hard to produce a       comprehensive legislative proposal related to issues of school       safety  and in August unanimously reported the School Safety and       Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007  SSLEIA  to the full       Senate  As part of this legislative package  we drafted Title       II of SSLEIA to include an amended version of the NICS Amendment       Improvement Act of 2007  H R  2640  that passed the House in       July  Today  the Senate passed a revision of Title II from       SSLEIA  as the Leahy Schumer Amendment to H R  2640  which       closes the gaps in the NICS system that allowed the purchase of       the firearms that were used in the Virginia Tech killings  I       hope the House of Representatives will take up and pass H R        2640  as amended  as soon as possible        The Leahy Schumer Amendment       largely mirrors the language of H R  2640 as passed by the       House  But it also makes modest but important changes to that       bill in order to ensure this new law works effectively and       fairly for all Americans  It creates a legal regime where the       reporting of disqualifying mental health records  both at the       State and Federal levels  will be improved  This bill will also       require Federal agencies to report mental health and other       disqualifying records into NICS and would create significant new       incentives for States to report this same information  These       basic features of the amendment are the same as in the House       bill  Additionally  the bill contains provisions directing       Federal agencies to establish relief from disabilities programs       through which individuals who have overcome a disqualifying       mental illness or disability may reclaim their rights  and urges       the States to do the same        As I reviewed this issue  however        I determined that additional changes were necessary both to       improve the NICS system further and to better enable States like       Vermont to implement these improvements  By tempering the       penalties for insufficient participation by the States in       meeting the bills goals  and increasing incentives for full       participation  I am hopeful that the bill will strengthen the       partnership between Federal and State authorities in search of a       common goal  The NICS system is only as good as the information       that is reported into it  and to achieve success in improving       NICS  we must recognize and adequately support the States in       this challenging undertaking        I want to thank Paco Aumond        Director of Criminal Justice Services at the Vermont Department       of Public Safety  for working with me to identify those changes       in the legislation to ensure that Vermont and the many similarly       situated States will be more easily able to make the       comprehensive improvements necessary for a more effective NICS       system        Nothing can bring back the lives       tragically lost at Virginia Tech  and no legislation can be a       panacea  but the bill we pass today will begin to repair and       restore our faith in the NICS system and may help prevent       similar tragedies in the future
