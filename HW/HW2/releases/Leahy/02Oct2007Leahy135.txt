                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               The Senate     Judiciary Committee Tuesday held a hearing on     The     panel heard testimony from Jack Goldsmith  former Assistant Attorney     General as head of the     Office of Legal Counsel  Goldsmith is the author of the recently     published book  The Terror Presidency  Law and Judgment Inside the Bush     Administration  which offers an inside view of the flaws Goldsmith     found in the Office of Legal Counsels opinions of the legality of the     Administrations policies after     9 11  from torture to warrantless surveillance   Chairman Patrick Leahys opening statement     follows       Statement Of Chairman     Patrick Leahy     Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing On Preserving the Rule of Law in the Fight Against Terrorism    October 2  2007 The subject of todays hearing is one of the most     fundamental tests that we face as a nation  Can we maintain respect for     the rule of law and our Constitution in a time of crisis  I think it is     now clear that this Administration has failed that test   The attacks of September 11 shook this nation  The     grave threat from international terrorism that we experienced that day     remains real  and our government has the responsibility to protect     Americans against further attack  But that is not its only     responsibility  The government must protect our security without doing     harm to the liberties we value and the vibrant system of checks and     balances that the Founders created to preserve them   Rather than working to preserve those checks and     our constitutional balance  this Administration set out to accomplish a     radical realignment of the powers of the government  Its goal is an     unprecedented expansion of executive authority  The Administration has     used the threat of terrorism to justify this expansion  but its genesis     was well before September 11   Key members of this Administration have long held     the view that the President should not be encumbered  Not by laws  not     by Congress  not by the courts   To accomplish this vision of Executive power  the     White House set out to limit knowledge of important legal decisions to a     tiny  powerful cabal of like minded lawyers  This group was led by     Alberto Gonzales  then Counsel to the President  and by the Counsel to     the Vice President  now his Chief of Staff  David Addington  If you     might disagree with these lawyers  you were not allowed in the     discussion  Congress  at all costs  was to be denied any input into     critical decisions   No doubt about it  secrecy  insularity and     unilateralism are powerful tools that have been used before to expand     Executive authority  And secrecy  insularity and unilateralism have     become the hallmarks of the Bush Administrations dealings with     Congress  with our allies  and with the wider world   We have begun to see the great cost this has     exacted on American values  constitutional principles  and our standing     as we pursue our national interests around the world  We see it in a     system of detention that  rather than being above reproach and an     example to the world  has lost all credibility with our allies and is a     powerful rhetorical tool for our direst enemies  We see it in the     terrible abuses at Abu Ghraib  which stained us as a country and which     were the direct result of a lack of clarity and restraint in the rules     about interrogation  We see it in a President who chose to violate a     surveillance law rather than come to Congress to get it changed  sowing     seeds of distrust and suspicion for himself and  no doubt  for many     Presidents to follow  We see it in the Presidents cavalier use of his     pardon power to override a jury verdict that convicted a top White House     aide of lying to a grand jury and the FBI  We see it in the White     Houses efforts to corrupt federal law enforcement by the unprecedented     mass firings of U S  Attorneys who this President had appointed  in     order to install cronies and loyalists  We see it generally in a     deplorable lack of respect for the liberties of Americans by this     Administration   Our witness today  Jack Goldsmith  was invited      briefly  into this powerful group of lawyers  He is a conservative     lawyer who shares many of this Administrations views about legal policy     to fight terrorism  Indeed  I suspect Mr  Goldsmith and I would     disagree on more than a few topics  But when Mr  Goldsmith became head     of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel he was dismayed by     what he saw   The Office of Legal Counsel or OLC is a small      but critical office within the Justice Department  It is the office     that gives legal advice to the rest of the Executive Branch  so that the     President can carry out his obligation to faithfully execute the law      But Mr  Goldsmith found OLC opinions that  in his words  were deeply     flawed  sloppily reasoned  overbroad  and incautious in asserting     extraordinary constitutional authorities on behalf of the President      Mr  Goldsmith decided he had to try to fix them   I thank Mr  Goldsmith for standing up and insisting     on putting things right  This was an act of courage  he suffered     searing criticism and many personal misgivings  Mr  Goldsmith has     written a book  The Terror Presidency  which is a rare window into     this crucial period and a chilling account of what he saw over the short     time he headed OLC  It contains many lessons for this Administration      if it were willing to listen  and for future administrations that I hope     will listen  We will explore some of those lessons today
