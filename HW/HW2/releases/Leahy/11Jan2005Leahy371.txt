       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Hearing On The Fairness In Absestos   Injury Resolution Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement         Of Senator Patrick Leahy         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee        Hearing On        The Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution Act        January 11  2005  I commend Chairman Specter for holding this hearing         on asbestos legislation  My message today is a simple one  We must see         our efforts through until we have a balanced and effective national trust         fund that fairly compensates victims of asbestos related disease  In         order to reach that goal  we must continue to work with the various         stakeholders and Senators on both sides of the aisle until we settle the         outstanding details on a fair resolution for all concerned   Back in September 2002 I chaired the first Senate        Judiciary Committee hearing on asbestos litigation  Since that time I am        pleased that we have made real progress in finding common ground around a        national trust fund  despite some fits and starts along the way  In the last Congress  we painstakingly built two of        the four pillars of a successful trust fund  appropriate medical standards        to determine who should receive quick compensation  and an efficient         expedited system for processing claims  With the unanimous adoption of the        Leahy Hatch medical criteria amendment  this committee reached consensus on        the proper standards for determining legitimate victims  Meanwhile         Senator Specter and Judge Becker  working hand in hand with the        stakeholders  achieved consensus on the framework for a no fault        administrative system to be housed at the Department of Labor   We have yet to reach consensus on the other two        pillars of a successful trust fund    fair award values for asbestos        victims  and adequate funding to pay for the victims claims   If the award values are too low or subject to liens        that reduce or exhaust any recovery for victims  the bill will be        inherently unfair and unworthy of our support  There are about 600 000        legal cases currently pending in the system  making it critical to have        adequate funding at the inception of a national trust fund  Direct        contributions from defendants and insurers and borrowing authority will be        necessary to accommodate the inevitable  which is thousands of these        pending claims coming in on the very first day of the trust fund   The negotiations between Senator Frist and Senator        Daschle in the waning days of the last Congress narrowed the differences on        many compensation and funding provisions   Now we need to build on that progress with all the        stakeholders to resolve these remaining critical and connected issues  Our        undertaking is challenging and unprecedented  It will not be easy to        hammer out the details necessary for enacting a bipartisan bill into law         But the stakes are too high  and too much progress has already been        accomplished  for us to leave the field before trying our utmost to        complete this difficult task   Creating a fair national trust fund to compensate asbestos victims is        one of the most complex legislative undertakings I have been involved with        in my 30 years in the Senate  The interrelated aspects necessary for a fair        national trust fund are like a Rubik s Cube  and that is all the more        reason why we need a consensus solution  translated into legislation   For Congress to enact reforms this year  all the stakeholders will have        to be willing to work with open minds toward a realistic and reasonable        national trust fund  It cannot be a stacked trust fund approach that        attempts to shoot the moon for one side or the other  To succeed  it must        be a balanced piece of legislation  My two grandfathers worked as stonecutters in the        granite quarries of Vermont  They both suffered from silicosis because of        their workplace exposures to stone dust  One of my grandfathers died at        the age of 35 because of the disease  Thinking of them  and of the        hundreds of thousands of present and future asbestos victims  I want to        make every effort to enact a fair and balanced national trust fund  and I        commend and encourage all who are working in good faith to help do that         Acting together is the best way to move a bipartisan        bill through the legislative process and into law  There remain a number        of important issues on which we need to find common ground  and by working        together we stand the best chance of success   I thank Chairman Specter  Judge Becker and the representatives from        organized labor  the trial bar  and industry who have worked so hard to try        to reach consensus on a national trust fund  Now is the time to renew and        redouble our efforts and to seize this opportunity to enact a fair and        balanced bill   I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Specter  Judge        Becker  the stakeholders  and Senators on both sides of the aisle to do the        hard work necessary for us to craft the bipartisan solutions necessary to        enact an effective trust fund to fairly compensate asbestos victims
