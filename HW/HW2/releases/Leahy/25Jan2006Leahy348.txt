       Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel A    Alito  Jr  To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Opening       Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr        To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United       States      Senate Floor      January 25  2006   We open debate today the       nomination of Judge Samuel A  Alito Jr  faced  foremost  at a       pivotal constitutional moment in our history  with a single        fundamental question  Will the Senate serve its constitutional       role and preserve the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on       the expansion of presidential power     A nominees views on Executive       power and the checks and balances built by the Founders into our       constitutional framework should always weigh heavily in hearings       for those nominated to the Supreme Court  Executive power       issues were the first issues I raised with Chief Justice Roberts       at his confirmation hearing  and they were the first issues I       raised with Judge Alito    The reason presidential power       issues have come to dominate this confirmation process is that       we have clearly arrived now at a crucial juncture in our Nation        and on our highest court  over the question of whether a       President of the       United States is above the law  The Framers knew that unchecked       power leads to abuses and corruption  and the Supreme Court is       the ultimate check and balance in our system  Vibrant checks       and balances are instruments in protecting both the security and       the liberty of the American people    This is a nomination that I fear       threatens the fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans        now and for generations to come  One need only look to the       White House to see the practical effects of such an erosion of       those rights and liberties  This President is prone to       unilateralism and assertions of Executive power that extend all       the way to illegal spying on Americans     This President is in the midst of       a radical realignment of the powers of the government and its       intrusiveness into the private lives of Americans  and this       nomination is part of that plan  I am concerned that  if       confirmed  this nominee will further erode the checks and       balances that have protected our constitutional rights for more       than 200 years  It is not overstating the case to say this is a       critical nomination  one that can tip the balance on the Supreme       Court radically away from constitutional checks and balances and       the protection of Americans fundamental rights      This past week  I introduced a       resolution to clarify what we all know  that congressional       authorization for the use of military force against Osama bin       Laden did not authorize warrantless spying on Americans  as the       Bush Administration is now claiming  I thought    we all       thought    that when we joined in the bipartisan authorization       of military action against Osama bin Laden more than four years       ago  that action would have been more effective and have       succeeded by now in ridding the world of that terrorist leader        That is not the case  Instead  the Administration is using this       resolution as legal justification for a covert spying program on       Americans that recently came to light         As Justice OConnor underscored recently  even war is not a       blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the       Nations citizens  Now that the illegal spying on Americans       has become public  the Bush Administrations lawyers are       contending that Congress authorized it  The September 2001       Authorization to Use Military Force did no such thing        Republican Senators know it  and a few have said so publicly        We all know it  The liberties and rights that define us as       Americans  and the system of checks and balances that serve to       preserve them  should not be sacrificed to threats of terrorism       or to the expanding power of the Government    Security and liberty are not       mutually exclusive values in  America  We should have both  and       we can have both  with adequate checks and balances and with the       extra effort that it takes to chart the right course  The       terrorists win if they frighten us into sacrificing the freedom       and the principles that define us as Americans  I said this in       the days following the 9 11 attacks  and I believe it just as       strongly today    Just after 9 11  I joined with       Republicans and Democrats in round the clock efforts to update       and adapt our law enforcement powers  These negotiations       resulted in the law that came to be the USA PATRIOT Act  During       those days the Bush Administration never asked us to amend the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to accommodate the spying       on Americans that they were already undertaking contrary to       law  That law does contain an express reservation for the 15       days following a declaration of war by the Congress  But       neither Attorney General Ashcroft nor anyone else in the Bush       Administration at the time  or thereafter  sought congressional       authorization for the NSA spying program     Indeed  Attorney General Gonzales       admitted at a recent press conference that the Bush       Administration did not seek legal authorization for the program       of NSA spying because it was not something we could likely       get  Consider that damning admission  It is utterly       inconsistent with the Bush Administrations current argument       that Congress authorized warrantless spying on Americans  They       cant have it both ways      The Bush Administrations       after the fact claims about the breadth of that 2001 resolution       are the latest in a long line of manipulations and another       affront to the rule of law  American values  and traditions  We       have also seen such overreaching in the Justice Department       offices twisted interpretation of the torture statute  in the       detention of suspects without charges and denial of access to       counsel  and in the misapplication of the material witness       statute as a sort of general preventive detention law  Such       abuses serve to harm our national security as well as our civil       liberties  By way of illustration  sources at the FBI       reportedly say that much of what was forwarded to them to       investigate from the NSA spying program was worthless and led to       dead ends  That is a dangerous diversion of our investigative       resources away from those who pose real threats  while precious       time and effort is devoted to looking into the lives of       law abiding Americans    Throughout the Alito hearings  I       asked about these matters  I am not reassured    The Need for an       Effective Check on Unfettered Presidential Power  A central question during the       hearings on this nomination was whether Judge Alito would serve       as an effective constitutional check on the presidency    Preventing government intrusion       into the personal privacy and freedoms of Americans is one of       the hallmarks of the Supreme Court  There is no assurance that       Judge Alito will serve as an effective check and balance on       government intrusion into the lives of Americans  Indeed  his       record suggests otherwise    We know that Samuel Alito sought       to justify absolute immunity for President Nixons Attorney       General John Mitchell from lawsuits for wiretapping Americans        among other violations of their privacy  That is immunity even       if the Attorney General acted willfully to violate their rights         We know he was part of the effort       within the Meese Justice Department to expand the use of       presidential signing statements to increase the Presidents role       is construing what a law passed by Congress means  That is the       practice that the Bush Administration has taken to new heights        This President does not veto laws with which he disagrees  as       contemplated by the Constitution  Instead  he signs them and       then cherry picks what he will faithfully enforce  Often the       Bush Administration makes a unilateral statement declaring what       it will not follow or how it will choose to construe the       measure  In these signing statements  the President is reported       to have relied upon the theory of the Unitary Executive more       than one hundred times   This is not just theory  it has       practical effects on Americans lives and liberties  We saw it       recently in the Presidents signing statement on Congresss       declaration against torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading       treatment of detainees  After months of obstruction and delay       by the Bush Administration  Congress passed a bill last month       containing a provision against torture known as the McCain       Amendment  The Administration tried to create a loophole in the       law to get out of following it  When Congress said no        President Bush had a widely publicized meeting with Senator       McCain at the White House to announce that they had worked it       out and that the President now agreed to the prohibition against       torture    Shortly after that meeting with       Senator McCain  after Congress had enacted the measure and the       President had signed it into law  the President released a       signing statement proclaiming that his Administration would       construe the law in a manner consistent with the constitutional       authority of the President to supervise the unitary Executive       branch  Many of us  Republicans and Democrats  are concerned       that the President is still trying to have it both ways  He is       apparently signaling that he thinks that he can choose to       disregard the law  at his discretion  based on his own       self serving view of his powers     Judge Alitos       Record  We know that as a judge  Samuel       Alito was willing to go further than even then fellow Third       Circuit Judge Michael Chertoff  the former head of the Ashcroft       Justice Departments Criminal Division  a former U S  Attorney        and the current Secretary of the Department of Homeland       Security  in excusing government agents for searches not       authorized by judicial warrants  We know Judge Alito would have       excused the strip search of a 10 year old girl that was not       expressly authorized by the search warrant   Judge Alitos troubling record on       the bench of allowing invasive searches with little or no       concern for the crucial role of the magistrate in authorizing       warrants deepens my concern that he will not be an effective       check on government intrusion into the personal privacy and       freedoms of Americans  Judge Alito has written a variety of       highly disturbing opinions    In both Doe v  Groody and Baker v       Monroe Township        Judge Alito dissented and would have allowed invasive searches       beyond the scope of warrants issued by a magistrate  including       the strip search of a 10 year old girl and her mother  In       answering questions about these cases  not only did Judge Alito       insist that the cases involved only technical issues  He       showed little appreciation or concern for the Government       intrusions into personal privacy  His analysis in Doe  the       strip search case  showed such deference to the Government       agents that he would have given them a pass for undertaking       searches they did not even ask for in seeking the       warrant    As a former prosecutor  I am       keenly aware of the difficulties faced by police officers in the       course of their duties  I support vigorous law enforcement       tools  But I am also mindful of the careful balance that must       be struck in order to preserve our individual liberties  One of       the most important Fourth Amendment protections we have for our       privacy is the requirement that a judicial officer ensure that       the Governments intrusion on citizens privacy is based on       probable cause and that it is reasonable  It is the judge who       determines whether to authorize the search and the extent of the       search to be permitted  The officers affidavit and the warrant       are not mirror images of each other  The magistrate is not a       rubber stamp  The role of the magistrate in issuing warrants  a       role Judge Alito has too easily cast aside on the bench  is a       crucial check in maintaining the right balance so that all       Americans can have both security and liberty   It is worth taking a few moments       to recount the facts of these cases  because I am concerned that       Judge Alito has too little regard for the consequences arising       from allowing these kinds of invasive searches beyond those       authorized by warrants    In the Doe case  the 10 year old       girl and her mother were subjected to what the Third Circuit       termed an intrusive strip search  even though they were not       suspected of nor charged with any wrongdoing  The warrant that       the Government agents had obtained from a judicial officer       authorized a search for a man living at a certain address  Yet       when they arrived at the address they encountered only the       10 year old and her mother and proceeded to strip search them        There was no contention that they posed a risk to the agents          Similarly  in Baker v   Monroe Township  a mother       and her three teen aged children were detained and searched as       they arrived at the home of the mothers adult son  The woman       and her teenaged children did not live at the house  were not       suspected of any wrongdoing  were not named in the warrant  and       were not even inside the premises when the officers arrived on       the scene  They were nevertheless all ordered at gunpoint to       lie on the ground  They were subsequently handcuffed  taken       into the house  further detained  and their property and persons       were searched   In both cases  the Third Circuit       held that the Government agents had acted inappropriately and       had violated the Fourth Amendment when they conducted these       invasive searches of innocent persons who were not named in the       search warrants When I asked him why he  in contrast  looked       beyond the four corners of the warrant that was actually       signed by the magistrate in Doe  Judge Alito replied that the       issue was a technical one  Repeatedly when pressed about this       case  Judge Alito insisted that the issue was merely       technical    The illegal strip search was not       technical for the 10 year old girl  Then Judge Chertoff       understood that this issue is far from technical  but  rather        embedded in the core protections of our individual privacy and       dignity from governmental intrusion  In the courts opinion        rejecting the rationale of Judge Alitos dissent  Judge Chertoff       wrote  This is not an arcane or legalistic distinction  but a       difference that goes to the heart of the constitutional       requirement that judges  and not police  authorize warrants         Judge Alito tried to find       technical ways to excuse the illegality  Judge Alitos       dissent relied on the affidavit accompanying the warrant  To       the extent the affidavit had requested a search of all       occupants of the home  it did so based on a concern about       concealment of drugs by frequent visitors that purchase        drugs  or by persons who do not actually reside or own rent       the premises  not by a 10 year old girl living in the home        Judge Alito ignored this language in the affidavit  in order to       misconstrue the affidavit more broadly and to then substitute it       for the magistrates warrant    Judge Alitos rationale was that       because the officers initial request was broad  it could be       assumed that the magistrate intended to grant broader search       authority than that set forth in the warrant  The Supreme Court       had specifically rejected this type of reasoning in the case of       Ramirez v  Groh  which was decided a month before Judge Alito       dissented in Doe  In Groh  the Supreme Court held a search       warrant invalid  citing the sharp distinction the law draws       between what is authorized in a warrant  and what was       requested  Judge Alito went to great lengths in a futile and       hyper technical attempt to distinguish the Supreme Courts       decision in Groh   Similarly  in Baker v   Monroe Township  Judge       Alito saw the facts in the light most favorable to the       Government  rather than to the mother and her children  That is       directly contrary to the standard that should be used when       reviewing an order granting summary judgment against a party        In his dissent  Judge Alito found that although the warrant in       question did not describe any persons to be searched  it       nevertheless was appropriate for officers to search and handcuff       a mother and her three teen aged children as they approached a       relatives home  Judge Alito stated in his dissent that even       though the mother and her three children were not named in the       warrant and there was no reason to suspect them of any       wrongdoing  to  his  mind the warrant had been intended to       authorize a search of any persons found on the premises        Judge Alito went so far as to excuse the officers failure to       request or obtain a warrant permitting the search of persons on       the premises as sloppiness    The Third Circuit disagreed with       Judge Alito  holding that because the search warrant did not       authorize the search  it was unlawful and in violation of the       Fourth Amendment  The other judges hearing the case found fault       with Judge Alitos willingness to look beyond the warrant to       excuse the unauthorized and unlawful searches  In Baker  Judge       Alito inserted himself into the case in an active attempt to       excuse misconduct when the warrant did not authorize the       Government intrusion   Unfortunately  Doe and Baker are       not outliers in Judge Alitos record  As troubling as his       dissents are in those two cases  they are only part of a broader       pattern of deference to the Government that shows far too little       concern for individual liberties and rights  which find their       ultimate protection in the Supreme Court    Judge Alitos record on the use of       excessive force is also troubling  It goes back at least as far       as his time in the Meese Justice Department  I find       particularly troubling a 1984 memorandum he wrote to the       Solicitor General regarding a case called Tennessee  Memphis       Police Department v  Garner  In a long memo in which he       repeatedly wrote in the first person proclaiming his own       beliefs  Samuel Alito argued that there were no constitutional       problems with a police officer shooting and killing an unarmed       teenager who was fleeing after apparently stealing  10 from a       home  A year later  the Supreme Court ruled 6 3 against Judge       Alito s position in that case and reiterated the law against use       of deadly force if a suspect presents no danger  In contrast       to Justice OConnors dissent on federalism grounds  Samuel       Alitos memo makes no mention of the human tragedy of the events       nor did he think the Constitution even applied since he argued       that the unjustified shooting was not technically a seizure        Most troubling is Judge Alitos statement in his legal memo       endorsing the general principle that the state is justified in       using whatever force is necessary to enforce its laws  I fear       that this deference to the Government  which he has continued on       the bench  makes him ill suited to be an effective check on the       Government or protector of individual liberties and rights    A Deferential       Nominee At a Pivotal Point in History  The Supreme Court is the ultimate       check and balance in our system  The independence of the Court       and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of life        The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp  and       neither should the Supreme Court    And so we owe it to the American       people of today  and the Americans of generations to come  to       ask and answer several essential questions  Can this President        or any President  order illegal spying on Americans  Can this       President  or any President  authorize torture  in defiance of       our criminal statutes and our international agreements  Can       this President  or any President  defy our laws and Constitution       to hold American citizens in custody indefinitely without any       court review  Can this President  or any President  choose       which laws he will follow and which he will not  by quietly       writing a side statement when he signs a bill into law  These       are some of the most vital questions of our era  and these are       among the most vital questions that confront the Senate in       considering this nomination to our highest court  Judge Alitos       record  and his responses    and his failure to adequately       answer questions about these issues    are deeply troubling         No President should be allowed to       pack the courts  and especially the Supreme Court  with nominees       selected to enshrine presidential claims of government power        Our system was designed to ensure a balance and to protect       against overreaching by any branch    A Democratic Senate stood up to       one of the most popular and powerful Democratic Presidents of       all time when it rejected President Franklin Roosevelts court       packing scheme  The Senate should not be a rubber stamp to this       Presidents effort to pack the court with those who would give       him unfettered leeway  I will not lend my support to an effort       by this President to move the Supreme Court and the law       radically to the right and to remove the final check within our       democracy   I voted for President Reagans       nomination of Justice Sandra Day OConnor  for President       Reagans nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy  for President       Bushs nomination of Justice Souter  and for this Presidents       recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts  I cannot vote for       this nomination    At a time when the President is       seizing unprecedented power  the Supreme Court needs to act as a       check and to provide balance  Based on the hearing and his       record  I have no confidence that Judge Alito would provide that       crucial check and balance
