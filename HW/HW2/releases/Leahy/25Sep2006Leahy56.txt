       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Department Of Homeland Security   Appropriations Bill  House Senate Conference                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Department Of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill    House Senate Conference    September 25  2006 As pleased as I am     about many aspects of the bill before us  it is my firm belief that the     Homeland Security Conference Report should be kept clean of all     extraneous immigration legislation  As a proponent of the Senates     immigration bill and a firm believer in the need for comprehensive     reform  I cannot support the piecemeal addition of enforcement only     measures taken from the House immigration bill to this conference     report  This is not the way to legislate and I truly believe that were     we to adopt any such amendments our chances of passing a comprehensive     immigration and border security package would be seriously diminished  Those who supported     the Senate passed bill are all aware that we need to step up border     enforcement and security  there is little debate about that  But we     need to do it in the context of comprehensive reform  where we address     both security and a realistic solution to the millions of undocumented     workers in this country  many of whom contribute in a significant way to     our economy  We all can agree that we need to reform our immigration     system  but we differ on how best to accomplish this  The Senate passed a     comprehensive reform package that goes a long way toward finding a     realistic solution to all aspects of our immigration situation  I see     no reason to undermine the Senates enormous effort by adopting     enforcement only provisions outside of the normal legislative process      This issue is far too important to fall prey to election year politics     and I hope my fellow conferees refrain from supporting such efforts     today  That being said  I     would like to express how pleased I am that the Leahy Stevens amendment     concerning the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative has been included in     this bill  I thank Senator Gregg  Senator Byrd and Congressman Rogers     for working so closely with Senator Stevens and me to craft compromise     language that will help ensure that the transition to the significant     new requirements called for by the Initiative is a smooth one  We have heard from     numerous interests in the business community and tourism industry     expressing the fear that a hasty or imperfect implementation of this     program will cause substantial delays in cross border commerce and     travel  This has been our fear as wellthat hasty implementation will     result in avoidable problems for all those who will be affected by this     Initiative  Those of us who represent States along the U S  Canada     border know first hand how important Canada is to us as a trading     partner and neighbor  It is in our best interest to keep these     relations as positive and productive as possible   In my home State of     Vermont  people travel back and forth across the border on a regular     basisit is a well established way of life for many in Vermont and     Quebec  It is critical that if we increase the identification     requirements for Americans who enter the United States from Canada  we     do so as seamlessly as possible  Our amendment requires a modest     implementation delay to June 1  2009  and also requires that certain     technological goals are met in the design of the PASS Card to ensure     that the strictest standards are in place to protect personal     information  Our language also     requires the Departments of Homeland Security and State to certify prior     to implementation that a cost for the PASS Card has been agreed upon      that all border authorities are familiar with the technology  and that     it has been shared with the Canadian and Mexican authorities  These are     just a few of the steps we have taken in this amendment to ensure that     the transition to an increased security environment is done without     creating unnecessary obstacles  Thank you again to     all those who s hard work went into reaching an agreement on this     amendment  With it  we greatly increase our chances for the successful     implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative
