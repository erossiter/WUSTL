       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The War In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Remarks Of U S  Sen  Patrick Leahy     The War In Iraq     February 15  2007   Mr       President  a week ago the distinguished Majority Leader tried every      which way to provide the Senate with an opportunity to debate a      bipartisan resolution on Iraq  That effort failed because it was      blocked by some in the Minority party  who insisted on a separate      vote that was nothing more than a political ploy  Instead of a      debate on the Presidents policy  they wanted the debate to be about      who supports the troops     As      has so often been the case when anyone has asked a question       expressed reservations  or outright opposed the Presidents failed      policy in Iraq  his defenders accuse his detractor of not being      patriotic or of not supporting the troops    As      one who for years has fought for veterans benefits  for fair      treatment for the National Guard  for armor for our troops who were      sent into battle unprepared  and for replacing the depleted stocks      of essential equipment that our troops need and depend on  the      absurd accusation that it is unpatriotic to disagree with a policy      that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of American soldiers      and created a terrorist haven in a country that before posed no      threat to the United States  has worn thin     It      reminds me of my days as a prosecutor  When a defendant was caught      red handed  the predictable response was to attack the accuser       That is what has been going on here since President Bush  Vice      President Cheney and former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld  ignoring all      advice to the contrary  led us into this costly fiasco  These      flawed policies have thrust our troops into the maw of a bloody      civil war  Our troops are not responsible for the mistaken policies      they have been asked to implement  Policymakers in Washington are      responsible for that  And only decision makers in Washington can      change those policies     The      polls show unmistakably that a majority of the American people wants      the Congress to debate and vote on the Presidents policy in Iraq       They know that Iraq is the key issue of today  they see that it is a      widening civil war  and they want their sons and daughters out of      there  in as sensible a timeframe and as sensible a plan as we can      muster  It is that simple  and that is what we should be debating         The      costs of this misadventure have not just been onerous  they have      been catastrophic  More than 3 000 Americans killed  and more than      20 000 wounded  Tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis have lost      their lives  In material terms we are fast approaching the one      trillion dollar mark  throwing money out the door at a rate of more      than  2 billion per week to fund this war  Our international      reputation and the influence it brings  including among our allies       has been badly tarnished and diminished         Where are we in Iraq  We are in the midst of a civil war among      religious and ethnic factions  an insurgency that shows no sign of      diminishing  and out of control organized crime  It is hard to say      that we have made any real progress toward the larger objectives of      bringing democracy to Iraq or the Middle East  It is time we face      the grim reality  and it is time we deal with it  Our soldiers      lives are in the balance    I      made a brief statement on Tuesday about an column in last Sundays     Washington Post by      retired Lieutenant General William Odom  General Odom has one of      the most distinguished military intelligence careers  and he      continues to provide powerful insights on national security  In his      piece entitled Victory in Not an Option  he outlines how this      Administrations entire policy on Iraq  including the so called      surge strategy  is based on a self defeating inability to face      reality     The      reality  according to the general  is that we are not going to make      Iraq a democracy and that the longer we stay  the more likely Iraq      will be anti American at the end of our intervention      Our      invasion made civil war and increased Iranian involvement in Iraq      inevitable  and no amount of military force    especially after so      many errors of judgment    will prevent those outcomes          Meanwhile  our presence is only stoking al Qaedas involvement in      Iraq  The reality is that supporting our troops does not mean      keeping them there to carry out a failed strategy  It means      pursuing a course that protects the countrys interests and prevents      more Americans from dying in pursuit of an ill defined  open ended      strategy that cannot succeed          General Odom knows that we need to begin an orderly withdrawal from      Iraq  He argues that we should join with other countries in the      region  those whose input this Administration has often ignored       and seek to stabilize the region through sustained  high level      diplomacy          These views are in line with those of some our senior military      officers  other national security experts  many of us in Congress       and a majority of the American people     Yet      look at what the Administration and it defenders in the Minority      party offer instead  We get filibusters that stymie a debate on our      Iraq policy  We get the same old rhetoric about not supporting the      troops  And we get a bill from the President for another  100      billion to send 20 000 more troops and continue the war    If      the President cannot face the reality that even members of his own      party increasingly have come to accept  then it is our      responsibility  our patriotic duty  our moral duty  to act  A      non binding resolution that sends a clear message in opposition to      an escalation of troops is better than years of the silence of a      rubberstamp Congress  But we know the President will ignore it  he      has already said so  It is only a first step    I      support binding legislation by Senator Obama and Senator Feingold to      begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq  It is not      our role to choose sides in a civil war  It is not our troops role      to die trying to force these warring factions to settle their      age old differences     We      need to continue to fight the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan       We need to deploy sufficient forces and intelligence assets to track      down international terrorists around the world  We need to do a lot      better job of policing our borders without denying entry to innocent      people who are fleeing persecution          General Odom is right  Keeping our troops in Iraq is not making us      safer  We should begin bringing our troops home  Congress has it      in its power to force the President to change course  That is what      the American people want  and that is what we should be debating
