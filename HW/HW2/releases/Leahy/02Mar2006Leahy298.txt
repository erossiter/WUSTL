       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Democratic Member    Committee On The Judiciary  Executive Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Democratic Member      Committee On The Judiciary     Executive Meeting     March 2  2006 Today is the day      that Dubai Ports Worlds transaction to take ownership of port      operations in 6 U S  ports and other assets is set to close  It      will close unless a British judge has delayed it  The Bush Cheney      Administration approved the acquisition on January 17 and  as far as      I can tell  it closes today without U S  objection  Thus  any      action Congress should seek to take will likely have to be in      retrospect with respect to this multibillion dollar transaction  if      possible at all  Last week  on behalf of Democratic Senators on      this Committee  I wrote the Attorney General of the United States      raising appropriate questions about his role and that of the      Department of Justice in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the      United States approval of the transaction  Despite the important      public interest in this matter  we have yet to receive a response or      so much as an acknowledgement of our interest as the Justice      Departments Committee of oversight in the Senate  I ask that a      copy of that letter be made part of the record  There are some      striking parallels between the warrantless wiretapping program and      approval of the takeover of most of the key port operations on the      East Coast of the United States by a firm controlled by a foreign      government with previous ties to Osama bin Ladin  to terrorist      financing and to the proliferation of nuclear weapon technology by      A Q  Khan  In both cases  this obsessively secretive and      unilateralist Administration proceeded with action that it must have      known would face strong bipartisan opposition and did so without      informing Congress or the American people  In both cases  the      Administration did not follow processes mandated by specific federal      statutes  the FISA Court warrant requirement in the wiretapping      case  and the 45 day review requirement of the Exon Florio law in      the case of the port deal   This week the      Committee held a hearing with an academic panel featuring      commentators who have not witnessed or played any role in the      program that they were discussing  and who knew little more than the      very minimal facts about that program that the President has chosen      to divulge  I greatly appreciate their analysis  just as I      appreciate the analysis of former President Jimmy Carter  former FBI      Director William Sessions  conservative columnist George Will  and      the many other scholars and former government officials who have      concluded that the Presidents program violates the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act and threatens the constitutional      separation of powers  But Tuesdays hearing was no substitute for      the vigorous and forceful oversight this Congress owes the American      people  I commend Chairman Specter for beginning this Committees      investigation into the Presidents program of domestic spying into      emails and telephone calls of Americans without a judges approval       The Chairman and I have a long history of conducting vigorous      bipartisan oversight investigations  If the Senate is to serve its      constitutional role as a real check on the Executive  real oversight      is essential  The February 6 hearing and yesterdays can only be      the beginning of the process   Promptly after the      February 6 hearing  the eight Democratic Members of the Committee      forwarded written follow up questions to the Attorney General       including fewer than three dozen that were prioritized for prompt      answer before this weeks hearing  I spoke to this matter on the      Senate floor and urged the Bush Cheney Administration to come clean      with us and the American people  Sadly  they have not responded       The Attorney General ignored our prioritizing a limited number of      questions and has provided no answer   Instead  on Tuesday       more than three weeks after the hearing  he sent the Chairman an      extraordinary letter seeking to modify his February 6 testimony       That letter raises many questions  both factually  and also going to      the credibility of the testimony itself  Of course  at the February      6 hearing Senator Feingold confronted the Attorney General with what      appeared to be misrepresentations from his January 2001 testimony      during his confirmation hearing  I expect that his letter on      Tuesday was an attempt to provide some defense to a charge that he      misled the Committee in his testimony on February 6  I ask that a      copy of his letter be made part of the record   He sought to add      qualifiers and hedge already vague answers about the shifting legal      analysis for the Presidents domestic spying program without      judicial approval and about the scope of activities undertaken      secretly based on his expansive interpretation of inherent powers of      the unitary executive not based on statutory authorities    At the outset of my      questioning at our February hearing  I asked the Attorney General      when the Bush Cheney Administration came to the conclusion that      the congressional resolution authorizing the use of military force      against al Qaeda also authorized warrantless wiretapping of      Americans inside the United States  He never directly answered my      question  Now  in his February 28 letter to Chairman Specter  he      finally admits what I suspected all along  This was not the      underlying intent of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force      that we passed on September 14  That was to authorize the Commander      in Chief to use our Armed Forces against al Qaeda and Osama bin      Laden in Afghanistan  He knows that  he was the White House counsel      at that time  Instead  after dodging months of my inquiries  he now      concedes in his letter to Chairman Specter that the Departments      legal analysis has evolved over time  Thus  even they did not rely      on the Authorization for Use of Military Force to justify the spying      program when it began in 2001  Its use is an after thought       after the fact rationalizing   We still need direct      answers to our questions and the documents that we requested back in      January in advance of the February 6 hearing   I ask that my letter      responding to the Attorney General yesterday be made part of the      record and that the pre hearing letter request be included  as well       Most disturbing is      that the Attorney Generals new letter raises the implication that      that are other secret activities impinging on the liberties and      rights of Americans being conducted by the Bush Cheney      Administration  We need to know what other activities affecting      Americans rights the Attorney General views as justified by the      Authorization for the Use of Military Force and the inherent power      of the President  He concedes that the Department of Justice has      conducted additional legal rationalizations and analysis beyond the      January 19th paper but has refused to produce the      binding legal opinions of the Government or inform us what those      programs involve   I know that this      Committee has a full agenda but these are fundamental matters and we      need to get to the bottom of them  That is why I raise them  I look      forward to working on these matters with the Chairman  In addition  we all      want to move forward this spring with hearings and action to      reauthorize the Voting Rights Act  We should complete that      important action this year  Chairman Sensenbrenner in the House has      long been involved and interested in this matter  It would be a      fitting part of his legacy as the House Chairman if we could work      together to accomplish that reauthorization before the Congress      adjourns this year  I hope that we can begin those hearings before      the April recess  I understand from      the Chairman that he intends to make immigration the focus of our      work this week and in the weeks ahead  I know that Senators Kennedy      and Feinstein and others have extensive experience and strong views      on these matters  A number of us have introduced immigration      initiatives  But some of us are playing a bit of catch up on the      Chairmans mark and his substitute to his mark  I look forward to      our working together in the weeks ahead
