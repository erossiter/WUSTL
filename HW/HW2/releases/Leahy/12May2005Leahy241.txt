       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  State  Foreign Operations   And Related Programs Subcommittee Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member          Opening Statement      State  Foreign Operations And Related Programs Subcommittee Hearing          Witness  Secretary of State Rice      May 12  2005   Secretary Rice  I join Chairman McConnell in welcoming you on      your first appearance before this Subcommittee  I also want to thank      the Chairman for his continued work on these issues  and  most      importantly  for his friendship    Madam Secretary  we have a lot to cover  but I want to focus on      one issue that you and I spoke about before you were confirmed  the      need for U S  foreign aid programs to be funded at a level      commensurate with our national interests    The President s national security strategy recognizes the central      role of foreign aid  The Presidents Fiscal Year 2006 budget request      for Foreign Operations  which is an increase of  3 1 billion over      last years level  is a good step forward    At the same time  I have serious concerns with this years      budget    First  the President would cut several core foreign aid accounts       Funding for Child Survival and Health Programs  including for      infectious diseases  would be cut by  280 million  The Development      Assistance account is cut by  45 million  Aid to Russia is cut in      half  He would even cut our contribution to UNICEF  And there are      many areas    from promoting renewable energy to building democracy       where we could and should do far more    These programs are cut to help pay for a large increase in      funding for the Millennium Challenge Corporation    something the      President said would not happen  I continue to support the      principles of the MCC  but the proposed increase in funding  at the      expense of other programs  is not going to fly up here  If this      years request is fully funded  a total of  5 5 billion will have      been appropriated to the MCC  which so far has awarded just one      compact of  110 million to Madagascar  with a population of only 15      million people    We cannot have billions of dollars for the MCC sitting in the      U S  Treasury for years  when there are urgent needs that are      woefully under funded    Second  I would urge you to do more to defend your budget  Being      here today is important and I thank you for it  But the House      allocation for the Foreign Operations Subcommittee is  2 5 billion      below the Presidents request  I am sure you realize what that would      mean  I urge you and the President to do whatever you can to help      ensure that the Senate fully funds the budget request    Dealing with the Congress on this is not always politically      rewarding    but it has to be done  You can have the best policies       but they will not amount to much without the resources to implement      them  I am willing to help the in any way I can    Finally  even if we appropriate every dime the President has      asked for  it will still amount to only about one percent of the      Federal budget  How can we possibly mount a credible response to      global poverty  international terrorism  and all the other      challenges we face  with so few resources    We cannot  We are missing so many opportunities    We should treat foreign aid for what it is  a critical investment      in global stability and security  The Presidents national security      strategy recognizes this  The Presidents budget is a positive step       But  it is not nearly enough    This is not a Democratic or Republican issue  Chairman McConnell      and I have worked closely together every year to protect this      budget  We will again this year  But as we look ahead  let us find a      way to significantly increase this budget so this Nation can show      the promise and the moral leadership a great nation should show
