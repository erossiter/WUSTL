Ranking Member     Arlen Specter  R Pa   today sent a letter to Attorney General Michael     Mukasey and National Intelligence Director Michael McConnell seeking the     preservation of any remaining documentation and audio or video     recordings of enhanced interrogations of detainees  Leahy and Specter     also requested that the Judiciary Committee be provided with any     remaining recordings  The letter follows an exchange last week between     the Judiciary Committee leaders and Mukasey about the Justice     Departments investigation into the Central Intelligence Agencys     possession and subsequent destruction of videotapes showing     interrogations of detainees  Leahy and Specter last week queried     Mukasey about the Justice Departments knowledge and involvement in the     matter  In a response to Leahy and Specter sent last Friday  Mukasey     refused to provide the Judiciary Committee with the information     requested  Today  Leahy and Specter followed up by asking that     the Justice Department report to the Judiciary Committee any information     about the discovery of any remaining tapes  It is of the utmost importance to Congress and to     the American people that the record with regard to this issue so crucial     both to our security and to our values not be further compromised      Leahy and Specter wrote Friday            The text of the Leahy

Honorable Michael McConnell    Director of National Intelligence    Office of Director of National Intelligence    Washington  D C  20511 Dear Attorney General Mukasey and Director     McConnell  We write on behalf of the Senate Judiciary     Committee to request that you preserve and produce to the Committee all     remaining audio or video recordings of enhanced interrogations of     detainees  Our request expressly includes copies  remnants  fragments     and extant recordings of the tapes reportedly destroyed of waterboarding      wherever recorded and wherever currently held  If those recordings are     in the possession  custody or control of the United States or can be     obtained by the United States  we request them on behalf of the     Committee   We have already noted that we were alarmed to learn     of the destruction by the Central Intelligence Agency of videotapes     showing interrogations of detainees and to learn of the existence of     these videotapes only after they were destroyed  We are sensitive to     the need to avoid interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation      Our request is pursuant to our oversight and legislative     responsibilities  This Committee has often worked with the executive     branch in the past to perform oversight in ways that do not interfere     with ongoing criminal probes  It is vital that all remaining documentation of     enhanced interrogations be preserved  Specifically  we request that     you   Issue preservation orders to ensure that all      audio and video recordings of interrogations of detainees  all other      documentation of such interrogations  and all documents relating to      the destruction of any such recording or documentation are      preserved     Canvass the White House  the Central      Intelligence Agency  other intelligence agencies  and any other      relevant agency  contractors and associates to determine whether any      other audio or video recordings of enhanced interrogations  in which      harsh interrogation techniques including but not limited to      waterboarding were used  are in existence  including any additional      recordings of the interrogations for which the videotapes were      destroyed     Provide this Committee with a report of your      findings with regard to what recordings are still in existence  what      the recordings depict and who possession or controls them     Work with this Committee to arrange for      existing recordings to be reviewed  consistent with national      security requirements    Report to this Committee on an ongoing basis      any newly discovered information with regard to remaining or new      recordings of enhanced interrogations    It is of the utmost importance to Congress and to     the American people that the record with regard to this issue so crucial     both to our security and to our values not be further compromised      Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter   Sincerely  PATRICK     LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER     Chairman     Ranking Member
