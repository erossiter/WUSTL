       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee   Hearing On Democracy Programs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee     Hearing On Democracy Programs     March 16  2006       Mr  Chairman  you have been the leader here in strengthening      democracy programs in our foreign aid budget  and each year you have      included additional funding above what the Administration      requested  It is a legacy to be proud of and I commend you for it        These programs  which support political party development  elections      and independent media  strengthen civil society organizations       parliaments and the rule of law  are fundamental to any aspiring      democracy  And in countries ruled by repressive governments  they      are a means to plant the seeds for a more democratic future          As you have pointed out on occasion  the Administration  and it is      not unique to this Administration  has not always been clear or      consistent about it means by democracy programs  It is important      that we are clear what we are talking about  to make the most of      limited funds         I think one of the best things we can do is to stand up for people      in these countries who speak out  sometimes at great risk to their      personal safety  for democracy and human rights  Aung San Suu Kyi      is one example  as Chairman McConnell has done  There are many      others  in Nepal  in Ethiopia  in Belarus  in Iran         But supporting democracy is about much more than any individual  It      is about building institutions and it is about supporting human      rights  which is how these programs can make a lasting difference             No institution of democracy is more important than an independent      judiciary  which in so many of the countries that receive U S       assistance is corrupt and dysfunctional  One can imagine what it      would be like to live in a country where the laws are not enforced       where the police  prosecutors and judges lack the resources to do      their jobs and are easily bribed  where rules of procedure are      antiquated and cumbersome  where impunity is the norm  Democracy is      imperiled         We have a mixed record when it comes to judicial reform  Often  I      am afraid  we have acted in the mistaken and na  ve belief that the      governments we supported actually wanted to reform their judicial      systems  when officials in many of these countries are often the      ones getting rich from corrupt judicial systems  We have wasted a      lot of money where the political will was lacking         I suspect our witnesses will tell us that democracy is on the march       particularly in East Asia and the Middle East  but that there is      much still to do         There are encouraging signs  But one need only look at Russia today      to see how fragile democracy can be  even in a country that knows      from decades of experience the terrible consequences of      dictatorship        Finally  there is the issue of consistency  President Bush and the      Secretary of State talk a lot about democracy  But this      Administration has also supported regimes that harass  intimidate       imprison and torture citizens who bravely speak out in support of      democracy  the lawyers who defend them  and the journalists who      publicize their views  And it supports the security forces of these      countries         We need to be consistent about what we stand for  particularly when      it concerns matters as fundamental as democracy and human rights
