       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Revised U S  Sentencing Commission   Guidelines On Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing Policy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Revised U S  Sentencing Commission Guidelines    On Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing Policy    May 15  2007   Background         The U S  Sentencing    Commission sent Congress today its comprehensive Report on Federal Cocaine    Sentencing Policy  which concludes that current quantity based penalties    sweep too broadly and apply most often to lower level offenders  The    Commission has unanimously urged Congress to act on its recommendations to    focus crack cocaine penalties more closely on serious and major drug    traffickers as Congress originally intended   The Sentencing Commission has taken an important    first step in correcting the wide disparity in our federal sentencing laws     For far too long  the federal crack powder sentencing laws have created an    injustice in our nation  For more than 20 years this policy contributed to    the swelling of our prison population  disproportionately impacted African    Americans  and misspent limited federal resources on low level street    dealers rather than on the worst offenders  the drug kingpins                The full report can    be found at          Below is the Executive Summary of the    Commissions report  May 15  2007 TO  All    Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees FROM  United    States Sentencing Commission RE  United    States Sentencing Commissions May 15  2007 Report to Congress on Federal    Cocaine Sentencing Policy  The United    States Sentencing Commission is pleased to provide you with its    comprehensive 2007 Report on Federal Cocaine Sentencing Policy  The    report follows the Commissions May 1  2007 submission to Congress of an    amendment to the Federal sentencing guidelines that would modify the current    penalties for crack cocaine offenses but still keep the applicable guideline    penalties within the statutory mandatory minimum penalties enacted by    Congress in 1986  The Commission promulgated this amendment and issued the    attached report because it believes the problems associated with the current    statutory structure for cocaine sentencing are urgent and compelling and    require congressional action  Background     Since 1995 the    Sentencing Commission has advocated for amendment of the 100 1 statutory    ratio that triggers penalties for crack and powder cocaine offenders 2     As part of its priorities for its 2006 2007 amendment cycle 3     the Sentencing Commission continued its work with the congressional     executive  and judicial branches of the government and other interested    parties on cocaine sentencing policy  including reevaluating its 2002 report    to Congress  Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy    The Commission    held two hearings4     to discuss federal cocaine sentencing during which the Commission received    testimony from witnesses representing the Department of Justice  Federal    judiciary  defense bar  law enforcement  academics  treatment and medical    experts  and interested community activists  among others  The Commission    also received a number of letters from Members of Congress and the public    about this important issue  The Commission also conducted its own research    and analyses of sentencing data and trends  reviewed the most recently    available literature on the issue  and conducted an exhaustive case law    review  This extensive research effort culminated in the enclosed 2007    Report to the Congress  Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy  The 2007 Report   In this 2007    report  the Commission concludes  as it did in 2002  that     1  The    current quantity based penalties overstate the relative harmfulness of crack    cocaine compared to powder cocaine    2   The    current quantity based penalties sweep too broadly and apply most often to    lower level offenders    3  The    current quantity based penalties overstate the seriousness of most crack    cocaine offenses and fail to provide adequate proportionality   4    The current severity of crack cocaine    penalties mostly impacts minorities  Accordingly  through its    report  the Commission again unanimously and strongly urges Congress to act    promptly on the following recommendations   1    Increase the five year and ten year    statutory mandatory minimum threshold quantities for crack cocaine offenses    to focus the penalties more closely on serious and major traffickers as    described generally in the legislative history of the 1986 Act 5      2    Repeal the mandatory minimum penalty    provision for simple possession of crack cocaine under 21 U S C     844   3    Reject addressing the 100 to 1 drug    quantity ratio by decreasing the five year and ten year statutory mandatory    minimum threshold quantities for powder cocaine offenses  as there is no    evidence to justify such an increase in quantity based penalties for powder    cocaine offenses 6  The Commission further    recommends that any legislation implementing these recommendations include    emergency amendment authority7     for the Commission to incorporate the statutory changes in the Federal    sentencing guidelines  Emergency amendment authority would enable the    Commission to minimize the lag between any statutory and guideline    modifications for cocaine offenders  On the following pages    please find a summary of the data and other material contained in 2007    report for your quick reference   The Sentencing    Commission looks forward to working with you on this and other issues of    sentencing policy during the 110th Congress  If you have any    questions about this material  or

quantity required to trigger the five year mandatory    minimum yields between 2 500 and 5 000 doses  Five grams of crack    cocaine  the    quantity required to trigger application of the five year mandatory minimum    yields between ten and 50 doses   See p 62  2007 Report    Crack cocaine and    powder cocaine are both powerful stimulants  and both forms of cocaine cause    identical effects  See pp  61 62  64  2007 Report    Cocaine patients    present at treatment having the same symptoms and receive the same treatment    regardless of the drug ingested 15      See p  62  66  2007 Report    Although both    forms of the drug are addictive  the risk of addiction may be greater for    crack cocaine than powder cocaine on the typical user because of    their   different    methods of typical administration  typically crack cocaine is smoked    and powder cocaine is snorted  16      See pp  62 66  2007 Report    The negative    effects of prenatal exposure to crack cocaine are identical to the effects    of prenatal exposure to powder cocaine and are significantly less severe     than previously    believed   See pp  61  67 70  2007 Report    In 2002  fourteen    states maintained some form of distinction between crack cocaine and powder    cocaine offenses  Only one state  Iowa  maintained a 100 1  ratio between    the two forms of the drug but that was only for purposes of the statutory    maximum penalties   See p 73  2002 Report  In 2007  only thirteen   states maintain    such a distinction 17      See pp  98 106  2007 Report for a discussion of state cocaine sentencing    policy       The United States Sentencing Commission is a bipartisan  independent agency    in the judicial branch created by Congress in 1984 as part of the Sentencing    Reform Act  The Commission consists of seven voting members  three of which    are Federal judges  and no more than four of whom are from the same    political party  The Commission also has two non voting members including    the chair of the Parole Commission and a representative of the Department of    Justice  The Commission establishes sentencing policies and practices for    the Federal criminal justice community  including the promulgation of    advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines used by Federal judges to sentence    Federal criminal defendants  See generally  28 U S C       991  et    seq   West 2006        The Sentencing Commission has submitted reports and recommendations on    Federal cocaine policy to Congress in 1995  1997  and 2002        The Sentencing Commission considers proposed priorities in the spring and    summer of every year  and publishes those priorities in the Federal    Register for public comment  In the fall the Sentencing Commission    promulgates its final priorities for the amendment cycle  including research    projects and amendments to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines  During the    next few months  the Sentencing Commission works with representatives of the    criminal justice community and interested parties on possible amendments to    the Guidelines  ensuring that proposed guidelines changes meet the purposes    of sentencing  The final proposed amendments are submitted to Congress on    or before May 1 of each year  Congress reviews the amendments for 180 days    after which time  if it does not modify or disapprove of them  the    amendments become effective  See 28 U S C     994 p   West 2006        One hearing took place on November 14  2006 and included testimony from    twenty expert witnesses representing the Department of Justice  Federal    judiciary  defense bar  law enforcement  academics  treatment and medical    experts  and interested community activists  among others  The second    hearing took place on March 20  2007 at which the Commission heard testimony    from the Department of Justice  the Federal Public Defenders service  and a    number of advocacy groups  A copy of the transcript is available at our    website            The Subcommittee on Crime of the House Committee on the Judiciary generally    defined serious traffickers as managers of the retail traffic  the person    who is filling the bags of heroin  packaging crack cocaine into vials          and doing so in substantial street quantities and major traffickers as    manufacturers or the heads of organizations who are responsible for    creating and delivering very large quantities  See H R  Rep  No     99 845  pt  1  at 11 12  1986   In the 2002 Commission Report  the    Commission concluded that increasing the five year mandatory minimum    threshold quantity to at least 25 grams  resulting in a drug quantity    ratio of not more than 20 to 1  would provide a penalty structure for    crack cocaine offenses that would more closely reflect the overall penalty    structure established by the 1986 Act  USSC  2002   Commission Report  supra    note 1  at 106 07        In the 2002 Commission Report  the Commission suggested that if  in    Congresss judgment  penalties for powder cocaine offenses should be    increased  specific sentencing enhancements targeting more culpable    offenders would promote sentencing proportionality to a greater degree than    could be accomplished simply by raising the quantity based penalties for    powder cocaine offenses  USSC  2002    Commission Report  supra note 1  at 110 11       Emergency amendment authority allows the Commission to promulgate    amendments outside of the normal amendment cycle described in footnote 3     supra       The Commission defines a wholesaler for purposes of its analyses as anyone    who sold any quantity of drug to another person who then resold the drug     sold more than a retail or user level quantity  i e   more than one ounce      or possessed or purchased in a single transaction more than two  2  ounces    of the drug  See pp  82 84  2007 Report for a discussion of drug    trafficking patterns       Classifications were based on description of conduct found in the offense    conduct section of the Presentence Investigation Report  These    classifications may not reflect court findings on application of specific    guideline enhancements  Role adjustments refer to Aggravating Role  USSG      3B1 1  and Mitigating Role  USSG   3B1 2  in Chapter 3 of the Federal    Sentencing Guidelines  This figure excludes cases with missing information    for the variables required for analysis       Classifications were based on descriptions of conduct found in the offense    conduct section of the Presentence Investigation Report  one of five    sentencing documents courts must send to the Commission under 28 U S C        994 w   These classifications may not reflect court findings of specific    guideline enhancements    See supra  n 10       For purposes of the 2007 Report  an offense was defined as violent if    any participant in the offense made a credible threat  or caused any    actual physical harm to another person  See p  36  2007 Report     Classifications were based on descriptions of conduct in the offense conduct    section of the Presentence Investigation Report and may not reflect court    findings on application of specific guideline enhancements       This average is for cases in which powder cocaine was the primary drug in    the offense  the drug that drove the sentence        Includes cases that received either a two level reduction pursuant to   2D1 1    or relief from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to   5C1 2     or both       During the Commissions November 14  2006 hearing  Dr  Bruce Johnson of the    Institute of Special Populations Research explained that a recent study has    documented that almost 90 percent of ADAM  the Arrestee Drug Abuse    Monitoring Program was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice until    2003 when the program ended  arrestees who tested positive for cocaine had    detectable metabolites for crack  which suggests a 9 to 1 ratio of crack    versus powder cocaine use among these arrestees  See November 14     2006 Transcript at p 219  available at     This contrasts with the self reporting of ADAM arrestees    who  when asked about their use of cocaine  indicated use of crack cocaine    about twice as often as powder cocaine  See p 79  2007 Report     November 14  2006 Hearing Transcript at p  219  testimony of Dr  Johnson    stating the ratio was about 1 5 to 1        Smoking crack cocaine produces quicker onset of shorter lasting and more    intense effects than snorting powder cocaine  See p 62  2007    Report  These factors in turn result in a greater likelihood that the user    will administer the drug more frequently to sustain these shorter highs    and develop an addiction  See id       In 2005  Connecticut eliminated the quantity disparity between crack cocaine    and powder cocaine  The remaining thirteen states with some type of    distinction between the two forms of the drug are  Alabama  Arizona     California  Iowa  Maine  Maryland  Missouri  New Hampshire  North Dakota     Ohio  Oklahoma  South Carolina  and Virginia
