       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On DOJ s Determination In The   ATT BellSouth Merger                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee  On DOJs Determination In The ATT BellSouth Merger    October 11  2006  Todays action  or inaction  by the     Department of Justice is one more example of this Administration     thumbing its nose at Congress and the courts  one more example of siding     with big business over consumers    Only two weeks ago  Members of Congress     on both sides of the aisle urged the Department not to act prematurely     on the ATT BellSouth merger  but to instead await the outcome of the     ongoing court proceeding in other mega telecommunications mergers      which raises the same competitive concerns  and to place specific     conditions on the merger to protect competition    By approving the merger without any     conditions  the Administration is avoiding court review  ignoring     Congress and protecting big business at consumers expense     Congress must be vigilant    if the Bush     Administration will not be    to protect consumers from anticompetitive     actions and attempts at re monopolization    Since the enactment of the 1996     Telecommunications Act  which I voted against  I have warned that the     concentration of ownership in the telecommunications industry is     outstripping the growth of competition  Old monopolies are simply     regrouping and getting bigger and bigger    This unending wave of mergers is not     helping rural America get better phone service  and it is doing nothing     good for consumers in general
