       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Medical Malpractice Insurance   Antitrust Act of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     The Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2005     July 28  2005 I am pleased to      introduce the Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of      2005  In the ongoing debate about health care costs  this      legislation is a targeted and responsible move toward fixing one      significant part of the system that is broken  the skyrocketing      insurance premiums for medical malpractice  For too long       doctors and hospitals have endured dramatic increases in the cost of      their malpractice insurance  I doubt there is a single Senator who      has not heard repeatedly from beleaguered physicians back home       Rising insurance rates are reportedly forcing some doctors to      abandon their practices   Some of my      colleagues in the other body seem content to echo the refrains of      the insurance industry and heap blame for the problem of rising      insurance premiums rates on trial lawyers and the victims of medical      malpractice themselves  I have opposed arbitrary caps on damages      because they will inflict additional harm on the most vulnerable      victims of medical malpractice  Many of us have      questioned the insurance industrys claim that lawsuits are causing      the rise in premium costs since doctors in states that have imposed      damages caps have not seen a reduction in their medical malpractice      insurance premiums  A newly released      report provides shows that our questions were well founded  This      report provides real evidence rather than anecdotal stories      routinely trotted out by the insurance industry advocates  This      study was prepared by a former State Insurance Commissioner      and uses the insurance industrys own numbers to debunk the myths      being advanced by the insurance industry   The study entitled  Falling Claims      and Rising Premiums in the Medical Malpractice Insurance Industry       suggests that malpractice insurers have been overcharging  even      gouging  physicians unconscionably  I expect a number of Senators      will be surprised to learn that the malpractice claims payments      actually went down  in real terms  over the past five years  In      addition  even the insurers own projections of future losses are      declining  Despite these downward trends  year in and year out       these insurers are burdening doctors with increased premium costs      and shifting the blame for their increases on to lawyers and      victims  In the past five      years  premiums have more than doubled even though claims payments      have been stable  In 2004  malpractice insurers total premiums were      three times higher than their payouts  During the years 2000 to      2004  net premiums increased by 120 percent  while net claims      payments increased by less than 6 percent  I urge Senators      to read this report  It is based entirely on data from annual      statements filed under oath with state insurance departments by the      nations 15 largest malpractice insurers  The statements contain      each insurers estimate of how much it will pay out in malpractice      claims  as well as data showing how much it actually paid out in      claims and took in premiums  Claims and projected losses are down       It is only premiums that are rising  not claims   What this boils      down to is an insurance industry problem  not a problem with the      legal system  No wonder that the state attorneys general of      Connecticut and Missouri have reacted to the study by attacking      industry practices and calling for an aggressive regulatory      response  As this study      makes clear  high malpractice insurance premiums are not the result      of malpractice lawsuit verdicts  They are the result of investment      decisions by the insurance companies and of business models geared      toward ever increasing profits  I hope that this study once and for      all shines light on the real culprit in rising malpractice insurance      rates and informs the Senate with solid evidence of the best way to      assist the good doctors who commit their professional lives to      caring for others  I ask unanimous consent that the Executive      summary of the study be inserted into the Record  To be sure       different States have different experiences with medical malpractice      insurance  and insurance remains a largely State regulated      industry  Each State should endeavor to develop its own solution to      rising medical malpractice rates because each state has its own      unique problems  Some Statessuch as my own  Vermontwhile      experiencing problems  do not face as great a crisis as others       But another fact of the insurance      industrys business model requires a federal legislative      correctionits blanket exemption from federal anti trust laws       Insurers have for years enjoyed a special benefit in our      marketplace  The McCarran Ferguson Act permits insurance companies      to operate without being subject to most of the Federal antitrust      laws  and our Nation s physicians and their patients are suffering      from this special treatment  Using their exemption  insurers can      collude to set rates  resulting in higher premiums than true      competition would achieve  and because of this exemption       enforcement officials cannot investigate any such collusion  If      Congress is serious about controlling rising premiums  we must      revoke this blanket exemption created in the McCarran Ferguson Act       That is why today I introduce the      Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2005  I want to      thank Senators Kennedy  Boxer  Corzine  Durbin  Feingold  Mikulski       Obama  Rockefeller  and Salazar for cosponsoring this      essential legislation  Our bill modifies the McCarran Ferguson Act      for the most pernicious anti trust offenses  price fixing  bid      rigging  and market allocations  I am hard pressed to imagine that      anyone could object to a prohibition on insurance carriers fixing      prices or dividing territories for anticompetitive purposes  After      all  the rest of our Nations industries manage either to abide by      these laws or pay the consequences   Many State insurance commissioners      police the industry well within the power they are accorded in their      own laws  and some States have antitrust laws of their own that      could cover some anticompetitive activities in the insurance      industry  Our legislation would not affect regulation of insurance      by State insurance commissioners and other State regulators  There      is no reason to continue a system in which the Federal enforcers are      precluded from prosecuting the most harmful antitrust violations      just because they are committed by insurance companies   This legislation is a carefully      tailored solution to one critical aspect of the problem of excessive      medical malpractice insurance premiums  I hope that quick action by      the Judiciary Committee and then by the full Senate  will ensure      that this real solution is adopted before more damage is done to the      physicians of this country and to the patients that they serve       Only professional baseball has      enjoyed an anti trust exemption comparable to that created for the      insurance industry by the McCarran Ferguson Act  Senator Hatch and      I have joined forces several times in recent years to scale back      that exemption for baseball  and in the Curt Flood Act of 1998 we      successfully eliminated the exemption as it applied to employment      relations  I hope we can work together again to create more      competition in the insurance industry  just as we did with baseball       If Congress is serious about      helping to control rising medical malpractice insurance premiums       then we must limit the insurance industrys broad exemption to      Federal antitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance      marketplace
