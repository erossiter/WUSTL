           Leahy  Specter Inquire About     Former DOJ Official s Account     Of  Uncomfortable  Conversation With Attorney General      Leading Judiciary Senators Ask Inspector General Whether Internal     Investigation     Is Looking Into Conversation Between The Two Potential Witnesses  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  June     6     Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    and     Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa    sent a letter to Department of     Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine today asking if the expansion of     his internal investigation included a conversation former DOJ official     Monica Goodling had with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales about the     firings of several federal prosecutors before she resigned from the     Department  Goodling testified     before the House Judiciary Committee last month about a meeting she had     with Attorney General Gonzales   shortly     before she resigned that made her     uncomfortable  At this meeting  Mr  Gonzales recounted to her his     recollection of the process leading up to and including the firing and     replacement of several U S  Attorneys  according to Goodlings     testimony  She testified the conversation was the Thursday or Friday     before she resigned   In addition to the ongoing     congressional investigation into the firings and replacement of the     federal prosecutors  the DOJ Inspector Generals Office and Office of     Professional Responsibility  have been investigating matters relating to     the firings since March  The two offices recently notified the Senate     and House Judiciary Committees that they were expanding their internal     investigation to include improper considerations in DOJs hiring of     career employees               Below is the text of the     letter       Following the letter are     transcript excerpts from Goodlings testimony before the House Judiciary     Committee on May 23rd regarding her conversation with     Attorney General Gonzales  as well as Attorney General Gonzaless     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 19th     regarding his lack of contact with officials involved in the firing and     replacement of federal prosecutors    June 5  2007 The Honorable Glenn A      Fine    Inspector General    The Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW    Washington  D C  20530 0001 Dear Inspector General     Fine  Thank you for your     letter of May 30  notifying the Committee of the expansion of your     investigation into issues related to the dismissals of several U S      Attorneys  This letter followed up on your earlier letter of March 26     notifying the Committee of the joint investigation into the matter by     your office and the Office of Professional Responsibility  In your most recent     letter  you notified us that you have expanded your investigation to     include allegations regarding improper political or other     considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice  On     May 23  Monica Goodling admitted during her testimony before the House     Judiciary Committee that she crossed the line with respect to such     considerations  She also testified     about a meeting she had with Attorney General Gonzales that made her     uncomfortable in the days before she resigned from the Department of     Justice  She testified that Mr  Gonzales recounted to her his     recollection of the process leading up to and including the firing and     replacement of several U S  Attorneys  Mr  Gonzales had previously     testified to this Committee that he was being careful not to speak to     others involved in the replacement of US  Attorneys about those matters     because he thought that inappropriate  Ms  Goodling s     testimony prompted Congressman Davis to ask whether the Attorney General     was engaged in inappropriately communicating with someone he knew was a     participant in and witness to the matters under investigation in order     to shape her testimony  Although you mentioned the expansion of your     inquiry with respect to the consideration in hiring decisions of     improper political considerations  you did not mention this incident in     your recent letter  Does the expansion of your inquiry include this     matter  We look forward to     your response   PATRICK LEAHY     Chairman  ARLEN SPECTER    Ranking Member              CQ     Transcript Excerpt of Senate Judiciary Committee w  Gonzales on April     19  2007   emphasis added      Sen      GRASSLEY  OK      In prior statements  you indicated that you really hadn t been     involved in any discussions or deliberations to remove the U S      attorneys       But e mails indicated that you had discussions with Mr  Sampson about     this in late 2004 or early 2005  and that you attended a November 2006     meeting just prior to the firings       Mr  Sampson testified before this committee that your statements weren t     fully accurate  And your testimony today backtracks on what you said     earlier       Why is your story changing       Can you tell us when you first got involved and the extent of your     participation in the process to evaluate and replace U S  attorneys       And additionally  who came up with a plan to evaluate U S  attorneys   Alberto GONZALES  Yes  sir       Well  the reason why my statements initially were incorrect was because     I had not gone back and looked at the record       Since then  I ve tried to clarify it  I think Mr  Sampson  even in his     testimony  said that I had clarified my statements       The meeting    the e mail that you re referring to  a discussion that     happened in either  I think January  05    as I recall  Senator  would     relate to a discussion that would have happened in Christmas week        between Christmas and New Year s and just weeks before my confirmation      And so I don t have a recollection of that discussion  quite frankly          But what we have tried to do since this time  since early March  is     gather up as much information as we can and provide to the Congress     documents and make people available so that we can get to the bottom of     what happened here       And I m here to provide what I know  what I recall as to the truth in     order to help the Congress help to complete the record  But there are     clearly some things that I don t know about what happened       And it s frustrating to me  as head of the department  to not know that     still today  But I haven t talked to witnesses because of the fact     that I haven t wanted to interfere with this investigation and     department investigations   CQ     Transcript Excerpt of House Judiciary Committee Hearing w  Goodling on     May 23  2007     Rep  DAVIS     When is the last time     you spoke to the attorney general  Ms  Goodling    Monica GOODLING  I spoke to him the Thursday or Friday my last     full week at the department  and then I took leave the following         DAVIS  Do you have a     good memory of that conversation  Ms  Goodling    GOODLING  I have     memory of some of it    DAVIS  Was there any     part of that conversation that made you uncomfortable     GOODLING  Yes     DAVIS  Would you tell     the committee about it    GOODLING  I had     decided that I couldn t continue working on his staff because of the     circumstances  I felt that I was somewhat paralyzed  I just felt like I        I was distraught  And I felt that I wanted to make a transfer       So I went back to ask him if it would be possible for me to transfer out     of his office  He said that he would need to think about that  And I     think he was  you know  trying to  you know  just trying to chat  I was     on his staff  But he then proceeded to say  Let me tell you what I can     remember  And he kind of    he laid out for me his general recollection     of      DAVIS  Recollection     of what  Ms  Goodling    GOODLING  Of some of the process   DAVIS  Some of the     process regarding what    GOODLING  Some of the     process regarding the replacement of the U S  attorneys  And he    he     just    he laid out a little bit of it  and then he asked me if he     thought    if I had any reaction to his iteration       And I remember thinking at that point that this was something that we     were all going to have to talk about  and I didn t know that it was    I     just    I didn t know that it was maybe appropriate for us to talk about     that at that point  and so I just didn t  As far as I can remember  I     just didn t respond    GOODLING  And so I     just didn t  As far as I can remember  I just didn t respond     JACKSON LEE  The time     of the gentleman has expired  We now recognize the distinguished     gentleman from Illinois  Mr  Gutierrez for five minutes     GUTIERREZ  Thank you     very much       I would like to yield my time to Mr  Davis    DAVIS  Thank you  Mr      Gutierrez       Had you finished your answer  Ms  Goodling  regarding your conversation     with the attorney general    GOODLING  I think     there was a little bit more to the discussion  but I m having trouble     remembering it    DAVIS  Well  let me     try to help you a little bit  I know it s been a long day  and so let me     try to help you a little bit       You said that you thought part of the conversation was inappropriate     with the attorney general  Did you say that  Ms  Goodling    GOODLING  I don t know if I said    I didn t know if I meant to     say inappropriate  I said it made me a little uncomfortable    DAVIS  What was it that made you uncomfortable about your     conversation with the attorney general  Mr  Gonzales   GOODLING  I just    I did not know if it was appropriate for us     to both be discussing our recollections of what had happened  and I just     thought maybe we shouldn t have that conversation    GOODLING  So I didn t respond to what he said    DAVIS  Why did you think it might be inappropriate for you to     have this conversation with the attorney general    GOODLING  I just knew that  at some point  we would probably all     have to talk about our conversations and I just    I m not saying that I        I m not saying that I definitely thought it was inappropriate  I     think  in all fairness  that he was just talking to someone on his staff     and I was distraught and I was asking for a transfer       And I think he was being kind  He s a very kind man  But I just didn t     know that I thought that maybe this was a conversation that we should be     having    DAVIS  Ms  Goodling  did you tell the attorney general that you     felt that part of his testimony  or part of his public statements  were     not fully accurate    GOODLING  No  I didn t    DAVIS  And was there a reason why you didn t share with the     attorney general that part of what he had said to the committee or the     public might not be accurate    GOODLING  I just    I     feel like it    I feel like after he had the press conference  people     came out fairly soon and said that they thought the statements were     inaccurate  I don t think that I needed to do that  I think that other     people had already raised questions about that       DAVIS  Do you think the attorney general appreciated that he had     made statements that were not accurate    GOODLING  I don t know    DAVIS  Did you ask him    GOODLING  No  I didn t    DAVIS  Do you think the attorney general would have been     concerned about making public statements that were not accurate    GOODLING  I don t know what he    I know that he testified     before the Senate  and he clarified his remarks from his press     conference  So I believe he cared about the fact that he didn t express     everything in the best way that he could  And I think he s already     apologized for that and tried to clarify it    DAVIS  Let me ask you this  Ms  Goodling  During the     conversation that you ve said made you somewhat uncomfortable with the     attorney general  did the attorney general discuss the circumstances     around any of the terminations of the U S  attorneys    GOODLING  He discussed a little bit       As I recall  he just said that he thought that everybody that was on the     list was on the list for a performance related reason  and that he had     been upset with the deputy because he thought that the deputy had     indicated that    by testifying about Mr  Cummins  that there was        that the only reason there was to relieve him in order to give Mr      Griffin a chance to serve       He said that he thought  when he heard that  that that was wrong  that     he really thought that Mr  Cummins was on the list because there was a     performance reason there  too       And    I think there was more to the discussion  That s the part I m     remembering right now  But I think he just kind of laid out what he     remembered and what he thought  And then he asked me if I had any     reaction to it   DAVIS  Do you know    let me ask you this way  You say the     attorney general asked if you had any reaction to what he said       Do you think  Ms  Goodling  the attorney general was trying to shape     your recollection    GOODLING  No  I think he was just asking if I had any     different      DAVIS  But it made you uncomfortable    GOODLING  I just did not know if it was a conversation that we     should be having  and so I just    just didn t say anything      Mr  Davis  I don t know that I have anything to add to that point  but I     do want to clarify  to the extent that at the beginning of your     questioning I indicated answers based on testimony  I want to be    I     want to clarify that I think that the statements you were referencing     were press accounts  and I didn t mean to indicate that      DAVIS  Well  Ms  Goodling  if you ve noticed  what I ve done in     my questions  I ve consistently said either or  I ve referred either to     public statements or to testimony       Let me ask you one final question with my limited time about the     attorney general
