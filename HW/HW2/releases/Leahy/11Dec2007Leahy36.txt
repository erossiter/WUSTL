       Comment Of Sen  Leahy On the U S  Sentencing Commission s Retroactivity   Vote On Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing Policy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee       On The U S  Sentencing Commissions       Retroactivity Vote On Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing Policy    The U S  Sentencing Commission       took yet another important step in addressing the wide disparity       in our federal cocaine sentencing laws  I applaud their effort     I abhor the damage done by drug       abuse  but I also abhor that the penalties for those in our       inner cities are different than for those in affluent society        For 21 years  far too many African Americans and low level drug       offenders were subject to unfair and overly punitive federal       crack cocaine sentencing laws  With the Commissions amendment       to reduce this disparity  we begin the process of healing wounds       which have long shaken the publics confidence in our federal       drug policy  Applying this fix retroactively is only fair and       just                  For Leahys       Congressional Record statement on the changes to the sentencing       policy
