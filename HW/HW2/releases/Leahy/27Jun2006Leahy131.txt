       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Senate Debate Of Flag Desecration   Amendment And Veterans Needs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On Senate Debate Of Flag Desecration Amendment      Veterans Needs      June 27  2006    This       morning we awoke to read the latest example of this       Administrations incompetence  Because of bureaucratic       bungling  widows of those who have served this nation and       sacrificed for all of us have been denied the survivors       benefits to which they should be entitled  A leader of the Gold       Star Wives of America  a group of 10 000 military widows  was       quoted as saying  It is shameful that the government and       Congress do not deliver the survivor benefits equally to all our       widows with the same compassion and precision the military       presents the folded flag at the grave  Edie Smith is right and       we should be ashamed     This news follows other recent       public reports that post traumatic stress disorders among our       veterans are on the rise  Instead of seeking to turn       the flag into a partisan political weapon and the Constitution       into a billboard for political slogans  for partisan gain  we       should be working to fulfill the pressing needs of our veterans       and their families  I wish the Senate would use its time to       discuss and solve the real problems that real Americans are       facing right now  instead of trying to stir public passions for       political ends     It was noted today       in one of the newspapers that the Senate is expected to spend       four days debating this amendment  one for each incident of       flag burning that purportedly occurred this year  I       respectfully suggest that in the less than 10 weeks left to us       in session this year  the Senates resources would be better       spent working to improve veterans health care services        survivors benefits and protecting veterans and Americans       privacy  We have just witnessed the largest theft of private       information from the Government ever  the loss of information on       more than 26 5 million American veterans  including more than 2       million who are in active service  nearly 80 percent of our       active duty force and a large percentage of our National Guard       and the Reserve     Let me quote what a       spokeswoman for the American Legion said recently  Our armed       forces personnel have enough on their plates with fighting the       global war on terror  let alone having to worry about identity       theft while deployed overseas  A spokesman for the VFW said        This confirms the VFW s worst fear from day one   that the loss       of data encompasses every single person who did wear the uniform       and does wear the uniform today    Because of the       recklessness of the Bush Cheney Administrations Department of       Veterans Affairs  our veterans and our active duty service       members are now worried whether their personal information is       being sold on the black market or available to foreign       intelligence services or terrorists  That adds up to a heckuva       bad job for  Americas veterans and our men and       women in uniform     Three weeks after       the theft  it was finally disclosed  Three weeks after that        the Administration finally announced that it would do what it       should have done from day one by making credit reporting       available to those affected  And the Administration is still       fighting paying for its mistakes  It is resisting the efforts       by Senators Byrd and  Murray to provide the additional  160       million that is needed to pay for credit monitoring and       proposing to take the money from veterans health care or other       programs  That is wrong     Such incompetence at       the Bush Cheney Department of Veterans Affairs is worse than       anything I have seen in six presidential administrations  At       some point  this Administration has got to stop appointing and       hiring cronies  and at some point they might really take       responsibility and we might have some real accountability for       their incompetence     Rather than work on       our privacy and identity theft legislation  rather than proceed       on bill protecting veterans  such as Senator Akakas or Senator       Kerrys  we are being directed to another divisive debate on a       proposed constitutional amendment  The White House calls the       tune  and this Republican led Congress is quick to dance to it        This is a White House that does not even list veterans as an       issue on its website     The nations       veterans  who have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice       for their country  deserve better  In his second       inaugural  while the nation was fighting the Civil War        President Lincoln concluded with words that became the motto of       the Veterans Administration and remains on metal plaques around       the Vermont Avenue doors of the VA office here in Washington        To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his       widow  and his orphan  In this fundamental mission  this       Administration has lost its way     What       the Bush Administrations budget says is that honoring veterans       is not a priority  especially when it comes to medical care       The Presidents       budget requests consistently fall short of the levels needed to       provide necessary services and care  Secretary Nicholson had to       admit a billion dollar shortfall last year after first issuing       inaccurate and unfounded denials of his mismanagement      And when Democratic       Senators  like Senators Murray  Akaka  or Nelson  offer       amendments to fund veterans programs  Republicans refuse to       support those amendments to bring funding up to the levels       recommended by the Independent Budget and just plain common       sense    We heard in March       2004 from the Chairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance  Major       General Patrick Brady  that we have never fully met the needs       of our veterans  This echoed General Bradys frank admission       following our April 1999 hearing that the most pressing issues       facing our veterans were not flag burnings  but rather broken       promises  especially health care  Sadly  it appears playing       politics with veterans emotions rather than sustaining their       health care is nothing new  Tragically  it continues      The most recent       supplemental spending bill excluded almost  400 million in       additional spending for the veterans health care  Again  the       Administration said it did not need the additional fundingbut       our veterans need it     The Bush budget for       veterans simply does not account for the increase in demand for       VA services due to the  Iraq war  With nearly 20 percent of       those returning from Iraq reporting mental health problems and       35 percent of Iraq war veterans needing health care services  we       are not providing the resources that we should  Consider the       cost of inflation and the increased costs for medicine and       services and you can understand why the American Legion projects       that more than  1 billion is needed in further funding just to       meet annual payroll and medical inflation costs      Most disturbing is       the move to make veterans contribute a larger share to provide       their own health care  This Administration continues its       efforts to impose onerous fees and co payments on our nations       veterans  This parallels the demands on families to buy armor        helmets and other supplies for their family members serving in       our armed forces  The Bush Administration plans to increase by       almost  800 million this year the fees and collections from       third parties for veterans health care  They plan on imposing       an annual enrollment fee and doubling prescription drug       co payments for certain veterans  Veterans are being forced to       subsidize their government health care  So much for the words       on the veterans building in  Washington    We seem headed back       to the time after World War I when veterans had to come to            Washington and lived in tent cities to demand that the       Government honor the words of President Lincoln and care for       them and those others had left behind     Instead of debating       polarizing issues that we have talked about in election years        we should be acting to provide real resources for our men and       women who served this country with honor and sacrifice
