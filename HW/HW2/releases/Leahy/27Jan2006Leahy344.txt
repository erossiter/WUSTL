       Leahy Introduces Judicial Ethics Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy Introduces Judicial      Ethics Bill   Bill Promotes Transparency On      Conflicts Of Interest     And So Called Judicial Junkets  WASHINGTON  Friday  Jan  27   Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has introduced a judicial ethics bill aimed at      preserving the publics confidence in the federal judiciary by      targeting special interest funded junkets and requiring judges to      allow greater access to their recusal lists    Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee  has been a longtime proponent of      judicial ethics reform  offering similar legislation in previous      Congresses  The bill  introduced on Thursday  is cosponsored by      Sens  Russell Feingold  D Wisc   and John Kerry  D Mass     The American people deserve a federal      judiciary that is beyond reproach    in appearance  and otherwise       The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act seeks to ensure continued      public confidence in our federal courts  said Leahy     Leahys statement on the introduction      of the bill is below  A section by section of the legislation      follows                       Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy     The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act of 2006     January 26  2006  I am pleased to introduce the Fair      and Independent Judiciary Act of 2006 because ensuring a fair and      independent judiciary is critical to the system of checks and      balances established in our Constitution  This legislation seeks to      preserve the public confidence that our federal courts enjoy  and      that our courts need to adequately fulfill their constitutional role      in our system  Revelations that judges and justices are receiving      gifts from parties that may appear before them or have a financial      interest in a litigating party undermine the publics trust     For the past four years  editorial      boards across the country have called our attention to the      appearance of impropriety that occurs when federal judges accept      gifts and attend lavish private seminars sponsored by well heeled      corporations  I have proposed similar legislation in previous      congresses to address the problem of private judicial seminars       Last year  despite my ongoing concerns about reports of judicial      activities that undermine public confidence  I withheld these      provisions from a judicial pay raise bill  I had hoped that the      federal judiciary would engage in selfregulation on these timely      and substantive ethical issues  Unfortunately  recent press reports      show continued appearances of impropriety  even by a member of the      Supreme Court  This legislation does not prohibit judges and      justices from attending educational seminars  Instead  it simply      requires them to learn and disclose the private sponsors of the      seminars and make that information public  Then  they would be      allowed to attend the seminars  but at the courts expense  instead      of having special interests pick up their tabs    Another issue that threatens to      undermine confidence in our judicial impartiality was highlighted at      the recent hearings for Judge Alito  Some judges fail to monitor      their financial holdings so that they can properly recuse themselves      from cases where there may be a conflict of interest  One way to be      sure that the recusal laws Congress enacted are being followed by      all federal judges is to allow more transparency of a judges      financial conflicts  This legislation contains a provision to      improve the public s access to the recusal lists that all judges      keep within their chambers or clerks offices    Because the publics trust is at      stake  it is important to require that private seminar providers      fully disclose the litigation interests of their sponsors and to      improve access to judicial conflicts  The American people deserve a      federal judiciary that is beyond reproach    in appearance  and      otherwise  The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act seeks to ensure      continued public confidence in our federal courts  I ask unanimous      consent that the bill be printed in the Record                      Section by      Section of the Bill    The Fair and      Independent Judiciary Act of 2006  The vitality of the third branch of      government is a critical part of the checks and balances established      in our Constitution  Accordingly  we must remain steadfast in our      commitment to a fair and independent judiciary  The      Fair and Independent Judiciary Act includes measures to      instill even greater public confidence in our courts   Title I   SHORT TITLE  This Act shall be cited as the  Fair and Independent Judiciary Act      of 2003   Title II   JUDICIAL EDUCATION FUND  The continuing education of our      judiciary is necessary to ensure that it is able to uphold its      essential constitutional duty  This provision establishes a      monetary fund of  2 000 000 for the next three fiscal years to pay      for expenses related to the attendance of seminars  conferences       symposia and colloquia  The Board of the Federal      Judicial Center will be able to approve reimbursements once they      receive information by the sponsor of the judicial seminar about the      content of the program and the litigation activities of the sponsors      and presenters  Such information will be available to other judges      and the public   Title III   SEMINAR GIFTS PROHIBITED  Public confidence in the impartiality      of the courts is essential to our system of justice  This title      builds on our strong commitment to guaranteeing that every party      appearing before a court is assured that the judge will grant them a      fair hearing  Reports that sitting judges and justices attend      lavish junkets sponsored by parties that appear before them      threatens the appearance and the reality that our courts are truly      impartial  The Fair and      Independent Judiciary Act would establish a fund to      enable the judiciary to be reimbursed for expenses related to      educational events to remove the taint that has emerged from      receiving gifts of vacations from corporations   Title IV   RECUSAL LISTS  Federal judges and justices are      required by statute to recuse themselves and not preside over cases      involving parties in which they or their immediate family hold a      financial stake  The Committee on Financial Disclosure instructs      judges to keep a list of entities whose appearance would require      recusal in their chambers  The      Fair and Independent Judiciary Act would require judges      and justices to keep a copy of their recusal lists with the clerks      office in the courthouse where they sit  This list would be      available to the public to assist parties in ascertaining whether to      file a motion for recusal
