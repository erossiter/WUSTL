       Congress And President Enact Leahy Measure Allocating  15 M  To Target   World s  Neglected Diseases                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Congress And President Enact Leahy      Measure     Allocating  15 M  To Target World s  Neglected Diseases   WASHINGTON  Friday  Jan  6     Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has secured  15 million for treatment of seven      of the world s most neglected diseases  Leahy included his      legislation in the recently enacted Foreign Operations      Appropriations Bill    Signed into law by President Bush on      Nov  14  the bill will fund initiatives to combat intestinal      parasites  leprosy  trachoma  schistosomiasis  onchocerciasis and      lymphatic filariasis  which cause debilitating and disfiguring      illness among hundreds of millions of people in tropical countries   Thankfully  Congress has been      supportive of efforts to treat and prevent HIV AIDS  tuberculosis      and malaria  Yet while our attention focuses on these three killer      diseases  millions of people across our world are suffering from      other diseases that do not exist in our country  Leahy said  I am      pleased that Congress now has allocated funds to treat and prevent      these illnesses that cause immense suffering in the poorest      countries  among the poorest of the poor   The Leahy measure also calls for an      integrated approach to coordinate efforts to maximize donor      contributions to fight these diseases   These are preventable or treatable      diseases  Leahy said  This new effort will enable us to      dramatically improve the lives of millions of people and move us      closer to containing  and ultimately eradicating  these diseases   Leahy is the ranking member of the      Subcommittee on State  Foreign Operations and Related Programs  of      the Appropriations Committee   which handles the Senate s work in      writing the annual budget bill for the State Department and U S       foreign operations  For a decade he has led efforts in Congress to      target global infectious diseases that kill millions each year and      that often also are just a plane flight away from infecting      Americans here at home                 FYI    A recent piece by two leading      doctors about the problem of  neglected diseases  and the importance      of the Leahy Amendment       Fort Worth Star Telegram     January 1  2006  Beating Back Ancient Scourges Of      The Poor  By PETER HOTEZ and ERIC OTTESEN     Special to the Fort Worth Star Telegram  Within the last few weeks  World AIDS      Day and the November 2005 Global Health Summit in New York  The      Woodstock of Global Health  focused the nation s attention on the      plight of the world s poorest people  who suffer disproportionately      from our planet s three greatest medical scourges  malaria       tuberculosis and HIV AIDS   Barely mentioned in these discussions      is a little known group of 13 infectious diseases of poverty       appropriately given the moniker neglected tropical diseases  They      represent a group of ancient conditions that have burdened humans      for thousands of years  boasting detailed and vivid descriptions in      the Bible  Talmud  Egyptian papyrus and other ancient texts   Together  these conditions    with      their exotic names of African sleeping sickness  kala azar  Chagas      disease  lymphatic filariasis  elephantiasis   river blindness       guinea worm  ascariasis  whipworm  hookworm  schistosomiasis       trachoma  Buruli ulcer and leprosy    kill more than 500 000 people      annually and cause disability and hardship in billions more   More often than not  an impoverished      individual living in sub Saharan Africa  Brazil  Central America or      Southeast Asia suffers from several of these diseases at the same      time   By some estimates  these neglected      tropical diseases cause morbidity that is equivalent to each of the      big three  and yet they remain largely forgotten diseases among      forgotten people   One reason is their stigmatizing      character    they are frequently disfiguring and invariably linked      with poverty    so that those afflicted often shun medical attention      and almost always any political limelight   As they are largely confined to      remote rural areas of low income countries  they remain largely      unseen by television viewers   These diseases not only occur in the      setting of poverty but also promote poverty    disabling adults       increasing maternal and infant mortality  and impairing physical and      intellectual development in affected children  Thus  their impact on      the health of the world s poorest profoundly affects their education      and economic development as well   Despite the long standing neglect of      these diseases that afflict 3 billion people worldwide  there is now      unprecedented optimism that their morbidity can be greatly reduced      in the coming years   Why  Principally because scientific      breakthroughs have now paid off in practical solutions  and the      public and private sectors have joined forces to attack these      ancient scourges together   Since the late 1980s  small groups of      scientists  physicians and public health workers have worked to      identify and develop new agents and methods to control these      biblical diseases  Now  with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates      Foundation and the U S  government  experimental vaccines for      kala azar and hookworm have been developed and are undergoing      clinical testing   At the same time  it was discovered      that four drugs developed by the pharmaceutical industry primarily      for human and veterinary use in the industrialized world are also      remarkably effective in controlling the morbidity and reducing the      transmission of many of these neglected diseases as well   The four drugs    ivermectin       albendazole  mebendazol  and azithromycin     are not only effective  but they      are currently being donated free of charge to those in need by Merck       Co  Inc   GlaxoSmithKline  Johnson  Johnson and Pfizer       respectively   Together with the low cost drugs      praziquantel and diethylcarbamazine  it may be feasible to integrate      efforts to control or eliminate six of these neglected tropical      diseases    lymphatic filariasis  river blindness  ascariasis       whipworm  schistosomiasis and trachoma    for an extremely modest      cost of between 40 cents and 90 cents a person   Therefore  in sub Saharan Africa       where an estimated 500 million people are afflicted with these      diseases  total annual treatment could be achieved for  200 to  400      million  a fraction of what it would cost to treat any of the big      three  and with an enormous return on investment both in personal      health and community productivity   Such efforts also reduce transmission      of these diseases to the point of their elimination  In addition       because these infections recently have been recognized to promote      increased susceptibility to malaria  HIV AIDS and tuberculosis       their control may also represent an important ancillary step for      controlling the big three   Identifying the opportunities now      available  Congress just announced an allocation of  15 million from      the Foreign Operations fiscal 2006 appropriation to spur an      initiative for coordinated  cost efficient programs to control and      eliminate those neglected biblical diseases designated as targets      of opportunity because of the available no cost or low cost       effective drug treatment   Although this amount might seem      modest in comparison to the billions of dollars for the President s      Emergency Program for AIDS Relief and other initiatives  it still      represents an unprecedented commitment for efforts to control the      neglected tropical diseases   Indeed  partly because of the modest      costs required for their successful control  if leveraged      appropriately the  15 million allocation for integrated control of      these biblical diseases could have an impact on health and      productivity for the world s most underserved populations in ways      that 10 times that amount might not have for other conditions   We therefore strongly applaud      Congress for passing a Foreign Operations bill that embraces such      visible support for eliminating these long neglected ancient      scourges of the world s poor   ________________________________  Dr  Peter Hotez is professor and      chairman of the Department of Microbiology
