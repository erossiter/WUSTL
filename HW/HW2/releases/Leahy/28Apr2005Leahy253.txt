       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Regarding The Budget Resolution   Conference Agreement Failure To Include Sense Of The Senate Rejecting The   Rescission Of The Crime Victims Fund                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy      Regarding The Budget Resolution Conference Agreement       Failure To Include Sense of the Senate      Rejecting The Rescission Of The Crime Victims Fund       April 28  2005 Mr  LEAHY        Mr  President  I am truly frustrated in the failure of the       Budget Resolution conference agreement to include the Sense of       the Senate provision  which I offered and the Senate accepted       by voice vote  that is intended to head off the       Administrations plans to raid the Crime Victims Fund of over        1 2 billion  The Crime       Victims Fund was created under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984        VOCA  as a separate account  meaning that the revenues in the       Fund are intended to be used solely for financial support of       victim services  The Fund does not depend at all on taxpayer       revenues  it is derived from federal criminal fines        forfeitures  and special assessments  Since its inception        amounts deposited into the Fund in a given fiscal year have       remained available to support victim services in subsequent       fiscal years  Following a       proposal in the Presidents budget  this Budget Resolution       conference agreement would rescind all amounts remaining in the       Fund at the end of FY 2006  an estimated  1 267 billion  That       would leave the Fund with a balance of zero going into FY 2007       to support vital victim services   This is       absolutely shameful and unacceptable  The budget is a statement       of our nations priorities and with this agreement we say to       crime victims  Sorry  but your suffering is no longer our       concern  We are telling crime victims  the victims of child       sexual and physical abuse  domestic violence  sexual assault        robbery  assault  DUI DWI crashes  elder abuse  adults molested       as children  and the survivors of homicide victims  that their       concerns and suffering do not rise to the level of being a       national priority  The       provision that we included in the Senate passed Budget       Resolution expressed the sense of the Senate that we reject the       proposed rescission  It assumes that all amounts that have been       and will be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund  including all       amounts to be deposited in FY 2006 and thereafter  will remain       in the Fund for use as authorized by the Victims of Crime Act  The Crime       Victims Fund is the nations premier vehicle for the support of       victims services  Nearly 90 percent of the Fund is used to       award State crime victim compensation and victim assistance       formula grants  VOCA funded victim assistance programs serve       nearly 4 million crime victims each year  VOCA funded       compensation programs have helped hundreds of thousands of       victims of violent crime   The Fund       also serves victims of federal crimes  VOCA funding supports       victim assistance services provided by U S  Attorneys Offices       and the FBI  as well as the federal victim notification system        It is used for child abuse prevention and treatment grants  and       it is also used to provide emergency relief to victims of       terrorism and mass violence  Since FY       2000  Congress has set a cap on annual Fund obligations       expressly for the purpose of ensuring that a stable level of       funding will remain available for these programs in future       years  The rainy day fund created by this spending cap has       been used to make up the difference between annual deposits and       distributions three times during the past six years    When       Congress began considering caps on Fund obligations  I proposed       and Congress enacted an amendment to the Victims of Crime Act to       clarify our intent to stabilize and preserve the Fund for the       benefit of victims  The amendment  now codified at section       10601 c  of title 42  requires that all sums deposited in the       Fund in any fiscal year that are not made available for       obligation by Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall       remain in the Fund for obligation in future fiscal years        without fiscal year limitation  Thus  in both the       authorization and the appropriations processes  Congress has       clearly and emphatically stated its intent to maintain a stable       source of federal support for essential victim services  Over the       past four years  the Bush Administration and this Republican       Congress have squandered record surpluses and racked up  7 6       trillion in Federal debt as a result of reckless spending and       budget busting tax cuts  Now the President and this Budget       Resolution conference agreement propose to reduce the deficit by       siphoning off resources that we set aside to assist victims of       crime   The entire crime victims       community  including the National Center for Victims of Crime        the National Network to End Domestic Violence  the National       Organization for Parents of Murdered Children  the National       Childrens Alliance  and Mothers Against Drunk Driving  stands       united in opposition to the proposed rescission  These       organizations represent the millions of Americans who become       victims of crime every year  They have argued that rescinding       the Fund at the end of FY 2006 would create a disastrous       situation for victim service providers and their clients   My friend and colleague  Senator       Crapo  recently joined me to lead a bipartisan group of 29       senators on a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee       on Commerce  Justice and Science requesting that they oppose       proposals to rescind all amounts remaining in the Fund at the       end of FY 2006  Each of those senators recognized that we bear       a responsibility to victims of crime  that it is appropriate       that compensation come from convicted criminals and provided to       the victim  and that it is entirely inappropriate to expunge       this money from the Fund and transfer it into the pot of       appropriated taxpayer dollars  In the House  a letter with the       identical request has 91 bipartisan cosigners  Clearly broad       Congressional support for the preservation of the Fund exists  In every       State and every community across the country  the Crime Victims       Fund plays an essential role in helping crime victims and their       families meet critical expenses  recover from the horrific       crimes they endured  and move forward with their lives  It is       an embarrassment that this Budget Resolution agreement fails to       preserve the Fund  as we promised we would  for the benefit of       victims
