       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Comprehensive   Immigration Reform II                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Comprehensive Immigration Reform II     October 18  2005 I commend the      Chairman for convening a second hearing on this important topic       Securing our borders is a challenge that we must face  no matter how      complex and difficult  While tackling these issues we also need to      recognize the key role immigrant labor plays in our economy and      adopt practical guest worker programs that are supportive of that      contribution   In July  the      Administration cancelled the appearance of its two scheduled      witnesses  Michael Chertoff  Secretary of Homeland Security  and      Elaine L  Chao  Secretary of Labor  just days before the hearing       It was the first of two such last minute cancellations of      administration witnesses before the Committee that week  I am      pleased that Secretaries Chertoff and Chao are here today    Since the July      hearing  we have heard many rumors about a White House proposal on      comprehensive immigration reform  Today  we will hear about the      Presidents plan in broad terms  but apparently without significant      detail  I believe that we should give all due respect to any      serious attempt to reform our broken system  whether it comes from      the Congress or the White House  I am disappointed  however  to see      time slipping away  Over the summer  the Senate Majority Leader      said that immigration is not likely to be taken up on the Senate      floor this year  We all know that 2006 is an election year  making      it difficult to advance proposals to solve our immigration problems      free from campaign rhetoric and posturing  I hope that we can take      up these serious issues this year  and avoid the pressure of an      election cycle  In May  Senators      McCain and Kennedy introduced their bill  S 1033  the Secure America      and Orderly Immigration Act  I have said many times that I believe      the McCain Kennedy bill is the appropriate starting point for the      Judiciary Committee to consider immigration reform  This bill      recognizes that much of the nations economy depends on immigrant      labor  and that some of those immigrants do not have legal status       The bill provides an opportunity for those workers to earn legal      status  It contains border security and enforcement provisions       Just prior to the      July hearing  Senators Cornyn and Kyl introduced S 1438  Their      approach supports the concept of a guest worker program but makes it      exceedingly difficult for these non citizens to obtain legal      status  Illegal immigrants would have to leave the U S  and then      meet certain criteria before they could re enter with legal       temporary status  The Cornyn Kyl approach contains some troubling      provisions that we must review carefully  It would authorize state      and local police to enforce federal immigration laws  a policy that      could undermine community policing efforts in immigrant      communities  It would also expand expedited removal programs  which      are already hurting bona fide asylum seekers   Border security      is a pressing issue in Vermont  I remain concerned that the      Administration seems to have ignored Congress clear and consistent      call for substantial increases in staffing for the Border Patrol       The Border Patrols presence on our Northern Border was minimal      before the September 11 attacks  with about 300 agents assigned to      the 4 000 mile border  Last December  Congress passed and the      President signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention      Act of 2004  which mandated an increase of at least 2 000 Border      Patrol agents for FY 2006  with at least 20 percent of the increased      agents to be assigned to the Northern Border  The Presidents      budget  however  would have provided only enough funding to add 210      Border Patrol agents  or about 10 percent of what Congress      mandated  Moreover  it appears that  of those agents provided for      in the Presidents budget  not a single one would be assigned to the      Northern Border  While I was      disappointed that the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference      Report passed by the Senate and House earlier this month failed to      reach authorized levels  it did allocate a total of  6 billion for      securing our Nations borders  which is  378 million more than the      Presidents request  This includes  1 8 billion for border security      between ports of entry  including hiring 1 000 additional Border      Patrol Agents to reach the goal of 10 000 more agents over the next      10 years  and  79 5 million to annualize the cost of 500 Border      Patrol Agents funded in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2004   The approaches to      immigration reform that we will discuss today are complex  I      commend Senators for studying the issues carefully and putting      forward their proposals for our consideration  I look forward to      todays hearing and thank all the witnesses for their      contributions
