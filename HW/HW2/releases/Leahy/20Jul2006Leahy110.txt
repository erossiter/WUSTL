       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Voting Rights Act   Reauthorization And Amendments Act of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Opening Statement Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Fannie Lou Hamer  Rosa Parks  And Coretta Scott King      Voting Rights Act Reauthorization And Amendments Act Of 2006      July 20  2006   The Voting Rights       Act is the cornerstone of our civil rights laws  We honor those       who fought through the years for equality by extending the       Voting Rights Act to ensure that their struggles are not       forsaken and not forgotten  and that the progress we have made       not be sacrificed  We honor their legacy by reaffirming our       commitment to protect the right to vote for all Americans          Reauthorizing and       restoring the Voting Rights Act is the right thing to do  not       only for those who came before    the brave and visionary people       who fought for equality    but also for those who come after us          our children and our grandchildren  No ones right to vote       should be abridged  suppressed or denied in the United States of       America     I thank Chairman       Specter for adopting my suggestion to convene the Judiciary       Committee yesterday in a special session to consider our       bipartisan  bicameral legislation to reauthorize the Voting       Rights Act  Our Senate bill  S 2703  is cosponsored by the       Republican and Democratic leaders  by a bipartisan majority of       the Judiciary Committee and by a bipartisan majority of the       Senate  At the end of our Committee meeting  we voted       unanimously to report our bill favorably to the Senate    I thank Senator       Kennedy  who was here to fight for passage of the original       Voting Rights Act of 1965  for his consistent commitment to       equal rights for all Americans  I commend all those in the       Judiciary Committee who have worked so hard over the last       several months to build a fair and extensive record and to bring       us to this point today  I include those who started with doubts       and who have now come around to supporting our bipartisan bill        which the Judiciary Committee reported out unanimously with all       18 Members in support     Because the bill we       take up today and the bill the Committee voted to report today       are so similar  I know that the Senate debate will be informed       by the extensive record we have built before the Judiciary       Committee  Over the last four months the Senate Judiciary       Committee held nine hearings into all aspects of these matters       and on the overall bill itself  In another indication of       bipartisanship  those hearings were chaired by a large number of       Members of the Committee  including both Republican and       Democratic Senators  No one can say that the hearings were not       fairly conducted  Those Senate hearings supplement those held       in the House on this matter  Indeed  our first hearing was held       for the express purpose of hearing from the lead sponsors from       the House and to receive the results of the House hearings into       our Senate record     In anticipation of       this important matter coming to the Floor  I have been including       statements in the Record in the course of this week to help make       the record we have seen available to the Senate  On Tuesday  my       statement focused on the continuing need for Section 5  On       Wednesday  my statement focused on the continuing need for       Section 203  I refer to these prior statements as parts of this       debate and hope that they will be helpful to other Senators as       we proceed  They reflect my views as the lead Democratic Senate       sponsor   We have fewer than two dozen       legislative days left in this session of Congress  I appreciate       the willingness of our Senate leadership  both Democratic and       Republican  to take up this important measure without delay        The House of Representatives delayed consideration of the Voting       Rights Act for a month due to the recalcitrance of some  We       hope not to suffer the same delay  This is the time for us to       debate  consider and vote on this important legislation  We       should pass the bill in the same form as the House so it can be       signed into law before the Senate recesses for the remainder of       the summer     After the delays in       the House and after having carried the matter since June 22 on       the Judiciary Committee agenda  there is some speculation about       why we are proceeding now  today  We hear that for the first       time in his presidency  President Bush is going to appear today       before the national convention of the National Association for       the Advancement of Colored People  I think it is great that the       President is finally going to appear before the NAACP  If that       had anything to do with our success in the last few days in       getting this bill moving expeditiously through the Senate  I       hope other organizations will invite him to their meetings and       that he will agree to appear     The House passed       bill and the Committee reported bill are very similar  In fact        when we introduced them  we did so in a bipartisan  bicameral        coordinated effort in May  The only change made to the       House passed bill was the inclusion of a governmental study       added in the House Judiciary Committee  In the interest of       expediting final passage of this important measure  I will urge       the Senate to accept that addition     The only change made       during Senate Judiciary Committee consideration was to add an       Hispanic civil rights leader to the roster of those civil rights       leaders for whom the bill is named  We did this at the       suggestion of Senator Salazar  it is a good suggestion  and I       commend him for it  As Senator Salazar has reminded us  Cesar       Chavez is an American hero  He sacrificed his life to empower       the most vulnerable in America  He believed strongly in the       democracy of America and saw the right to vote as a cornerstone       of our freedom  I offered the amendment in the Judiciary       Committee and it was adopted without dissent      I have consulted       with Senator Salazar and neither of us wants to complicate final       passage of the Voting Rights Act  I will urge the Senate to       proceed with the House passed bill and resist amendments so that       it can be signed into law without having to be reconsidered by       the House  With respect to the short title of the bill and the       roster of civil rights leaders honored therein  I have committed       to work with Senator Salazar to conform the law to include       recognition of the contribution to our civil rights  voting       rights and American society by Cesar Chavez in follow up       legislation     The Voting Rights       Act reauthorization is named for three important civil rights       leaders  Fannie Lou Hamer was a courageous advocate for the       right to vote  She risked her life to secure the right to vote       for all Americans  Coretta Scott King was a tenacious fighter       for equality through the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and       up to her recent passing  Everyone in the Senate can remember       when less than a year ago  the body of Rosa Parks lay in state       in the Capitol  the first African American woman so honored        Rosa Parks dignified refusal to be treated as a second class       citizen sparked the Montgomery bus boycotts that are often cited       as the symbolic beginning of the modern civil rights movement         Last week  after months of work        the House of Representatives  led by Congressmen John Conyers        Mel Watt  John Lewis and Chairman Sensenbrenner  rejected all       efforts to reduce the sweep and effect of the Voting Rights       Act  Congressman John Lewis  himself  a courageous leader       during those transformational struggles  only decades ago          said during the House debate  When historians pick up their       pens and write about this period  let it be said that those of       us in the Congress in 2006  we did the right thing  And our       forefathers and our foremothers would be very proud of us  Let       us pass a clean bill without any amendments  The bill we are       considering in the Senate today passed the other body with 390       votes in favor after the other body rejected all four amendments       offered there  I congratulate our House cosponsors on their       successful efforts and hope that we can repeat them here in the       Senate     On May 2nd        when our congressional leadership joined together on the steps       of the Capitol to announce a bipartisan and bicameral       introduction of the Voting Rights Act  it was an historic       announcement and an occasion almost unprecedented during the       last five years of partisanship     We cannot relent in       our fight for the fundamental civil rights of all Americans        Working together  we should pass a clean  bipartisan voting       rights bill  Congress has reauthorized and revitalized the Act       four times  each time with overwhelmingly bipartisan support        pursuant to its constitutional powers  This is no time for       backsliding  it is a time to move forward together    So let us unite to       renew this cornerstone  let us rededicate ourselves to its noble       purpose  and let us commemorate the many who suffered and       endured to bring our cherished ideals closer to reality for       millions of our fellow Americans
