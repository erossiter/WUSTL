       Judiciary Democrats Renew Request For Key Documents On Domestic Spying   Policy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Judiciary Democrats Renew Request     For Key Documents On Domestic Spying Policy    Attorney General Has Not Responded      To Outstanding Request      For Current And Earlier Opinions On Government Surveillance Policies  THURSDAY  Feb       2     After almost a week with no response from the Department of      Justice  the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee on      Thursday renewed their request for the release of key documents      relating to the current and previous policies on government      surveillance   The Committee      Democrats first asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for      correspondence  memoranda and legal opinions on January 27 in a      letter  Senators sought the information in anticipation of the Feb       6 hearing the committee is holding on the controversial surveillance      program  So far  the Department has not responded   The text of the      letter sent today as well as the underlying request for documents is      below               February 2  2006 The Honorable      Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney      General Gonzales   Last week we      wrote to you and asked that you provide relevant information in      advance of the Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday  February 6       2006  in connection with the legal justifications of the recently      revealed NSA surveillance programs  It is disconcerting that you      have not responded but  instead  have refused to provide the      information that we need to conduct the congressional oversight that      is long overdue   As Bruce Fein  a      former Reagan Administration official  observed in his January 31       2006  column  The presidents startling new interpretation of the       Authorization for the Use of Military Force  enjoys little legal      standing  The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed that      contemporaneous interpretations defeat the belated variety  where       as here  they smack of expediency  That is why we asked you to      provide to us  in advance of next weeks hearing  the      contemporaneous communications the Administration had with Congress      about the Authorization for the Use of Military Force  AUMF  and      those contemporaneous internal statements detailing the      Administrations understanding of the meaning of the language of the      AUMF  You have failed to provide the legal opinions rendered by the      Department of Justice relevant to these matters  You have failed      even to provide us with an answer to the question of what specific      language in the AUMF you contend grants authority to the President      to conduct domestic surveillance without seeking warrants from the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the authorizations that      the President has signed in connection with these matters  Your lack of      cooperation is at odds with your testimony at your confirmation      hearing in January 2005  when you indicated that you would respond      to our letters and that you respect and understand the oversight      responsibilities of the Judiciary Committee  You have not appeared      before the Committee since April 2005  The Chairman has been very      solicitous of your schedule in the timing of next weeks hearing       You have had time to make numerous television appearances and      speeches on this subject  It would have been more helpful if you      would have complied with our request for information in a timely      fashion  Please respond to our January 27 letter with the requested      documents prior to your appearance before the Judiciary Committee on      February 6  2006  Sincerely       PATRICK LEAHY     EDWARD KENNEDY     JOSEPH BIDEN     HERB KOHL     DIANNE FEINSTEIN     RUSSELL FEINGOLD     CHARLES SCHUMER     RICHARD DURBIN    Request for Documents  January      27  January 27  2006 The Honorable
