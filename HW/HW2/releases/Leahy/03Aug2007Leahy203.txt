       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Court Security Improvement Act Of   2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     The Court Security Improvement Act Of 2007    August 3  2007     One of the first actions I took this year was to reintroduce the Court     Security Improvement Act of 2007  S 378  on January 24  2007  This     bipartisan bill has a dozen cosponsors here in the Senate  In February     we held a Judiciary Committee hearing at which we heard from Justice     Anthony Kennedy  In March the Judiciary Committee considered and then     reported the bill by unanimous consent       I thank the Majority Leader and the Assistant Majority Leader for their     interest in these matters  Each has witnessed violence against judges in     their home states  With their leadership  in April the Senate was called     upon to consider the measure  I was amazed when it took a cloture motion     to proceed to consideration of court security  Cloture on the motion to     proceed was obtained by a vote of 93 to 3  Thereafter  this important     measure was considered and passed by the Senate on April 19th by a     unanimous vote of 97 to 0  Not a single Senator voted against it  not     even those Senators who objected to proceeding to the bill initially or     the three Senators who voted against cloture on the motion to proceed          A companion bill was considered by the House of Representatives and     passed on a voice vote  To resolve the remaining difference between the     Senate passed measure and the House passed measure we sought to     substitute the Senate passed text into the House bill and to request a     House Senate conference  This is hardly a novel procedure  It is a     standard way to resolve differences and to complete action on     legislation  This routine request has cleared the Democratic side of the     aisle here in the Senate  No Democratic Senator has objected to     proceeding  But  once again  an anonymous objection on the Republican     side is thwarting progress  Just as Republican Senators objected to     proceeding to consider legislation to bolster court security in April      now  an anonymous Republican objection is preventing the Senate from     acting  requesting a conference and moving forward to resolve the     differences and enact this long overdue legislation  Despite the broad     bipartisan support for both the Senate bill and for the House bill  we     are being blocked from going to conference to resolve the minor     differences between them by an anonymous Republican Senator       This obstruction delays the useful provisions in these bills and     threatens important safety measures for our federal judges and their     families  For our justice system to function  our judges must be able to     dispense justice  They and their families must be free from the fear of     retaliation  Witnesses who come forward must be protected  and the     courthouses where our laws are enforced must be secure  We are in danger     of letting this chance to improve the security of our federal courts     slip through our fingers  I am disappointed and troubled that we will     not be improving the security for our federal judges and courthouses     around the nation before we go into recess       I hope that the Republican Senator who has placed this anonymous     objection would remove it  to let us go to conference  and to let us     improve the security that our federal courts need
