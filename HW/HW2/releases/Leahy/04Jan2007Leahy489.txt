       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S  185  The Habeas Corpus Restoration   Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     On S  185  The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act Of 2007     January 4  2007  On the first day of this new Congress       I join Senator Specter to reintroduce a bill to restore the Great      Writ of habeas corpus  a cornerstone of American liberty since the      founding of this Nation  The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007      bill continues our efforts to amend last years Military Commissions      Act  to right a wrong and to restore a basic protection to American      law  This is an issue on which we continue to work together and      urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to join with us     As Justice Scalia wrote in the  Hamdi case  The very      core of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of separated      powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of      the Executive  The remedy that secures that most basic of freedoms      is habeas corpus  It provides a check against arbitrary detentions      and constitutional violations  It guarantees an opportunity to go      to court  with the aid of a lawyer  to prove ones innocence  This      fundamental protection was rolled back in an unprecedented and      unnecessary way in the run up to last falls election by passage of      the Military Commissions Act   The Military Commissions Act      eliminated that right  permanently  for any non citizen determined      to be an enemy combatant  or even awaiting such a determination       That includes the approximately 12 million lawful permanent      residents in the United States today  people who work and pay taxes      in America and are lawful residents  This new law means that any of      these people can be detained  forever  without any ability to      challenge their detention in federal court  or anywhere else       simply on the Governments say so that they are awaiting      determination whether they are enemy combatants   I deeply regret that Senator Specter      and I were unsuccessful in our efforts to stop this injustice when      the President and the Republican leadership insisted on rushing the      Military Commissions Act through Congress in the weeks before the      recent elections  We proposed an amendment that would have removed      the habeas stripping provision from the Military Commissions Act       We fell just three votes short in those political charged days  It      is my hope that the new Senate and new Congress will reconsider this      matter  restore this fundamental protection and revitalize our      tradition of checks and balances    Giving Government such raw  unfettered      power as this law does should concern every American  Last fall I      spelled out a nightmare scenario about a hard working legal      permanent resident who makes an innocent donation to  among other      charities  a Muslim charity that the Government secretly suspects      might be a source of funding for critics of the United States      Government  I suggested that  on the basis of this donation and      perhaps a report of suspicious behavior from an overzealous      neighbor  the permanent resident could be brought in for      questioning  denied a lawyer  confined  and even tortured  Such a      person would have no recourse in the courts for years  for decades       forever   Many people viewed this kind of      nightmare scenario as fanciful  just the rhetoric of a politician       It was not  It is all spelled out clearly in the language of the      law that this body passed  In November  the scenario I spelled out      was confirmed by the Department of Justice itself in a legal brief      submitted in a federal court in Virginia  The Justice Department       in a brief to dismiss a detainees habeas case  said that the      Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any      non citizen designated an enemy combatant without giving that person      any ability to challenge his detention in court  This is true  the      Justice Department said  even for someone arrested and imprisoned in      the United States  The      Washington Post wrote that the brief raises the      possibility that any of the millions of immigrants living in the      United States could be subject to indefinite detention if they are      accused of ties to terrorist groups   In fact  the situation is even more      stark than The Washington Post      story suggested  The Justice Departments brief says that the      Government can detain any non citizen declared to be an enemy      combatant  But the law this Congress passed says the Government      need not even make that declaration  They can hold people      indefinitely who are awaiting determination  whether or not they are      enemy combatants    It gets worse  Republican leaders in      the Senate followed the White Houses lead and greatly expanded the      definition of enemy combatants in the dark of night in the final      days before the bills passage  so that enemy combatants need not be      soldiers on any battlefield  They can be people who donate small      amounts of money  or people that any group of decision makers      selected by the President decides to call enemy combatants  The      possibilities are chilling   The Administration has made it clear      that they intend to use every expansive definition and unchecked      power given to them by the new law  Novembers Justice Department      brief made clear that any of our legal immigrants could be held      indefinitely without recourse in court  Earlier in November  the      Justice Department went to court to say that detainees who had been      held in secret CIA prisons could not even meet with lawyers because      they might tell their lawyers about the cruel interrogation      techniques used against them  In other words  if our Government      tortures somebody  that person loses his right to a lawyer because      he might tell the lawyer about having been tortured  A law      professor was quoted as saying about the Governments position in      that case  Kafka esque doesnt do it justice  This is Alice in      Wonderland    We have eliminated basic legal and      human rights for the 12 million lawful permanent residents who live      and work among us  to say nothing of the millions of other legal      immigrants and visitors who we welcome to our shores each year  We      have removed a vital check that our legal system provides against      the Government arbitrarily detaining people for life without charge       We may well have also made many of our remaining limits against      torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because they are      unenforceable  We have removed the mechanism the Constitution      provides to check Government overreaching and lawlessness   This is wrong  It is      unconstitutional  It is un American  It is designed to ensure that      the Bush Cheney Administration will never again be embarrassed by a      United States Supreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful abuses      of power  The conservative Supreme Court  with seven of its nine      members appointed by Republican Presidents  has been the only check      on this Administrations lawlessness  Certainly the last Congress      did not do it  With passage of the Military Commissions Act  the      Republican Congress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a      check and balance on the Administration    Some Senators uneasy about the      Military Commissions Acts disastrous habeas provision took solace      in the thought that it would be struck down by the courts  Instead       the first court to consider that provision  a federal court in the      District of Columbia  upheld the provision  We should not outsource      our moral  legal and constitutional responsibility to the courts       Congress must be accountable for its actions and we should act to      right this wrong    Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone      who the Government thinks might have assisted enemies of the United      States is unnecessary and morally wrong  It is a betrayal of the      most basic values of freedom for which America stands  It makes a      mockery of the Administrations lofty rhetoric about exporting      freedom across the globe    We should take steps to ensure that      our enemies can be brought to justice efficiently and quickly  I      introduced a bill to do that back in 2002  as did Senator Specter       when we each proposed a set of laws to establish military      commissions  The Bush Cheney Administration rejected our efforts      and designed a regime the United States Supreme Court determined to      be unlawful  Establishing appropriate military commissions is not      the question  We all agree to do that  What we need to revisit is      the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal      immigrants and others  denying their right to challenge indefinite      detainment on the Governments say so     It is from strength that      America should defend our values and our Constitution  It takes      commitment to those values to demand accountability from the      Government  In standing up for American values and security  I will     keep working on this issue until we restore the checks      and balances that are fundamental to preserving the liberties that      define us as a nation  We can ensure our security without giving up      our liberty
