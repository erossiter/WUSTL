       Statement Of Senator Patrick LEahy  Improving the PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Improving The PATRIOT Act      In Support Of The Extension      Senate Floor Statement     Thursday  February 2  2006  I noted earlier this week that I was      concerned that the Republican congressional leadership had not even      proposed to the Senate Democratic leadership or to that of the      Judiciary Committee that action be taken to ensure that certain      sunsetting provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act not be allowed simply      to expire at the end of this week  Thereafter  action was finally      considered  Yesterday the House passed a bill to extend the      sunsetting provisions until March 10  2006  I support H R  4659       Chairman Sensenbrenners bill   Those of us working constructively and      in a bipartisan way to extend the USA PATRIOT Act with improvements      have repeatedly offered to meet to work out the remaining      differences  Regrettably  the Senate leadership has not made the      effort to work through the remaining concerns or to bring us      together  I was concerned because as recently as last week  leading      Republicans were indicating that they opposed another short term      extension that could be used to work out improvements that can lead      to longer term Senate reauthorization    I was concerned that the demagoguery      we had witnessed from the White House and House Republicans would be      repeated  but that this time it would have real consequences  Last      December  even though a majority of Senators  Republicans and      Democrats  those who voted against cloture on the conference report      that failed to pass the Senate and those who voted for it  urged      the Republican Leader to act on a short term  3 month extension      before the end of the last session  At that time the President had      said that he would not approve a short term extension  and House      Republicans had said that they would not allow a short term      extension  Those who threatened to let it expire were playing a      dangerous political game  Fortunately  common sense prevailed  and      in the waning days of the last session  just before adjournment for      Christmas  the House approved a short term extension until February      3  and the President reversed his earlier position and signed it      into law    Now the Republican leadership of the      House and Senate is proposing a second extension that will last for      another five weeks  until March 10  That is in line with the      initial bipartisan proposal that Senator Sununu and I made in      S 2082  back on December 12  that came to be cosponsored by 47      Senators  It is my hope that this will allow us the opportunity to      work out improvements to the reauthorization legislation to better      protect the liberties and rights of ordinary Americans  We should      do our best to get it right for all Americans    I have continued meeting and talking      with interested Republican and Democratic Senators  Senate staff      has finally gotten together this week in a bipartisan meeting  I      have joined in a bipartisan request to the Majority Leader that he      bring together key interested Senators to work out a bipartisan      compromise that improves the failed conference report     Contrary to the false claims and      misrepresentations by some  there was no effort on either side of      the aisle to do away with the PATRIOT Act  That is simply and      profoundly not true  Along with others here in the Senate  I am      seeking to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act  not to end it  There is      no reason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is      both effective and that adequately protects their rights and their      privacy  The only people who ever threatened an expiration of the      PATRIOT Act were the President and House Republicans  As I noted on      December 21  the Administration and the Republican congressional      leadership were those who were objecting to extending the Act and      threatening its expiration  That was wrong  That made no sense       They came to their senses in the days that followed     In his State of the Union speech this      week the President said only that reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act was      needed to provide the same tools we provide to law enforcement      authorities to fight drug trafficking and organized crime  I have      worked with others to provide additional tools in the fight against      terrorism  With others on both sides of the aisle  I also want to      protect the liberties of ordinary and law abiding Americans from      overreaching and unchecked Government intrusion  Permanent gag      orders and conclusive presumptions in favor of the Government  when      intrusive demands for library records or personal medical records      are being made by agents without court approval  smack of a police      state  not the United States    Republican and Democratic Senators      joined together last month to say we can do better to protect      Americans liberties while ensuring that our national security is as      strong as it can be  In the days after 9 11  the Senate Democratic      majority joined with Republicans and the Administration in      bipartisan action  Unfortunately  the Presidents political adviser      Karl Rove and other Republican partisans have sought to make the      PATRIOT Act a partisan issue  I urge them  instead  to join with      our bipartisan coalition and work with us to provide a better      balance to protect the rights of ordinary Americans     Every single Senator    Republican and      Democratic    voted last July to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act       That bipartisan solution was cast aside by the Bush Administration      and Republican congressional leaders when they hijacked the      conference report  rewrote the bill in ways that fell short in      protecting basic civil liberties  and then tried to ram it through      Congress as an all or nothing proposition I have joined with      Senators of both parties in an effort to work to improve the bill       Some of us are working hard to protect the security and liberty of      Americans  What is wrong is for the White House to seek to      manipulate this into a partisan fight for its partisan political      advantage  Instead of playing partisan politics  the Bush      Administration and Republican congressional leadership should join      in trying to improve the law  Especially when security and liberty      are at issue  why not make the extra effort to produce a consensus      bill that can deserve the confidence of the American people     This is a vital debate  The terrorist      threat to Americas security is very real  and it is vital that we      be armed with the tools needed to protect Americans security  At      the same time  the threat to civil liberties is also very real in      America today  The question is not whether the Government should      have the tools it needs to protect the American people  Of course      it should  That is why I co authored the PATRIOT Act five years      ago  and that is why that Act passed with broad bipartisan support       When I voted for the PATRIOT Act  I did not think it was an ideal      piece of legislation  and I knew that it would need careful      oversight and  in due course  reform  This is about how to      reconcile two fundamental goals    ensuring the safety of the      American people and      protecting their liberty by means of a system of checks and balances      that keeps the Government    their Government    accountable  Those goals should not be the      goals of any particular party or ideology  they are shared American goals    Our nation is a democracy  founded on      the principles of balanced government  We need to restore checks      and balances in this country to protect us all and all that we hold      dear  Our Congress and our courts provide checks on the abuse of      executive authority and should protect our liberties  We need to      write the law so that Congress has provided its check in the law and      so that courts can play their role  as well  All Americans need to      take notice and demand that their liberties and security be properly      and effectively maintained
