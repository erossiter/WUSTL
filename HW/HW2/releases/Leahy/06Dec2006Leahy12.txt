       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Report Of The Iraq Study Group                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt       On The Report Of The Iraq Study Group     Wednesday  December 6  2006  This report is another strong signal      that consensus has emerged in this country  across the political      spectrum  that stay the course proved its failure as a strategy in      Iraq long ago    Like all Americans  I want a credible      strategy for withdrawing American troops from Iraq and a path for a      political settlement that stabilizes the country  Our open ended      military presence in Iraq continually signals to Iraqi politicians      that they don t have to take the necessary steps to stand up to the      militias and address the underlying problems that are fueling the      violence  In the meantime  while the Presidents strategy seems to      be little more than repeating the word victory  our troops are      stuck in the middle of a civil war and thousands of Iraqi civilians      live under the specter of suicide bombings and ethnic cleansing       Mr  Gates underscored the plain reality yesterday that we are not      winning in Iraq    The authors of this report deserve our      thanks  They have taken a hard look at a complex situation that has      been growing worse by the day  It may be too late to achieve the      outcome we want  even if the reports recommendations are      implemented  But while there are no guarantees  the report does      identify a package of measures which  in the view of this      experienced  bipartisan group  may offer the best chance  however      fleeting    of stabilizing the country and bringing home the bulk of      our troops within a year   This report will have relevance only      if the President  the Commander In Chief  adopts a clear  credible      new strategy   There are many positive aspects to the      Study Groups recommendations  like the withdrawal of most of our      combat forces over the next year  enhanced training of Iraqi forces       a better coordinated reconstruction effort  and a greater focus on      engagement with Iraqs regional neighbors    The most important thing that this      report may achieve is to jolt the White House into a clear eyed      recognition of todays reality in Iraq   I suspect no one will be satisfied      with every aspect of these recommendations  and I worry most of all      that the President may simply be unwilling to accept the reality of      a very dire situation and take the necessary steps to bring our      troops home
