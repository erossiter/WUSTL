       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Consideration Of The Fairness In   Asbestos Injury Resolution                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Consideration Of S  852  The Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution      Or FAIR Act     Senate Floor     February 6  2006  I am pleased to join Senator Specter       the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Senator Feinstein and      others in urging my colleagues to move to consider  S 852  our      bipartisan bill to address the serious and urgent problem of      asbestos related disease  The time is now for Congress to solve      this dire situation  victims have been waiting long enough for a      comprehensive  national solution   This legislation is the product of      years of difficult and conscientious negotiation  Building on the      Judiciary Committees work last Congress under former Chairman      Hatch  we have crafted a fair and efficient plan that will ensure      adequate compensation to the thousands of victims of asbestos      exposure  but that also will give due consideration to the      businesses that should  and will  provide that compensation  Our      bipartisan legislation does that  Asbestos has wreaked havoc on the      lives of the victims of asbestos exposure and has overwhelmed our      Nations court system as it tries to compensate them  We have      worked hard and long in an open process to produce a balanced bill      that offers fair solutions    Senator Specter  with whom I have      worked very closely  rightly calls this one of the most complex      issues we have ever tackled  It is not the bill that I would have      written  were I alone responsible for its drafting  nor is it the      bill that Senator Specter would have produced  It should not      surprise anyone to hear that the interested groups  the labor      unions  the businesses contributing to the trust fund  their      insurers  and the trial bar  are each less than pleased with some      portion of the bill or another  That is the essence of legislative      compromise  We have kept the ultimate goal of fair compensation to      victims impaired by asbestos exposure as the lodestar of our      efforts  and we have all had to make compromises on a variety of      subsidiary issues as we worked together to resolve this emergency       What we have achieved is a significant and needed step toward a more      efficient and more equitable method to compensate asbestos victims       The fact that only 42 cents of every dollar spent on the burgeoning      dockets of litigation in this area goes to actual victims of      asbestos exposure is a national disgrace  We can and we must do      better for all involved in this crisis  They need our help and they      need it now    The Ravages Of      Asbestos  Asbestos is one of the most lethal      substances ever to be widely used in the workplace  Between 1940      and 1980  more than 27 5 million workers were exposed to asbestos       and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long      periods of time  We even know of family members who have suffered      asbestos related disease from washing the work clothes of their      loved ones  The ravages of disease caused by asbestos have affected      tens of thousands of American families  We need a more honest and      reliable health screening program and swifter compensation for those      affected    In light of the devastating damage      asbestos has wreaked  it is hard to believe that this dangerous      product is still being used today  yet it is  This bill will put a      stop to that  and by doing so  we will protect yet another      generation from becoming victims of asbestos exposure     The economic harm caused by asbestos      is also real  and the resulting bankruptcies are a different kind of      tragedy for everyone    for workers and retirees  for shareholders       and for the families that built these companies  In my home State      of Vermont  the Rutland Fire and Clay Company is among      the more than 70 companies to have declared bankruptcy    The late Chief Justice Rehnquist has      declared that the elephantine mass of asbestos cases cries out for      a legislative solution  In additional opinions written by Justice      Ginsburg  the Supreme Court has repeatedly called on Congress to act      because a nationwide administrative claims processing regime would      provide the most secure  fair  and efficient means of compensating      victims of asbestos exposure  I agree  our Committees Chairman      agrees  Senator Feinstein agrees  and we hope that many others in      the Senate will agree    Broad Support  This bipartisan legislation has earned      the support of many organizations that represent victims of serious      asbestos exposure  Asbestos disease has tragically weighed      especially heavily on one group in particular  our nations war      veterans  These brave veterans are unable to receive compensation      under our current system and have repeatedly asked their      representatives in Congress for help  The Military Order of the      Purple Heart noted in their last letter of support that the FAIR      Act is the only viable solution for sick veterans   In their latest letter to the Minority      Leader urging him to proceed to consideration of our bipartisan      bill  more than 30 organizations representing veterans noted that      The FAIR Acts victims trust fund would open a door for Veterans      that has been closed for years   Other organizations that represent      victims of asbestos exposure have also endorsed our bipartisan      bill  In the past week  we have received renewed letters of support      from the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and      Asbestos Workers union  the International Union of United      Automobile  Aerospace  Agricultural Implement Workers of America  UAW        and the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades  These      labor unions represent literally hundreds of thousands of families      that have suffered from asbestos exposure  They support S 852      because they are firmly convinced it would be far superior to the      current tort system in compensating the victims of asbestos related      diseases   The National Governors Association      has also called on Congress to proceed on this bipartisan bill   In addition to the support of groups      that represent those exposed to asbestos  our bill has earned the      support of small businesses like the 600 000 members of the National      Federation of Independent Business  as well as hundreds of larger      companies that will be contributing to this  140 billion dollar      trust fund    These statements of support in many      ways tell the story of what we have accomplished with this      legislation  We have crafted a bill fair enough to garner a      favorable response from veterans groups  labor unions  small      businesses  and companies with considerable asbestos liabilities       We have worked on this legislation for several years now  and as my      partners in this effort can attest  garnering this level of      consensus has been no small feat  I ask unanimous consent that the      text of these letters be printed in the Record     A Carefully      Balanced Bill  The bipartisan efforts of the last two      years have been productive  With the help of Senior Judge Edward      Becker  the primary stakeholders have worked diligently  and as a      result we have reached a compromise agreement on a national trust      fund that will fairly compensate victims of asbestos exposure  With      the Chairmans leadership  the disparate interests have reached      consensus on many issues such as overall funding of  140 billion and      a streamlined administrative process within the Department of      Labor  Compensation will be awarded and paid outside of the court      system through a simplified administrative claims process  There is      no need to prove liability or identify a particular defendants      product  There is  instead  a claims process where those who      exhibit specified medical symptoms and evidence of disease are      compensated    Last Congress I was disappointed by      the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee  S 1125  and by the      purely partisan bill that was introduced as a substitute without      Committee consideration  S 2290   As compared to those efforts  our      bipartisan bill includes significant and necessary improvements       Our bipartisan bill provides higher compensation awards for victims       with  1 1 million for victims of mesothelioma   300 000 to  1 1      million for lung cancer victims   200 000 for victims of other      cancers caused by asbestos   100 000 to  850 000 for asbestosis  and       25 000 for what we call mixed disease cases    All likely asbestos victims are      eligible for medical monitoring  and unlike previous asbestos bills       our bipartisan legislation provides for medical screening of      high risk workers  a relatively low cost way to make sure that those      most likely to be harmed are diagnosed properly and without the      taint of some screening programs that have occurred in the past        Another essential improvement in our      bipartisan bill ensures that victims awards from the new trust fund      will not be subject to subrogation by insurance companies  This      means that victims will not have to give up any of their      much deserved compensation just because they received workers      compensation or health insurance benefits in the past     The initial funding of this trust fund      is more substantial than the partisan bill from the last Congress       providing for almost  43 billion of the total  140 billion in the      first five years  And unlike the earlier bill  this bill ensures      that the contributors into the fund will be a matter of public      record  as are their obligations to the fund  We have also      strengthened enforcement provisions so that the Fund Administrator      can collect contributions owed by businesses    Our bill also guarantees that pending      court cases that are before juries  and certainly those that have      reached judgment at the trial court level  will not be upset by the      new trust fund  Previous bills would have preempted these mature      cases and overridden all civil settlements that had any remaining      payments or performance outstanding  Our bipartisan asbestos bill      protects those settlements between named defendants and named      victims  and also protects settlements that provide for future      health insurance or health care    There are other improvements to the      trust fund plan over last years effort  The partisan legislation      of last Congress provided no real incentive for the fund to start      processing claims  Thanks in large part to Senator Feinsteins      work  the Specter Leahy bill creates an incentive for the fund to      begin processing claims quickly  If it is not operational within      nine months  the sickest victims will be able to return to the tort      system  If the fund is not operational within 24 months  all      asbestos victims can return to the tort system    Victims of asbestos exposure who have      less than a year to live and those with mesothelioma deserve an      especially fast track to compensation  Currently  many victims wait      years in pending court actions or pending bankruptcy confirmation to      receive any final determination of their claim  Once their claims      are adjudicated in the current system  payments are often further      delayed because of lengthy appeals and their recovery is diminished      significantly by attorneys fees and court costs  Also  many of      these victims receive only pennies on the dollar from overwhelmed      bankruptcy trusts  Our legislation provides them lump sum payments      and strong incentives for expedited settlements for these victims       I thank the senior Senator from California for her      tireless efforts on behalf of those citizens in the most urgent need      of our help    In negotiating this complex      legislation we compromised on one category of compensation for a      particular class of lung cancer sufferers  Those who have had      significant asbestos exposure  but whose x rays show no markings of      asbestos related disease  are not entitled to compensation under the      Fund  Because of the absence of asbestos markers  it is not      possible to conclude that asbestos caused their disease  If they      develop markings  however  they will become eligible for      compensation from the asbestos trust fund    As with many other administrative      compensation programs  this bill sets a limit on attorneys fees for      claims within the Fund  In connection with this asbestos fund  the      limit is set at 5 percent on victims awards within the fund  There      are no attorney fee limits for representation of asbestos victims      outside the administrative Fund  Unlike the current system where      victims received less than half of the money spent  this fee cap      removes any incentive for litigation abuses and puts more money into      the hands of those injured by asbestos exposure   In addition  in order to prevent      victims of asbestos exposure from retooling their complaints to      circumvent the asbestos trust fund  the bill also imposes a higher      burden of proof within the tort system for plaintiffs seeking      damages resulting from exposure to silica    The Scourge Of      Asbestos Disease Must End  The problems we are addressing are      complex  this bill necessarily reflects these complexities  and its      drafting was not easy  The compromises we had to make were      difficult but necessary to ensure that we created a trust fund that      would provide adequate compensation to the thousands of workers who      have suffered  and continue to suffer  the devastating health effect      of asbestos  The tragic history of asbestos use in our country must      come to an end    Under a provision authored by Senator      Murray that we have included  which was accepted during the last      Congress by the Judiciary Committee  this bill will ban the      maintenance and distribution of asbestos    We must halt the harm asbestos creates      and ameliorate the harm it has already caused  The industrial and      insurer participants in the trust fund will gain the benefits of      financial certainty and relief from the stresses of litigation in      the tort system  and the victims will have a quicker and more      efficient path to recovery   I thank Chairman Specter  Senator      Feinstein  Senator Baucus and my colleagues on the Judiciary      Committee for working so hard with me on this bipartisan      legislation    I urge Senators to support this      compromise legislation to  at long last  help solve the asbestos      problem by providing fair compensation to victims of asbestos      exposure
