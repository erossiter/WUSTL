       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Senate Votes On Comprehensive   Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Comment Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On Senate Votes On Comprehensive Immigration Reform      April 7  2006 We had an      historic opportunity to pass a bipartisan bill that offered      Americans tough but fair immigration reform  and I am disappointed      that the Republican controlled Senate missed two chances to make      that progress this week  I  along with a majority of Senators  have      supported two bipartisan compromises that would have helped fix our      broken immigration system through better securing our borders while      making reforms that acknowledge human dignity and hard work       Unfortunately  someRepublicans wereunable or unwilling to support      those bipartisan compromises that  ironically  President Bush and      Majority Leader Frist endorsed just yesterday   I and other      Democratic senators will continue to fight for strong comprehensive      bipartisan reform and resist efforts by some to derail progress with      narrow  punitive measures
