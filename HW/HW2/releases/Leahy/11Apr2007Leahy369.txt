       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Stem Cell Research Enhancement   Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  April 11  2007 MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  I wish to express my support for   the bill before the Senate this week  S 5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement   Act of 2007  This legislation will put us on the path of progress by reversing   the Presidents policy  a policy that is holding back the promise of stem cell   research   It is unfortunate that the Congress must even spend time   debating this measure  The majority of Americans support stem cell research  as   does the director of the National Institutes of Health  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  It   has been six years since the President announced his Administrations   restrictive policy on stem cell research  which limited the number of stem cell   lines available for use with federal funding  Now we know that all of these   lines are contaminated by the use of mouse feeder cells  and they will probably   never meet the standards required for human treatment   It is clear that  because of the Presidents policy  we are   now years behind in developing therapies and cures for diseases such as   diabetes  Alzheimers and cancer  That is time that millions of Americans   simply do not have to waste  For millions of others  this wasted time has   dampened hope   Some families who hold out hope for the potential of stem   cell research are from Vermont  Many are either afflicted by  or know someone   one who is suffering from  multiple sclerosis  Parkinsons or Lou Gehrigs   Disease  I have met these Vermonters  many of whom are advocating not for   themselves  but for future generations who they hope will not endure the   debilitating nature of these diseases  There are others in Vermont who know firsthand the good   this research could bring  These are the scientific researchers at the   University of Vermont and Dartmouth College who are doing groundbreaking work   that needs the support of our federal government to be truly successful  These   scientists know that the most viable method for progress in research is to   expand the number of embryonic stem cell lines that are available   I would like to take a moment to also address some of the   myths perpetrated about what S 5 will and will not do  Let us be clear  This   bill will not allow federal funds to be used for the destruction of human   embryos  While federal dollars can be used for research on stem cell lines that   are derived from human embryos  the creation of these lines cannot be funded   with federal monies  S 5 will do nothing to change this policy   This legislation will also ensure that federal funding will   be used only for researching stem cells lines that are derived from human   embryos that have been donated from in vitro fertilization clinics  The in   vitro fertilization process creates more embryos than are needed  and the   remaining embryos will simply never be used  There are more than 400 000 of   these embryos that are frozen in fertility clinics  the majority of which will   ultimately be destroyed   This week the Senate will vote on two stem cell bills    While I support both  only one of these bills will take us solidly forward  The   time for passage of this legislation is now  and I urge the President not to   veto this critical bill   I hope that the President will heed the advice of his own   chief medical researcher in the United States  NIH Director Dr  Zerhouni who    when he testified before the Labor  Health and Human Services Appropriations   Subcommittee  said that American science would be better served  and the Nation   would be better served  if we let our scientists have access to more cell   lines   As Congress is poised to send this legislation to the White   House  I hope the President will take note of Dr  Zerhounis remarks  I hope   that he will also listen to Congress and the millions of Americans who believe   that we should support all angles in stem cell research  and sign this bill
