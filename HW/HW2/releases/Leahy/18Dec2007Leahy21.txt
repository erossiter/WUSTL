Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act  OPEN       Government Act   which unanimously passed the Senate on Friday       The bipartisan legislation was       introduced by Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    John Cornyn  R Texas        and Jon Kyl  R Ariz    and addresses overdue and much needed       reforms to FOIA  Leahy and Cornyn introduced similar       legislation in the Senate earlier this year  The Senate       unanimously passed that bill in August  and the House had passed       a similar version of the legislation earlier this year  Earlier       this month  Leahy  Cornyn and Kyl introduced revised legislation       in the Senate to address pay go concerns that had delayed       final passage of the legislation in the House  House Oversight       and Government Reform Chairman Henry Waxman  D Calif   worked to       shepherd the legislation quickly through the House       The American people can have a       new law honoring the publics right to know under the tree this       holiday season  I look forward to the President signing this       FOIA reform legislation promptly  to make that possible  said       Leahy  In an era of increased government secrecy  we cannot       postpone reforming the very Act that keeps our government open       to the people whose government this is  FOIA helps make       government accountable and responsive to the people  I thank       Senator Cornyn for his longtime partnership on this issue  and I       commend Chairman Waxman for his quick work to usher this       important bill through the House       Passage of these long overdue       open government reforms is a victory for the American people        This sweeping legislation to let more sunshine in government       will be one of the signature achievements of this Congress        Cornyn said  Our bipartisan bill holds politicians and       bureaucrats accountable in an age of ever expanding size and       scope of government  These reforms  embraced across the       political spectrum  strengthen our democracy by building on the       ideals America was founded uponthe peoples fundamental right       to know       The enactment of FOIA reform       legislation this year is an important milestone in the effort to       restore openness and transparency to our government  By sending       this meaningful FOIA reform bill to the President this year  the       Congress also sends a powerful message to the American people       that the era of excessive government secrecy has come to an end       The OPEN Government Act would       Restore meaningful deadlines        for agency action under FOIA    Impose real consequences on        federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day statutory        deadline    Clarify that FOIA applies to        government records held by outside private contractors          Establish a FOIA hotline        service for all federal agencies  and   Create a FOIA Ombudsman to        provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a        meaningful alternative to costly litigation                       Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee   On Final House Passage Of       The OPEN Government Act   December 18  2007     Mr  President  I am pleased that       the Congress will send the Openness       Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act   the OPEN Government Act   S  2488  to the President for       signature before the end of this year  With House passage of       this bill today  and the Senates passage of it last Friday        this historic  bipartisan  bicameral legislation becomes the       first major reform to the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  in       more than a decade  The American people will have a new law       honoring the publics right to know under the tree this holiday       season        I commend House Government Reform       and Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman for moving quickly       to enact this bill  and for his leadership of the successful       effort to pass FOIA reform legislation in the House of       Representatives  I thank him and his staff  including Anna       Latin  Michelle Ash and Phil Schiliro  for all of their hard       work on this legislation  I also commend Representative William       Lacy Clay  Jr  for sponsoring this legislation in the House       I also commend the bills chief       Republican cosponsor in the Senate  Senator John Cornyn  for his       commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation       this year        I am also appreciative of the       efforts of Senator Jon Kyl for cosponsoring this bill and       helping us to reach a compromise on this legislation this year        I also thank the more than 115 business  news media and public       interest organizations that have endorsed this legislation             Historic FOIA Reforms      As the first major reform to FOIA       in more than a decade  the OPEN Government Act will help to       reverse the troubling trends of excessive delays and lax FOIA       compliance in our government and help to restore the publics       trust in their government        This legislation will also improve       transparency in the Federal Governments FOIA process by       Restoring meaningful deadlines        for agency action under FOIA    Imposing real consequences on        federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day statutory        deadline    Clarifying that FOIA applies        to government records held by outside private contractors          Establishing a FOIA hotline        service for all federal agencies  and   Creating a FOIA Ombudsman to        provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a        meaningful alternative to costly litigation          The OPEN Government Act will       protect the publics right to know  by ensuring that anyone who       gathers information to inform the public  including freelance       journalists and bloggers  may seek a fee waiver when they       request information under FOIA        The bill ensures that federal       agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and other       Web based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA       fees  In addition  the bill also clarifies that the definition       of news media  for purposes of FOIA fee waivers  includes free       newspapers and individuals performing a media function who do       not necessarily have a prior history of publication             The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action        by ensuring that the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA starts       when a request is received by the appropriate component of the       agency and requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests       to the appropriate agency component within 10 days of the       receipt of such requests              The bill also clarifies that the Supreme Courts decision in  Buckhannon Board and Care Home        Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of Health and Human Resources        532 U S  598  2001   which eliminated the catalyst theory for       attorneys fees recovery under certain federal civil rights       laws  does not apply to FOIA cases             Furthermore  to address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA       litigation  the bill also creates an Office of Government       Information Services in the National Archives and creates an       ombudsman to mediate agency level FOIA disputes         In       addition  the bill ensures that each federal agency appoints a       Chief FOIA Officer to monitor the agencys compliance with FOIA       requests  and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to       resolve FOIA related disputes  And  the bill creates a better       tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of the       public and clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that       are held by outside private contractors  no matter where these       records are located       Finally  this bill contains a       number of key improvements championed by Chairman Waxman  The       bill includes pay go language that will ensure that attorneys       fees that are awarded in FOIA litigation are paid for with       annually appropriated agency funds        The bill also eliminates a       provision on citations to FOIA  b  3  exemptions contained in       the earlier Senate bill  In addition  the bill includes a new       provision that requires federal agencies to disclose the FOIA       exemptions that they rely upon when redacting information from       documents released under FOIA        And the bill adds FOIA duplication       fees for non commercial requestors  including the media  to the       fee waiver penalty that will be imposed when an agency fails to       meet the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA                    Ending an Era of Excessive Government Secrecy      The enactment of FOIA reform       legislation this year is an important milestone in the effort to       restore openness and transparency to our government  By sending       this meaningful FOIA reform bill to the President this year  the       Congress also sends a powerful message to the American people       that the era of excessive government secrecy has come to an end       While I am pleased that the       reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act will ensure that       FOIA is reinvigorated for future generations  my work to       strengthen FOIA will not end with the enactment of this       legislation        There is much more work to be done       to ensure that we have a Government that is open and accountable       to all Americans  And I will continue to work with Senator       Cornyn  Chairman Waxman and others to further strengthen this       vital open government law       I urge the President to promptly       sign this open government legislation into law at the earliest       opportunity       I request that a copy of my       statement be printed in the Record                            For Background Purposes            Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act       of 2007          OPEN Government Act of 2007   Cornyn Leahy Kyl          Section by Section Analysis      Sec  1  Short       Title  The Open Government Act of 2007       Sec  2        Findings  The findings reiterate the intent       of Congress upon enacting the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA         5 U S C  552 as amended  and restate FOIAs presumption in favor       of disclosure       Sec  3        Protection of Fee Status for News Media  This       section amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  A  ii  to make clear that       independent journalists are not barred from obtaining fee       waivers solely because they lack an institutional affiliation       with a recognized news media entity  In determining whether to       grant a fee waiver  an agency shall consider the prior       publication history of the requestor  If the requestor has no       prior publication history and no current affiliation with a news       organization  the agency shall review the requestors plans for       disseminating the requested material and whether those plans       include distributing the material to a reasonably broad       audience        Sec  4        Recovery of Attorney Fees and Litigation Costs   This section  the so called  Buckhannon fix        amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  E  to clarify that a complainant has       substantially prevailed in a FOIA lawsuit  and is eligible to       recover attorney fees  if the complainant has obtained relief       through a judicial or administrative order or if the pursuit of       a claim was the catalyst for the voluntary or unilateral change       in position by the opposing party  The section responds to the       Supreme Courts ruling in       Buckhannon Board and Care Home  Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of       Health and Human Resources  532 U S  598  2001         which eliminated the catalyst theory of attorney fee recovery       under certain Federal civil rights laws  FOIA requestors have       raised concerns that the holding in  Buckhannon could be       extended to FOIA cases  This section preserves the catalyst       theory in FOIA litigation   Adds House       pay go language to require that any attorneys fees be paid from       any annually appropriated agency funds       Sec  5        Disciplinary Actions for Arbitrary and Capricious Rejections of       Requests  FOIA currently requires that when a       court finds that agency personnel have acted arbitrarily or       capriciously with respect to withholding documents  the Office       of Special Counsel shall determine whether disciplinary action       against the involved personnel is warranted   See 5 U S C        552 a  4  F   This section of the bill amends FOIA to require       the Attorney General to notify the Office of Special Counsel of       any such court finding and to report the same to Congress  It       further requires the Office of Special Counsel to report       annually to Congress on any actions taken by the Special Counsel       to investigate cases of this type        Sec  6  Time       Limits for Agencies to Act on Requests  The       section clarifies that the 20 day time limit on responding to a       FOIA request commences on the date on which the request is first       received by the appropriate agency component       Further  the section states       that if the agency fails to respond within the 20 day limit  the       agency may not assess the FOIA search fees  and duplication fees       in the case of non commercial requestors  collected in       connection with that FOIA request   Also adds duplication fees for       non commercial requestors to the penalty for untimeliness       Sec  7        Individualized Tracking Numbers for Requests and Status       Information  Requires agencies to establish       tracking systems by assigning a tracking number to each FOIA       request  notifying a requestor of the tracking number within ten       days of receiving a request  and establishing a telephone or       Internet tracking system to allow requestors to easily obtain       information on the status of their individual requests        including an estimated date on which the agency will complete       action on the request       Sec  8        Reporting Requirements  This section adds to       current reporting requirements by mandating disclosure of data       on the 10 oldest active requests pending at each agency        including the amount of time elapsed since each request was       originally filed  and requires additional breakdowns depending       on the length of delay  This section further requires agencies       to calculate and report on the average response times and range       of response times of FOIA requests   Current requirements       mandate reporting on the median response time   Finally  this       section requires reports on the number of fee status requests       that are granted and denied and the average number of days for       adjudicating fee status determinations by individual agencies       The       bill does not include the Specific Citations in Exemptions       provision that was set forth in Section 8 of S  849       Sec  9        Openness of Agency Records Maintained by a Private Entity       This section clarifies that agency records       kept by private contractors licensed by the government to       undertake recordkeeping functions remain subject to FOIA just as       if those records were maintained by the relevant government       agency       Sec  10        Office of Government Services  This section       establishes an Office of Government Information Services within       the National Archives and Records Administration  Within that       office will be appointed a FOIA ombudsman to review agency       policies and procedures  audit agency performance  recommend       policy changes  and mediate disputes between FOIA requestors and       agencies  The establishment of an ombudsman will not impact the       ability of requestors to litigate FOIA claims  but rather will       serve to alleviate the need for litigation whenever possible             Sec  11        Report on Personnel Policies Related to FOIA   This section requires the Office of Personnel Management to       examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency level        including an assessment of whether FOIA performance should be       considered as a factor in personnel performance reviews  whether       a job classification series specific to FOIA and the Privacy Act       should be considered  and whether FOIA awareness training should       be provided to federal employees       Sec 12       Requirement to Describe       Exemptions Authorizing Deletions of Material Provided Under FOIA       This       section requires that agencies describe the FOIA exemptions that       they are relying upon to redact material from information that       is provided under FOIA
