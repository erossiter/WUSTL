       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To New SG Documents Released Wednesday                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      To New Solicitor General Documents Released Wednesday     Concerning Supreme Court Nominee Samuel Alito     November 30  2005  This new      information heightens concern about Judge Alitos views regarding      settled law and his eagerness to engage in activism to change law      with which he disagrees  This document from his time in the      Solicitor Generals office builds on what we have already learned      from his 1985 application for promotion from career to political      status in the Meese Justice Department and the personal convictions      he expressed in that about the direction of the law  This      information reinforces the need for the Senate to obtain all      relevant information about this nominee  including his other      Solicitor General memos and his work in the Office of Legal Counsel       We now see why this Administration has resisted so strenuously to      the release of these sorts of memos  They show that nominees often      have expressed legal views on issues that it is important for      Senators to know about before voting on these lifetime      appointments
