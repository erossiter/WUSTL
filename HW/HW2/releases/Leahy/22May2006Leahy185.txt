       Statement Of Sen  patrick Leahy  Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     Comprehensive Immigration Reform     Senate Floor     May 22  2006      When the Senate resumed its consideration of comprehensive      immigration reform last week I began by expressing my hope that we      would finish the job the Judiciary Committee started in March and      the Senate began in April  We need to fix the broken immigration      system with tough reforms that secure our borders and with reforms      that will bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the      shadows  I have said all along that Democratic Senators cannot pass      a fair and comprehensive bill alone  Last week we got some help            We got some words of encouragement from President Bush last Monday      night when he began speaking out more forcefully and in more      specific terms about all of the components needed for comprehensive      legislation  For the first time  he expressly endorsed a pathway to      earned citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers now      here  I thank him for joining in this effort  We will need his      influence with the recalcitrant members of his party here in the      Senate  and especially in the House  if we are ultimately to be      successful in our legislative effort  Without effective      intervention of the President  this effort is unlikely to be      successful and the prospects for securing our borders and dealing      with the hopes of millions who now live in the shadows of our      society will be destroyed  Those who have peacefully demonstrated      their dedication to justice and comprehensive immigration reform      should not be relegated back into the shadows        Last week the Senate made progress  We made progress because      Democratic and Republican Senators working together rejected the      most strident attacks on the comprehensive bill that we are      considering  We joined together in a bipartisan coalition in the      Judiciary Committee when we reported the Judiciary Committee bill       Democratic Senators were ready to join together in April and      supported the Republican Leader s motion that would have resulted in      incorporating features from the Hagel Martinez bill  but Republicans      balked at that time and continued to filibuster action  Last week       Republicans joined with us to defend the core provisions of that      bill  and we defeated efforts by Senators Kyl and Cornyn to gut the      guest worker provisions and to undermine the pathway to earned      citizenship  Instead  we adopted the Bingaman amendment to cap the      annual guest worker program at 200 000 and the Obama amendment      regarding prevailing wages in order to better protect the      opportunities and wages of American workers   I      spoke last week about the need to strengthen our border security      after more than 5 years of neglect and failure by the Bush Cheney      Administration  A recent report concluded that the number of people      apprehended at our borders for illegal entry fell 31 percent on      President Bushs watch  from a yearly average of 1 52 million      between 1996 and 2000  to 1 05 million between 2001 and 2004  The      number of illegal immigrants apprehended while in the interior of      the country declined 36 percent  from a yearly average of roughly      40 000 between 1996 and 2000  to 25 901 between 2001 and 2004       Audits and fines against employers of illegal immigrants have also      fallen significantly since President Bush took office  Given the      vast increases in the number of Border Patrol Agents  the decline in      enforcement can only be explained by a failure of leadership            The recent aggressive and well publicized enforcement efforts to      detain illegal immigrants seem to be election year posturing that      does little to improve the situation  We need comprehensive reform       backed up by leadership committed to using the tools Congress      provides  not to piecemeal political stunts        Once again the Administration is turning to the fine men and women      of National Guard  After our intervention turned sour in Iraq  the      Pentagon turned to the Guard  After the government wide failure in      responding to Hurricane Katrina  we turned to the Guard  Now  the      Administration s longstanding lack of focus on our porous Southern      border and failure to develop a comprehensive immigration policy has      prompted the Administration to turn once again to the Guard  I      remain puzzled that this Administration  which seems so ready to      take advantage of the Guard  fights so vigorously against providing      this essential force with adequate equipment  a seat at the table in      policy debates  or even adequate health insurance for the men and      women of the Guard  I      have cautioned that any Guard units should operate under the      authority of State governors  In addition  the Federal Government      should pick up the full costs of such a deployment  Those costs      should not be foisted onto the States and their already overtaxed      Guard units        Controlling our borders is a national responsibility  and it is      regrettable that so much of this duty has been punted to the States      and now to the Guard  The Guard is pitching in above and beyond       balancing its already demanding responsibilities to the States       while sending troops who have been deployed to Iraq  The Guard      served admirably in response to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal      Government failed to prepare or respond in a timely or sufficient      manner  The Vermont Guard and others have been contributing to our      national security since the immediate aftermath of 9 11  After 5      years of failing to utilize the authority and funding Congress has      provided to strengthen the Border Patrol and our border security       the Administration is  once again  turning to the National Guard            It was instructive that last week President Bush and congressional      Republicans staged a bill signing for legislation that continues      billions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy  Instead of a      budget with robust and complete funding for our Border Patrol and      border security  the President has focused on providing tax cuts for      the wealthiest among us  Congress has had to step in time and again      to create new Border Agent positions and direct that they be      filled  Instead of urging his party to take early and decisive      action to pass comprehensive immigration reform  as he signaled he      would in February 2001  the President began his second term      campaigning to undercut the protections of our Social Security      system  and the American people signaled their opposition to those      undermining steps  While the President talks about the importance      of our first responders  he has proposed 67 percent cuts in the      grant program that supplies bulletproof vests to police officers            Five years of the Bush Cheney Administrations inaction and      misplaced priorities have done nothing to improve our immigration      situation  The Senate just passed an emergency supplemental      appropriations bill that allocated nearly  2 billion from military      accounts to border security  The Democratic Leader had proposed      that the funds not be taken from the troops  But last week the      President sent a request for diverting a like amount of funding       intended for capital improvements for border security  into      operations and deployment of the National Guard  The Republican      Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland      Security came to the Senate floor last week to give an extraordinary      speech in this regard        In addition  last week the Senate adopted a billion dollar amendment      to build fencing along the Southern border without saying how it      would be funded  We also adopted amendments by Senators Bingaman       Kerry and Nelson of Florida to strengthen our enforcement efforts            Border security alone is not enough to solve our immigration      problems  We must pass a bill  and enact a law    that will not      only strengthen the security along our borders  but that will also      encourage millions of people to come out of the shadows  When this      is accomplished we will be more secure because we will know who is      living and working in the United States  We must encourage the      undocumented to come forward  undergo background checks  and pay      taxes to earn a place on the path to citizenship        Last week we defeated an Ensign amendment to deny persons in legal      status the Social Security benefits to which they are fairly      entitled  I believe that most Americans will agree with that      decision as fair and just  It maintains the trust of the Social      Security Trust fund for those workers who contribute to the fund       The      opponents of our bipartisan bill have made a number of assaults on      our comprehensive approach  Senators Kyl  Sessions and Cornyn      opposed the Judiciary Committee bill  Senators Vitter  Ensign and      Inhofe have been very active in the amendment process  as well  I      hope that they recognize how fairly they have been treated and the      time they have been given to argue their case against the bill and      offer amendments  We have adopted their amendments where possible       A narrowed version of the Kyl Cornyn amendment disqualifying some      from seeking legalization was adopted  The Sessions amendment on      fencing was adopted  The Vitter amendment on documents was      adopted  The Ensign amendment on the National Guard is being      considered  Over my strong objection and that of the Democratic      leader  Senator Salazar and others  a modified version of the Inhofe      amendment designating English as our national language was even      adopted  This amendment is wrong and has understandably provoked a      reaction from the Latino community as exemplified by the May 19      letter from the League of United Latin American Citizens  the      Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  the National      Association of Latino Elected Officials Educational Fund  the      National Council of La Raza  the National Puerto Rican Coalition       and from a larger coalition of interested parties as reflected in a      May 19 letter from 96 national and local organizations  I ask that      copies of these two letters be included in the record following my      statement   I      trust that with so many of their amendments having been fairly      considered and some having been adopted  those in the opposition to      this measure will reevaluate their previous filibuster  that they      will vote for cloture  and  I will hope  support the compromise      bill        Immigration reform must be comprehensive if it is to lead to real      security and real reform  Enforcement only measures may sound tough      but they are insufficient  The President has acknowledged this      truth  Our bipartisan support of the Senate bill is based on our      shared recognition of this fact  In these next few days  the Senate      has an opportunity  and a responsibility  to pass a bill that      addresses our broken system  with comprehensive immigration reform
