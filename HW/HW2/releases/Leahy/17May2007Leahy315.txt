       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On H R  1700  The COPS Improvements Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On H R  1700  The COPS Improvements Act Of 2007   May 17  2007 This Congress has been making important efforts to show    our support and commitment to our nations law enforcement officers  This    week marks the 44th year that we have celebrated National Police    Week  On May 1  the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by my colleague    Senator Specter  the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee  and myself     marking May 15  2007 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day  Earlier this    week  I was honored to participate in that ceremony here at the Capitol    hosted by The    Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary  As we do    each year  we gathered with the families of those who lost loved ones in    2006 while serving in the line of duty  We commemorated their sacrifice to    keep us safe and secure  On Tuesday  the House passed H R  1700  the COPS    Improvements Act of 2007  by an overwhelming vote of 381  34  The Senate    Judiciary Committee has voted to report the Senates companion bill which I    joined with Senator Biden to introduce  Despite tremendous support for this    legislation  a Republican objection to passing the House bill has prevented    this important legislation from passing the Senate  I am disappointed that    Senate action on these vital improvements to the COPS program has stalled     and I hope the objection is withdrawn so that the Senate can pass H R     1700   This legislation would reauthorize and expand the    ability of the Attorney General to award grants aimed at increasing the    number of cops on the streets and in our schools  To accomplish this goal     this bill would authorize  600 million in designated funds to hire more    officers to improve and expand community policing  which will in turn help    reduce crime  In Vermont  for example  passage of the COPS Improvement Act    would likely mean that 110 new officers would be put on the beat     Additionally  the COPS Improvement Act would authorize  200 million annually    for district attorneys to hire community prosecutors and  350 million    annually for technology grants   The COPS program has been a resounding success  and the    improvements to the program that are contained in this bill would help our    State and local law enforcement agencies cope with the substantial    reductions in funding they have endured in recent years  Despite these    reductions in funding  law enforcement officers have an increased role in    homeland security responsibilities  H R  1700 includes Terrorism Cops     officers who are focused on specifically on homeland security  and would    also include the Troops to Cops program to help soldiers returning from the    battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan  In short  this legislation gives our    law enforcement officers the tools they need to reduce crime and protect our    citizens   The Government Accountability Office has reported that    between 1998 and 2000  COPS hiring grants were responsible for 200 000 to    225 000 less criminal acts   one third of which were violent  With violent    crime on the rise  and our State and local law enforcement officers stretch    thin with new responsibilities  it is essential that we pass this    legislation  I urge those on the other side of the aisle to    withdraw their objections and support our State and local law enforcement    agencies by passing H R  1700
