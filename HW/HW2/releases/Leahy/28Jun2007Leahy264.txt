       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Supreme Court Decisions On School   Integration                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement     Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On The     Supreme Court Decisions     On School    Integration        June 28  2007  Today  in two cases involving school     integration  Parents Involved in     Community Schools v    Seattle School District No  1  and Meredith v  Jefferson County     Board of Education  a thin majority of the Supreme Court     ruled that the Constitution prohibited the way these two school     districts considered race in order to achieve diverse classrooms  It is     unfortunate that the Supreme Court could not come to a meaningful     consensus on how local school districts can constitutionally achieve the     laudable goal of racial diversity    In 1954  a unanimous Supreme Court in  Brown v  Board of Education     shattered the myth that public schools could be separate but equal by     declaring segregation incompatible with the notion of equal protection     under law  Now  as Justice Breyer noted in his powerful dissent  the     majoritys invalidation of the local school diversity plans threaten     the promise of Brown   Just four years ago  Justice OConnor     observed in Grutter v  Bollinger      that  e ffective participation by members of all racial and ethnic     groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one     Nation  indivisible  is to be realized  I could not agree with her     more     Todays ruling comes as we prepare to     celebrate a major milestone in the desegregation movement  Fifty years     ago this September  nine African American students bravely crossed a     line of armed soldiers and defied a violent mob to integrate Central     High School  in Little Rock  Arkansas  This courageous act compelled     our nation to live up to Browns promise of equality    It is reassuring to me that school     districts across the country are continuing to value racial diversity in     the classroom  Todays splintered opinion does not completely foreclose     the continued pursuit of that goal  By not joining the most troubling     parts of the courts plurality opinion  Justice Kennedy was able to keep     the possibility alive that districts can achieve this compelling state     interest  He rightly criticized the majority opinions failure to     acknowledge the legitimate governmental interest in ensuring all people     have equal opportunity regardless of their race and concluded that      s chool districts can seek to reach Brown s objective of equal     educational opportunity
