        The Conclusion Of Attorney General Nominee Testimony                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                      VERMONT               WASHINGTON  Thursday  Oct  18  2007   The     Senate Judiciary Committee returned for a second day of questioning of     Attorney General nominee Michael B  Mukasey to be the next Attorney     General of the United States  Mukasey faced questions from Committee     Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and others about executive privilege      torture  and the Administrations warrantless wiretapping program      Leahys remarks at the conclusion of Mukaseys testimony follow     Closing Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     At The Conclusion Of Attorney General Nominee Michael Mukaseys     Testimony    October 18  2007  I hope that these hearings turn out to be a step on     the road to restoring the Department of Justice  I noted yesterday when these hearings began that we     face the most serious threat to the effectiveness and professionalism of     the United States Department of Justice since Watergate and the Saturday     Night Massacre   After Richard Nixon became the only American     President to resign from office  President Ford appointed Edward Levi     and former Judge Harold Tyler to begin the process of restoring the     Department of Justice  Now we have reached another critical juncture      I expedited this hearing because we need an effective and functioning     Department of Justice  It is too important an institution in this     country to remain dysfunctional  I hope that Judge Mukasey  like     another former federal judge with whom he worked  Harold Tyler  will     begin to restore the Departments integrity and reputation and lead it     back to fulfilling its law enforcement mission for all Americans  Judge     Mukasey testified that the Department must stand for the rule of law  I     agree and would add to its mandate that it must stand for justice   Nothing is more fundamental to our constitutional     democracy than our basic notion that no one is above the law  This     Administration has undercut that precept time and time again  Just one     example of this was the Presidents commutation of the sentence given to     Scooter Libby  the former chief of staff to the Vice President  who was     convicted after a fair jury trial of lying to the FBI and to a grand     jury  and of obstructing justice  More and more  we see this     Administration promoting immunity over accountability  secrecy over     responsiveness to congressional oversight  and unilateral power over the     checks and balances that have defined this Nation and protected     Americans rights and liberties for more than two centuries   This Administrations view that the President is     above the law and may override it as he chooses is about as extreme a     view of executive power as ever I have witnessed  I believe that it is     not only dead wrong in constitutional terms  but that it is extremely     dangerous to our democracy  The cost to American liberty  our standing     in the world  and to the security of our soldiers and citizens is     staggering  even more staggering than the trillion dollar cost of the     war in Iraq  The Administration has compounded its lawlessness by     cloaking its policies and miscalculations under a veil of secrecy      leaving Congress  the courts and the American people in the dark about     what they are doing   Yesterday and today we have had an opportunity for     dialogue  I have made clear that I am not satisfied with all of the     nominees answers  I am especially troubled by his retreat today from     his clearer statements yesterday on the rule of law and the President     not being above the law  I remain troubled that he also now seems to be     positing a system where a Presidents overbroad and invalid claims of     executive privilege cannot be tested  These are important areas on     which we will continue to meet  to talk and to work   In order to succeed at repairing the damage that     has been done  Judge Mukasey must act in accordance with the     understanding that the duty of the Attorney General is to uphold the     Constitution and the rule of law  not to try to bend the law to the     current Presidents agenda  Never again can the American Government     seek to define torture down in secret and in fundamental conflict with     American values and law  I agree with the nominees sentiment from his     opening statement that protecting civil liberties and peoples     confidence that those liberties are protected is part of protecting     national security  and I would add that they are a fundamental American     value and strength  These hearings can be the start of a new chapter      where American law and values are no longer undercut in secret  The     bottom line for this nomination is not that Judge Mukasey will be     confirmed but rather how he acts as Attorney General  That will be the     real test   The oversight process  and an Attorney Generals     cooperation with that process  helps forge a constructive working     partnership  To paraphrase Ronald Reagan  a confirmation in part is an     act of trust  and oversight helps us verify  This Committee  Democrats     and Republicans  are ready and willing to work with the nominee  In     fact  we have already started
