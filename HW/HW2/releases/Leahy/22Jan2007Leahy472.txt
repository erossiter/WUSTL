       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Bush Administration s Response To   Canadian Officials Regarding The Case Of Maher Arar                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Bush Administrations Response To Canadian Officials     Regarding The Case Of Maher Arar      January 22  2007     Congress and the American people      deserve to know more about the Bush Administrations handling of      this case  I am particularly puzzled by this Administrations      decision to keep Maher Arar on a U S  border control watch list even      though a Canadian commission found that he is innocent and poses no      security threat  The Attorney General has pledged to me that he      would provide the Judiciary Committee with more information shortly       and I hope these facts  whatever they are  will finally shed light      on our questions   Canadian officials said last week      that new intelligence provided by the United States did not change      their conclusion that Mr  Arar poses no threat to the United States      or to Canada  The letter from Secretary Chertoff and Attorney      General Gonzales supplies no new information to clear up the      confusion as to why Mr  Arar remains on a watch list or why he was      sent to Syria in the first place  I am hopeful that the Attorney      General will follow through on his pledge to promptly supply us with      the information we need to meaningfully evaluate these decisions   I am disappointed that the letter      does not address the larger issues surrounding this case  The      reason the Arar case is such a sore point and such an offense to      American values is that he was sent to Syria  on the Bush      Administrations orders  where he was tortured  This was the      finding of the Canadian commission that has investigated this case       and it seems beyond dispute at this point    Yet the Bush Administration has yet      to renounce the practice of sending detainees to countries that      torture prisoners  and it has yet to offer even the hint of an      apology to Mr  Arar for what he endured with our governments      complicity  This abhorrent practice stains Americas reputation as      a defender and protector of human rights  and I hope this      Administration will renounce it at long last
