       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Tuesday s Meetin With President Bush   And Senate Leaders To Discuss The Supreme Court Vacancy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Tuesdays Meeting With President Bush And Senate Leaders     To Discuss The Supreme Court Vacancy     Monday  July 11  2005 The      process starts with the President  and this decision is too      important to all Americans for it be treated as a divisive political      campaign to eke out a slim majority of 51 votes in the Senate  The      Supreme Court belongs to all Americans  not just to one party or      faction   There are      potential candidates who would unite Americans  and those who would      divide us  Meaningful consultation is more than checking off a      box  It means a real dialogue that can help the President find a      good nominee who could have overwhelming bipartisan support    I hope this meeting is a solid      step toward meaningful consultation between the White House and the      Senate in making this crucial decision  Its been my experience      that many Presidents have consulted  and when they did it led to      good candidates and a much smoother confirmation process  I look      forward to working with the President to help him bring the country      together with this decision
