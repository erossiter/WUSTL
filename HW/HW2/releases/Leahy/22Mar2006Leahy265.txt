       Senator Sees First Hand How Leahy Funded Communications System Makes   State Troopers More Prepared For Incidents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Senator Sees First Hand     How Leahy Funded Communications System     Makes State Troopers More Prepared For Incidents  RUTLAND       Wednesday  March 22   U S  Sen  Patrick Leahy visited the Rutland      State Police Barracks Wednesday to witness a demonstration of a new      state police communication system  Since 2001  Leahy has secured       2 5 million for the Mobile Data and Remote Computing Project  to      help the state police link patrolling troopers  their barracks and      communication centers using laptop computers and state of the art      software  Leahy  the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary      Committee  secured the grants in various budget bills funding the      Department of Justice  Leahys remarks from the event follow        Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Announcement Of Vermont State Police Mobile Data Project     Rutland State Police Barracks     March 22  2006 I want to thank      everyone for gathering here at the Rutland Barracks to unveil an      integrated crime fighting tool that will usher the Vermont State      Police into a new age of protecting public safety through better      information sharing  The Mobile Data and Remote Computing Project      will enhance the ability of our State Police to quickly and      efficiently respond to calls  handle incidents  and access and share      critical information with a touch of a button  I want to      especially thank Lieutenant Donald Patch and the troopers assigned      to the Rutland area for letting us invade their station  My thanks also      go to Public Safety Commissioner Kerry Sleeper  Colonel Tom      Powlovich of the Vermont State Police and Paco Aumand  Director of      the Public Safety Division of Criminal Justice Services  for joining      me here to explain why access to information is essential to any      successful public safety effort  They should all be commended for      their leadership in Vermonts efforts to ensure that our State      Police out in the field have the capacity to share critical      information  State and local      police officers are the first responders to an emergency and have to      determine almost instantaneously whether the cause was an accident       a crime or  worse  an organized terrorist attack  To make these      split second decisions and to make them wisely and appropriately       they must have access to the information necessary to evaluate these      situations accurately and swiftly  When police      were pursuing gunman Carl Drega along the Vermont New Hampshire      border nearly a decade ago  after he shot and killed four people       including two New Hampshire State troopers  their efforts were      hampered by outdated police radios that prevented State and Federal      authorities from effectively coordinating their efforts  The Drega      shootings also were the impetus for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership      Grant Program that I introduced soon after that episode  with the      Republican Senator from Colorado at the time  Ben Nighthorse      Campbell  And Im pleased to be able to report that last week the      Senate approved my budget amendment that would restore the 63      percent cut that the White Houses budget calls for in this vest      partnership grant program  allowing us to fully fund it in next      years budget  This is a program that already has made it possible      for Vermonts police and sheriffs offices to be able to afford to      buy 1400 vests for officers who otherwise may not have had this      life saving protection  Also in the      aftermath of the tragic Drega shootings  I have done what I can to      secure for Vermont Federal funds for new law enforcement      communications equipment and mobile data units  I know from my own      experience in law enforcement back in my days as the Chittenden      County States Attorney that access to accurate and timely      information will help save lives  Good communication is one of the      biggest challenges that first responder agencies continue to face      across the nation  as we saw again in the tragic aftermath of      Hurricane Katrina  This is a task that we simply have to get right       but the good news is that this is a problem that is fixable  with      vision and adequate resources   I am proud to      have worked closely with the Department of Public Safety to secure       2 25 million total in the 2001  2002 and 2006 Justice Department      budgets to set up the Mobile Data and Remote Computing system that      we roll out today  At this time  the State Police are able to equip      aircards in laptops in 30 State Police cruisers and 20 State Police      detective units  By the end of the year  another 60 units will be      ready to go  This is a remarkable achievement  and its one that      will make a difference in your abilities to protect the people of      Vermont  Technology is      helping to improve the efficiency  the effectiveness and the      accessibility of our public safety system  This project will help      Vermont achieve those benefits  We      have taken great pains to ensure that the  Mobile Data and Remote Computing      Project will truly improve intelligence gathering and      intelligencesharing capabilities throughout Vermont  From here on      out  wherever State Troopers and State Police Detectives are      responding to a call  whether here in the City of Rutland  or way      up in the remote reaches of the Northeast Kingdom along the Canadian      border  they will have at hand laptops through which they can      access and share much needed criminal intelligence and investigative      support services  This capability will help catch criminals faster      and make sure a suspects records are readily available and easily      searchable when needed  Events of the      past decade  from local incidents like the Drega shootout to the      terrorist attacks of September 11th in New York City  Washington and      Pennsylvania  have taught us that our best defense against crime      and terrorism is improved communication and coordination among      local  State and Federal authorities  Through these efforts  led by      the Federal government and with the active and dedicated assistance      of many others in other levels of government and in the private      sector  we can enhance our prevention efforts  improve our response      mechanisms  and at the same time ensure that funds allotted for      protection against crime and terrorism are being used most      effectively  Now more than      ever it is imperative for local  State and Federal law enforcement      and criminal justice agencies to have access to and the ability to      shared information  one of the most valuable resources out there in      our efforts to keep Americans safe  Our      announcement today bodes well for the future of information sharing      and gathering for our criminal justice agencies  which will only      enhance the effectiveness of criminal justice and law enforcement      efforts to keep Vermont a safe and wonderful place to live and raise      a family  Thank you for      all you do
