       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Legislation To Repeal Changes To The   Insurrection Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Legislation To Repeal Changes To The Insurrection Act  S  513     February 7  2007 Last year  Congress quietly made it easier for this     President or any President to declare martial law  Thats right  In     legislation added at the Administrations request to last years massive     Defense Authorization Bill  it has now become easier to bypass longtime    posse comitatus restrictions that prevent the federal     governments use of the military  including a federalized National     Guard  to perform domestic law enforcement duties  That change runs     counter to our founding principles  to the optimal use of our superb     National Guard here at home  and to whatever sensible reforms are needed     to improve our Nations emergency response capabilities  Today Senator Bond and I are introducing     legislation to repeal these unwarranted and perilous changes  which were     made to a little known law called the Insurrection Act  Our amendment     replaces every word  comma  and period from the original act and returns     it to its original form  Repealing this ill considered change in the     Insurrection Act would allow Congress to have a more orderly      thoughtful  open and consultative discussion on whether such sensitive     and massive powers should be changed  if at all  It is difficult to see     how any Senator could disagree with the advisability of having a more     transparent and thoughtful approach to this sensitive issue  The Insurrection Act is a Reconstruction era law     that provides the major exemption from posse comitatus  the     legal doctrine that bars the use of the military for law enforcement     directed at the American people here at home  The Insurrection Act is     designed to ensure that federal laws are enforced and to ensure that     American citizens basic constitutional rights are respected and     protected  When the Insurrection Act is invoked  the President can      without the consent of the respective governors    federalize the     National Guard and use it  along with the entire military  to carry out     law enforcement duties  Treading as this does across basic     constitutional issues relating to separation of power and to state and     local sovereignty  this is a sweeping grant of authority to the     President  Because the use of the military for domestic law enforcement     is so sensitive an issue  the Act has been invoked only sparingly since     it was enacted  The primary reason that the law has been invoked so     rarely is that there has been an inherent tension in the way it was     crafted  Before it was changed last year  the law was purposefully     ambiguous about when the President could invoke the Act in cases beyond     a clear insurrection or when a state clearly violated federal law in its     actions  Because there was this useful ambiguity  a constructive     friction in the law    a President until now would have to use the power     with great caution  and with the impetus for appropriate     consultation   Yet by the time committee work was completed in the     House and the Senate on the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization Bill      the law had been changed and that useful ambiguity had vanished  In     addition to the cases of insurrection  the Act can now be invoked to     restore public order after a terrorist attack  a natural disaster  a     disease outbreak  or  and this is extremely broad  other condition      Restoring public order has suddenly become an entirely new purpose for     the Insurrection Act  And  as if to underscore this fundamental change      the conference committee changed the name of the Act from Insurrection     to Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order   This significant change was made without consulting     the Nations Governors  mayors  sheriffs  or the National Guard     Adjutants General  It was made without consulting the other relevant     policy committees in the Senate and the House  It was merely slipped     in  at the Administrations request  as rider to a bill that was     hundreds of pages long  And when the Nations Governors learned of the     change and expressed their strong opposition  they were ignored  and     this facilitation of presidential ability to federalize the National     Guard  even over the objections of the Nations Governors    remained     in the bill that was signed into law by President Bush  Now this President and future Presidents can more     easily take control of the National Guard and use our entire military     apparatus for law enforcement at home  In a situation like another     Katrina or even a more contained incident like a terrorist incident  the     President will be able to bring in federal troops and take away control     from the Governors  the Emergency Managers  the Sheriffs  and the state     Adjutants General who know their communities best and are responsible     for responding  What we should be doing instead is buttressing the     response abilities of these local and state officials  We should ensure     every State has a state of the art emergency operations center  that our     first responders have the best equipment and training  and that the     National Guard has adequate equipment and available people at home to     provide support  Any federal assets  military or otherwise    that     might come into a State should be in a supporting and not commanding     role  The local officials who know their communities are in the best     positions to control the situation  not the President or the military      Some have argued that the changes made were only a     clarification of existing law or that the Insurrection Act already gave     the power to the President to use the military for law enforcement in an     emergency  I strongly disagree with that explanation  and so do the     Governors  Adjutants General  and a host of other officials  They see     it  as Senator Bond and I see it  as a tangible and troubling expansion     of the Presidents powers and a parallel reduction in State     sovereignty  But if some believe the original Act already gave the     President this expansive power  they should not object to bringing the     law back to its original form   Repeal of the recent changes to the Insurrection     Act will help ensure that our National Guard and larger emergency     response capabilities remain strong  Repeal is crucial to ensuring that     our Governors and local officials remain in control and that they are     consulted when anyone considers overriding their authority  Repeal is     simply essential to ensuring the military is not used in a way that     offends and endangers some of our more cherished values and liberties  We enter this effort with the strong support of     Governors and of the National Guard community  including the National     Governors Association  the National Guard Association  the Adjutants     General Association  and the Enlisted Association of the National     Guard  I ask unanimous consent that support letters from the National     Governors Association  the Adjutants General Association  and the     Enlisted Association of the National Guard be included at this point in     the Record   Last years Insurrection Act rider reflects the     general lack of close oversight that has taken a toll on our system of     government  I hope the days of rubberstamping are over  and I hope the     Senate will quickly remedy this situation by considering and passing the     bill that we introduce today
