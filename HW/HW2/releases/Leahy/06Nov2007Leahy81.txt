       Statement of Sen  Leahy On The Implementation Delays For The REAL ID Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  On The Implementation Delays For The REAL ID Act  November 6  2007        When the REAL ID Act was added to an emergency supplemental spending      bill in 2005  with little debate or foresight  I believed that      Congress had made a mistake  I was not alone  and since that time      38 States have either introduced or passed legislation opposing the      law  Seventeen States having enacted laws in opposition  I have      joined Senators Akaka  Sununu  Tester  Baucus  and Alexander in      introducing legislation to repeal the drivers  license provisions of      the law  and to replace them with the negotiated rulemaking process      that had been originally enacted in the 2004 Intelligence Reform and      Terrorist Prevention Act  That bill  which REAL ID superseded  was      intended to improve the security of State driver s licenses through      a cooperative partnership with the States and the private sector                  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on May 8 of this year to      examine whether the REAL ID Act is actually an effective way to      improve our security  I agreed with many at the hearing who argued      that the REAL ID Act was not an effective way to improve identity      security  and the sacrifices Americans would be compelled to make in      their personal privacy were unacceptable  All agreed more could and      should be done to ensure the integrity of identification documents       but many cautioned that the REAL ID Act is not the most effective      way to do it              Opposition to the REAL ID Act has been bipartisan and widespread      among the States and many Federal lawmakers  In addition to the      enormous financial burdens placed on the States  the law raises      serious privacy concerns about the Federal government s interference      in a responsibility traditionally left to the State  Proponents of      the law proclaim it is not a national ID card  But when the Federal      government directing how a State drivers license is issued  what      characteristics the card must have  and conditioning access to      Federal buildings and airplanes on possession of a REAL ID card  it      is difficult to think this is anything but the first  big step      toward a national identification card that so many Americans oppose                  But the reality of the dissatisfaction among the American people is      catching up with the Administration  The Washington Post      recently reported that Secretary Chertoff is expected to announce      yet another delay for REAL IDs implementation deadline  Secretary      Chertoff previously waived the May 2008 compliance deadline and set      a new target of 2013 for nationwide compliance  Now Secretary      Chertoff will reportedly extend this date to 2018 for drivers who      are older than 40 or 50  and officials have said the Government will      not bar those not possessing a REAL ID license from Federal      facilities and airplanes              Nonetheless  despite being faced with determined opposition from the      States and many Members of Congress  the Administration still      refuses to reconsider implementation of the law and is ignoring the      pleas of the States  which are urging a better way  Without buy in      from the States and the American people  this program is doomed to      failure  Delaying the inevitable by pushing back deadlines is not      the way we will improve identity security  Had the negotiated      rulemaking provisions enacted in the 2004 Intelligence Reform and      Terrorist Prevention Act been left intact  it is likely meaningful      identity security improvements would already be under way  It is      unfortunate that instead of addressing the fundamental problems this      law poses for the States  the Administration appears content merely      to prolong a contentious and unproductive battle to force the States      to comply  Rather than improved security  this course will result      in resentment  litigation  and enormous costs that States will be      forced to absorb  The Administration would do much better to treat      the States as partners  and forego the paternalistic mandates that      the American people are rejecting  That spirit of cooperation would      result in much greater security than the Administration s      go it alone strategy to force compliance with another ill conceived      policy              Like the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  the REAL ID Act      represents precisely the big government interference the President s      party claims to dislike  The American people are demanding that the      Federal government take a second look at the wisdom of charging      ahead with a national ID card  and the Administration ought to      listen carefully to what many have been saying since this law was      enacted  before more time is wasted trying to force this unpopular      and cumbersome law on the citizens of the United States  And I      welcome all Senators to join me and the other cosponsors of S  717      in rejecting the burdensome mandates of REAL ID and advocating for a      better system of securing our fundamental identification documents
