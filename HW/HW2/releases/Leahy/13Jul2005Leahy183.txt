       Leahy Warns Against Limiting Court Appeals Of Death Penalty Cases                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy Warns Against       Limiting Court Appeals Of Death Penalty Cases   Evidence Shows More Than 100       Innocent People Released From Death Row        WASHINGTON  Wednesday  July 13     The Senate Judiciary       Committee on Wednesday began consideration of a bill that would       speed up executions by limiting the ability of those sentenced       to death to appeal to federal court  A longtime proponent of       death penalty reform  Senator Patrick Leahy  the Ranking       Democratic Member of the panel  warned that the bill could       drastically increase the risk of wrongful executions and       incarcerations of innocent people    I       will not vote to increase the risk that more innocent people       will be executed  Leahy said  More than 100 people have been       released from death row with evidence of their innocence  said       Leahy  who during the hearing  raised as an example of the need       for a fair appeals process a murder case in St  Louis that was       reopened this week        a decade after a man was executed for the crime          Leahy was the chief author of the Innocence Protection Act of       2004  a package of criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing       wrongful executions  The IPA was included in the more       expansive  Justice For All Act of 2004  a sweeping law that       would combat crime and reduce wrongful convictions through       greater access to DNA technology  Congress passed the landmark       legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support last year and       President Bush signed it into law  Below is Leahys statement       from the committees hearing followed by background information       on the St  Louis case that has been reopened      Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On Habeas       Corpus Proceedings and Issues of Actual Innocence July 13  2005  It has been less than a decade       since Congress overhauled federal habeas corpus law as part of       the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996  or       AEDPA  Enacted as a bipartisan compromise  this law severely       narrowed the scope of habeas jurisdiction by  for example        imposing strict new time limits and procedural bar rules   I thought then  and continue to       think  that AEDPA went too far  By drastically curtailing the       ability of federal courts to adjudicate meritorious       constitutional claims  it increased the risk that people who       were wrongfully convicted would be left to rot in jail  and that       the nightmare scenario    the execution of an innocent American        would come to pass    Of course  others thought AEDPA       did not go far enough  That is the nature of compromise        During the floor debate on AEDPA  the Senator from Arizona       offered an amendment to eliminate federal habeas except in       circumstances where the states justice system had proved       incapable of enforcing federal constitutional rights  That       extreme position was roundly rejected in the Senate  with every       Democratic Senator and more than a dozen Republican Senators          including several Republican members of this Committee    voting       against it   The habeas bill that is now before       the Committee  the so called Streamlined Procedures Act  would       go much farther than AEDPA did  and it would unravel that       bipartisan compromise  I will have more to say about the       specifics of the bill when the Committee marks it up  but for       now it will suffice to say that I can see little practical       difference between this bill and the 1996 amendment that was       defeated  What has changed that might       justify unraveling AEDPA now  I imagine that we will hear today       anecdotal evidence about cases in which habeas proceedings have       dragged on long after conviction  I would urge consideration       first and caution against any rash judgments  We need to ask       some questions before we rush to legislate based on such       stories    First and foremost  what caused       the delays  Was federal habeas being abused  Or was it that       most of the time between conviction and the end of habeas       proceedings was taken up by either state habeas proceedings  or       by delays attributable to the state itself  My understanding is       that it is quite common in some states for a case to spend many       years in state post conviction proceedings  If that is right        there may well be something to be said for taking a close look       at the rules that require state prisoners to exhaust state       post conviction remedies before they can bring a federal habeas       petition  But there is nothing to be said for scape goating the       federal courts for a problem that is internal to certain state       justice systems    Second  if there are in fact       instances of serious delay caused by real abuse of federal       habeas  we need to ask if there is a systemic problem  or just a       few isolated instances  Habeas corpus has protected the       constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans throughout       our history  That is a vital protection that all Americans rely       on  Lets not rush to dismantle it based on a few anecdotes       about delay   We must also bear in mind that a       great deal of time has been spent litigating over the precise       meaning of AEDPAs complex array of time limits and procedural       bars  Those questions  which reflect the poor drafting of the       law itself and not any abuse of habeas  are now largely       resolved  Indeed  it is only in the last couple of years that       the appellate courts have clarified the rules under AEDPA       sufficiently to start generating information about how the law       is actually working in practice   What has really changed since       AEDPAs enactment  Since 1996  we as a Committee have joined       with the rest of the Congress and the Nation as a whole in       taking a closer look at the realities of state criminal justice       systems  And that closer look led us to a further consensus        Last October  President Bush signed into law the Innocence       Protection Act of 2004    a package of criminal justice reforms       aimed at reducing the likelihood that an innocent person would       be executed  Congress passed this landmark legislation with       overwhelming bipartisan support  including the strong support of       Chairman Specter  former Chairman Hatch  and Senator DeWine   It is important to remember why we       joined together on the IPA  and why we must continue to work       together to ensure that its funding promises do not go       unfulfilled  The IPA reflects what we learned about the       administration of the death penalty over years of hearings in       this Committee  We learned that there is an unconscionably high       rate of error in capital cases    error so serious that it not       only denies defendants their constitutional rights  but also       undermines the reliability of the verdict  We learned of       sleeping lawyers  drunk lawyers  suspended lawyers  and lawyers       too overworked  underpaid  inexperienced  or indifferent to meet       with their clients or conduct even the most cursory       investigation  Most troubling  we learned of the more than 100       people who have been released from death row with evidence of       their innocence   The modern miracle of DNA testing       has revealed what  because of its limited scope  can only be the       tip of the iceberg  but that tip is tragically vast  Since the       enactment of AEDPA in 1996  post conviction DNA testing has       cleared more than 150 wrongfully convicted individuals        including a dozen who had been sentenced to death     A few of these individuals are       here today  and I would like to welcome them      Kirk Bloodsworth was a young man        just out of the Marines  when he was arrested  convicted  and       sentenced to death for a heinous crime that he did not commit        DNA evidence ultimately freed him and identified the real       killer  I am proud to have come to know him and his wife        Brenda  through our work together on the Innocence Protection       Act  which includes a program named in his honor      Dennis Fritz spent 12       years serving a life sentence until he was finally able to prove       his innocence through DNA testing  He testified before this       Committee five years ago  in support of the Innocence Protection       Act  and I welcome him back      Darryl Hunt of North       Carolina was convicted in 1984 for a murder he did not commit        He was freed in 2003  after DNA evidence ruled him out as the       killer and identified the true perpetrator of the crime  The       true perpetrator then confessed      Brandon Moon was       convicted of rape in 1987  while a student at the University of       Texas at El Paso  DNA testing cleared him of the crime just a       few months ago  and he was released with the apology of the       District Attorney   Three other exonerees are also in       the audience  Thomas       Goldstein  Gloria Killian  and Joseph Eastridge        Each was granted federal habeas relief after presenting       substantial evidence of actual innocence  If S 1088 were the       law  they would still be wrongfully imprisoned  or worse  So       there will be no misunderstanding of what is at stake here  let       me repeat that  If S 1088 were the law  exonerees such as these       would still be wrongfully imprisoned  or worse   That is what we have learned since       AEDPA  and that lesson has involved saving innocent lives  And       that is what apparently convinced President Reagans first       appointee to the Supreme Court    and one of the strongest       advocates of states rights in the history of the Court    that       left without federal scrutiny  state criminal justice systems       may pose unacceptable risks  In July 2001  Justice Sandra Day       OConnor acknowledged in a widely reported speech that serious       questions are being raised about the administration of the       death penalty  Her conclusion was chilling in its commonsense       candor  the system may well be allowing some innocent       defendants to be executed  Tragically  we now know how       prophetic those words appear to be    Just this week  prosecutors in St        Louis  Missouri  reopened a murder investigation  10 years       after a man was executed for the crime  Larry Griffin was put       to death on June 21  1995  for a drive by killing that he       steadfastly maintained he did not commit  Now  new evidence has       emerged to support his claim  and the victims family is       expressing concern that the wrong man was convicted and       executed   I sympathize deeply with victims       and their families who seek closure  I hope they will take some       comfort from the statistics showing that notwithstanding some       scare mongering rhetoric to the contrary  under AEDPA  habeas       relief has effectively been reserved for a very small minority       of truly problematic cases  But I will not vote to increase the       risk that more innocent people will be executed   The bill before us would greatly       increase that risk  as well as the risk of lesser  but       nonetheless life shattering  injustices  And it would do so       without any real evidence that the new regime we enacted less       than a decade ago to limit federal habeas is not doing the job        AEDPA is not broken  at least  not in the way this bill would       presuppose  and there is no need to fix federal habeas corpus       by destroying it                 Background On       St  Louis Case AP News Article on Murder Case Reopened A Decade       After Man Executed   Executed man s       case reopened  Ten years after       execution  25 years since killing  ST        LOUIS  Missouri  AP     Citing grave concerns that Missouri       executed an innocent man  a coalition that includes a       congressman  high profile lawyers and even the victim s family       pointed to evidence Tuesday that they said could clear Larry       Griffin s name         Prosecutors have decided to reopen the case of Griffin  who was       convicted in 1981 in the murder of Quintin Moss  a 19 year old       drug dealer who was shot to death  Griffin maintained his       innocence to the end  but was put to death in 1995   Now        many people  including some members of Moss  family  believe       him         What I have heard recently is very troubling and leads me to       believe an innocent man was executed for this murder  while the       real killers have not been brought to justice  said Rep        William Lacy Clay  D Missouri  who spoke at a news conference       Tuesday with other supporters of Griffin   The       news conference followed a report compiled by a University of       Michigan Law School professor who discovered new information on       the case in the last year  The report suggests that    The first police officer at        the scene of the 1980 shooting  Michael Ruggeri  now says        that the story told by the supposed eyewitness was false         even though Ruggeri s own testimony at trial supported what        the witness said    A second victim of the        shooting  Wallace Conners  has said he was never contacted        by the defense or the prosecution  Conners  now 52  who was        wounded in the attack  said the supposed eyewitness was not        present at the shooting     I       tell all you all  Larry Griffin did not commit this crime        Conners told reporters  Larry Griffin definitely wasn t in the       car   Original       prosecutor  Testimony about revenge  The       report  by Michigan professor Sam Gross  called into question       the credibility of the only person who testified at the trial       that he saw the murder  Robert Fitzgerald later testified at an       organized crime murder trial and in other prosecutions  and       judging from news coverage  he developed a reputation as a       snitch who couldn t produce convictions  Gross  report said        Fitzgerald died last year         There was no DNA evidence in the case  prosecutor Jennifer Joyce       said   But       Gordon Ankney  the original prosecutor who is now in private       practice  believes Griffin was the killer   I       believe the jury did the right thing  and nothing s happened       that s led me to believe otherwise  Ankney said         Ankney said the new information discounts several facts from the       case  He said an off duty officer saw Griffin get in the car       used in the drive by shooting the day of the murder  He said the       murder weapon was found in the car and that Conners told police       twice he wouldn t be able to identify who shot him   He       also pointed out there was testimony that Griffin killed Moss in       revenge for the slaying of one of Griffin s brothers  Dennis        Moss had been questioned by police in that shooting  but not       charged         Moss  older brother  Walter Moss  is among those supporting a       reinvestigation of the case   I       myself am not here to accuse  blame or show anger  It s been 25       years since my brother was murdered and 10 years since Larry       Griffin was put to death for that murder  Walter Moss said   John       Fougere  a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections        said he was unaware of any previous situation where a Missouri       case was reopened after an execution
