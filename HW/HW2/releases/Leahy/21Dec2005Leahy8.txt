       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Judiciary Related Reconciliation   Provisions                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On Judiciary Related Reconciliation Provisions     December 21  2005 MR  PRESIDENT  It      has been said that a great test of morality is what people do when      they have power  The fast track budget reconciliation rules mean      that the majority party can essentially do whatever it wants in a      reconciliation bill if they act in lockstep  The reason is simple       Reconciliation debates in the Senate can only last 20 hours and the      final version of the bill    a reconciliation conference report         only can be debated for 10 hours   The majority      party can even orchestrate a single meeting with conferees and      immediately gavel it over almost when it starts  doing everything      behind the scenes with no consultation and without sharing drafts of      even sweeping policy changes in proposed major laws  They not only can      do such things  they just did them  But let me start      at the beginning  The Presidents budget proposal for programs      under the oversight of the Judiciary Committee  issued in February      of this year  called for a user fee on the manufacture and      importation of gunpowder and other explosives of two cents per      pound  The President requested that Congress enact these user fees         some called it a tax    to raise  600 million over the next five      years  Because of that White House proposal on gunpowder and other      explosives  the budget resolution of the other body called for the      Judiciary Committee to meet a target of  600 million   The Senate passed      budget resolution did not require any cuts to be made by the      Judiciary Committee  This is the usual approach for the Judiciary      Committee since the Committee controls few  yet very important       mandatory spending programs  For example  it is difficult to make      significant reductions to mandatory programs  including  pensions      for U S  Judges  the Crime Victims Trust Fund  salaries of U S       Marshals  the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund  the      Copyright Owners Fund  the diversion control fee account of the      Drug Enforcement Agency  border patrol salaries and expenses  the      assets forfeiture fund for U S  Marshals  and other sources  It is      also difficult to increase Patent and Trademark Office fees or      Copyright Office fees since there is not a compelling reason to do      so   In the end  in      order to comply with the budget resolution  the Judiciary Committee      of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee of the other body were      required to come up with  300 million in revenue or to make  300      million in cuts   The first      casualty in this process was the White House proposal to tax      gunpowder and other explosives  There was little support by the      majority party for even making half the Presidents proposed      increases in the gunpowder tax  Many other alternatives were      considered by the majority party  Finally  a      proposal was worked out in the Judiciary Committee that had my      support  and the strong support of universities and many business      leaders  For example  the National Association of State      Universities and Land Grant Colleges  Motorola  Oracle  Sun      Microsystems  Texas Instruments  Intel  Microsoft  Hewlett Packard       Qualcomm  and many others agreed with a proposal to charge higher      immigration fees for high tech workers  The House also included      immigration fees in their proposal  However  after an      aborted conference meeting which started at 9 p m  last Friday      night  and ended a few minutes later  what has the Majority party      proposed as a compromise on the immigration fees  They came up with      increasing fees on all citizens to get into federal courts and into      bankruptcy court  The bankruptcy fee increase raises some ironies       The increase in fees for citizens trying to seek judicial relief      narrows access to courts   So we have gone      from the Presidents proposal to tax gunpowder and other explosives      and mysteriously ended up with a tax on citizens to get into federal      court and bankruptcy court  Nevertheless  the majority party  as      long as they are in lockstep together  has nearly absolute power in      a reconciliation bill that enjoys only limited debate  History will      record what they have done with that power   What is      especially unfortunate is that the version of the reconciliation      bill reported out by the Senate Judiciary Committee  and approved by      the full Senate by unanimous consent to the Budget Reconciliation      Act  was a bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Specter and      myself to allocate the extra  278 000 000 in revenue provided from      the Judiciary Committee markup on reconciliation to supplement      funding that is demonstrably needed for the Bulletproof Vest      Partnership Fund  programs authorized by the Justice For All Act       and a Copyright Royalty Judges Program  The Judiciary      Committee markup on its reconciliation title provided  278 000 000      more in revenue than was mandated by the Budget Resolution      instructions   The Specter Leahy      Senate proposal  approved by the full Senate    would have provided       60 000 000 over the next five years for such initiatives as the      Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program  to help law enforcement      agencies purchase or replace body armor for their rank and file      officers   Recently       concerns over body armor safety surfaced when a Pennsylvania police      officer was shot and critically wounded through his new vest      outfitted with a material called Zylon  which is a registered      trademark  The Justice Department has since announced that Zylon      fails to provide the intended level of ballistic resistance    Unfortunately  an      estimated 200 000 vests outfitted with that material have been      purchased  many with Bulletproof Vest Partnership funds  and now      must be replaced  Law enforcement agencies nationwide are      struggling to find the funds necessary to replace defective vests      with ones that will actually stop bullets and save lives  Our      Senate Judiciary provisions would have funded those efforts       Unfortunately  the majority party dropped this language  Our Senate      Judiciary language  approved by the full Senate    also provided      more than  216 000 000 for programs authorized by the Justice For      All Act of 2004  a landmark law that enhances protections for      victims of Federal crimes  increases Federal resources available to      State and local governments to combat crimes with DNA technology       and provides safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions and      executions   The Senate      Judiciary Committee language also would have funded training of      criminal justice and medical personnel in the use of DNA evidence       including evidence for post conviction DNA testing  It would have      promoted the use of DNA technology to identify missing persons       With these funds  State and local authorities would have been better      able to implement and enforce crime victims rights laws  including      Federal victim and witness assistance programs   State and local      governments would have been able to apply for grants to develop and      implement victim notification systems to share information on      criminal proceedings in a timely and efficient manner  That      language would have helped improve the quality of legal      representation provided to both indigent defendants and the public      in State capital cases  Last  but      certainly not least  our amendment provided  6 500 000 over five      years for the Copyright Royalty Judges Program at the Library of      Congress  The Copyright Royalty Distribution Reform Act of 2004      created a new program in the Library to replace most of the current      statutory responsibilities of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty      Panels program  The Copyright Royalty Judges Program was supposed      to determine distributions of royalties that are disputed and set or      adjust royalty rates  terms and conditions  with the exception of      satellite carriers  compulsory licenses  The Senate passed language      would have helped pay the salaries and related expenses of the three      royalty judges and three administrative staff required by law to      support this program   Unfortunately       instead of raising more funds than we needed through widely      supported increases in immigration fees and using them for these      law enforcement and other programs we are instead going to increase      the cost of access to federal courts and not fund any of these other      priorities   What may be the      most troubling aspect of this abuse of power is that by      substantially increasing fees to get into federal courts the      majority party raised  253 million more in revenue than it needed to      meet the reconciliation target  That means that all the above      priorities in the Senate passed bill including bulletproof vests for      law enforcement  use of DNA technology to identify missing persons       and better enforcement of crime victims rights laws could have been      included at only slightly reduced levels of support   The Republican      Congress has missed a great opportunity in this abuse of power
