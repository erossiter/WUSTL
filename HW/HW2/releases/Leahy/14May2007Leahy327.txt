       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Resignation Of Deputy Attorney   General Paul McNulty                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On The Resignation Of Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty    May 14  2007 The American people     deserve a strong and independent Department of Justice with leaders who     enforce the law without fear or favor  Regrettably that is not the     Justice Department we have today  Instead  we see a Department rife     with scandal and another agency this Administration seeks to manipulate     as a political arm of the White House  Our justice system should not be     a political arm for this White House or any White House  whether     occupied by a Republican or a Democrat  This is not the first     resignation from the Department of those involved in the United States     Attorney scandal  We need to restore     the Department of Justice to a place deserving of its name and the way     we do that is get to the truth about the role the White House played in     the replacement of United States Attorneys for political purposes  The     Committee has made requests for cooperation from the White House and I     hope the information and cooperation requested will finally be     forthcoming  If the White House has done nothing improper  then they     have nothing to hide  The Administration should come clean so that we     can begin the process of reconstituting the leadership of the Justice     Department  Then all Americans can renew their faith in its role as our     leading law enforcement agency  The obligations of the Justice     Department are to the Constitution  the rule of law and to the American     people  not to the White House
