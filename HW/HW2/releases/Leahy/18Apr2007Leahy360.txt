       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  FY08 Budget Request For Maternal And   Child Health  And Family Planning Reproductive Health                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee Hearing   FY08 Budget Request For Maternal And Child Health    And Family Planning Reproductive Health   April 18  2007 The focus of todays    hearing is on aspects of our global health programs which address the core    public health needs of the worlds poorest people  As the chart on my left    makes clear  while funding for HIV AIDS has for obvious reasons and with the    bipartisan support of this Subcommittee increased dramatically in recent    years  funding for maternal and child health  and family    planning reproductive health  has languished   This should concern all    of us  when you consider what a difference these programs make  and when you    consider what we take for granted in our own country  Over the past thirty    years  expanded immunization programs  often costing only pennies per child     have saved millions of lives  Family planning reproductive health programs    have also made an enormous difference in child survival and womens health     USAID has been at the forefront of these efforts  But despite great    progress and countless lives saved  11 million children under age five die    each year  mostly from easily preventable and treatable causes like    diarrhea  pneumonia or measles  The Administrations FY 2008 budget request    for these programs is  373 million  compared to  420 million in FY 2007     An estimated 200    million women still lack access to family planning  and up to one third of    the half a million yearly maternal deaths could be prevented with basic    reproductive health services  The Administrations FY 2008 budget request    for these programs is  325 million  compared  436 million in FY 2007  It seems to me that we    are short changing programs that have a long history of proven success  and    which are fundamental to any effective public health system  We are also witnessing    an alarming exodus of health professionals from developing countries to    higher paying jobs in the industrialized countries  The short and long term    consequences of this brain drain  coupled with the deaths of countless    health workers from AIDS  are staggering We have four    outstanding witnesses who should be able to help guide us as we try to make    the best use of the resources we have  It is simply unacceptable to me that    a country of our economic means would spend far less on maternal and child    health  and on family planning reproductive health  for the worlds two    billion poorest people  than we spend for the same purposes in a tiny state    like Vermont with a population of 625 000 people  I believe most Vermonters    would also find it unacceptable  as I suspect would most Americans    Dr  Kent Hill     Assistant USAID Administrator for Global Health  will lead off by describing    the Administrations FY 2008 request for the programs we are discussing    today  Dr  Helene Gayle is    currently the President of CARE  one of the countrys leading organizations    fighting global poverty  Previously  Dr  Gayle headed USAIDs HIV AIDS    programs  and at the GATES Foundation she was the Director of HIV  TB and    Reproductive Health  Laurie Garrett is    Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations  and    the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Coming Plague and Betrayal of    Trust  The Collapse of Global Public Health  Dr  Nils Daulaire  from    my own State of Vermont  is President of the Global Health Council  after    serving as USAIDs Senior Health Advisor  After Senator Gregg    makes his opening remarks  I suggest that we hear from Dr  Hill and then    each of the other witnesses in the order in which you are seated  I would    ask the witnesses to limit your oral remarks to 5 minutes  and we will place    your longer written testimony in the record
