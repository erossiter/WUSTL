       Senators Urge EPA To Approve Northeast Mercury Plan And Enhance National   Mercury Pollution Standards                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Senators Urge EPA To Approve Northeast Mercury Plan       And Enhance National Mercury Pollution Standards       November 6  2007           WASHINGTON  D C U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R Maine   Patrick      Leahy  D Vt    Judd Gregg  R N H    John Sununu  R N H    Bernard      Sanders  I Vt    Susan Collins  R Maine   Joseph Lieberman       I Conn    Jack Reed  D R I    Sheldon Whitehouse  D R I   and      Christopher Dodd  D Conn   sent a letter to Environmental Protection      Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson this week to approve the      Northeast Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load cleanup plan       As part of the plan  the region requires enhanced federal guidelines      for mercury pollution coming into the Northeast from other parts of      the country        In recent years  the Northeastern states of Maine  New Hampshire       Vermont  Massachusetts  Rhode Island  Connecticut  and New York have      drastically reduced mercury pollution from in state power plants       Yet the region fails to meet current EPA guidelines because of the      mercury pollution brought in from neighboring states  Todays letter      follows a similar plea made recently by the governors of the      Northeastern states     The Northeastern states  including      Maine  continue to be at end of the tailpipe of mercury  spewing      coal fired power plants in the Midwest  said Snowe  Maine has led      the way in reducing mercury emissions within the state  but we must      see strong action on the part of the EPA to reduce mercury emissions      that enter our state from sources in other states  The petition      from the region clearly identifies that our State simply can not do      anything more  The lax approach by EPA in regards to our national      problem has failed to protect the health of our children  Maines      natural resources and the economies that depend on them        Despite mercurys toxic effects  special interests have been able      to impose a do nothing policy on the American people  said Leahy       Our region has long led the way in curbing mercury pollution  which      is among the least controlled and most dangerous poisons threatening      pregnant women and children  Because mercury pollution knows no      borders  we need a sensible national approach to protect Vermonters      and all Americans        Like other states in the Northeast  New Hampshires air quality is      uniquely impacted by toxic emissions from coal fired power plants in      the Midwest  especially mercury  Gregg said  In spite of some      gains made at the state level  mercury emissions still pollute New      Hampshires waterways  contaminate fish stocks  and pose a      significant health risk  Federal action is required  and Im      disappointed that the EPA has not more rigorously fulfilled its      obligations under the Clear Air Act to reduce mercury emissions  As      a first step  the EPA should approve the Northeast regional mercury      plan  and it must also promulgate clean air regulations that benefit      the environment  not dirty coal fired power plants        The toxicity of mercury to the health of humans and the environment      has been documented time and again by scientists around the world       While state and federal regulations have made great strides      combating high mercury levels in air and water sources  tougher      federal standards are needed  Northeastern states have a plan to      reduce mercury pollution and Administrator Johnson has the ability      to implement these guidelines  I strongly urge him to put them in      place        The toxicity of mercury to the health of humans and the environment      has been documented time and again by scientists around the world       said Sununu  While state and federal regulations have made great      strides combating high mercury levels in air and water sources       tougher federal standards are needed  Northeastern states have a      plan to reduce mercury pollution and Administrator Johnson has the      ability to implement these guidelines  I strongly urge him to put      them in place        Mercury is a toxin that is extremely harmful to children and      pregnant women  in particular  said Collins  Maines waterways are      threatened by emissions from power plants located in other states       yet the EPAs current rules do little to address this serious      problem  That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues in urging      the EPA to approve the Northeast Regional Mercury TMDL to help      reduce toxic mercury in our environment        Connecticut and its partner states in the Northeast have stepped      forward with a plan to remove from the region s waters mercury      pollution that is harming children and expectant mothers  said      Lieberman  The least the EPA can do is to approve the states       plan        This is a national problem that demands a national response  said      Reed  The EPA needs to lay out and enforce strict federal      guidelines to prevent harmful pollutants like mercury from coming      into the Northeast from other parts of the country        Rhode Island is working hard to keep poisonous mercury out of our      air and water  but our people are still suffering from pollution      from Midwestern power plants  said Whitehouse  a member of the      Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  The Bush      administration needs to stop blocking our states progress on      pollution controls  and Ill keep fighting for higher emissions      reductions standards to protect our health and environment and stop      global climate change        Pollution knows no boundaries  said Dodd  While Connecticut and      other Northeastern states have reduced mercury emissions by 70      percent between 1998 and 2002  our efforts to combat this dangerous      toxin will be undermined if the EPA does not take critical action to      regulate the mercury pollution entering the Northeast from other      parts of the country        A PDF of the letter is
