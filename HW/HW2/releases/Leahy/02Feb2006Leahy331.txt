       As Domestic Spying Hearing Looms  Leahy Renews Request For Key Documents   On Domestic Spying Policy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          As Domestic Spying Hearing Looms      Leahy Renews Request     For Key Documents On Domestic Spying Policy   Urges DOJ Officials To Release      Current And Earlier Opinions     On Government Surveillance Policies and Practices   THURSDAY  Feb       2     Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee  Thursday pushed for the release of key      documents from the Department of Justice relating to current and      previous policies and procedures governing electronic surveillance       It is essential      that we get these documents  Leahy said when asked at a press      conference Thursday afternoon on a bipartisan bill creating a trust      fund to compensate victims of asbestos exposure   No White House      can just pick and choose which laws it wants to follow  This      President has repeatedly asked Congress and the American people to      just trust him on key decisions that have resulted in failed polices      with devastating consequences  Drafting a      legal rationale after the fact in a one sided white paper without      showing Congress its legal thinking and binding legal opinions over      time does little to lend credibility to this Administrations      contentions    Also on      Thursday  Leahy hand delivered the Democratic request to Paul      McNulty  who has been nominated to the number two position at the      Justice Department  During a Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday      morning on McNultys nomination to be Deputy Attorney General  Leahy      again urged the Justice Department to cooperate with the document      request from Democratic members of the committee before the panel      opens its hearing next Monday on the Administrations illegal spying      program   Leahy handed      McNulty a letter from the eight Democratic members of the committee      in which they request documents and correspondence from the days      immediately following the attacks of Sept  11  2001  as well as      departmental memos and legal opinions from the past 30 years      addressing the constitutionality of government practices and      procedures with respect to electronic surveillance  Below is Leahys      statement from Thursdays McNulty hearing as well as the letter sent      last week by the eight Democratic committee members seeking the      documents in advance of the Feb  6 hearing on the NSA spying      program  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is scheduled to testify      before the committee at the hearing                   Statement On Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      On Nomination Of Paul McNulty     To Be Deputy Attorney General     February 2  2006  The Committee today will consider the      nomination of Paul McNulty to the position of Deputy Attorney      General  The Deputy Attorney General is the number two position at      the Department of Justice  and in the absence of the Attorney      General  the Deputy acts as the Attorney General  The previous Deputies  including James Comey      and his predecessor Larry Thompson  have had extensive experience as      prosecutors  When the President nominated Tim Flanigan to this      position  I and other senators raised questions about his lack of      prosecutorial experience  It was of particular concern given that      none of the top officials at the Department had experience      prosecuting criminal cases  I noted that neither the current      Attorney General  nor the Associate Attorney General  nor the      Assistant Attorney General chosen to head the Criminal Division  nor      even the Solicitor General brought that vital experience to the      Department  The President eventually withdrew Mr       Flanigans nomination  Questions still remain about the      circumstances of that nomination  I joined Senator Durbin in a      letter just yesterday to the Attorney General about the role that      Mr  Flanigans dealings with Jack Abramoff and David Safavian played      in that action  I look forward to thoroughly responsive answers to      that letter   With respect to prosecutorial experience  Mr       McNulty comes to us as the Acting Deputy Attorney General and U S       Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia  so he has had some      supervisory experience with criminal matters  Being a U S  Attorney      is not like being a district attorney or local prosecutor  however       and I am not sure how many cases Mr  McNulty has personally      prosecuted  As the Deputy Attorney General  prosecutorial      experience and prosecutorial judgment will be sorely needed and      tested in this Justice Department  He is overseeing delicate      investigative and prosecutorial decisions  Situations will arise      where prosecutorial experience will be beneficial and may be      critical  especially given the lack of other experience in the top      ranks of the Department   This points to the bigger issue  We are faced      with a President who holds an extreme and expansive view of his      power  Within the Executive branch  the Department of Justice serves      as an important check on Presidential power  corruption and      illegality  The Justice Department must make independent decisions      about sensitive criminal prosecutions and must often tell the rest      of the Federal Government  including the White House  what it may      and may not legally do   The most recent Deputy Attorney General  James      Comey  a respected prosecutor and a long time Republican  seemed to      many of us to have taken this responsibility seriously  He      appointed a committed  independent prosecutor to investigate      potentially serious wrongdoing within the Bush Administration       According to recent press reports   Mr  Comey questioned the Presidents authority      to conduct warrantless wiretapping and defended career attorneys who      sought to put the brakes on over expansive assertions of Executive      power  It seemed to many of us and now appears from recent press      accounts  that for his trouble  for refusing to be a yes man  Mr       Comey was apparently drummed out of the Department of Justice  The      Department of Justice should not be made up of yes men  It needs      to enforce the law and make sure that the law  including the laws      that Congress enacts to protect the liberties and rights of ordinary      Americans  are faithfully executed   I voted against confirmation of the current      Attorney General because I did not believe that he would act      independently of the White House and serve the proper role of the      Attorney General of the United States  Attorney General Gonzales      has been a loyal friend and representative of the President and       regrettably in my view  he has continued to act like the Presidents      in house counsel  During the debate of his nomination one year ago       I noted the importance of having an Attorney General who would act      as a check against presidential overreaching  Ultimately  the Attorney Generals duty is to      uphold the Constitution and the rule of lawnot labor to circumvent      it  Both the President and the nation are best served by an      Attorney General who gives sound legal advice and takes responsible      action  without regard to political considerationsnot who develops      legalistic loopholes to serve the ends of a particular President or      Administration  Those words hold just as true for the important      position of Deputy Attorney General  At the time  I did not know      how right I would turn out to be  The recent revelation that the      Bush Administration has been conducting illegal spying on Americans      for more than four years  while Mr  Gonzales served as White House      Counsel and Attorney General  is the most serious of a series of      wrongheaded legal rationalizations for illegal conduct that include      the scandal of Abu Ghraib and the withdrawn torture memo  the      extraordinary rendition and black site prisons in the former Soviet      Union  and the Supreme Court having to reign in this President and      remind him that even war time is not a blank check for the      President when it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens   Mr  McNulty has had a number of important      Republican political jobs  I first met him when he was serving as      staff for Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee  He is      someone I like personally  Whether he will be able to follow Mr       Comeys example of independence and the examples of other      Republicans like Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus  who      resigned or were fired rather than interfere with the investigation      of wrongdoing of the Nixon Administration  is a critical question        The Eastern District of Virginia  under Mr       McNulty  has been the go to district for the Bush Administration      for terrorism prosecutions  national security issues  and detainee      abuse allegations  His work on these issues needs to be explored      and explained  We need to understand how much he will be willing to      question extreme assertions of Presidential power and to look out      for the individual liberties of ordinary Americans and protect the      rule of law  According to a recent letter from the      Department of Justice to Senator Durbin  since the beginning of the      war on Afghanistan in 2001  20 allegations of detainee abuse by      American civilians have been referred to the Department of Justice       and all but one of these cases  have been assigned to a task force      in the U S  Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia       under Mr  McNultys supervision  To date  only one of these      allegations  the one that was not referred to his office  has      resulted in an indictment   These are instances of serious misconduct that      have hurt American credibility in the world  potentially increased      the risk to our troops abroad and undermined our ability to combat      the threat of terrorism  Press reports say that these referrals      include one case in which a detainee was killed in CIA custody      within 45 minutes of the beginning of the interrogation and in that      case the CIAs own Inspector General found the possibility of      criminality  It has been 18 months since former Attorney General      Ashcroft announced the creation of the taskforce in Mr  McNultys      office to investigate these cases  We need to understand why  when      the military has prosecuted detainee abuse cases and the Eastern      District of North Carolina has returned the one civilian indictment      thus far handed down for this type of conduct  Mr  McNultys task      force has not yet acted  Finally  it will be important to find out what      he knew and when about the Presidents warrantless domestic spying      program and what he has done to make sure that the Government is not      violating the law  We need to get to the bottom of this and      understand how Mr  McNulty responded to these important issues   I support aggressive action to protect against      terrorism  I helped write and pass the USA PATRIOT Act  I am      working hard to pass its reauthorization  But it is also important      that the Department do its utmost to protect individual liberties      and to make sure that the Government acts legally  I hope that Mr       McNulty can reassure us on these matters  I welcome Mr  McNulty to the Committee today       and I hope that he will provide the Members of this Committee with      candid responses and the information this Committee needs to conduct      necessary oversight                 January 27  2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales   We are pleased that you have agreed to testify      at the Judiciary Committees hearing on Monday  February 6  2006  in      connection with the legal justifications of the recently revealed      NSA surveillance programs  To enable us to prepare for the hearing       we request that you provide the following information without delay      and in advance of that hearing         1  Please      provide all letters  memoranda  notes  e mails or other documents      that are or reflect communications from the Administration to      Congress during the time period September 11 through September 14       2001  of proposals for  or draft language to be included in what      came to be the Authorization for Use of Military Force         2  Please      provide all letters  memoranda  notes  e mails or other documents      that are or reflect communications from the Administration to      Congress during the time period September 11 through September 14       2001  of the Administrations understanding of the meaning of the      language being considered for inclusion in what came to be the      Authorization for Use of Military Force         3  Please      provide all documents that are or reflect internal Administration      communications during the time period September 11 through September      18  2001  regarding the meaning of the language being considered for      inclusion in what came to be the Authorization for Use of Military      Force        4  The      Authorization for Use of Military Force makes no mention of domestic      surveillance  What specific language does the Administration assert      grants authority to the President to conduct domestic surveillance      without seeking warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court        5  Please      provide copies of all memoranda and legal opinions rendered by the      Department of Justice during the past 30 years that address the      constitutionality of government practices and procedures with      respect to electronic surveillance         6  Please      provide any documents by which the President has  prior to and after      September 11  2001  authorized the NSA surveillance programs       including all underlying legal opinions authored by the White House  We would appreciate your prompt cooperation      with these requests for underlying background information relevant      to the hearing   Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     EDWARD KENNEDY     JOSEPH BIDEN     HERB KOHL     DIANNE FEINSTEIN     RUSSELL
