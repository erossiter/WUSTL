       Body Armor For Officers In Communities Facing Hardship  Leahy And Others   Offer Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Body Armor For       Officers In Communities Facing Hardship    Leahy  Clinton        Mikulski  Shelby And Landrieu   Offer Bill For       Need Based Waivers Of The Local Matching    Requirement In       The Bulletproof Vest Grant Program    WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Dec  19         Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Hillary Clinton  D N Y   are       leading a bipartisan group of senators in a push to make it       easier for local law enforcement agencies facing financial       hardships to buy bulletproof vests for their officers     Leahy  Clinton  Sen  Barbara       Mikulski  D Md    Sen  Richard Shelby  R Ala   and Sen  Mary       Landrieu  D La   have introduced a bill to allow need based       waivers of the local matching requirement for grants under the       existing Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program  The       eight year old grant program has been a great success in making       it possible for local police and sheriffs offices  correctional       facilities and other law enforcement agencies across the country       to equip their officers with life saving body armor  ever since       it was chartered under legislation authored by Leahy and by       then Sen  Ben Nighthorse Campbell  R Colo       Leahy said  We know that body       armor saves lives  and this program has worked well in helping       local police departments to afford them  The dangers that       police officers face every day do not disappear when a community       is hit by special hardship  if anything  those dangers       increase  Senator Landrieu made that case as strongly as it       could be made  in her advocacy for New Orleanss hard hit police       force after Katrina  We should rise to the occasion and partner       with hard hit communities  so those officers can have the       bulletproof vests that protect them while they are protecting       us      Clinton said  Every day  our       nations law enforcement officers place themselves in harms way       in order to protect the American public  It is unconscionable       that many of them are forced to go without the body armor they       need to protect themselves  This legislation will ensure that       our deserving police officers  correctional officers  and other       law enforcement officers will be able to obtain protective gear       they need even in cases of financial hardship     Bulletproof and stab resistant       vests remain one of the foremost defenses for uniformed law       enforcement officers  but law enforcement agencies have       struggled to find the funds necessary to replace either aged       vests  which have a life expectancy of roughly five years  or to       purchase new vests for newly hired officers  Vests cost between        500 and  1000 each  Officers have had to dip into their own       pockets to pay for new vests due to local and state agency       budget shortfalls     Since 1999  the Bulletproof Vest       Program has provided  173 million to purchase about 500 000       vests in more than 11 500 jurisdictions nationwide  The program       funds up to 50 percent of cost of replacing or purchasing new       vests  The program is required to fully fund the 50 percent of       requested vest needs for jurisdictions with populations below       100 000  and the remaining funds are distributed to       jurisdictions of over 100 000      The changes proposed in the new       Leahy Clinton bill  introduced Tuesday night  would give       discretion to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance       within the Justice Department to grant waivers or reductions in       the match requirements for bulletproof vest awards to state and       local law enforcement agencies that can demonstrate fiscal       hardship  The senators point out that local law enforcement       agencies are constantly responding to new challenges  from       fighting a recent rise in violent crime to responding to threats       of terrorism  Waiving the match requirement as needed for       life saving body armor would make vests available for law       enforcement officers in New Orleans  in other Gulf Coast states        or in other rural or urban areas that experience disasters or       other circumstances that create fiscal hardships  Leahy and       Clinton note that DOJ already has such a mechanism in place for       determining if waivers for financial hardship are warranted in       programs such as the Violence Against Women Act  the COPS       program  and grants to Indian tribes                      Statement Of Senator        Patrick Leahy  On Introduction Of A        Bill To Provide Waivers   For Bulletproof Vests        Match Requirements  December 18  2007     Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I        am pleased to introduce a bill that will help will build        upon our efforts to improve the Bulletproof Vest Partnership        Grant Act  which has had so much success in protecting the        lives of law enforcement officers across the country  The        bill introduced today provides a need based waiver of        matching requirements that will aid state and local law        enforcement agencies in financial hardship purchase body        armor for their officers  I thank Senators Clinton         Mikulski  Shelby  and Landrieu for joining me to introduce        this bill to give our law enforcement officers the        protection they need        I was proud to work with        Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell to author the Bulletproof        Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998  which responded to the        tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the Vermont New        Hampshire border when two state troopers who did not have        bulletproof vests were killed  The Federal officers who        responded to the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped        with life saving body armor  but the state and local law        enforcement officers lacked protective vests because of the        cost  Since its inception in 1999  I have worked to        reauthorize this program three times  most recently in the        2005 Violence Against Women and Department of Justice        Reauthorization bill       Since 1999  the BVP program        has provided  173 million to purchase an estimated 500 000        vests in more than 11 500 jurisdictions nationwide  Vermont        has received more than  600 000 in bulletproof vest funding        under this program  which has been used to purchase 2700        vests statewide       I want to thank Senators        Mikulski and Shelby for continuing to recognize this program        as a priority  As Chair and Ranking Member of the        Appropriations Subcommittee that finalizes Justice        Department spending priorities  they saw fit to include more        than  25 million for the Bulletproof Vest Program in the        Fiscal Year 2008 Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations bill        that we will consider this week       Bulletproof vests remain one        of the foremost defenses for our uniformed officers  but law        enforcement agencies nationwide are struggling over how to        find the funds necessary to replace either aged vests  which        have a life expectancy of roughly five years  or purchase        new vests for newly hired cops  We want to ensure that our        law enforcement officers are outfitted with vests that will        actually stop bullets and save lives  Vests cost between         500 and  1 000 each  depending on the style  Officers are        being forced to dip into their own pockets to pay for new        vests due to local and State agency budget shortfalls unless        the Federal government offers more help       The bill we introduce today        will give discretion to the Director of the Bureau of        Justice Assistance within the Justice Department to grant        waivers or reductions in the match requirements for        bulletproof vests awards to State and local law enforcement        agencies that can demonstrate fiscal hardship  Our local        law enforcement agencies are constantly responding to new        challenges  from fighting a recent rise in violent crime to        responding to threats of terrorism  and many localities lack        the resources to effectively combat these challenges         Waiving the match requirement for life saving body armor        should be available for police agencies like those in New        Orleans  on the Gulf Coast or other areas that experience        disasters or any circumstances that create fiscal        hardships        A tragic event in Tennessee in        2005 highlights the need for this legislation  Wayne        Cotton Morgan  a Tennessee correctional officer was gunned        down on August 9  2005  outside the Kingston Court House by        the wife of an inmate being escorted by Officer Morgan  He        was killed  and the prisoner and his wife escaped  Officer        Morgan was not wearing a bulletproof vest  although he        repeatedly requested one from the warden at Brushy Mountain        Prison  The Tennessee Department of Corrections        Administrative Policies and Procedures memorandum requires        that fitted vests be provided to individuals assigned to        transportation duties  Despite this requirement and Officer        Morgans repeated requests  he was not issued a vest due to        lack of funding  This legislation will help ensure that no        officer is left without a bulletproof vest for lack of        resources in his or her department        Our law enforcement officers        deserve the protection that bulletproof vests can provide         Few things mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police        officers and they tell me that the protective vests they        wear were made possible because of the Bulletproof Vests        Partnership Program  This is the least we should do for the        officers on the front lines  who put themselves in danger        for us every day  I want to make sure that every police        officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one       I look forward to working with        the Senate to pass this bipartisan bill to better to protect        our law enforcement officers
