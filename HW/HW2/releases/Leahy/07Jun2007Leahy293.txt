       Judiciary Panel Clears Bill Restoring Habeas Safeguards For Millions Of   U S  Permanent Residents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Judiciary Panel Clears Bill Restoring Habeas Safeguards     For Millions Of U S  Permanent Residents   Bipartisan     Legislation Corrects Mistakes In Military Commissions Act of 2006  WASHINGTON  Thursday  June 7   The Senate     Judiciary Committee Thursday reported a bipartisan bill sponsored by     Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    and Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa       that would restore basic  legal safeguards that guarantee people an     opportunity to go to court to challenge any abuse of power by the     government    The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007      S  185   passed the Committee by an 11 8 vote  with all Democratic     members and Specter supporting it  The bill would restore the     fundamental protections that were stripped for millions of legal     permanent residents of the United States  as well as several hundred     detainees held at Guantanamo Bay  in last years Military Commissions     Act    Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined     in last years legislation  I hope that the new Senate will reconsider     this historic error in judgment and set the matter right  said Leahy      who joined Specter last year in efforts to strip this provision from the     Military Commissions Act  Their efforts failed by a few votes in the     Republican controlled 109th Congress   The panels vote Thursday occurred just     days after two military judges dismissed charges against Guantanamo     detainees because of flaws in the current system set up by the Bush     Administration  which helped engineer the passage of the 2006 law in the     lead up to the mid term elections    Time and again  the Administration has     set up legally suspect systems for addressing detainees  and time and     again  these cramped systems have been found to be flawed  Leahy said      Every time they are called upon to create a workable and fair system      the Administration responds by seeking to remove judicial review and     discretion and narrow the procedures even further  I hope this time the     Administration will work with us to create a better system  The place     to start is by restoring that hallmark of justice  the Great Writ of     habeas corpus  so that there will be a check by an independent court to     guarantee that basic safeguards and the rule of law are followed   The bill was introduced by Senators     Specter and Leahy on the first day of this Congress  The bill now moves     to the full Senate for consideration  Statement Of Sen  Patrick    Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On S  185  The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act Of 2007    Executive Business Meeting   June 7  2007  Today  the Judiciary Committee turns its attention to a    top legislative priority  restoring the Great Writ of habeas corpus  and    the accountability and balance it allows  Earlier this week  two military judges threw out    charges against Guantanamo detainees because the system set up in last    years Military Commissions Act was  once again  deemed inadequate  Time    and again  the Administration has set up legally suspect systems for    addressing detainees  and time and again  these cramped systems have been    found to be flawed  Every time they are called upon to create a workable    and fair system  the Administration responds by seeking to remove judicial    review and discretion and narrow the procedures even further  I hope this    time the Administration will work with us to create a better system  The    place to start is by restoring that hallmark of justice  the Great Writ of    habeas corpus  so that there will be a check by an independent court to    guarantee that basic safeguards and the rule of law are followed  Last months hearing on this important issue    illustrated the broad agreement among people of diverse political beliefs    and backgrounds that the mistake committed in the Military Commissions Act    of 2006 must be corrected  I thank Senator Specter again for his constant    commitment to this issue  Senator Specter and I together introduced the    Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 on the first day of this Congress     This bipartisan bill has 16 co sponsors  and I hope this Committee will pass    it expeditiously  Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last years    legislation  I hope that the new Senate will reconsider this historic error    in judgment and set the matter right  Like the internment of Japanese    Americans during World War II  the elimination of habeas rights was an    action driven by fear and another stain on Americas reputation in the    world  This Great Writ is the legal process that guarantees an    opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the    Government  The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections by    eliminating that right  permanently  for any non citizen labeled an enemy    combatant  In fact  a detainee does not have to be found to be an enemy    combatant  it is enough for the Government to say someone is awaiting    determination of that status   The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the    few hundred detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay  and includes an    estimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States today     These are people who work and pay taxes  people who abide by our laws and    should be entitled to fair treatment  Under this law  any of these people    can be detained  forever  without any ability to challenge their detention    in court  At last months hearing  Stanford Professor Mariano Florentino    Cuellar called this an issue about which the Latino community  which    encompasses so many of the nations legal permanent residents  must be    concerned   Since last fall  I have been talking about a nightmare    scenario surrounding a hard working legal permanent resident in the United    States picked up on at best a tenuous factual basis  who can now be held    with no ability to go to court to plead his or her innocence  for years     for decades  forever   Last November  just after enactment of these    provisions  the Department of Justice confirmed this sad scenario in a legal    brief submitted in federal court in Virginia  They asserted that the    Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any non citizen    designated as an enemy combatant  even someone arrested and held in the    United States  without giving that person any ability to challenge his    detention in court   This is wrong  It is unconstitutional  It is    un American  We all want to make America safe from terrorism  But I    implore those who supported this change to think about whether eliminating    habeas truly makes America safer in the world  and whether it comports with    the values  liberties  and legal traditions we hold most dear  Top conservative thinkers like Kenneth Starr  Professor    Richard Epstein  and David Keene  head of the American Conservative Union     agree that this change betrays centuries of legal tradition and practice     Professor David Gushee  head of Evangelicals for Human Rights  submitted a    declaration calling the elimination of habeas rights and related changes    deeply lamentable and fraught with danger to basic human rights   Perhaps most powerful for me at last months hearing    was the testimony of Rear Admiral Donald Guter  who was working in his    office in the Pentagon as Judge Advocate General of the Navy on September    11  2001  and saw up close the effects of terrorism  His credibility is    unimpeachable when he says that denying habeas rights to detainees endangers    our troops and undermines our military efforts  In his written testimony to this Committee  Admiral    Guter wrote  As we limit the rights of human beings  even those of the    enemy  we become more like the enemy  That makes us weaker and imperils our    valiant troops  serving not just in Iraq and Afghanistan  but around the    globe  The elimination of basic legal rights undermines  not strengthens     our ability to achieve justice  It is from    strength that America should defend our values and our way of life  It is    from the strength of our freedoms  our Constitution  and the rule of law    that we can prevail   Just yesterday in answers    former Deputy Attorney General James Comey provided to our questions  we saw    more disturbing examples of this Administration twisting the law to sustain    its unilateral agenda of expanding Government power at the expense of the    rule of law  In this case  it was the Vice President secretly insisting on    warrantless wiretapping of Americans years after 9 11  What gives America    its special standing in the world has been its dedication to the rule of    law  Let us stop sacrificing our values to expediency  I hope all    members of this Committee will join me in supporting the Habeas Corpus    Restoration Act today
