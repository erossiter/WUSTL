       Leahy And Sanders Again Vote To Withdraw U S  Troops From Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy And Sanders Again Vote   To Withdraw U S  Troops From Iraq WASHINGTON  Wednesday     May 16     U S  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and U S  Senator Bernie    Sanders  I Vt   on Wednesday voted again to bring American troops home from    Iraq   The Senate vote came on    an amendment offered by Senator Russ Feingold  D Wisc    which requires the    President to withdraw U S  forces from Iraq by March 31  2008  Leahy and    Sanders are leading cosponsors of the amendment  which makes limited    exceptions for small numbers of troops needed to train Iraqi troops  to    protect remaining American personnel  and for counter terrorism efforts     The amendment lost in a procedural vote of 29 to 67  The amendment backed by    Leahy and Sanders is stronger still than the redeployment provisions that    recently prompted President Bush to veto a supplemental appropriations bill      After the vote  Leahy    said  The nation was misled into a war that White House incompetence has    made increasingly worse for our troops  for Iraqis and for our country     Instead of making us safer  this war has diverted our attention and    resources from the fight against Al Qaeda and from a lengthening list of    other security and foreign policy challenges  We need to keep pushing  step    by step  until we succeed in getting our troops out of the middle of Iraqs    civil war  Sanders said  Today  I    voted for legislation to start bringing our troops home within four months    and have virtually everyone out of Iraq by the end of next March  The war    in Iraq  which President Bush misled us into  has been a disaster  The    American people know it  The Iraqis know it  The shrinking coalition that    backed the invasion in the first place knows it  Only President Bush and his    blind loyalists are ignoring reality by refusing to change course in Iraq     This amendment would allow for a responsible  phased redeployment that will    remove our service members from the crossfire of an escalating civil war in    Iraq  It would also send a clear message to the Iraqi people themselves    that they must begin to work through the difficult issues that will be    necessary to create a stable and lasting peace  It will also allow us to    better focus our energies on combating the very serious problems of    international terrorism  Our country has lost    some 3 300 soldiers    while 24 000 others have been wounded  Tens of    thousands more will come home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  There    are estimates that as many as 500 000 Iraqis have died  Over 2 million    Iraqis have fled their country and another 2 million have been displaced as    a result of violence and ethnic cleansing  Sanders continued  At a    time when our country has a record breaking national debt  the war in Iraq    has cost us almost  500 billion  and the final cost will almost certainly be    more than  1 trillion  Meanwhile  because of our continued occupation in    Iraq  demagogues like Osama bin Laden are able to rally Islamic fanatics    around the world  and the number of terrorist attacks grows higher and    higher  The time is overdue for a change in Iraq  for us to bring our    troops home  to engage Iraqs neighbors and the international community in a    diplomatic solution  and to support those elements in Iraq who want to    create a stable Iraq with economic assistance
