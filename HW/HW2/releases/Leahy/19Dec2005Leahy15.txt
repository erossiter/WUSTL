         Month   WASHINGTON  Monday           Dec  19   Senator Patrick Leahy  the ranking member          of the Judiciary Committee  on Monday sent the          following letter to Supreme Court nominee Samuel          Alito  In the letter  Leahy  D Vt   provides Judge          Alito notice that he plans to inquire about issues          relating to Alitos views on presidential power           including the recent revelation that the Bush          Administration had been conducting a covert spying          program of Americans  and others  within the United          States  Among other issues  Leahy also wrote that          he plans to ask Judge Alito about the Bush          Administrations policies on torture and          interrogation of detainees  The text of the letter          follows               December 19  2005 The Honorable Samuel A  Alito         United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit         357 U S  Post Office and Courthouse         Federal Square and Walnut Street         Newark  NJ 07101 Dear Judge Alito  I was glad that we had a chance          to meet last month  if only briefly  and look          forward to hearing from you at the upcoming          hearings  I expect to ask you a number of questions          about the role of the courts and judges in our          democratic government  I write to you now  in          advance of the hearing  so that you will have an          opportunity to reflect on these issues and provide          fully responsive answers at the hearings  Last week  we celebrated the          214th anniversary of the adoption of the          Bill of Rights to the Constitution  The Framers          also embedded protections into the structure of our          democracy  The checks and balances among our three          branches of government provide fundamental          safeguards for the rights of all Americans by          ensuring that when one branch overreaches  it can be          constrained by the others  Americans rely on this          governmental structure to maintain the critical          stability and balance necessary to preserve our          freedoms and liberty   At your nomination hearing next          month I plan to ask you about your views on the          Presidents power as Commander in Chief under our          Constitution and the scope of congressional power in          the time of war  There have been times throughout          our history when the separation of powers has been          tested by Presidents claiming unfettered power           Recent revelations that the President authorized          domestic eavesdropping without following the statute          that requires approval of the Foreign Intelligence          Surveillance Court is but one of several areas where          the Courts role as a check on overreaching by the          Executive may soon prove crucial  The Supreme          Courts role in resolving disputes between the two          political branches of federal government involving          the withdrawal of troops  and the methods of          interrogation  are two other examples of issues that          I will want to discuss with you   Just as with any Federal judge           I view a Supreme Court Justices willingness to          serve as a check on executive power as among the          most important issues to consider in a nomination          process  It is ironic that after years of issuing          decisions that were strongly supportive of executive          claims of authority  especially in cases involving          so called enemy combatants  the Fourth Circuit is          now questioning the Bush Administrations switch in          its position on whether Jose Padilla can be tried as          a civilian in federal criminal court  These issues          were also raised in the case of Hamdi v  Rumsfeld           in which Justice OConnor wrote that our          Constitution does not afford the President a blank          check  even in war time  I raised these concerns          with Chief Justice Roberts when I asked him about          congressional power to end a war and the Bybee memo          and its theory of a Commander in Chief override of          legal restraints on torture    Because your career includes an          extensive period in the Meese Justice Department and          because your advancement in 1990 and proposed          elevation this year owe much to selection and          nomination of Presidents  I will ask what assurance          you can give to the American people that you will          not improperly defer to the executive  but will act          as an effective check on abuses of presidential          power   I also will want to explore          your view of the role of the federal courts in          protecting the rights of Americans  I have often          noted that the words engraved in the Vermont marble          on the facade of the Supreme Court are not just          Under Law but Equal Justice under Law  Judges          and justices do not act mechanically but must          exercise their judgment and discretion in the          interests of justice  within the bounds of the law          and the Constitution  as they did in such crucial          cases as Brown v  Board of Education and          Baker v  Carr  Finally  I will ask about your          view of congressional authority  Along with many          others  I have grown increasingly concerned over the          last few years at the Courts overruling of          congressional actions to protect the environment           ensure equal justice and provide health care and          other basic benefits  Your speeches to the          Federalist Society in these regards raise particular          concerns  and I am sure that you will be asked about          your endorsement of such judicial activism   Following as it does the          Presidents withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet          Miers because ofcomplaints by supporters of the          President s  and coming as it does with the          wholehearted endorsement of those samesupporters           your nomination directly raises the concern whether          this is all part of an effort to move the Supreme          Court and the law radically to the right  I want          all Americans to know that the Supreme Court will          protect their rights and will respect the authority          of Congress to act in their interests  I want a          Supreme Court that acts in its finest traditions as          a source of justice  The Supreme Court must be an          institution where the Bill of Rights and human          dignity are honored  If confirmed as an Associate          Justice on the United States Supreme Court  you          would not be just another appointee of a Republican          President  but must serve as a check on abuses of          presidential power   I wish you and your family a          Merry Christmas and a healthy and happy New Year  I          look forward to seeing you again on January 9  Sincerely  PATRICK LEAHY         Ranking Democratic Member
