       Leahy  Counting Of Electoral Votes                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Counting Of Electoral Votes        January 6  2005  While I        was pleased at the large number of Americans who turned out to vote in last        years Presidential election  I am deeply concerned about the many credible        allegations of voting irregularities that surfaced in the weeks following        the election   I        cannot  however  support an objection to the certification of           Ohios electoral votes  Although I believe this debate is worthwhile  I        am not persuaded that the alleged fraud was sufficient to change the        outcome of either the Electoral College or the popular vote  Senator Kerry        conceded the election more than two months ago  and he does not support a        challenge  Moreover  the practical effect of discounting Ohios electoral        votes would simply be to allow the election to be decided by the House of        Representatives    In the         months leading up to Election Day  I joined with Senator Kennedy in         writing with great frequency to Attorney General Ashcroft about our         concerns about voter suppression and possible partisan activity by the         Department of Justice  It is with dismay  then  that I have learned about         the secret counting of votes in Warren County  Ohio  allegedly prompted by         an FBI terrorism warning that the FBI denied making  I have read also of         the nearly 4000 votes President Bush was mistakenly awarded in a           Franklin County precinct with only 800 voters  Although this mistake was         corrected  such a malfunction suggests the possibility that other problems         with the vote count may have been missed             Finally  I would point to the shocking misdistribution of voting machines         in          Ohio  Voters from minority and urban communities frequently waited in         line for four to five hours to cast their votes  while suburban voters         faced far more manageable waiting times  We cannot know the effect this         may have had on vote totals  but we can and should work with State and         local officials to prevent this from happening in future Presidential and         other Federal elections     I         commend Representative Conyers and many of his Democratic colleagues on         the House Judiciary Committee for their tireless pursuit of a goal that         all of us  Republicans and Democrats alike  should desire  a free and         fair election in which every vote counts  I look forward to the results         of the Government Accountability Offices investigation of election         irregularities called for by Representative Conyers
