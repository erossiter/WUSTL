       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On 2007 Executive Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On 2007 Executive Nominations    December 19  2007  As the first session of the 110th Congress concludes  we     should note that the Senate has worked hard on executive nominations      In addition to confirming 40 lifetime appointments to the Federal     bench  we confirmed 22 of this Presidents nominations for high ranking     Executive Branch positions  including the confirmations of nine U S      Attorneys  four U S  Marshals  and nine other important positions  We     achieved these numbers in a year when our investigation into the mass     firing of U S  Attorneys  which triggered a host of resignations by     senior White House and Justice Department officials  led the Judiciary     Committee to devote significant time to rebuilding the integrity and     independence of the Justice Department   We held hearings on nine executive nominations      including a two day hearing on the nomination of Michael B  Mukasey to     be Attorney General of the United States and another hearing on the     nomination of Judge Mark Filip to be Deputy Attorney General of the     United States  the top two positions at the Justice Department  We also     held hearings on the nominations of Michael J  Sullivan to be Director     of the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms  and Explosives  Ronald Jay     Tenpas to be Assistant Attorney General  Environment and Natural     Resources Division  Department of Justice  Ondray T  Harris to be     Director  Community Relations Service  Department of Justice  David W      Hagy  to be Director of the National Institute of Justice  Department of     Justice  Scott M  Burns  to be Deputy Director of National Drug Control     Policy  Executive Office of the President   Cynthia Dyer  to be Director     of the Violence Against Women Office  Department of Justice  and Nathan     J  Hochman  to be an Assistant Attorney General  Tax Division      Department of Justice   We favorably reported 20 executive nominations  and     the full Senate has proceeded to confirm 22 executive nominations      including four additional nominations discharged from the Judiciary     Committee and confirmed today  those of Joseph P  Russoniello to be     U S  Attorney for the Northern District of California  Cynthia Dyer to     be Director of the Violence Against Women Office  Nathan J  Hochman  to     be Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division at the Justice     Department  and Explosives  and Scott M  Burns  to be Deputy Director of     National Drug Control Policy  Executive Office of the President  and     one additional nomination confirmed today  that of Julie L  Myers to be     Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security  I thank the Members of the Judiciary Committee for     their hard work all year in considering these important nominations  I     especially thank those Senators who have given generously of their time     to chair confirmation hearings throughout the year   These nominations come at a critical time for the     nation  Over the course of this year  during which the Judiciary     Committee investigated the firing of U S  Attorneys  we faced the most     serious threat to the effectiveness and professionalism of the Justice     Department since Watergate and the Saturday Night Massacre  Under    this President  the Justice Department     suffered a severe crisis of leadership that allowed our justice system     to be corrupted by political influence  The crisis of leadership that     led to numerous resignations and has taken a heavy toll on the tradition     of independence that has long guided the Department and protected it     from political influence  This crisis has also taken a heavy toll on     morale at the Department and in confidence among the American people  Our work to restore the Justice Department also     including reporting nine U S  Attorney nominations  James Russell     Dedrick to be U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee      Thomas P  O Brien to be U S  Attorney for the Central District of     California  Edward Meacham Yarbrough to be U S  Attorney for the Middle     District of Tennessee  Rosa Emilia Rodriguez Velez to be U S  Attorney     for the District of Puerto Rico  Joe W  Stecher to be U S  Attorney for     the District of Nebraska  John Wood to be U S  Attorney for the Western     District of Missouri  Diane J  Humetewa to be U S  Attorney for the     District of Arizona  Gregory A  Brower to be U S  Attorney for the     District of Nevada  and Edmund A  Booth  Jr  to be U S  Attorney for the     Southern District of Georgia  Some replace outstanding U S  Attorneys     who were fired almost a year ago as part of the ill advised  partisan     plan to fire well performing U S  Attorneys  We also reported the nominations of four U S      Marshals  Michael David Credo for the Eastern District of Louisiana      Esteban Soto III for the District of Puerto Rico  John Roberts Hackman     for the Eastern District of Virginia  and Robert Gideon Howard  Jr  for     the Eastern District of Arkansas   We also reported the nominations of Julie L  Myers     to be Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security  Dabney Langhorne     Friedrich to be a member of the U S  Sentencing Commission  and Beryl A      Howell to be a member of the U S  Sentencing Commission  Just this week  with     only a few legislative days left to us before the Christmas     holidays and the end of this session  our     Committee held two hearings for executive nominations   Our track record shows that the Judiciary Committee     has been working hard to make progress  Of course  when the White House     fails to timely send us nominations to fill vacancies  it makes it that     much harder  The White House has made an abysmal effort to send     nominees to the Senate to replace the fired U S  Attorneys and to fill     vacancies in those districts and many others  There are now 19     districts with acting or interim U S  Attorneys instead of     Senate confirmed U S  Attorneys  That is nearly a quarter of all     districts  Yet the White House has nominated only three people for     these 19 spots  Of course  some of these could have been filled a year     ago had the White House worked with the Senate  I have urged the President to fill the remaining     executive vacancies with nominees who will restore the independence of     federal law enforcement  Last month  the     White House announced with great fanfare its intent to make nominations     for key positions at the Department of Justice  It was only weeks later     that several of these nominations were sent to the Senate  The    delays in sending U S  Attorney nominees and     others to the Senate follow the many months of delay where the White     House failed to send nominees to fill vacancies that have been open     since the summer  or before   In the course of the Committees investigation into     the unprecedented mass firing of U S  Attorneys by the President who     appointed them  we uncovered an effort by officials at the White House     and the Justice Department to exploit an obscure provision enacted     during the Patriot Act reauthorization to do an end run around the     Senates constitutional duty to confirm U S  Attorneys  The result was     the firing of well performing U S  Attorneys for not bending to the     political will of political operatives at the White House  I have repeatedly emphasized that when it comes to     the Justice Department and to the U S  Attorneys in our home states      Senators have a say and a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in     order to insulate the federal law enforcement function from untoward     political influence  That is why the law and the practice has always     been that these appointments require Senate confirmation  The advice     and consent check on the appointment power for U S  Attorneys is a     critical function of the Senate   I had hoped when the Senate voted overwhelmingly to     close the loophole created by the Patriot Act when we passed S 214  the     Preserving United States Attorneys Independence Act of 2007  by a vote     of 97 0  it would send a clear message to the Administration to make     nominations that could receive Senate support and begin to restore an     important check on the partisan influence in law enforcement  Yet  even as we closed one loophole  the     Administration has been exploiting others to continue to avoid coming to     the Senate  Under the guidance of an erroneous opinion of the Justice     Departments Office of Legal Counsel  the Administration has been     employing the Vacancies Act authority to use acting U S  Attorneys and     the power to appoint interim U S  Attorneys sequentially  They have     used this misguided approach to put somebody in place for 330 days     without the advice and consent of the Senate  This approach runs afoul     of congressional intent and the law   By not providing us with the nominations to the     highest ranking vacancies within the Justice Department and not     providing the basic background materials needed to review such     nominations before the Thanksgiving recess  the Administration has once     again foreclosed the opportunity to have these nominees considered by     the Senate and in place this year  Those nominations will now     necessarily carry over into the next session  That is unfortunate and     was unnecessary   We will continue to make progress when we can  and     I will urge the White House to work with the Senate to fill these     vacancies
