       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On DOJ OIG Report On FBI Computer System   Project                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding an FBI Oversight hearing      on Wednesday at 9 30 a m  in Room 226 of the Senate Dirksen Office      Building  FBI Director Robert Mueller is scheduled to appear      before the Committee  Senator Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the panel and the incoming Chairman  plans to ask Director      Mueller about the consistent cost overruns and budget shortfalls      relating to the FBIs long running project to update its computer      system  Below is Senator Leahys comment on the DOJ Inspector      Generals Report released today that found the project is short       56 7 million for its second phase  The full project is four      phases     Comment Of Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Ranking Member And Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary      Committee  On DOJ OIG Report On FBI Computer System Project     December 4  2006       The Bush Administrations mismanagement of this project seems to      know no bounds  Todays finding by the Department of Justice Office      of Inspector General that the FBI will need an additional  56 7      million over what the President requested in his budget for next      year to continue the Sentinel project  and that these additional      costs could have an adverse impact on the FBIs counterterrorism and      other programs  are cause for deep concern  Congress has been told      that Sentinel will cost the American taxpayers  425 million to      complete and that this system will not be fully operational until      2009  Yet the OIG finding of significant funding problems with      Sentinel at this early stage calls the FBIs cost estimate for this      program into serious question         After watching the FBI waste five years and more than  170 million      of taxpayer dollars on the Trilogy program  I remain seriously      concerned about the handling of this project  The American people      cannot afford another fiasco
