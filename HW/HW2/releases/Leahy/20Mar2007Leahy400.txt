       Senate Judiciary Holds Hearing On Combating War Profiteering                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Senate Judiciary Holds Hearing      on Combating War Profiteering  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  March 20   The      Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing    Combating War      Profiteering  Are We Doing Enough To Investigate and Prosecute      Contracting Fraud and Abuse in Iraq  on Tuesday focusing on the      widespread contracting fraud  waste and abuse in Iraq     Our Nation has sent nearly half a      trillion dollars to Iraq with few or no controls over how that money      has been spent  The Bush Administration has chosen to use private      contractors in this war to a greater extent than at any time in our      history  This trend has raised the cost of this military action by      untold billions  said Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman of      the Committee  Predictably  these actions by the Bush      Administration have led to widespread fraud  waste and abuse in      Iraq  on a scale that may be unprecedented in our history    Leahy has introduced the War      Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007  S  119   which would create      criminal penalties for war profiteers and cheats who would exploit      taxpayer funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world  The      legislation builds on earlier efforts by Chairman Leahy  who is also      a senior member of the Appropriations Committee  to crack down on      this type of rampant fraud and abuse  It is similar to legislation      Leahy introduced in 2003  that was subsequently passed by the Senate      as part of an appropriations bill but later torpedoed by the White      House and the House Republican leadership  which stripped out the      Leahy provision   Statement Of Chairman Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On   Combating War Profiteering  Are We Doing Enough     To Investigate And Prosecute Contracting Fraud And Abuse In Iraq      March 20  2007     Efforts to combat war profiteering      have a history going as far back as the practices themselves       During the Civil War  President Lincoln fought against war      profiteers  denouncing them as worse than traitors  He pushed for      the first federal laws curbing this abuse  In World War II       President Roosevelt spoke out against war millionaires who made      excessive profits exploiting the calamity of war  President Truman       when he served in the Senate  crossed this country holding      now famous public hearings to expose gross fraud  waste and abuse by      military contractors  As we observe this week the fourth      anniversary of the war in Iraq  we also must recognize that we      continue to face war profiteering in that conflict  As Iraq Study      Group Co Chair Lee Hamilton testified before this Committee just a      few weeks ago  contracting fraud and abuse significantly undermine      the current efforts in Iraq    Our Nation has sent nearly half a      trillion dollars to Iraq with few or no controls over how that money      has been spent  The Bush Administration has chosen to use private      contractors in this war to a greater extent than at any time in our      history  This trend has raised the cost of this military action by      untold billions  Predictably  these actions by the Bush      Administration have led to widespread fraud  waste and abuse in      Iraq  on a scale that may be unprecedented in our history     The Inspectors General before this      Committee today have reported that billions of dollars spent in Iraq      are unaccounted for and may have been lost to fraud or other      misconduct  These Inspectors General have opened hundreds of      investigations into fraud  waste and abuse in Iraq  Kuwait  and      Afghanistan involving illegal kickbacks  bid rigging  embezzlement       and fraudulent over billing  These investigations have uncovered      crimes committed by employees of the largest government contractors      in Iraq  including Kellogg  Brown  Root  a wholly owned subsidiary      of Halliburton  Many of these matters involve abuse of the now      infamous cost plus and no bid contracts so often used by the      Bush Administration to award huge sums to those with close ties to      this Administration    Despite these investigations and      mounting evidence of fraud  the Administration has committed      precious few resources to investigate and prosecute those who have      illegally exploited this war for profit  It is as if the Department      of Justice is allergic to demanding the accountability that the      American people deserve when it comes to how taxpayer funds have      been misappropriated    Regrettably  the earlier rubberstamp      Congress attempted to limit the investigation of fraud in Iraq and      to shut down the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq      Reconstruction  I am pleased that better sense prevailed and the      inspector generals authority was reinstated after the people spoke      last November    During the nearly four years of war       the Department of Justice has failed to move aggressively enough in      prosecuting fraud in Iraq  As we sit here today  the Inspectors      General before us have more than 70 open and active investigations      in contracting fraud and abuse in this war  but the Justice      Department has only brought six criminal cases involving fewer than      20 individuals over the last three years  Private whistleblowers      have filed numerous civil claims involving Iraq fraud under the      False Claims Act  That is the federal law first used by President      Lincoln to combat war profiteering  a law which was reinvigorated      by Senator Grassley and Congressman Berman during the procurement      scandals of the 1980s  Despite these many cases filed by      whistleblowers  the Justice Department has yet to intervene publicly      in a single case  not one  In fact  to date the Justice Department      has largely chosen not to proceed against the corporations involved      in war profiteering and contracting abuse    As reported to our Committee by the      Department of Justice  the crimes in many of these criminal cases      were committed by employees of Kellogg  Brown  Root  one of the      largest contractors in Iraq  and a division of Halliburton  In      these cases  KBR employees have admitted to receiving kickbacks       inflating costs  embezzling money  and stealing millions from the      American people  But so far  the Justice Department has brought no      formal case  civil or criminal  against KBR  or Halliburton  and KBR      has not returned the profits made from the criminal acts of their      employees    Just last week  we learned that      Halliburton will move its CEOs headquarters outside the United      States to Dubai  and Halliburton apparently plans to spin off KBR       Perhaps Halliburton and its CEO are more comfortable in Dubai than      in the United States  But whether they are or not  their move is an      insult to the U S  soldiers and taxpayers who paid the tab for their      no bid contracts and endured their overcharges for all these years   I introduced the War Profiteering      Prevention Act of 2007  S 119  on the first day of this new      Congress  The bill has 18 cosponsors  including Senators Feinstein       Feingold  Schumer and Durbin  who are members of this Committee  By      this measure we hope to clarify that no one anywhere in the world      can defraud this country during a time of war    and get away with      it    This legislation makes acts of war      profiteering a specific crime  and more importantly  this bill      reaches all contracting fraud whether it occurs in this country or      not and whether it is committed by a U S  citizen or not  Our      legislation applies to all reconstruction and relief activities      overseas to make sure no one can exploit our country in times of      emergency  I have been proposing versions of this bill since 2003       when it did pass the Senate  Unfortunately  this crucial provision      was stripped out of the final version of a bill by a      Republican controlled conference committee    At our hearing today  we will hear      whether this Administration continues to use cash contracts in      Iraq  which create obvious risks for fraud and abuse  As we all      know  the Special Inspector General has already disclosed that this      Administration disbursed through the Coalition Provisional Authority      more than  10 billion in cash in Iraq  with little or no accounting      of how the money was spent  And yet  it appears that this practice      has continued in many contracts in Iraq  The Inspectors General      here today are sifting through millions of documents reflecting      these cash disbursements and finding evidence of fraud  Cash      contracts create incentives for fraud    We will also explore why some cases      have not been prosecuted  because of legal disputes about the      extraterritorial reach of U S  law  That is a problem our War      Profiteering bill would solve    I hope to get a better understanding      of why the Justice Department has been so slow to act and has not      treated these problems as priorities  During the first three years      of the war  the Department of Justice undertook no specific      initiatives to combat fraud in Iraq  and it appears that there were      few  if any  investigators  other than the Special Inspector      General  to pursue allegations of fraud in Iraq  Only in the last      six months has the Department now formed a task force on these      problems  and that task force has not brought any new cases  I hope      and expect that the Department of Justice can do better in the      future  At the suggestion of our Ranking Member  we invited the      Attorney General to come or send a representative  He has chosen to      designate a deputy assistant from the Criminal Division rather than      anyone from the leadership of the Department    Congress has sent billions upon      billions of dollars to Iraq with too little accountability and too      few financial controls  More than  50 billion of this money has gone      to private contractors hired to guard bases  drive trucks  feed and      shelter the troops and rebuild the country  Too much of this money      is unaccounted for  and many of the facilities and services that      these funds were supposed to pay for are still nonexistent  We in      Congress must ask  Where did all the money go  We need to press      for more accountability over the use and abuse of billions of      taxpayers dollars sent as development aid to Iraq     A new law to combat war profiteering      in Iraq and elsewhere is sorely needed and long overdue  Although      there are anti fraud laws to protect against the waste of U S  tax      dollars at home  no law expressly prohibits war profiteering or      expressly confers jurisdiction on U S  federal courts to hear fraud      cases involving war profiteering committed overseas  The bill which      once again is before our Committee would criminalize overcharging      taxpayers to defraud and to profit excessively from a war  military      action  or reconstruction efforts  It would also prohibit any fraud      against the United States involving a contract for the provision of      goods or services in connection with a war  military action  or for      relief or reconstruction activities  This crime would be a felony       subject to criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines      of up to  1 million  or twice the illegal gross profits of the      crime  The bill also prohibits false statements connected with the      provision of goods or services in connection with a war or      reconstruction effort  This crime would also be a felony  subject to      criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to  1      million  or twice the illegal gross profits of the crime     Our bill also addresses weakness in      the existing laws used to combat war profiteering  by providing      clear authority for the Government to seek criminal penalties and to      recover excessive profits for war profiteering overseas  These are      strong and focused sanctions that are narrowly tailored to punish      and deter fraud or excessive profiteering in contracts  both at home      and abroad   The message sent by this bill is      clear  Any act to exploit the crisis situation in Iraq or elsewhere      overseas for exorbitant gain is unacceptable  reprehensible  and      criminal  Such deceit demeans and exploits the sacrifices that our      military personnel are making in Iraq and Afghanistan  and around      the world  We cannot in good faith ask the American people to      sacrifice for reconstruction efforts that allow some to profit      unfairly  When U S  taxpayers have been called upon to bear the      burden of reconstruction contracts  where contracts are awarded in      a system that offers little competition and even less accountability       concerns about wartime profiteering are a grave matter  Combating      war profiteering is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue       Rather  it is a cause that all Americans can support
