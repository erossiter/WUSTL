       Leahy s Reply To Chairman Specter s Letter On Roberts Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy s Reply To      Chairman Specter s Letter On Roberts Documents August 10  2005 Senator Arlen      Specter     Chairman     Committee On The Judiciary     United States Senate     Washington  D C  20510 Dear Arlen  Thank you for      your letter today about documents related to the nomination of Judge      John G  Roberts  Jr   to the U S  Supreme Court   I appreciated      learning from your letter that the White House tomorrow will begin      to release some of the documents housed at the Reagan Library that      the White House earlier said would be provided to the Committee       The Committees evaluation of these documents will help us learn      more about Judge Robertss work and legal views while he was      employed at the White House and the Department of Justice during the      Reagan Administration  I also appreciate your written request to      White House Counsel Harriet Miers  pursuant to my written request      yesterday to the President  that all of these documents be made      available to the Committee as soon as possible and in no event later      than August 22  As we have discussed many times before  timely      cooperation from the Administration is essential for the Committees      preparation for the upcoming hearings on this nomination  The      hearings will begin soon under the agreement we have reached  and      that makes cooperation and good faith especially important in      ensuring that these hearings will be as full and fair as the      American people expect them to be  I must agree to      disagree with your judgment that the Administration is not wrong to      decline providing documents from Judge Robertss tenure in the      Solicitor Generals Office during the Administration of President      George H W  Bush  I and my Democratic colleagues on the Committee      have made a carefully crafted and narrow request for documents in 16      important cases that might illuminate Judge Robertss views on      important issues of concern to all Americans  civil rights  privacy      and access to justice  John Robertss work as a political appointee      in the office of the peoples lawyer  the Solicitor General  is      especially relevant to his nomination  in our view  because his      decisions there were made at the intersection of his legal views and      major public policy decisions  This was the highest ranking job      Judge Roberts ever held in any administration  where by his own      account he had final responsibility for determining whether the      United States would seek further review of adverse decisions in some      380 cases during his time there  He had a more significant policy      role there than in his previous positions  and his work as an      appellate advocate before the Supreme Court would be particularly      illuminating as to his views on judicial decision making  Since he      was also considerably farther along in his legal career  his views      were likely both more developed and more settled  Those records we      have received  which would have been publicly available anyway  have      suggested that Judge Roberts  while working for the Attorney General      earlier in his career  had strong views about such vital issues as      access to courts  the right to privacy  and desegregation  It is      therefore still more important for us to examine his work on these      same issues in cases before the OSG in order to get a sense of his      approach to these and other key rights and values at a more mature      point in his career  In addition  looking at the internal OSG      documents will help us to determine to what extent it is fair to      ascribe to Judge Roberts the views expressed in the publicly      available OSG briefs and to what extent his views at that time were      consistent with the strong positions expressed earlier in his      career  I welcome the      understanding that we seem to share that any White House assertion      of attorney client privilege is not appropriate in the context of a      request from Congress  and I would suggest that the decision in the      case cited in your letter  In re Sealed Case  121 F 3d 729       D C  Cir  1997   does not apply to Congress  To quote from that      decision   W e take no position on how the institutional needs of      Congress and the President should be balanced  In our letter to      the Attorney General we have cited precedents for our request  I look forward to      continuing to working with you in a bipartisan fashion to hold fair      and through hearings on the nomination of Judge Roberts to a      lifetime appointment to the highest court in the Nation   Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY     Ranking Member
