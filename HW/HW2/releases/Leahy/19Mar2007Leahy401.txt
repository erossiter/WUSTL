       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S  214  Perserving United States   Attorney Independence Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On S  214  Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act Of      2007     Senate Floor     March 19  2007      Over the last several months  the      Judiciary Committee has used hearings  investigation and oversight      to uncover an abuse of power that threatens the independence of U S       Attorneys offices around the country and the trust of all Americans      in the independence of our federal law enforcement officials  We      have probed the mass firings of U S  Attorneys and are trying to get      to the truth in order to prevent these kinds of abuses from      happening again    Today  the Senate finally begins      debate on S 214  the Preserving United States Attorney Independence      Act of 2007  We have sought Senate consideration of this bill for      more than a month now  but Republican objections have prevented that      debate and vote  Through the Majority Leaders persistence  he was      ultimately able to obtain consent to proceed to this measure today        Senator Feinstein gave our bill a      straightforward title  The Preserving United States Attorney      Independence Act of 2007  We need to close the loophole exploited      by the Department of Justice and the White House that facilitated      this abuse  The Department of Justice initially fought this bill      when it was in Committee  But since then  in a meeting in my office      on March 8  the Attorney General said the Administration would no      longer oppose this bill  I trust that tomorrow when the Senate      votes on this legislation  we will pass it and take a step toward      restoring the independence of federal law enforcement in this      country     Politics Have      Corrupted The Law Enforcement Function  The Judiciary Committee will continue      to investigate the firings and we will summon whoever is needed to      get to learn the truth  What we have already learned in the few      documents we have seen from the Department of Justice appears to      confirm that the Attorney General  officials at the Department of      Justice and the White House have previously misled Congress and the      American people about the mass firings and the reasons behind them       The most fundamental problem is that this Administration has      apparently insisted on corrupting federal law enforcement by      injecting crassly partisan objections into the selection       evaluation  firing and replacement of the top federal law      enforcement officers around the country  our United States      Attorneys     We have heard the Attorney General and      the President use what William Schneider has called the past      exonerative tense in conceding mistakes were made  Attorney      General Gonzales has yet to specify what mistakes he made  Was it      a mistake to allow the White House  through the Presidents top      political operative and his White House counsel  to force the firing      of a number of high performing  Bush appointed United States      Attorneys  Was it a mistake for the President and his top political      operative to tell the Attorney General and others in the Department      about concerns that U S  Attorneys are not pushing fast enough and      hard enough to indict Democrats but are pushing too hard in      corruption investigations involving Republicans  Was it a mistake      to generate  with White House political operatives  a hit list for      firing hard working United States Attorneys and to ensure that what      they call loyal Bushies are retained  Was it a mistake to name      more loyal Bushies to replace those United States Attorneys who      have shown some independence in exercising their law enforcement      authority and have acted without fear or favor based on political      party    This is an Administration that seeks      to justify its unilateralism by an expansive application of its      unitary executive theory  But when they get caught  all of a      sudden no one knows anything  no one can remember anything  no one      did anything and no one told the President  Instead  mistakes were      made  Is the only mistake they are now willing to acknowledge      their failure to cover up the White House influence over the Justice      Department  Is the only mistake they acknowledge that they got      caught in a series of misleading misstatements to Congress  the      media and the American people  I still wonder if the      Administration or the Attorney General understand the seriousness of      the problem    Yes indeed  mistakes were made  It is      our oversight duty to discover who made those mistakes and how and      why they made them   The apparent efforts corrupt the      federal law enforcement function and have cast a cloud over all U S       Attorneys  Now every U S  attorney is under that cloud  People are      asking about those who were retained as loyal Bushies     Those fired have had their reputations      rehabilitated to some degree by coming forward as we have publicly      examined the facts of their firings  But those circumstances raise      questions with respect to those retained and what they had to do to      please the White House political operatives in order to keep their      jobs  These mass firings have thus served to undermine the      confidence of the American people in the Department of Justice and      their local U S  Attorneys    A recent study of federal      investigations of elected officials and candidates shows a political      slant in the Bush Justice Department in public corruption cases       The study found that between 2001 and 2006  79 percent of the      elected officials and candidates who have faced a federal      investigation were Democrats  and only 18 percent Republicans  The      Administrations track record is wanting  and it again appears to      have been caught with its hand in the cookie jar   It is true that Presidents have the      power to appoint U S  Attorneys  That is not in question  What is      raising concerns is the apparent abuse of that authority by removing      U S  Attorneys for improper reasons  In the same way that any      employer has the power to hire  we understand that people cannot be      fired because they are Catholic or because of their race or because      they are whistleblowers  The power of employment is not without      limit  It can be abused  When it is abused in connection with      political influence over federal law enforcement  the American      people and their representatives in Congress have a right to be      concerned  We need the facts  not more spin  and not yet another      cover story    The United States Department of      Justice must be above politics  The Attorney General of the United      States has to ensure the independence of federal law enforcement      from political influence  I made no secret during our confirmation      proceedings of my concern whether Mr  Gonzales could serve as an      independent Attorney General on behalf of the American people and      leave behind his role as counselor to President Bush  As the      Nations chief federal law enforcement officer  he must carry out      his responsibilities and exercise his awesome authority on behalf of      the American people  He must enforce the law and honor the rule of      law  He must act with the independence necessary to investigate and      prosecute wrongdoing without fear or favor  The political interests      of the President cannot be his guiding light  His principal is      not the President  as the Attorney General indicated as recently as      our January 18 hearing  his client is the American people  and his      principles must be devoid of partisan politics  His mission is not      to provide legalistic excuses or defenses for unlawful actions of      the Administration    such as the warrantless wiretapping of      Americans  the use of torture and the issuing of signing statements      to excuse following the law    but to enforce the law and to ensure      that the federal law enforcement is above politics      The President can pick anybody he      wants to serve on his White House staff  and does  But when it      comes to the United States Department of Justice and to the U S       Attorneys in our home states  Senators have a say and a stake in      ensuring fairness and independence to prevent the federal law      enforcement function from untoward political influence  That is why      the law and the practice has always been that these appointments      require Senate confirmation  The advice and consent check on the      appointment power is a critical function of the Senate  That is      what this Administration insisted be eliminated by the provision it      had inserted in the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act to remove      limits on the ability of the Attorney General to name a interim      United States Attorneys  That is what our bill is intended to      restore    Rolling Back      Changes In The Law  We have seen  again  the effects of      letting politics infiltrate the Department and undermine its      independence and the independence of its law enforcement function         As we have learned more about these      events over the last few months  I was reminded of a dark time some      30 years ago when President Nixon forced the firing of the Watergate      prosecutor Archibald Cox  Not since what came to be known as the      Saturday Night Massacre have we witnessed anything of this      magnitude  The calls to a number of U S  Attorneys across the      country last December  by which they were forced to resign  were      extraordinary  Unlike during the Watergate scandal  there was no      Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus seeking to defend the      independence of federal prosecutors  Instead  the Attorney General       the Deputy Attorney General  the Executive Office of U S  Attorneys      and the White House all apparently collaborated in these efforts to      sack a number of outstanding United States Attorneys   Sadly  what we have heard from the      Administration about the mass firings has been a series of shifting      explanations and excuses  This lack of accountability or      acknowledgement of the seriousness of this matter makes it all the      more troubling  The Attorney Generals initial response at our      January 18th hearing when we asked about these matters was to brush      aside any suggestion that politics and interference with ongoing      corruption investigations were factors in the mass firings  Now we      know that these factors did play a role in this troubling project        Today and tomorrow we can take a step      forward by fixing the statutory excess that opened the door to these      untoward actions  I commend Senator Feinstein for leading this      effort and Senator Specter for joining it  We have all cosponsored      the substitute to restore the statutory checks that have existed for      the last 20 years  It is time to take that first step toward      restoring independence by rolling back a change in law that has      contributed to this abuse   There have been no good answers to our      questions about why the Administration has removed U S  Attorneys      and not had nominees lined up to replace them  Or why home state      Democratic Senators were not consulted in advance  There is no      explanation for why there are now 22 out of the 93 districts with      acting or interim U S  Attorneys instead of Senate confirmed U S       Attorneys    Sadly  even successfully restoring the      law will not undo the damage done to the American peoples      confidence in federal law enforcement  For that  we need to get to      the truth  real accountability  and a renewed commitment to insulate      federal law enforcement officers from the corrupting influence of      partisan politics and the corrosive influence of White House      intrusion into law enforcement activities
