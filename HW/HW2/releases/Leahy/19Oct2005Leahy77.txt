       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Reporters  Shield   Legislation  An Additional Investigation Of Issues And Implications                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Reporters Shield Legislation      An Additional Investigation Of Issues And Implications     October 19  2005 I      am pleased the Committee is holding a second hearing on this      important matter  Members of the Committee were surprised and      disappointed when the Deputy Attorney General cancelled his      appearance on the morning of the July 20 hearing  Senator      Feinstein and I sent a letter to the Chairman asking for this      opportunity to hear from the Administration  We appreciate his      agreement to schedule a follow up hearing  but I was very      disappointed to learn Monday that the starting time of this      mornings hearing was moved back  creating a number of scheduling      conflicts for me  Nonetheless  I want to acknowledge the serious      effort the Chairman is making to address this issue  I appreciate      that and I hope that we can continue to work together and with other      members of the Senate to develop legislation        While a small number of cases have garnered significant national      attention  the question of whether or not to enact some form of      privilege for journalists has vexed us since Branzburg v  Hayes      was decided by the Supreme Court in 1972  Since that time  31      states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes granting      some form of privilege to journalists  Efforts have been made from      time to time to codify a reporters privilege in federal law  but      these attempts failed  in part because supporters of the concept      found it difficult to agree on how to define the scope of what it      means to be a journalist  With bloggers now participating fully      in the 24 hour news cycle  we might face similar challenges in      defining terms today   I      have long been a champion of a vibrant and independent press  My      interest comes honestly and early as the son of a Vermont printer      from Montpelier  In my many years in the Senate  I have aspired to      fulfill the ideals of my father  fighting for a free press and      greater transparency in government  For example  I have long      championed the Freedom of Information Act  which shines a light on      the workings of government and has proven to be an invaluable tool      for both reporters and ordinary citizens  Earlier this year  I      introduced legislation with Senator Cornyn to improve implementation      of that critical legislation  Open government goes hand in hand      with freedom of the press and that is why I have advocated so      strongly for it   As      a former county prosecutor  I also understand that our democracy is      nothing without a healthy respect for the law  The issue before us      today is especially important because it requires us to carefully      weigh the public interest in First Amendment press protection and      the public interest in solving crime  Indeed  recent high profile      cases have shown just how thorny this issue can be   The      witnesses at todays hearing represent a wide range of views  We      will hear from a U S  Attorney and two former Federal prosecutors      who are skeptical of providing a privilege for reporters  We will      also hear from representatives of the news media  who rely on      sources to investigate and publish or broadcast the news  The free      flow of information is a cornerstone of our democracy  and our      independent press is the envy of the world  I look forward to      learning from the witnesses broad range of experience and      expertise  and expect that we will have a healthy debate
