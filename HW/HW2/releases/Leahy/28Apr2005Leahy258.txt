       Leahy Sununu Offer Bill To Defend E Mail Privacy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy Sununu Offer Bill To Defend      E Mail Privacy        Bipartisan Legislation      Would Close Loophole In Court Decision      Allowing Internet Service Providers To Snoop    WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 28   Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        and John Sununu  R N H   joined forces Thursday to strengthen      privacy protections of electronic mail in the wake of a court ruling      that opened the door for Internet Service Providers to snoop in      their customers communications    As two of the leading privacy advocates in the U S  Senate  Leahy      and Sununu sponsored the E Mail Privacy Act to stave off the privacy      erosions generated by a recent ruling of the First Circuit Court of      Appeals in the United States v  Councilman case  Last year  the      court  in a 2 1 ruling by a panel of the court that is being      appealed to the full court  found it permissible for an Internet      Service Provider  ISP   without permission  to systematically      intercept  copy and read its customers incoming emails for      corporate gain as the messages were being transmitted    The court based its ruling on its interpretation of the 1986      Electronic Communications Privacy Act  ECPA   a law which Leahy      wrote and sponsored    In what was clearly a strained reading of the law  ECPA   the      court condoned an unacceptable privacy intrusion  said Leahy  who      is the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee       I know firsthand that we wrote and enacted that law with one      purpose in mind  to ensure that Americans could enjoy the same      amount of privacy in their online communication as they do in the      offline world  Our bill would restate and underscore Congresss      intent and restore the law to its full purpose    This decision has serious ramifications beyond allowing ISPs to      snoop among their customers e mails  Leahy said  It would also      allow the government to conduct searches without complying with the      wiretap procedures that to date have been a standard part of      investigative practice    Last year  as the chief author of ECPA  Leahy took the rare step      of offering a friend of the court brief supporting the Department of      Justices appeal of the 3 judge panels decision  and objected to      the decisions weakening of the privacy protections he pushed to      enact almost 20 years ago  In 1986 Congress passed ECPA to update      the Wiretap Act  Leahy noted that the law was a careful  bipartisan      and long planned effort to bring privacy protection into the      information age  The full court has not yet issued a decision on the      panels ruling    More and more individuals  businesses  and governmental      organizations use electronic communications in their day to day      operations making privacy issues more critical than ever before       said Sununu  As we have seen so many times before  technology is      outpacing current law  and advances in communications are making old      distinctions irrelevant  By clarifying federal law so that all      e mail communications  no matter where they are in transit  are      subject to the Federal Wiretap Act  the Leahy Sununu E Mail Privacy      Act of 2005 restores the previous expectations of consumer privacy      for e mail    The E mail Privacy Act sponsored by Leahy and Sununu offers a      straightforward solution to prevent the erosion of privacy      protections and clarifies that the wiretap laws apply to all      interceptions  Leahy explained  The bill would amend ECPA to clarify      that the definition of intercept is broad enough to include      actions that are functionally equivalent to an interception    Below is Leahys statement on the introduction of the bill                  Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy          On The Introduction Of The E mail Privacy Act      And The Protection Of Online Privacy      April 28  2005    Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I introduce today the Leahy Sununu      E mail Privacy Act to ensure that last years decision by the First      Circuit Court of Appeals in a case called United States v       Councilman does not undermine the online privacy that Americans      expect and cherish  Senator Sununu has been a leader on privacy      issues  and I appreciate and welcome his support    In a strained reading of the Electronic Communications Privacy      Act  ECPA   the majority in this case effectively concluded that it      was permissible for an Internet Service Provider to systematically      intercept  copy and read its customers incoming e mails for      corporate gain  This outcome is an unacceptable privacy intrusion      that is inconsistent with Congressional intent and the commonly held      understanding of the protections provided by ECPA  and requires      swift Congressional response  I offer the E mail Privacy Act as a      simple  straightforward way to prevent the erosion of the privacy      protection Congress granted to e mail and ensure that this outcome      is not repeated    In 1986 Congress passed ECPA to update the Wiretap Act so that      Americans could enjoy the same amount of privacy in their online      communications as they do in the offline world  ECPA was a careful       bipartisan and long planned effort to protect electronic      communications in two forms  from real time monitoring or      interception as they were being delivered  and from searches when      they were stored in record systems  We recognized these as different      functions and set rules for each based on the relevant privacy      expectations and threats to privacy implicated by the different      forms of surveillance    The Councilman decision upset this careful distinction       Functionally  the ISP was intercepting e mails as they were being      delivered  yet the majority concluded that the relevant rules were      those pertaining to stored communications  which exempt ISPs       Specifically  the majority rejected the argument put forth by the      Justice Department that an intercept occurs  and the Wiretap Act      applies  when an e mail is acquired contemporaneously with its      transmission  regardless of whether the transmission may be in      electronic storage for a nanosecond at the time of acquisition  This      majoritys conclusion fails to consider the nature of electronic      communications systems and belies the reality that such searches are      functionally an interception    The implications of this decision are broad  While many ISPs are      responsible online citizens  this does not change the fact that this      decision essentially licenses ISPs to snoop  Even more worrisome is      that this decision creates the opportunity for they type of Big      Brother invasions that understandably make Americans cringe  For      practical reasons  law enforcement often installs surveillance      devices at these nanosecond storage points  but before doing so       they have obtained the appropriate legal permission to intercept      e mails  a Title III order  Under the majoritys interpretation in      the Councilman decision  law enforcement would no longer need to      obtain a Title III order to conduct such searches  but rather could      follow the less rigorous procedures for stored communications  For      example  under the rules for stored communication  if law      enforcement were to get the consent of a university operated ISP       such searches could be performed without the knowledge of users       This is Carnivore unleashed if you will  and is simply not the      outcome that Congress intended or the American people expect       Searches that occur in nanosecond storage points during the      transmission process are in their function interceptions and      should be treated as such and subject to the wiretap laws    The E mail Privacy Act is a simple approach to prevent the      erosion of privacy protections and clarifies that the wiretap laws      apply to e mail interceptions like those at issue in the Councilman      case  In essence  the Act would amend ECPA to clarify that the      definition of intercept is not a narrow  rigid concept  but is broad      enough to include actions that are functionally equivalent to an      interception  Importantly  these careful and slight changes would      simply restore the status quo prior to the Councilman decision      without disturbing other areas of ECPA and without raising      controversial concerns that may be difficult to resolve in the few      remaining days of this term    This is an important issue to the American people  and      fortunately the E mail Privacy Act provides a straightforward      approach that we can all get behind  Again  I thank Senator Sununu      for his support on this important legislation  I am sure he would      join me in urging our colleagues to make e mail privacy a top      priority and support the E mail Privacy Act
