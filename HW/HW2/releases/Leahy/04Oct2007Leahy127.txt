        Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                      VERMONT                 Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Committee On The Judiciary    Hearing On Justice Denied  Oversight On Implementation     Of The Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act     October 4  2007  In November of 2003  Congress unanimously passed     the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act  This important legislation     was intended to improve the Public Safety Officers Benefits program by     allowing survivors of first responders who suffer fatal heart attacks or     strokes while participating in non routine stressful or strenuous     physical activities to qualify for Federal survivor benefits  That     December  with great fanfare  the President signed this legislation into     law before a large group of firefighters and law enforcement officers      Then  once the camera lights were turned off  the cases began piling up     at the Justice Department  My frustrations  and the frustrations of the     surviving families and the first responder community grow daily over the     Justice Departments glacial processing of these applications  We will     hear a sampling of those deep and widespread frustrations today  More     than three years passed before the Justice Department released its final     implementation rule last year  in effect  delaying implementation of     the law and disregarding the clear will of Congress to grant these     surviving families death benefits in a timely  fair manner  It is no     overstatement to conclude that the Administration has worked to erect     obstacles between this program and these surviving family members  not     to find ways to help them  These thickets of red tape are a painful     indignity to these heroes and their families  and they are an offense to     our moral obligation to offer them our help and our thanks for all they     do for us  day in and day out  Now  nearly four years after the Hometown Heroes     bill became law  the Justice Department has approved only 12 Hometown     Heroes claims  all the while denying 50 families this important benefit      and leaving more than 240 applications unanswered   Is this any way to treat our first responders      those who Congress has appropriately called our Hometown Heroes  It is     disturbingly reminiscent of this administrations inexcusable neglect of     the needs of those who have returned from the fighting in Iraq and     Afghanistan and of our other veterans  President Lincolns spoke for     the ages in his second inaugural address in1865  in the midst of the     Civil War  when he called for binding up the Nations wounds and caring     for those who have borne the battle  and for his widow  and for his     orphan  This is the same moral obligation we share when it comes to     caring for the families of our first responders   The Justice Departments adjudication of claims has     been nothing but bewildering  It is shocking  for instance  that a U S      Forest Service firefighter in Florida  who was found dead 45 feet behind     a fire line with a shovel in his hand  was denied benefits because those     managing this program in Washington could not determine whether he was     engaged in strenuous activity at the time of his heart attack  The Justice Department should immediately expedite     all of the outstanding Hometown Heroes claims  In light of the fact     that so many individuals who should have been deemed eligible were not      the Department should revise the criteria it has used to evaluate     claims  The burdensome information requests made of those who file     claims  such as 10 years worth of past medical records  should stop      immediately  Instead of harassing these grieving families  the White     House and the Justice Department should remove the bureaucratic hurdles      the lengthy delays  and the other obstacles that have prevented     surviving families from receiving the benefits Congress intended  The     bottom line is that the needs of first responders and their families     simply have not been a high enough priority for this administration  We     intend to make them a higher priority  Passage of the Hometown Heroes     Survivors Benefits Act and this hearing are part of that effort  At his last hearing before the Judiciary Committee  former Attorney     General Gonzales agreed with me that the Justice Department was far too     slow in writing regulations for the Hometown Heroes program  and even he     apologized  He assured me that he would clear up the delays and the     backlog  But that did not happen before he resigned   I thank Director Herraiz of the Department of Justice for being with     us today  and I am hopeful that he comes with better news  that our     efforts are beginning to cut through all the red tape   Heart attacks and strokes are a grim fact of life and death in the     high pressure jobs of police officers  firefighters and medics  These     afflictions are killers that these heroes face day in and day out  like     speeding bullets and burning buildings  Emergency first responders put     their lives on the line for us  and we owe their families our gratitude      our respect and our help  If the Justice Department has been moved by     concern from Congress and the first responder community over the     implementation of this law  and if the Department now is prepared to     make the changes necessary to ensure that the law is faithfully     followed  I welcome any progress we can make   As we will see again today  the families of our first responders are     real people  whose sacrifices have been enormous and who deserve     better  We are honored that three surviving widows are here to share     their stories with us  They speak as representative of all the     families  to insist that the Justice Department end this shameful     bureaucratic logjam  Before introducing them  I turn to our Ranking     Member  Senator Specter  for any opening remarks he may care to make      As I welcome our witnesses today  I also welcome     the many uniformed officers  surviving widows  and their families and     friends who are here for the annual National Fallen Firefighters     Memorial Weekend in Emmitsburg  Maryland  In particular  I welcome Matt     Vinci and Ben OBrien from Vermont  who are both in the audience today      I also acknowledge and thank the fire and police     service organizations that have been so instrumental in passage and     implementation of the Hometown Heroes act  the Congressional Fire     Services Institute  the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation  the     International Association of Fire Fighters  the National Volunteer Fire     Council  the International Association of Fire Chiefs  the International     Fire Service Training Association  and  of course  the Fraternal Order     of Police  the National Association of Police Organizations  and the     Sergeants Benevolent Association of New York City   I would also like to express thanks to Congressman     Bob Etheridge  who was the author of this law in the House of     Representatives  and who has been a great supporter of our first     responders and has been equally forceful in ensuring this law is     implemented correctly   Now to our courageous witnesses  Athena Schwantes      Jo Ann Tilton  and Susan Falkouski  I had the pleasure of meeting Jo     Ann  Athena  and Athenas adorable children when they were last in town     back in July  Thank you for coming and for speaking out  I hope you     will be encouraged by what happens here today
