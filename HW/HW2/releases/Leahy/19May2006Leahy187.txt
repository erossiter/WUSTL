       Leahy Unveils Bill To Foster Low Cost Drugs For World s Poorest                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             At UVM       College Of Medicine Commencement          Leahy Unveils Bill      To Foster Low Cost Drugs      For Worlds Poorest  BURLINGTON  Vt   Sunday  May 21       Embargoed Until 2 30 p m    Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         announced Sunday he will introduce legislation this week to       foster production of low cost versions of life saving medicines       for millions in the poorest nations who now cannot afford them   In his commencement address at the       UVM College of Medicine  Leahy said his Life Saving Medicines       Export Act  which he will introduce in the Senate on Thursday        would allow U S  generic drug firms to manufacture low cost       generic versions of patented medicines for export to nations in       need when a voluntary agreement between the generic and the       brand name U S  company cannot be negotiated  Those patent       holders would get royalty payments  and the generic firms would       then be required to sell those less expensive drugs only to the       poorest countries   Today 15 percent of the worlds       people consume 91 percent of the worlds pharmaceuticals  Leahy       told the UVM medical graduates  The high price of many       life saving medicines  medicines that we take for granted  is       beyond reach for millions of the worlds most vulnerable       populations  Imagine if you  or a loved one  were dying and you       knew the medicine to cure the disease exists and costs only a       few dollars  but you have no way to get it or to pay for it        That is a reality for millions of people today   The need for these medicines is       clear and present  but the market to provide them is not  said       Leahy  The incentives in this bill would help change that   Leahys bill would amend U S        patent law to allow implementation of the low cost drug       provisions of a 148 nation agreement completed last year  The       Bush Administration itself has not proposed any implementing       legislation  even though former U S  Trade Ambassador Rob       Portman called the agreement a landmark achievement that we       hope will help developing countries devastated by HIV AIDS and       other public heath crises  and his office said this approach       will allow countries to override patent rights when necessary       to export life saving drugs  Leahy is the Democratic leader of       the Senate Judiciary Committee  which oversees patent laws         The bill addresses the extremely       low rate of treatment of a wide variety of diseases for which       there are pharmaceutical cures and treatments  Leahy said       infectious and parasitic diseases remain the major killers of       children in the developing world and communicable diseases still       account for seven out of the top ten causes of childhood       deaths  Thirty five percent of Africas children are at higher       risk of death today than they were 10 years ago  Reports by       UNICEF  UNAIDS  WHO and Doctors Without Borders clearly show       that the high prices of many life saving medicines and       diagnostics are a significant barrier to their availability in       the poorest areas of the world    Leading causes of death in the       developing worlds children include perinatal conditions  lower       respiratory infections  diarrhea diseases  malaria  measles        congenital anomalies  HIV AIDS  pertussis  tetanus  and       protein energy malnutrition  Only about 12 percent of       HIV positive people worldwide have daily antiretroviral drugs       available to them  Leahy said   Leahy has worked for months with a       wide range of foundations  humanitarian organizations  religious       groups  generic drugmakers and others in developing the bill   The Vermont senator said he is       hopeful about the prospects of his bill eventually becoming       law  The fact that deadly diseases today are just a plane ride       away    and the emergence of new threats like Avian Flu  have       finally convinced us that global health is also an issue of       national security                      Section By Section Summary      Of The Life Saving Medicines Export Act of 2006      Chief Sponsor  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Section 1  Short Title  Sets       forth the name of the Act as the Life Saving Medicines Export       Act of 2006   Section 2  Purposes and       Congressional Findings   Section 2 states that the purpose of       the Act is to promote public health under World Trade       Organization agreements by permitting the export of generic       versions of life saving patented pharmaceutical products and       other medicines  including diagnostic tools and vaccines  needed       to prevent or treat potentially life threatening diseases to       residents of impoverished countries with insufficient or no       manufacturing capacity to make the medicines  The findings set       forth determinations by the World Health Organization concerning       the millions of low income persons without regular access to       medicines in lesser developed or developing nations   Section 3  Exportation of Generic       Medicines for Public Health Purposes   This section requires       the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to       issue a compulsory license  permission to make and sell a       patented product under this new Act  to permit generic companies       to make and export medicines under the terms of WTO       international agreements under several conditions    The recipient country must be a       least developed nation  as defined by the United Nations  or a       developing nation without the ability to manufacture the       medicine in question    The recipient country  called an       eligible country in the bill  must notify the WTO of its       interest in participating in this program    Efforts must have been made by the       generic company to buy the right to make and sell the medicine       under normal business arrangements with the patent holders    The medical product exported under       this Act can only be used in least developed or developing       nations  and is not for re export except in identified       circumstances relating to regional trade alliances     Special labeling and packaging       must be used to make clear that the product is sold under the       authority of the WTO agreement only for use as allowed under       agreement and this bill    The permission to make and sell       the product  the license  can not exceed seven years  except       that the license may be extended once    The holder of the compulsory       license shall pay a royalty to the patent holder  as determined       by the Director of the PTO within a limited range of possible       rates set forth in the bill  taking into account such factors as       humanitarian needs  the economic value to the importing nation        and the need for low cost pharmaceutical products by persons in       the importing nation    The maximum royalty for any       shipment shall not exceed 4 percent times the commercial value       of the pharmaceutical products to be exported under this Act       under that supply agreement     An alternative royalty payment       approach  modeled after the approach enacted into law by Canada        would also be permitted with the same 4 percent maximum  In       addition  the Director may accept combined applications from       multiple eligible countries  Note that in emergency situations       the Director may waive provisions of the bill in a manner       consistent with the WTO agreements     Section 4  Not a patent       infringement   This section makes clear that compulsory       licenses issued under this Act shall not be considered an       infringement of a patent   Section 5  National Advisory Board       on Implementation of the General Council Decision   This       section creates a diverse advisory board  of academic  patent        trade  medical  international aid  and industry experts  to       advise the Director  and to report to the Congress  on ways to       improve implementation of the bill to achieve its purposes        Mandatory funding for the board is provided out of the general       fund of the U S  at  1 5 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008        with declining amounts provided in subsequent years through       2011
