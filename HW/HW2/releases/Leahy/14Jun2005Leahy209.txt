       Closing Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Thomas   B  Griffith To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Closing Statement      Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of Thomas B  Griffith     To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit     June 14  2005 This nomination      is a measure of the double standards used by Republicans in      connection with judicial vacancies   During the      Clinton presidency  Senate Republicans ensured that the 11th      and 12th judgeships on the D C  Circuit were not filled       They had argued since 1995 that the caseload of the D C  Circuit did      not justify a full complement on the court  Indeed  at ahearing in      1995  Republicans called Chief Judge Laurence H  Silberman of the      circuit to testify against proceeding to fill vacancies on the D C       Circuit   Republicans have      argued for years this circuits caseload per judge is one of the      lightest in the country  In a May 9  2000  letter  Judge Silberman      argued that the D C  Circuits caseload continued to decline from      1995 to 2000  and he opposed confirmation of additional Clinton      nominees  In fact  the D C  Circuit caseload has continued to      decline and in 2004 was lighter than it was in 1999 when Senate      Republicans refused to consider two highly qualified and moderate      nominations by President Clinton to vacancies on the circuit  With      the confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown to that court last week       there are now 10 confirmed  active judges for the D C  Circuit       which is what Republicans since 1999 had maintained was the      appropriate number  With all the      self righteous talk from the other side of the aisle about their      new found principle that every judicial nominee is entitled to an      up or down vote  the facts are that in 1999 and 2000  the nomination      of Elena Kagan to the D C  Circuit was pocket filibustered by those      same Senate Republicans  Ms  Kagan is now Dean of the Harvard Law      School  Qualified  Undoubtedly  Was she given consideration in a      Republican run Senate  Not on your life  Likewise  the nomination      of Allen Snyder to a vacancy on the D C  Circuit was never voted      upon  Mr  Snyder is a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and      was a highly respected partner in a prominent D C  law firm  the      same law firm from which President Bush nominated John Roberts to      the same court  Senate Republicans pocket filibustered President      Clintons nomination of Mr  Snyder  but they unanimously supported      the confirmation of Mr  Roberts  Senate Republicans played a cruel      joke on Mr  Snyder when they allowed him a hearing but then went on      to refuse to list him for a vote by the Judiciary Committee or by      the Senate   In September      2002  Senator Sessions explained that Clinton nominees Elena Kagan      and Allen Snyder were blocked  Because the circuit had a caseload      about one fourth the average caseload per judge And the chief      judge of the circuit said 10 judges is enough  instead of 12  And I      actually thought that was too many  I thought 10 was too many       Well  the D C       Circuits caseload per judge is lower now than it was during the      Clinton Administration  Let us see whether the votes of Republican      Senators this time will be based on the same rationale they gave in      inflicting pocket filibusters on Clinton nominees   Last week we      witnessed a Republican Senator    who had voted against the      confirmation of a Clinton judicial recess appointment and had      explained his vote as representing his opposition to recess      appointments    reverse himself to vote for a Bush judicial recess      appointment  Last week we witnessed dozens of Republican Senators         who had voted against confirmation of Ronnie White of Missouri      in 1999 and had explained their vote as compelled by the opposition      of his home state Senators    reverse themselves and vote in favor      of Justice Janice Rogers Brown and ignore the strong  consistent and      well founded opposition of her two home state Senators    Today we will see      whether the many Republican Senators who delayed and opposed the      confirmation of judge Merrick Garland in 1996 and 1997 and who      pocket filibustered the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan      in 1999 and 2000 will vote against a nominee to the D C  Circuit      because the caseload of the circuit does not justify more judges       We will see if Republican Senators again abandon their earlier      rationale  In addition  as I      explained yesterday  Mr  Griffiths decision to practice law without      a license for a good part of his career should be disqualifying  He      has not honored the rule of law by his practicing law in Utah for      five years without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to      become a member of the Utah Bar  In this regard he appears to think      he is above the law  That is not the kind of nominee who should be      entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a federal court and  least      of all  to such an important court as the D C  Circuit  which is      entrusted with protecting the rights of all Americans  This is the      wrong nomination for this court  and I will vote against it    The D C  Circuit      is an especially important court in our nation s      judicial system for its broad caseload covering issues as varied as      reviews of federal regulation on the environment  workplace safety       telecommunications  consumer protection  and other critical federal      statutory and constitutional rights  The White House has rejected      all Democratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees for      this court and refused to engage in consultation  The President has      insisted on dividing the Senate and the American people with several      of his judicial nominees  That is unfortunate for the judiciary       for the Senate and for the Nation  and the Presidents unilateral      approach is totally unnecessary and unlike his predecessors   This is another      in a series of inappropriate nominations this President has made to      this same court  Last week  Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to      confirm Janice Rogers Brown to this court  The takeover of this      court is now complete  Mr  Griffith is the third nominee from      President Bush to be considered by the Senate  If he is confirmed       the 11 judges on the court will include a majority of seven judges      appointed by Republican Presidents   And this takeover      will have been contrived through a web of Republican double      standards and doubletalk so audacious and intricate that it would      make a spider blush
