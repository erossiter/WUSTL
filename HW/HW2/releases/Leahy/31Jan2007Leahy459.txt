       New Congress Reshapes Foreign Aid Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              New Congress      Reshapes Foreign Aid Priorities   Peacekeeping Funds Will Aid Darfur      Efforts      Strengthened HIV AIDS Relief May Save More Than 100 000 Additional      Lives  WASHINGTON  WEDNESDAY  Jan  31   The      newly revised budget bill to fund much of the federal government for      the rest of this year will strengthen U S  efforts to secure peace      and protect refugees in Darfur  while opening the opportunity to      save more than 100 000 additional lives through HIV AIDS relief      efforts  according to Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Leahy  once again the chairman of the      Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State  Foreign Operations and      Related Programs  says the revised spending plan also will ensure      that compelling humanitarian needs are met  for example  by      boosting efforts to combat TB and malaria and to provide      humanitarian relief to refugees who have fled Darfur  Iraq and      several other of the worlds hotspots    The new Congress is already beginning      to reshape our priorities  said Leahy  We have painstakingly      forged a humanitarian aid budget that will enable us to relieve the      suffering of the worlds most vulnerable people  If this is      enacted  no longer will our federal budget needlessly cut off AIDS      and malaria  medicines that peoples lives depend on  This bill reflects      the bipartisan way we have worked together  as well as our common      recognition of the desperate needs in some of the worlds poorest      countries  A country as blessed as ours should be doing far more to      help destitute people far from our shores  but these are solid      improvements that will save lives and offer hope   The new bill  H J Res 20  would      replace the current continuing resolution  the placeholder budget      that was passed last year when the previous Congress failed to      finish work on nine of the 13 annual appropriations bills  The      current continuing resolution expires Feb  15  and the newly crafted      budget bill would replace it as the ongoing federal budget for the      remainder of Fiscal Year 2007  The Senate and House Appropriations      Committees worked together in the arduous  line by line recasting of      the budget  While freezing spending at current levels and staying      below the spending cap imposed last year by President Bush and      ratified by the Republican Congress  the new bill makes several key      adjustments in priorities  The House will take up the new bill      first  then the Senate will   The changes reflect longtime      priorities of Leahy  who again chairs the Appropriations panel that      handles the Senates work in writing the annual budget bill for the      State Department and U S  foreign assistance programs  Leahy      praised the cooperative  bipartisan effort that produced the bill       which included the leadership of Senate Appropriations Chairman Sen       Robert Byrd  D W V    House Appropriations Chairman Rep  David Obey       D Wis    House Foreign Operations Appropriations Chairwoman Rep       Nita Lowey D N Y    Senate State Foreign Operations Ranking Member Sen  Judd      Gregg  R N H   and House Foreign Operations Appropriations Ranking      Member Rep  Frank Wolf  R Va      Highlights Of The      FY2007 CRs Funding For State  Foreign Operations   HIV AIDS  TB AND      MALARIA     Under the continuing resolution      enacted last year by the previous Congress  funding within      State Foreign Operations to combat HIV AIDS  tuberculosis and      malaria totaled  2 68 billion  including  445 5 million for the      Global Fund to Fight HIV AIDS  TB and Malaria  Under H J Res 20       those amounts would increase by  1 27 billion and  179 5 million       respectively  for new totals in the State Foreign Operations section      of the bill of  3 95 billion and  625 million    Currently only 20 percent of people      needing AIDS drugs in poor countries are getting them  and only 10      percent of the people at risk of infection are receiving prevention      services  Continued funding at the FY 2006 level would have kept      life saving antiretroviral drugs from an estimated 350 000 more      HIV infected people  According to the Office of the Global AIDS      Coordinator  110 000 to 175 000 people would die of HIV related      causes if the FY 2006 funding levels had not been increased in the      joint resolution    Funding to combat malaria would have      been frozen at the FY 2006 level of  105 million under the      continuing resolution passed last year  Malaria is both preventable      and treatable  yet it kills more than one million people per year       mostly African children  Expansion of assistance to combat malaria      would be stalled and the eight additional countries targeted for the      next round of malaria prevention and treatment programs would be      placed on hold  The additional funding in the joint resolution will      enable the United States to meet our commitment to cut      malaria related deaths by 50 percent in 15 of the hardest hit      countries in Africa  These funds will go to support the purchase of      lifesaving drugs  distribution of insecticide treated bed nets  and      treatment of pregnant women at risk for malaria   INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING     H J Res 20 provides an additional  113      million for international peacekeeping operations above the amount      in the continuing resolution enacted last year  This amount ensures      that U S  dues to the UN are paid in FY 2007 and that the United      States not fall farther behind in support for troops in 13 countries      including Lebanon  Sudan  Haiti and the Congo    The joint resolution also includes  50      million to support the African Union troops in Darfur and Southern      Sudan  These funds  which were omitted in the continuing resolution      enacted last year  are needed to house and support 7000 troops at 34      camps throughout Sudan and to ensure a smooth transition this year      to a UN force    ASSISTANCE FOR REFUGEES     The joint resolution increases funding      by  75 million to support refugees  over the amount enacted last      year  Leahy noted that these funds were needed because current      resources would have been exhausted well before the end of FY 2007       resulting in great hardship to the worlds most vulnerable people       These funds include  20 million to support Iraqi refugees     EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE      PROGRAMS     The joint resolution provides an      increase of  19 2 million above the amount enacted in the budget      last year for international educational and cultural exchange      programs  These exchanges  Leahy said  are one of the most      effective tools of public diplomacy the U S  has available       particularly in predominantly Muslim countries
