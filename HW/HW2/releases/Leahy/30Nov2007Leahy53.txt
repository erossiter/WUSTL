       Leahy Presses Citizenship And Immigration Director On Fair Wages For   Vermont Service Center Employees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Leahy Presses Citizenship And       Immigration Director   On Fair Wages For Vermont Service       Center Employees      WASHINGTON  Friday  Nov  30         Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   is pushing the director of the U S        Citizenship and Immigration Service  USCIS  to work with a       private contracting firm to ensure that employees of the Vermont       Service Center are provided fair and equitable pay       In a letter sent Friday to USCIS       Director Emilio Gonzalez  Leahy expressed his strong concern       that  if left intact  wage reductions proposed for contract       workers will hurt employee morale and the efficient operation of       the Vermont Service Center  and he urged USCIS to work with       Stanley Associates to minimize planned wage cuts for       approximately 200 Vermont workers  Starting Monday  Stanley       Associates will assume data entry  fee collection  and mail and       file operations at the Vermont Service Center in St  Albans        where thousands of naturalization applications are processed       each year  The Virginia based firm secured a federal contract       through the Department of Homeland Security to manage operations       at the St  Albans facility  as well as a facility in       California  Leahy chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee  which       has jurisdiction over federal immigration agencies       Also on Friday  Leahy called for       the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to invest the       resources needed to reduce the backlog of naturalization       applications received since October 2006  More than 1 4 million       applications have been received in the last year  Over the       summer  the USCIS increased application fees  spurring a surge       in applications which the agency was not prepared to handle  It       is estimated that naturalization applications filed after June       1  2007  will have to wait 16 to 18 months for processing        threatening the right of successful applicants to vote in the       national elections in November       The text of Leahys letter to       USCIS Director Gonzalez is included below                  to to read more about       Leahys letter to DHS Secretary       Michael Chertoff on the processing backlog        November 30  2007      The Honorable Emilio T  Gonzalez   Director   U S  Citizenship and       Immigration Service   Department of       Homeland Security   20 Massachusetts       Avenue  NW   Washington  D C        20529      Dear Director Gonzalez         I have recently been made aware of       a troubling situation at the Vermont Service Center in St        Albans  Vermont  As a result of Stanley Associates succession       to a contract held by the Service Center Operations Team  SCOT        to provide data entry  fee collection  plus mail and file       operations at the Vermont Service Center  approximately 200       long time employees will receive serious reductions to their       hourly wages  Some of these employees stand to lose almost        3 00 per hour  In a state like Vermont  which  though rural        has a cost of living above the national average  these wage       reductions will have serious negative consequences to the men       and women who work at the Vermont Service Center  as well as to       their families        The Vermont Service Center is a       source of pride for Vermont  and for the many employees who are       responsible for the Centers excellent reputation  It would be       truly unfortunate if these wage reductions resulted in a       diminishment of employee morale and commitment  both of which       are essential to the Centers service quality  The work       performed by the Vermont Service Centers employees is critical       to our national security  and is a fundamental component of our       national immigration system  At a time when the agency has       imposed higher fees and promised improved services  it is       unacceptable that it then seeks  in effect  to cut the wages of       workers performing essential functions  This is especially true       in light of the severe backlog of naturalization applications       brought about in part by your agencys recent fee increases             As you continue to look at this       situation  I hope you will keep in mind the importance of       treating these Federal contract employees fairly  To this end        I urge you to work with Stanley Associates to try to come to a       resolution that meets the needs and expectations of the       dedicated men and women whose work is so important to the       overall success of USCIS  I look forward to hearing of any       progress in the near future        Sincerely              PATRICK LEAHY   Chairman
