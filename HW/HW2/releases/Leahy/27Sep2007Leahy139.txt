       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On THe Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes   Prevention Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Senate Amendment  3035     The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act Of 2007     September 27  2007    Today the Senate is considering an amendment to      the Department of Defense bill to address crimes that terrorize      entire communities  Violent crimes motivated by prejudice and hate      are tragedies that haunt American history  From the lynchings that      plagued race relations for more than a century to the      well publicized slayings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd  Jr   in      the 1990s  this is a story we have heard too often in this country       Unfortunately  in my home state of Vermont  there have been two      recent attacks that appear to have been motivated by the victims      religion or sexual orientation  A well respected state      representative in the Vermont Legislature has not been immune to      threats of violence based solely on his sexual orientation   I am proud to once again be a cosponsor of this      legislation  I hope that this time Congress will have the courage      to pass it  Six years ago  I made this bill one of the first major      bills to move through the Judiciary Committee after I became      Chairman  It passed the Senate in the 106th Congress and      again in the 108th Congress  but Republicans in the House      blocked this important bill each time  In the Democratically led      House of Representatives  the companion bill this year passed by a      wide bipartisan margin  So I am hopeful that this time  Democrats      and Republicans in the Senate will join together finally to enact      this civil rights measure into law  This hate crimes legislation improves current      law by making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and      prosecute crimes based on race  color  religion  and national      origin  Victims will no longer have to be engaged in a narrow range      of activities  such as serving as a juror  to be protected under      federal law  This bill also focuses the attention and resources of      the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed      against people because of their sexual orientation  gender  or      disability  which is an important and long overdue expansion of      protection  Finally  this bill provides assistance and resources to      state  local  and tribal law enforcement to address hate crimes   The crimes targeted in this bill are      particularly pernicious crimes that affect more than just their      victims and their victims       families B      they inspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim      other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual      orientation  When James Byrd  Jr   was dragged behind a pickup      truck and killed by bigots in Texas in 1998 for no reason other than      his race  many African Americans throughout our Nation surely felt      diminished as citizens  When Matthew Shepard was brutally murdered      in Wyoming the same year because of his sexual orientation  many in      the gay and lesbian community felt less safe on our streets and in      their homes  These crimes promote fear and insecurity that are      distinct from the reactions to other crimes  and we need to take      action to enhance their prosecution   All Americans have the right to live  travel      and gather where they choose  In the past we have responded as a      Nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights  We      have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our      citizens for nearly 150 years  The Local Law Enforcement Hate      Crimes Prevention Act continues that great and honorable tradition  This bill will strengthen federal jurisdiction      over hate crimes as a back up  but not a substitute  for state and      local law enforcement  States will still bear primary      responsibility for prosecuting most hate crimes  which is important      to me as a former state prosecutor  In a sign that this legislation      respects the proper balance between federal and local authority  it      has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law      enforcement organizations across the country   Moreover  this bill accomplishes a critically      important goal B      protecting all of our citizens     B without      compromising our constitutional responsibilities  It is a tool for      combating acts and threats of violence motivated by hatred and      bigotry  But it does not target pure speech  however offensive or      disagreeable  The Constitution does not permit us in Congress to      prohibit the expression of an idea simply because we disagree with      it  As Justice Holmes wrote  the Constitution protects not just      freedom for the thought and expression we agree with  but freedom      for the thought that we hate  I am devoted to that principle  and I      am confident that this bill does not contradict it   We have been trying for years to pass the Local      Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act  It is appropriate to      attach this important legislation to the pending Department of      Defense Authorization Bill  as we have done twice in recent memory       because this is a pressing issue  I hope that we will not see      another Republican led filibuster on what should be a bipartisan      measure   Passage of this amendment will show once again that     America values tolerance and protects all of its people  I urge the     opponents of this measure to consider the message it sends when year     after year  we are prevented from enacting this broadly supported bill      The victims of hate deserve better  Let us join together and adopt     these provisions without further obstruction and delay
