       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Senate Agriculture Hearing On Dairy   Policy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Senate Agriculture Committee Hearing On Dairy Policy     July 20  2006 Mr  Chairman  I would like to      thank you for holding this important hearing on the dairy programs      in the 2002 Farm Bill  I would also like to welcome Mr  Leon      Berthiaume  General Manager and CEO of St  Albans Cooperative      Creamery  Leon has provided tremendous leadership for Vermonts      largest cooperative for many years  and his wisdom on dairy issues      is only exceeded by his practical experience in dealing with them in      the real world  I look forward to his expert testimony   The 2002 Farm Bill was an historic      accomplishment that resulted in a unified national dairy policy that      has worked for all dairy farmers from Wisconsin to Vermont to the      State of Washington  As we all know  dairy policy has at times been      contentious  Yet the 2002 Farm Bill  and the advent of a new      program that provides support to all dairy farmers  resulted in      tremendous unity among the nations dairy producers   Forging practical solutions to      keep Americas vital dairy farms strong has posed unique challenges       and much of that has to do with the fact that milk is far more      perishable than other farm products  Farmers do not have the luxury      of storing their milk while they wait for bad market conditions to      improve   I continue to believe the      Northeast Dairy Compact  which supported dairy producers through the      marketplace  was the gold standard for dairy policy  In theory       and  even more importantly  in practice  it showed itself to be the      most successful and the most straightforward dairy program that has      yet been tried  After reauthorization of the Compact became      impossible because of opposition by the Administration and through      well financed opposition directed at Congress  I worked with other      dairy leaders in the Senate and later in the House to create the      Milk Income Loss Contract program  which has come to be referred to      by its acronym  MILC   The MILC program has proven to be      a vital lifeline to thousands of small and medium sized dairy      operations  To farmers in my State of Vermont  which depends on the      dairy industry more than any other state  MILC has provided more      than  47 million in support that has helped hundreds of dairy      producers weather severe market fluctuations to be able to stay in      business and on the farm  In a 2004 review  the Government      Accountability Office agreed  finding that  quote  payments      introduced through the MILC program have kept small dairy farms in      business   The Committee can also take some      pride in knowing that MILC is also the best targeted program that      USDA operates  The program is countercyclical    payments are made      only when the market price is low  When prices are good  as they      were for most of 2005  the program does not operate  In addition       there is a firm payment limitation that is targeted to operations of      approximately 125 cows  which makes over 80 percent of all dairy      farmers in this country fully covered by the cap in the MILC      program  In recent days  there has been a great deal of media      attention about large government payments to farms and government      payments that are going to people who dont even farm  The MILC      program has none of those problems  The program has proven so      successful that  under the leadership of Chairman Chambliss  and      with the help of many others  we were able to extend MILC for an      additional two years  An overwhelming bipartisan majority of this      Committee and the full Senate supported the extension of the MILC      program during the budget reconciliation process    The 2002 Farm Bill      also contained other important provisions for our nations dairy      industry  The extension of the dairy price support program  which      has proven to be an effective means of providing a minimal safety      net to prevent major disruption to dairy producer prices at      relatively low cost to the government was important  This minimal      safety net has allowed consumers and the industry to have ample      supplies of economical  wholesome and nutritious dairy products  I      am concerned  however  that USDAs administration of this program      has allowed the price support to effectually drop below the  9 90      level during low price periods  In addition the 2002 Farm Bill      reauthorized the Dairy Export Incentive Program  which helps dairy      producers develop new markets and compete in various subsidized      markets overseas   Finally  the 2002      Farm Bill made an historic commitment to working lands conservation      programs that have proved valuable to dairy producers  Most      importantly  the increased funding for the Environmental Quality      Incentives Program  EQIP  and the Farm and Ranchland Protection      Program  FRPP  have allowed producers to obtain important financial      support to comply with ever increasing environmental concerns  In      my State of Vermont  EQIP has helped hundreds of producers reduce      phosphorus in our lakes and streams  The Regional Equity      requirement in the 2002 Farm Bill also guaranteed traditionally      underserved states their fair share in USDA conservation programs        In summary  I      believe we made significant progress on dairy issues in the 2002      Farm Bill  I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today  and      look forward to working with Chairman Chambliss and Ranking Member      Harkin to continue these successful programs in the 2007 Farm Bill                        Testimony     By Leon Berthiaume     General Manger CEO     St  Albans Cooperative Creamery  Inc      St  Albans  Vermont     Review of U  S  Department of Agriculture Dairy Programs     U  S  Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry     July 20  2006 I am Leon Berthiaume       General Manager CEO  of St  Albans Cooperative Creamery  Inc       located in St  Albans  Vermont  It is a pleasure to      have the opportunity to submit written testimony and participate in      the hearing process as a member of a panel to review the United      States Department of Agriculture Dairy programs   I would like to thank      Chairman Chambliss and Senator Patrick Leahy and members of the      Committee for their leadership  commitment and support for      agriculture  specifically the dairy industry   I had the privilege of      joining the St  Albans Cooperative Creamery  Inc  team in 1984 as      the Controller  In 1991  I was provided the opportunity to take the      position of General Manager CEO of the Cooperative  I have the      pleasure of serving in various capacities and committees serving      both our state and northeast region of the dairy industry  The St  Albans      Cooperative Creamery  Inc  is a member governed dairy cooperative      serving Vermont  New York and New Hampshire dairy farmers  Our      membership comprises of approximately 500 members  producing in the      range of 1 3 billion pounds of milk on an annualized basis  Our      average member operation produces in the range of 2 4 million pounds      of milk per year  Approximately 20  of our members produce 60  of      the Cooperatives milk volume  When establishing and working on      cooperative and dairy industry policies  it is important to      represent all size farm operations  Fifty five percent of      our milk volume is marketed directly to fluid and manufacturing      plants throughout the Northeast  We operate a manufacturing      facility in St  Albans  Vermont that separates approximately 45  of      our milk volume to generate cream and skim solids for various      customers such as Ben and Jerrys  Franklin Foods  Vermont Butter      and Cheese  Saputo and other processors in New England and New York      markets  Due to the Cooperatives shortage of skim solid markets  it      is necessary to process excess skim solids into nonfat dry milk      powder  We manufacture in the range of 10 to 20 million pounds of      nonfat dry milk powder on an annualized basis  Our team at the St       Albans Cooperative is comprised of 70 employees who are responsible      for providing service  selecting stable markets and achieving the      greatest return for our members by offering quality products and      innovative service to customers  The Cooperative also is committed      to providing active leadership for the dairy industry and in the      political environment thereby benefiting all dairy farmers  My testimony will      reflect on the challenges that Vermont and other Northeast states      are facing in agriculture  and the need to maintain dairy programs      that provide support and economic stability for our agricultural      industry   2006 is proving to be      an unprecedented year for dairy farmers  Our members are      experiencing the lowest milk prices weve seen since 2003  which      mirrors pricing from the late 70s   escalating operating costs and      adverse weather conditions  Milk prices are      currently at their lowest levels in over two years  There is      uncertainty on the price outlook for the rest of 2006 and throughout      2007  Based on current price forecasts  we do not anticipate prices      reaching levels to cover the cost of production during this      timeframe  Below is a price forecast for the remainder of 2006 and      2007 that was prepared by the Vermont Dairy Task Force in June      2006        Month 2006 Stat  Uniform 2007 Stat       Uniform      Jan  13 93       12 83

the St  Albans Cooperative      has seen a significant decline in its average pay price to members       Listed below are the St  Albans Cooperative Creamery  Inc  average      pay price before

  13 97 cwt  1 20 per gallon     2006  Projected       12 40 cwt  1 07 per gallon In addition to      depressed milk prices  farm operating costs have and continue to      increase putting increased pressure on farm margins      This decrease in milk price combined with increasing      operating costs will significantly impact the profitability of our      member farms in 2006  The primary increase in operating costs is      due to the increase in energy costs that have been absorbed      by dairy farms over the past 2 years  Energy costs      affect the fuel used to plant and harvest crops  electricity on      farms  transportation costs and a variety of other essential      resources needed to operate a dairy  Dr  David Kohl  Professor      Emeritus Virginia Poly Tech states in the November 9  2005 Ag      Lender On the cost side  nearly  8 of every  10 spent  on farms       is linked to the price of oil and energy through fertilizer       chemical  and other inputs  The Northeast has been bombarded      with significant amounts of rainfall through late spring and early      summer  In St  Albans  Vermont  approximately 20 inches of rain has      fallen between the months of May and June  which is nearly triple      the average over the past ten years  These conditions have crippled      farmers efforts in Vermont to plant corn and harvest hay  The      Federal government has recognized this dire situation  approving a      designation making all qualified farm operators eligible for      low interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency  The      emergency designation with an allocation of funds from Congress will      also allow the FSA to assist farmers through the Livestock      Compensation Program  Livestock Assistance Program  Livestock      Indemnity program  and Flood Compensation Program   The      impact of increased energy costs can also be felt in various areas      at the Cooperatives facilities  St  Albans plant fuel costs      increased from  694 135 65 in FY04 to  892 913 29 in FY05       representing a 28 64  increase  Fiscal year 2006 already shows      signs of another significant increase over FY05  Lower dairy      commodity prices  coupled with increased manufacturing costs have      impacted the profitability of manufacturing operations  In turn       the lack of profitability impacts the dairy farmers who own and      operate manufacturing and or balancing facilities in the region  The      State of Vermont has seen the number of farms decrease over the past      five years while the overall milk volume has remained level  In      2002  there were approximately 1 415 dairy farms in Vermont      producing approximately 2 6 billion pounds of milk  Today  the      number of dairy farms has decreased to 1 179 with production      remaining steady at 2 6 billion pounds annually  Vermont has seen      at least 46 dairy farms discontinue operations since the beginning      of the year  Based on information from an economic impact study      conducted by the University of New Hampshire  the Vermont dairy      industry directly contributes approximately  1 billion into the      Vermont economy  This figure includes producer payroll  producer      purchases and processor revenues  excluding indirect revenues from      the tourism industry  At the St  Albans Cooperative  producer      payroll for its 500 members is down over  8 million when comparing      January April 2006 to January April 2005  which are dollars that      would have been re invested into the states economy and that would      have assisted in the viability of our farms operations   The      State of Vermont has taken action to combat the issues negatively      impacting Vermonts dairy industry  Vermonts Governor  James      Douglas  through the Agency of Agriculture formed the Vermont Dairy      Task Force in the spring of 2005 to address the changing trends in      the dairy industry in Vermont  The mission of the Dairy Task Force      is to develop a set of strategies to improve the vitality  longevity      and profitability of Vermonts dairy industry  The goals of the      Dairy Task Force include  reduce costs  increase returns and      increase profitability of Vermont dairy farmers as measured by a      return on assets of 8   increase the dairy herd to 150 000 animals       enhance the dairy industry in Vermont by attracting strategically      important dairy processing to the state and to enhance the image and      attitude of Vermonts dairy industry and dairy products for dairy      farmers  the dairy industry  related agricultural businesses and the      general public  In addition  Vermonts Secretary of Agriculture       Steve Kerr recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the      Commissioner of Agriculture in New York and the Secretary of      Agriculture in Pennsylvania to make the regions dairy farms more      competitive and to give producers in the Northeast an opportunity to      gain more market share through coordination of resources with the      states working together as one  Farms in the three states produce      approximately 25 billion pounds of milk per year  accounting for      roughly 15  of the nations total production  New York is the      third largest milk producing state in the country  followed by      Pennsylvania  Vermont is the 15th largest milk producing      state   The      initiatives that the State of Vermont has undertaken are critical to      the long term success of the dairy industry in Vermont       Unfortunately  these state programs combined with the MILCX program      have not been enough to cover the operating costs on Vermont      dairies  Hence  Vermont took on a third initiative to assist      farmers financially on a short term basis  The State of Vermont      instituted a Target Price Program in June 2006 to assist Vermonts      dairy farmers in this time of great need due to the adverse weather      conditions  high fuel prices and low milk prices  The Vermont      Target Price Program is designed to provide payments in the near      term to assist dairy farmers when the milk price is below  14 00 per      hundredweight  The program will pay the difference between the      target price and the combined announced Federal Order Statistical      Uniform Price for the Middlebury  Vermont location plus the amount      of the MILCX payment rate on a per hundredweight basis  This direct      payment program has come at a critical time for Vermont dairy      farmers  assisting in their efforts to remain viable businesses  I      would like to recognize the efforts of the US Senate Ag Committee      for holding these hearings on the US Department of Agricultures      Dairy Programs  Dairy programs are vital components to our      agriculture industry  It is essential to continually review and      assess the need and effectiveness of those programs    I am a      proponent of the USDA establishing a policy that supports regional      production of milk  Our agricultural and rural communities are an      important part of the individual regions within our countrys      economy  The dairy industry alone generates approximately  1      billion to Vermonts economy   I believe that from a bio security      and environmental standpoint that we would all benefit from ensuring      that our dairy industry and food production is not highly      concentrated in any one region in this country  It is essential      that we maintain minimum levels of production in various regions of      the country   The 2002 Farm Bill      included several programs that directly affect a dairy producers      income as well as conservation programs that provided assistance to      dairy farmers in implementing various environmental initiatives   Dairy farmers in the      Northeast have many variables that can affect any given years      production  A limited growing season can make farmers in the      Northeast more vulnerable to adverse weather conditions than those      farmers in other parts of the nation  Weather can adversely affect      a farmers crop yield  hence increasing the cost to feed a herd of      dairy cows  The Northeast traditionally has had high operating      costs compared to other regions and the Milk Income Loss contract      program  MILC  has assisted tremendously in covering part of those      costs in times of low milk prices  This safety net has enabled      Vermont farms to remain viable during those periods of low milk      prices  The MILC is similar to the Northeast Dairy Compact which      provides counter cyclical payments that are triggered when Class I      milk prices in Boston fall below  16 94 per hundredweight  The MILC      program provided a much needed safety net when farm milk prices      hovered just below  12 00 per hundredweight in 2002 and 2003       Vermont dairy farmers received more than  45 million in MILC      payments during that time   I would like to thank      the Committees leadership and support for the extension of the MILC      program  The MILCX program was extended until August 31  2007 and      payments in Vermont have already exceeded  2 million as milk prices      began to drop dramatically in March of this year   The one setback to the      MILCX program is that it contains a 2 4 million pound production      cap  discriminating between farmers of differing sizes  We need      farms of all sizes to maintain a strong infrastructure  serving the      needs of dairy farm operations within our region  Approximately 30       of our members are affected by the production cap  In order to      increase efficiencies in the utilization of labor  management and      capital  many of these members have consolidated their operations       becoming multi family farms  The size of the cap should be      increased to take this into account  The Federal Price      Support Program has served the dairy industry very well over the      last 6 decades and continues to be an important safety net for dairy      farmers in the northeast  Although the federal support price is set      relatively low at  9 90  it does provide a floor for manufactured      products in times of the over production of butter  powder and      cheese  This program truly is a stand by safety net program as it      incurred almost no purchases or costs during fiscal year 2005 and      throughout the first half of fiscal year 2006  However  in periods      such as from July 2002 through June 2003 when prices received by      dairy farmers were at 25 year lows  the program kept the industry      from being in an all out catastrophe throughout the country  The      Federal Price Support Program is an important safety net program      that benefits all dairy producers  The only suggestion that I would      make is that the department should utilize its tilt authority with      the utmost restraint when farm milk prices are on the upswing   The Dairy Export      Incentive Program is an important program that we need to encourage      the Secretary of Agriculture to utilize to its maximum allowable      levels  We need to market cheese  butter and nonfat dry milk to      levels afforded under the current WTO agreements  St  Albans Cooperative      manufacturing of nonfat dry milk is not a profitable operation  The      current Commodity Credit Corporation purchase prices for dairy      products do not reflect the increased costs to provide product to      the Commodity Credit Corporation  As a result market prices for      individual products have  from time to time  been less than the      support levels which on a milk equivalent basis provides for a price      of milk at less than the statutory support level for milk of  9 90      per hundredweight at average test   St  Albans Cooperative      is participating in the self help program  Cooperatives Working      Together  CWT   Under this program  dairy farmers contribute 10      cents per hundredweight on all their milk produced in order to      adjust the size of the nations dairy cow herd and more closely      aligning milk supply to demand  In addition  the program assists in      the exportation of dairy products  in an effort to market      domestically producer dairy products internationally   The CWT program has      been effective  however is not intended to take the place of federal      farm programs  Participation in the CWT program is voluntary and it      will always have those who choose to take advantage of its benefits      without contributing to the program  For this reason  federal farm      programs are still needed as well as Congresss help in providing      policy support to our industry   As the Committee well      knows  high energy costs have been particularly harmful to dairy      farmer income  Dairy farmers require significant amounts of      electricity to operate their facilities as well as diesel and      gasoline for their equipment  In addition  dairy farmers have to      pay the cost of transporting their milk  All of these higher energy      costs have added anywhere them  1 to  1 50 per hundredweight to milk      production costs  The 2007 Farm Bills Energy Title needs to be      significantly expanded to help develop alternative sources of      energy  One important source of energy that has not been fully      tapped has been the use of manure  Although methane digesters are      being built on some dairy operations  this technology  along with      other new and emerging technologies  needs to be developed so they      are economically feasible for various size dairy farm operations       The Federal Milk      Marketing Order program assures dairy farmers a minimum price       assure that all competing milk buyers pay the same minimum price       assure that all dairy farmers share equitably in the returns of the      marketplace and assure that the terms of trade are uniform      throughout the Orders marketing area  Although the federal orders      serve as an important marketing structure that helps provide dairy      producers with minimum prices for their milk  the order system      itself needs to be streamlined so that it can respond quickly to      changes that are needed when marketing conditions are altered due to      external forces in the economy  The process for obtaining      administrative changes in the operation of the federal orders is      much too slow  I would like to add a      couple of additional comments on USDAs working lands conservation      programs  Conservation programs on working agricultural lands bring      environmental benefits to both producers and the public       Conservation thus represents a double value for the taxpayers by      supporting sustainable agriculture and also enhancing the      environment  The 2002 Farm Bill added significant authorization for      expanded funding to the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP        In addition  the farm bill included an important Regional Equity      requirement which has significantly increased federal working lands      conservation funding for Vermont  When combined with State of      Vermont programs  conservation programs have helped significantly to      reduce run off around barns and other dairy facilities and has      allowed for the increased use of filter strips and other buffers      along waterways  Funding for EQIP and the Regional Equity      requirement should be continued in the 2007 Farm Bill and expanded      as well  We need the      Committees strong support and leadership to clarify the Superfund      law or its counterpart  the Community Right to Know Act regarding      animal manure  Getting the law clarified this year should be a      high priority as animal manure is not a toxic waste  Traditional      farming practices should not be jeopardized due to unclear laws that      impose strict  joint and retroactive CERCLA liability on dairy      farmers  In times of greater      financial stress in agriculture  it is especially important to have      effective loan programs to rely on  The Farm Service Agency is an      important service provider to our member farms  The current FSA      direct loan limit is  200 000 for both the operating loan program      and farm ownership loan program  The limits need to be re evaluated      as the current levels no longer reflect the needs on farm operations      today   In Vermont and in many      other states  additional loan funds are necessary to meet the      current demand   The FSA has worked to      improve efficiencies within the agency  However  there are      continued opportunities to streamlining the administration of this      program  FSA needs to continue to incorporate more technology and      web based resources into their programs  In addition  FSA has two      very different personnel systems that continue to separate the      activities of the Farm Loan Programs from the Conservation and      Commodity Programs that could be consolidated  Going forward  we      may need to assess whether more resources are needed for these very      efficient programs   The average age of      Vermont Dairy Farmers is increasing according to the 2002 Ag      Census  The group of farmers over 60 years old own and control a      large amount of farmland  We do expect that farms and land will      continue to transfer to other generations or other farmers  With      the age of the average Vermont farmer being 54 years old  in the      next 10 to 15 years more than half the farms will be changing      hands  This may require modification to the existing FSA programs       Due to the volatility      of milk prices  there is increased interest and participation by      dairy farmers in risk management opportunities   In working with      another dairy cooperative we are able to offer our members forward      contracting opportunities  Our members are more apt to work with      their cooperative on milk price opportunities  Capital is necessary      to operate risk management programs  The efforts in working with      dairy farmers are for short periods of duration with minimal risk       Cooperatives may need access to additional low cost capital to      support this initiative   Access to low cost      capital for Cooperatives is critical with rising interest rates       Again costs of capital are borne directly by dairy farmers as owners      of their Cooperatives  Access to low cost operating capital for      dairy Cooperatives and dairy farmers would also be beneficial to      operations  Funding plants and farms with owner equity and debt is      becoming increasingly problematic as cost  improvements  and land      prices continue to rise  sources of patient capital would      dramatically improve this situation  We must continue to      work with our Agency of Agriculture that support dairy programs and      provide technical assistance to dairy farmers  Funding continues to      be essential to support our initiatives surrounding water quality       conservation and best management farm practices  Matching dollars      has been important to the States effectiveness in supporting the      efforts of dairy farmers and implementing various practices and      required initiatives   Promoting and      supporting animal health initiatives is essential to protecting our      industry and the image of our products   The National Johnes      Disease Control Program continues to be an element of animal health      that should continue to be a priority in reducing the herds      associated with this disease  Sufficient funding of the program is      essential to its overall success  Laboratories have been able to      correctly detect and report this disease with the assistance of the      USDA   USDA has an integral      role in protecting agriculture from the full impact of market      conditions  There are many complex issues surrounding the structure      of agriculture  We must have a vision for agriculture for the      future of the industry in this country and ensure that we support it      with sufficient resources   I would again like to      thank the Chairman and members of the Committee for the opportunity      to provide written testimony  Your ongoing leadership  vision and      understanding are critical to the implementation and oversight of      USDAs dairy program  I look forward to answering any questions you      may have or to provide additional information to the Committee
