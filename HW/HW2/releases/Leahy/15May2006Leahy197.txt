       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Funding For The Bulletproof Vest   Partnership Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       And Author  Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program     News Conference     Funding For The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program     Monday  May 15  2006 It is an honor to      be here today with these dedicated officials representing Americas      police officers  who have made it their sworn duty to protect the      public  And I am proud of the leadership of this group in our      effort to raise awareness of the importance of ensuring that every      police officer who needs a bulletproof vest  gets a bulletproof      vest  This is a day and      a week that we dedicate each year to commemorating Americas fallen      police officers  to renewing our bond with their families  and to      thanking those who put their lives on the line for us each day when      they put on a police badge   The      dangers of police work can strike unexpectedly  even in a precinct      parking lot  Just last week  all of us were brought face to face      once again with the grim reality of what this day is about with the      events in Fairfax County Virginia  not far from here  across the      river  A week ago today  in a hail of senseless gunfire  Detective      Vicky Armel was taken from us  and Officer Michael Garbarino was      critically wounded  The Capitol Building behind us has also known      this kind of tragedy in recent times  But this annual      commemoration at the Capitol Building should be more than a time of      passive reflection  It should also be a time to rededicate      ourselves to doing those things that can help relieve or prevent      this kind of suffering and loss  The 850 000 men      and women who serve as our guardians of law and order do so at great      risk  They respond without hesitation  and with incredible      dedication and skill  There are those here with us today who know      first hand about that kind of valor and dedication among the      officers who were lost on 9 11 at the World Trade Center    Several years      ago  when I discovered that so few of our local and state law      enforcement officers were equipped with body armor such as      bulletproof vests  which has typically been standard equipment for      federal law enforcement officers  I knew we had an obligation to      change that  I sat down with my friend  former Senator Ben      Nighthorse Campbell  and we wrote the charter for the Bulletproof      Vest Grant Partnership Acts of 1998  2000 and 2003  Last year      Congress agreed to reauthorize the program again  at  50 million per      year  and through the year 2009  Year after year       the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program saves lives and spares      injuries of law enforcement officers nationwide by making it      possible for state and local law enforcement agencies to buy body      armor for their officers  Since we began it in 1999  this highly      successful program has made possible the purchase of an estimated      450 000 bulletproof vests for officers in 12 000 jurisdictions      nationwide  In Vermont  more than 150 communities have used this      partnership help buy more than 2 000 vests  Without this      partnership  I daresay there would be close to that number of police      officers without vests in Vermont today  Compounding the      ongoing funding needs to help purchase vests  concerns from the law      enforcement community over the effectiveness of body armor surfaced      nearly two years ago when a Pennsylvania police officer was shot and      critically wounded through his relatively new body armor vest  In      August 2005  the Justice Department announced that test results      indicated that used vests equipped with a material called Zylon may      not provide the intended level of ballistic resistance       Unfortunately  an estimated 200 000 of these faulty vests have been      purchased  many with Vest Partnership funds  and now need to be      replaced  We know that body      armor saves lives  but the cost has put these vests out of the reach      of many of the officers who need them  and of their departments       This program has made it more affordable for police departments of      all sizes  and that is why I was dismayed to see that the      Presidents budget for 2007 proposes slashing this program by 63      percent from last years level  stranding it at just over  9      million  Bulletproof vests for Americas police officers  and the      modest expense of fully funding this partnership program  is my      definition of a high budget priority  I know that our police      officers see it that way too  and I believe that all Americans do       Congress needs to reject that White House recommendation  and      instead we need to make these vests a priority by fully funding this      partnership program  in the budget decisions that lie directly ahead      for the Congress   Few things mean      more to me than when I meet police officers in Vermont and across      the nation and they tell me that the protective vests they wear      were made possible because of this program  We continue to lose too      many of our law enforcement officers to criminal acts and high risk      situations  They should not have to worry  in addition  about      whether or not they can afford vests to protect them  If we can take at      least this one worry from their shoulders  we can and we should do      it
