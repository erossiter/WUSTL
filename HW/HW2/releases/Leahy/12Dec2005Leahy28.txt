       Leahy Leads Bipartisan Coalition Seeking Extension of Patriot Act Powers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy Leads Bipartisan Coalition     Seeking Extension Of Patriot Act Powers        Democratic and Republican Senators Introduce Bill To Give Congress     Three Months To Improve Proposed USA PATRIOT Act Conference Report  WASHINGTON       Monday  Dec  12   Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt    the ranking      Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  has forged a coalition      of Republican and Democratic senators that introduced a bill Monday      to extend the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act to give      Congress more time to improve a proposed rewrite of the PATRIOT Act      that they believe is flawed on several counts   Leahy and the      bipartisan group have proposed a three month extension of the      expiration of key provisions in the 2001 law that granted broad law      enforcement powers to government agencies shortly after the Sept  11      attacks  The bill proposes that key provisions of the USA PATRIOT      Act set to expire at the end of this month remain valid until March      31 next year to give Congress more time to make improvements    Congress      should not rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline      that is within our power to extend  We owe it to the American      people to get this right  said Leahy  A sensible and workable      bipartisan solution that protects both Americans security and their      rights and liberties is within our reach and worth a few extra weeks      to get it done  We have made improvements just since Thanksgiving       and we should make every effort to make this a better bill that will      strengthen  instead of jeopardize  the publics faith and trust   The bipartisan      coalition consists of Leahy and Sens  John Sununu  R N H    John      Rockefeller   D W V    Larry Craig   R Idaho   Edward Kennedy        D Mass    Lisa Murkowski   R Alaska   Carl Levin   D Mich         Richard Durbin   D Ill    Debbie Stabenow  D Mich    and Ken      Salazar   D Colo     The bipartisan      group has offered the bill as an alternative to rushing through      Congress this week a Republican written conference report signed      last week that falls short of striking the right balance to protect      Americans civil liberties and privacy  said Leahy who served as      the Senates chief Democratic negotiator for the House Senate      conference committee  A similar proposal is expected to be      introduced in the House this week  Leahy said   None of the      Democratic conferees  either in the House or in the Senate         signed the proposed conference report filed last week  The American      people have every reason to expect Congress to achieve the right      balance in defending their rights while advancing their security       but the Republican backed conference report fails to do that  said      Leahy  Last week Leahy      joined with the other Democratic Senate conferees on the bill         Senators Rockefeller  Kennedy  and Levin  in sending a letter to      the conference chairman  House Judiciary Committee Chairman James      Sensenbrenner  R Wis    and to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman      Arlen Specter  R Pa    urging a three month extension of the      expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act to give Congress more time to      craft a bipartisan compromise that could win broad support   Leahy was an      original co author of the USA PATRIOT Act  enacted in October 2001       just weeks after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  Several provisions      of the 2001 law are set to expire at the end of this year under      sunset provisions that Leahy and former House Majority Leader Dick      Armey  R Texas  included in the final version of the 2001 law  The      two teamed up on the sunset provisions as a way to improve      congressional oversight of the new powers given to the government       Earlier this      year  Leahy supported and voted for the bipartisan Senate version of      the USA PATRIOT Act renewal bill  which included several new      sunshine provisions advanced by Leahy  to improve oversight and      accountability  as well as continuing some of the 2001 laws sunset      provisions  The Senate bill won unanimous  bipartisan support       These and other Leahy proposed sunshine provisions are included in      the proposed compromise bill                   Leahys Statement On Introduction Of The Bill   Senator      Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Statement On Introduction Of A Bill     To Extend Expiring PATRIOT Act Powers     December 12  2005 Mr  LEAHY  On a September morning four years      ago nearly 3 000 lives were lost on American soil  and our lives as      Americans changed in an instant  In the aftermath of the 9 11      attacks  Congress moved swiftly to pass anti terrorism legislation       The fires were still smoldering at Ground Zero in New York City when      the USA PATRIOT Act became law on October 30  2001  just six weeks      after the attacks   Many of us here in the Senate today worked      together in a spirit of bipartisan unity and resolve to craft a bill      that we had hoped would make us safer as a Nation  Freedom and      security are always in tension in our society  and especially so in      those somber weeks after the attacks  and we tried our best to      strike the right balance  One of the fruits of that bipartisanship was      the PATRIOT Acts sunset      provisions  These key provisions set an expiration date of December      31  2005  on certain government powers that had great potential to      affect the civil liberties of the American people  Republican House      Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted on these sunsets to ensure      that Congress would revisit the PATRIOT Act within a few years and      consider refinements to protect the rights and liberties of all      Americans more effectively  and we prevailed  Sadly  the Bush Administration and the      Republican congressional leadership have squandered key      opportunities to improve the PATRIOT Act  The House Senate      conference report filed last week by Republican lawmakers falls      short of what the American people expect and deserve from us  The      bipartisan Senate bill  which the Senate Judiciary Committee and      then the Senate adopted unanimously  struck a far better balance  The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must      have the confidence of the American people  The Congress should not      rush ahead to enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is      within our power to extend  We owe it to the American people to get      this right  The way forward to a sensible and workable      bipartisan bill is clear  Today I am pleased to join with Senator      Sununu and others to introduce a bill to extend the sunsets on the      expiring PATRIOT Act powers until March 31  2006  Our bill also      extends for three months the so called lone wolf FISA surveillance      authority  which Congress enacted last year as part the Intelligence      Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act   The deadline that Congress imposed to ensure      oversight and accountability should not now become a barrier to      achieving bipartisan compromise and the best bill we can forge      together  This is a vital debate  and these are vital issues to all      Americans  If a brief extension is needed to produce a better bill      that will better serve all of our citizens  then by all means  let      us give ourselves that time
