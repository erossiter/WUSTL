       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On U S  Attorney Firings                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On U S  Attorney Firings    March 13  2007 The White House     and the Attorney General have dodged Congresss questions and ducked     accountability as if they still were dealing with a rubberstamp     Congress  They are discovering that those days are gone   I am outraged that     the Attorney General was less than forthcoming with the Senate while     under oath before the Judiciary Committee  It is deeply disturbing that     this plan appears to have originated from high ranking officials at the     White House and executed in secret with a complicit Department of     Justice   This is not how     justice is served  nor is it how our system of checks and balances is     designed to work  It is an abuse of power committed in secret to steer     certain outcomes in our justice system  and then to dust over the     tracks  The President of the United States and the Attorney General are     responsible for setting the moral standard for this Administration      Apparently this matter does not bother them but it does bother me  and     we will summon whoever we need in our hearings to get to the bottom of     this
