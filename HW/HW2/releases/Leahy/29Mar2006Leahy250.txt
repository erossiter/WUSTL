       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Passage Of The Legislative   Transparency And Accountability Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On Passage Of The Legislative Transparency And Accountability Act Of      2006     March 29  2006  I am pleased that  today  the Senate      has passed the Legislative      Transparency and Accountability Act of 2006  S  2349         the first lobbying reform bill enacted by Congress in over a      decade  This legislation takes an important step toward restoring      the publics confidence in Congress and in ending the culture of      corruption that  in recent years  has gained a corrosive grip on      aspects of the conduct of the publics business in the Nations      Capital  This legislation will create greater transparency in our      government  The bill will also strengthen the ethics and lobbying      disclosure rules that apply to Members of Congress and their staff       and to the lobbyists who interact with the Congress          The legislation will       Strengthen      the disclosure requirements for lobbyists under the Lobbying      Disclosure Act and double the maximum penalty for non compliance      with that Act      Require      mandatory ethics training for all Members and staff      Close      the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying industry by      extending the post employment lobbying ban to 2 years      Prohibit      lobbyists from offering gifts of travel  meals and tickets to      Members of Congress      Eliminate      floor privileges for former Members of Congress who are lobbyists      Require      that information about earmarks be publicly available over the      Internet at least 24 hours before being considered by the Senate      Create      a commission to evaluate the effectiveness of congressional ethics      rules      Require      annual audits and oversight of lobbying registration and reports      filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act   The unfolding public corruption      investigations involving lobbyist Jack Abramoff and a Member of the      other body  now resigned from his position and sentenced to prison       demonstrate that unethical conduct by public officials threatens to      undermine the publics confidence in their government  Because our      democracy and national security depend upon a healthy  efficient       and ethical government  the Senate has done the right thing by      moving quickly to pass much needed lobbying reforms   The American people expect  and      deserve  to be confident that their representatives in Congress      perform their legislative duties in a manner that is beyond reproach      and that is solely in the public interest  Today  the Senate has      taken an important step toward restoring the peoples trust in their      Congress  I hope that the House of Representatives will now also      act quickly to pass meaningful lobbying reform legislation
