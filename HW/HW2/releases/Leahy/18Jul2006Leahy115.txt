       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Stem Cell Research Offers Hope To  Millions                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Stem Cell Research Offers Hope To Millions     July 18  2006  I would like to take this      opportunity to offer my perspectives on the issue currently      being debated by the Senate  stem cell research  The debate      over this issue in the Senate is long overdue  The promise this      research holds for finding treatments or cures for diseases such      as Alzheimers  diabetes  Parkinsons  Lou Gehrigs Disease and      cancer is immeasurable    It has been five years since the      President announced his Administrations restrictive policy on      stem cell research  a policy that limited the number of stem      cell lines available for use with federal funding  All of these      lines are contaminated by the use of mouse feeder cells and will      likely never meet the standards required for human treatment       The United States leads the world in the medical expertise that      can find cures and treatments for these scourges  But it has      become abundantly clear that the Presidents restrictive policy      is hindering scientific progress toward the discovery in the      United States of possible cures and treatments for many fatal      diseases that affect millions of Americans  and millions more      around the world    More than a year ago  our      colleagues in the House passed legislation that would reverse      the Presidents limiting policy  Since then  as we have all      waited for the Senate to act  many more who suffer from      catastrophic illness and could have been helped by research of      this kind have passed away  Many of us are grieving the loss of      Dana Reeve  a vocal advocate for stem cell research  who lost      her battle with cancer last March  She and her husband       Christopher Reeve  had become two of the public faces in the      struggle for advancement of stem cell research     The Senate will vote on three stem      cell bills today  However  H R 810 is the only bill that will      give real reason for hope to millions of Americans and their      families  Take the case of a woman from my State of Vermont who      was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999  Forced to give      up her career as a musician because she could no longer use her      hands to play the piano  she began working as a clerk in a gift      store  only to have to give up that job because she had trouble      handling money and sometimes broke the items in the store  Her      plea to me  and really to all of us  is deeply moving  Listen      to her appeal  If there is any chance stem cell research might      help MS  it must be done  There is nothing else for MS patients      to look forward to    I would like to address two of the      arguments that opponents of this stem cell research offer      against the passage of H R 810  They contend that there is no      need for public funding of this research because private funds      are available in some situations  While there are private      dollars being used for embryonic stem cell research  public      funds are needed to spur on this research  to lead this research      effort to the cutting edge of progress  and to harness the work      of our National Institutes of Health  Public funding is also      needed to keep the United States competitive with other      countries in this arena    At the University of Vermont  for      example  researchers are using bone marrow stem cells to repair      damaged tissues in various organs  This work could be expanded      with the infusion of federal research dollars     A second misdirected argument is      that this embryonic stem cell research is not needed because      alternatives to embryonic research hold more promise than the      current method  Some argue that embryonic stem cell research is      not needed because it has not yielded any results  However       none of the proposed alternatives has proven successful for      deriving human stem cells  and there is no guarantee that any of      them ever will  While it is true that embryonic stem cell      research has not yet led to human therapies  it is important to      remember that this field is only in its infancy  This is      because President Bushs restrictions have prevented federally      funded investigators from fully exploring the potential of this      research   The President has indicated his      intent to veto H R 810 should the Senate pass this bill  I join      my colleagues in urging him not to use the first veto of his      Administration to block funding for this research  H R 810 is a      bill that has garnered support across the faith community and      across political lines  I respect those who raise concerns      grounded in what they believe are moral and ethical issues      surrounding this issue  I would assure them that this bill      contains provisions that will ensure donor consent for the use      of the embryos for medical research  The bill also maintains      that research on these stem cells will be conducted in an      ethical manner    Those who oppose stem cell      research seemingly ignore the fact that embryos used for this      research will be otherwise discarded  Women at fertility      clinics are given an option of what to do with unused fertilized      embryos  At the discretion of the donor  embryos can be      preserved  donated for medical research  or discarded  In the      United States  there are more than 400 000 frozen embryos which      are stored for infertile couples  and many ultimately will be      thrown away  The options of discarding these embryos or      allowing them to be used for life saving research would seem to      offer a clear choice to those on both sides of this debate        I am proud to be a cosponsor of      S 471 and I urge the Senate to pass the Stem Cell Research      Enhancement Act so we can begin realizing the promise of this      research
