       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Iraq National Guard Town Meeting Day   Resolutions                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On Iraq National Guard Town Meeting Day Resolutions        Wednesday  March 2  2005  The Vermont National Guard is second to        none  and Vermonters have sent more than our share of sons and daughters        into combat and have suffered more than our states share of losses  This        resolution has prompted the kind of constructive debate that should be        happening not only in Washington        but in every community in the country  and Vermonters again are setting a        good example of civic responsibility and participation  These votes signal        deep concerns about several aspects of this war  about how the nation was        led into it  and about the effects that extended call ups have on our        families and communities  Vermonters have led in promoting these community        level discussions  but Vermonters are united with Americans from coast to        coast who have similar concerns   As National Guard Caucus Co Chair in the        Senate I am going to continue to fight for the men and women of the        National Guard to keep them from being overextended and mistreated  That        also means working against unsound policies that lead to extended call ups        and ensuring that Guard members and their families have such critical        benefits as health insurance  It has meant the successful coalition I led        to shelve the Administrations talk of extending active duty Guard tours        beyond two years  and I intend to keep those plans blocked  And it means        continuing to press the Administration to correct the mistakes it has made        in the transition in Iraq to        minimize casualties and turn Iraq over to the Iraqis so that our troops can        come home sooner rather than later
