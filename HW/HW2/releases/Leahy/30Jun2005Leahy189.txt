       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Importance Of Senate   Consultation On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Importance Of Senate Consultation On Judicial Nominations     June 30  2005  Last week a number of Senators urged      the President  if a vacancy were to arise on the Supreme Court  to      consult with Senators from both parties  I commend  in particular       Senator Kennedy  a former Judiciary Committee chairman for his      perspective on this and thank him for his diligence in helping make      this essential point in his statements again this week     Forty four Senators sent the President      a joint letter urging consultation and a consensus nomination  In      addition  I understand that Senators Nelson and Salazar have also      urged consultation    Likewise the 14 Senators in the      bipartisan group that averted the nuclear option included strong      language in their agreement urging bipartisan consultation by the      President  They wrote        We believe that  under Article II  Section 2  of the United States      Constitution  the word Advice speaks to consultation between the      Senate and the President with regard to the use of the Presidents      power to make nominations  We encourage the Executive branch of      government to consult with members of the Senate  both Democratic      and Republican  prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the      Senate for consideration         Such a return to the early practices of our government may well      serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice      and consent process in the Senate        We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions      of the United States Senate that we as Senators seek to uphold   I agree  Bipartisan consultation is      consistent with the traditions of the Senate and would return us to      practices that have served the country well  They are right to urge      greater consultation on judicial nominations   Last week some on the other side of      the aisle criticized me for offering to help the President should a      Supreme Court vacancy arise  At the time  I said I stood ready to      work with President Bush to help him select a nominee to the Supreme      Court who can unite Americans  In spite of the unfair criticism  I      reiterate today my willingness to help  I have urged consultation      and cooperation for four years and have continued to reach out over      these last few weeks to the President  I hope that if a vacancy      does arise the President will finally turn away from his past      practices  consult with us and work with us    I am troubled by the divisive battle      lines being drawn by some right wing groups that have launched      attack ads in recent weeks  They attack Democratic Senators      generally and individually in advance of a vacancy or a nomination       The other side has established a new low by going negative in      advance and being critical in anticipation of a fight that I and      others here in the Senate are working to avoid  The partisan      activists supporting the White House have boasted for weeks about      their war chest of upwards of  20 million to be used to crush any      opposition to this White Houses selection  They have now chosen to      fire a nasty preemptive strike in what they intend to make all out      partisan political warfare    If the White House intends to follow      that plan  it will be most unfortunate  unwise and      counterproductive  I have urged  Democrats have urged a better      way  Though the landscape ahead is sown with the potential for      controversy and contention should a vacancy arise on the Supreme      Court  confrontation is unnecessary  Consensus should be our mutual      goal    I would hope that the Presidents      objective will not follow the path he has taken with so many      divisive circuit court nominees and send the Senate a Supreme Court      nominee so polarizing that confirmation is eked out in the narrowest      of margins  This would come at a steep and gratuitous price that      the entire nation would have to pay in needless division  It would      serve the country better to choose a qualified consensus candidate      who can be broadly supported by the public and by the Senate        The process will begin with the President  He is the only      participant in the process who can nominate candidates to fill      Supreme Court vacancies  If there is a vacancy  the decisions made      in the White House will determine whether the nominee chosen will      unite the nation or will divide the nation  The power to avoid      political warfare with regard to the Supreme Court is in the hands      of the President  Senate Democrats are not spoiling for a fight      however much partisans on the other side may be  The person who      will decide whether there will be a divisive or unifying process and      nomination is the President  If consensus is a goal  bipartisan      consultation will help achieve it  I believe that is what the      American people want and what they deserve         The Supreme Court should not be a wing of the Republican Party  nor      should it be an arm of the Democratic Party  If the right wing      activists convince the President to choose a divisive nominee  they      will not prevail without a difficult Senate battle  And if they do       what will they have wrought  The American people will be the      losers  The legitimacy of the judiciary will have suffered a      damaging blow from which it may not soon recover  Such a contest      would itself confirm that the Supreme Court is just another setting      for partisan contests and partisan outcomes  People will perceive      the federal courts as places in which the fix is in          I take the President at his word  He made a public commitment at a      press conference several weeks ago to consult with Democratic as      well as Republican Senators should a Supreme Court vacancy arise       If there were to be a vacancy  I look forward to consulting with the      President         Our Constitution establishes an independent federal judiciary to be      a bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of      power by the political branches  That independence is what makes      our judiciary the model for others around the world  That      independence is at grave risk when a president seeks to pack the      courts with activists from either side of the political spectrum       We need fair judges  not sure votes for a partisan agenda     The American people will cheer if the      President chooses someone who unifies the nation  This is not the      time and a vacancy on this Supreme Court is not the setting in which      to accentuate the political and ideological division within our      country  In our lifetimes  there has never been a greater need for      a unifying pick for the Supreme Court  At a time when too many      partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to force the Senate to      confirm the most extreme candidate with the least number of votes      possible  Democratic Senators are urging cooperation and      consultation to bring the country together  There is no more      important opportunity than this to lead the nation in a direction of      cooperation and unity         The independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our      American concept of justice for all  We all want Justices who      exhibit the kind of fidelity to the law that we all respect  We      want them to have a strong commitment to our shared constitutional      values of individual liberties and equal protection  We expect them      to have had a demonstrated record of commitment to equal rights       There are many conservatives who can meet these criteria and who are      not rigid ideologues    This is a difficult time for our      country and we face many challenges  The President addressed the      Nation about the difficult situation in  Iraq just this week       We need to confront the truth about the situation in Iraq and      develop a concrete strategy rather than the swaggering rhetoric we      hear so much of lately  We need to do more about the rising gas      prices and health care costs that burden so many Americans  We need      to improve the economic prospects of Americans  We need to work      together to defend against real threats  the proliferation of      nuclear weapons  and disruption of critical food  water  energy and      information services  It is my hope that we can work together on      many issues important to the American people  including maintaining      a fair and independent judiciary  I am confident that a smooth      nomination and confirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan      basis if we work together  The American people we represent and      serve are entitled to no less   Justice Thomas remarked this past      Tuesday on the winds of controversy swirling       about the      imagined resignations from the Supreme Court   We were      all reminded  again  this week of the humanity of the Chief Justice      of the United States Supreme Court  He concluded this years term      with dignity  humour and steadfastness  Despite the rampant      speculation that continued this week   I know that the Chief Justice will      retire when he decides that he should  not before  He has earned      that right after serving on the Supreme Court for more than 30      years  the last 19 as the Chief Justice  I have great respect and      affection for him and he is in our prayers
