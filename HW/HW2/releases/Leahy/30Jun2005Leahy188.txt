       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Central American Free Trade   Agreement                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Central American Free Trade Agreement     June 30  2005 Mr  President  I      cannot in good conscience support the CAFTA agreement as proposed by      the Administration  I reviewed this agreement carefully and      evaluated the arguments of both sides  Exports play a central role      in the economy of my home state of Vermont  where some of the finest      specialized goods in the world are made  from computer chips to      cheese  Free and fair trade benefits us as Vermonters  and it      benefits the country  I have often voted in favor of various trade      agreements  including NAFTA and recent bilateral trade accords with      Jordan  Singapore  and Chile   I strongly believe      free trade and the agreements that facilitate it will be critical to      the well being of my state and our country in the years ahead  But      we have a responsibility to ourselves and those we trade with to      make sure these agreements are soundly predicated  are fair to both      sides  are constructed to advance the interests of the many and not      just a few  and that they will protect the environment upon which we      all ultimately depend  I do not believe this trade agreement      adequately meets these tests  and I cannot  in good conscience vote for      CAFTA   I have great      respect for some of Central America s leaders who favor this      agreement  I know they have the interests of their countries at      heart  But I believe they overstate the positive effects this      agreement would have and give too little weight to negative      effects  The weak labor and environmental provisions of this      agreement will do little to help the hardworking men and women of      Latin American  and in fact may make their already difficult lives      even harder and more dangerous   I also believe      that this agreement is a diversion from the larger trade issues that      will make a real difference for the long term health of our own      economy  This deal should be carefully and conscientiously      re negotiated to adequately address these pressing concerns  There has been a      lot of ink spilled from the Administration and from groups      representing particular interests arguing that CAFTA will be a      significant boost to the U S  economy  When you are talking about      Central American economies that have a combined Gross Domestic      Product of a medium sized U S  city  this argument just does not      carry weight  Yes  U S  consumers might be able to buy some Central      American exports at a cheaper price  And  yes  U S  manufacturers      might gain greater access to these markets  But these countries are      so small that the impact on the U S  economy will be negligible       For instance  this agreement would help the dairy producers in my      home state of Vermont only marginally  at the very best    We all know that      when we talk about trade  what makes a real difference for the      economy is trade with our larger trading partners  Europe  the      NAFTA countries of Canada and Mexico  several Far East Asian      countries    but  above all  China  Yet we have an enormous trade      deficit with China today that threatens interest rates and the      strength of the dollar   China has      maintained an artificially low exchange rate  removed voluntary      export quotas  and continually infringed on international patents      and copyrights  It does not seem that this Administration has any      strategy for dealing with these unfair trade practices  let alone      with the fact that Chinas G D P  is growing at almost 10 percent      every year and will challenge us economically in the decades ahead       It is a wonder to me that the Administration is seeking trade      agreements that are not part of a comprehensive strategy to deal      with this kind of continually escalating foreign competition    While this      agreement will not make much difference for our economy  it is      likely to have significant negative impacts on the countries of      Central America  and we should be concerned for the people of those      impoverished countries  Over the past several decades       dictatorships  civil wars and fierce class struggles have buffeted      the region  particularly during the Cold War when the larger      geopolitical struggle  in which we were a central player         exploited and heightened these local tensions  These countries have      set out on a new  democratic path over the past year  and our      foreign policy should encourage these favorable developments       Unfortunately  the weak labor and environmental laws of these      countries and the complete failure of this agreement to elevate and      strengthen those standards ensures that any growth that rises out of      the agreement is unlikely to translate into significant real gains      for everyday workers and the broader population   Under CAFTA       participating countries are only forced to abide by their own often      weak and rarely enforced labor laws  Sadly  an oligarchic culture      persists in these countries  whereby wealthy business and landowners      rarely trickle down profits to the hardworking men and women who do      the work  Without stronger labor provisions that provide increased      benefits and protections to workers  CAFTA will do little to change      that culture   A recent World      Bank report on the agreement found that Central American countries      will have to boost spending for schools and rural infrastructure to      take full advantage of the agreements benefits  Those investments      are not realistically forthcoming  and this Administration has not      shown a serious commitment to supporting this type of development in      those nations to make up the difference  This is a lost      opportunity  At the same time  CAFTA will displace poor subsistence      farmers who will abandon their land and follow in the footsteps of      those who have come illegally to the United States in search of      employment  And CAFTA will contribute to ongoing environmental      problems associated with manufacturing and the pesticides used in      large scale agriculture  I urge the      President to send his trade negotiating team back down to Central      America to rework this deal  We need a better agreement that      reaches the so called Jordan Standard  including the strong labor      and environmental provisions of the United States Jordan Bilateral      Free Trade Agreement that we ratified a few years ago   More importantly       I hope the President will deal with the mounting pile of economic      and trade problems that really do have profound consequences for our      economy and the living standards of the American people  Lets come      up with a broader approach to trade that addresses unfair trading      practices  that reduces our ballooning trade deficit  that boosts      our economy  and that protects the environment and the rights of      workers  I look forward to working with this or any other      Administration on these challenges  I cannot cast a vote for an      agreement like this that over promises and under delivers to the      workers of our own country and to the people of Central America
