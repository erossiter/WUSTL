       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Consideration Of The Public   Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman     Senate Judiciary Committee On Committee Consideration Of      The Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of     2007    October 25  2007 Today  the Committee has the opportunity to consider the     bipartisan Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act of 2007  a     bill that I introduced with Senator Cornyn to strengthen and clarify key     aspects of federal criminal law and provide new tools to help law     enforcement attack public corruption nationwide       Congress took an important step in restoring Americans faith in their     elected officials earlier this year by passing long awaited ethics and     lobbying reforms to tighten restrictions on those of us who hold public     office  as well as those who seek to lobby us on behalf of private     industry  But rooting out the kinds of rampant public corruption we have     seen in recent years requires us to go further  and to give law     enforcement the resources it needs to effectively investigate and     prosecute public corruption crimes       The most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing our own     rules  Bribery and extortion  in all branches and at all levels of     government  are committed by people bent on getting around the rules and     banking that they will not get caught  These offenses are very difficult     to detect and even harder to prove  Because they attack the core of our     democracy  these offenses must be found out and punished  Congress must     send a strong signal that it will not tolerate this corruption by     providing better tools for federal investigators and prosecutors to     combat it  This bill will do exactly that       The bill will improve the prosecution of public corruption offenses in     three ways  First  it gives investigators and prosecutors more time and     resources to effectively enforce existing anti corruption laws       The bill extends the statute of limitations for the most serious public     corruption offenses       The bill would also provide significant and much needed additional     funding for public corruption enforcement  FBI Director Mueller has said     recently that public corruption is now among the FBIs top investigative     priorities  but a September 2005 report by the Department of Justice     Inspector General found that  from 2000 to 2004  there was an overall     reduction in public corruption matters handled by the FBI  More     recently  a study by the research group Transactional Records Access     Clearinghouse  TRAC  found that the prosecution of all kinds of white     collar crimes is down 27 percent since 2000  and official corruption     cases have dropped in the same period by 14 percent  Manpower and     funding shortages have caused these declines       The bill goes further by amending several key statutes to broaden their     application in corruption and fraud contexts  This series of fixes will     prevent corrupt public officials and their accomplices from evading or     defeating prosecution  And it raises the statutory maximum penalties for     several statutes dealing with official misconduct  including theft of     government property and bribery    This bipartisan bill has received the support of the Department of     Justice  as well as from a wide array of public interest groups that     have long advocated for vigorous enforcement of our fraud and public     corruption laws  including the Campaign Legal Center  Common Cause      Democracy 21  the League of Women Voters  Public Citizen  and U S  PIRG          If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct     that we have recently witnessed in high profile public corruption cases      Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give investigators and     prosecutors the tools and resources they need to enforce our laws  I     hope all Members will join Senator Cornyn and me in supporting this bill     so that the Committee can promptly report it to the Senate
