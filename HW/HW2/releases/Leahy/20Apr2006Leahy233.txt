Administration      On Inquiry Of GOP Phone Jamming Scandal  Senators Inquire About Investigation Amid New      Information     On Abramoff And White House Links     To Republican Plot To Prevent Elderly  Sick To Get To Polls WASHINGTON       Thursday  April 20   Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Edward      Kennedy  D Mass   sent the following letter Thursday to Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales seeking answers to questions about the Bush      Administrations involvement and investigation into a Republican      phone jamming scheme during the 2002 elections in New Hampshire       Recent published reports suggest that the local GOPs plot to block      an effort by the New Hampshire Democratic Party and the Manchester      Professional Fire Fighters Association to help elderly  sick and      low income voters get to the polls could have involved disgraced GOP      lobbyist Jack Abramoff as well as officials working in the White      House at the time   Leahy  the      Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee  and Kennedy  a senior      member of the panel  asked Gonzales if the Bush Administration is      investigating the new  troubling allegations  and to provide them      with information on any such inquiry by May 1  Leahy and Kennedy      have closely followed developments in the case and in 2004 wrote to      then Attorney General Ashcroft about earlier developments  Following is      the text of the letter  A      version is also      available            April 20  2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales  We are deeply troubled by recent media reports      on the outrageous campaign tactics used by the Republican Party      during the 2002 elections in New Hampshire   In the months leading up to the election  the      New Hampshire Democratic Party and the Manchester Professional Fire      Fighters Association organized an effort to assist elderly  sick       and low income voters in getting to their polling places      Telephone contact numbers were established for these persons      to call on election day to request transportation  On the morning      of the election  however  the phone lines were jammed by hundreds of      outside calls  apparently placed at the direction of a telemarketing      firm hired by the New Hampshire Republican Party  This appalling      dirty tricks effort became the subject of both civil and criminal      litigation  The New Hampshire Democratic Party filed a civil      lawsuit in state court seeking damages and an injunction to prevent      Republican Party officials from engaging in any further interference      with the right of New Hampshire citizens to vote   We previously wrote to former Attorney General      John Ashcroft about this matter in October  2004  requesting      information about reports that the Department of Justice was      attempting to halt discovery in the lawsuit challenging the unlawful      campaign tactics  Attorney General Ashcroft explained the      Departments actions in the case  and assured us that the Department      would aggressively pursue an investigation of these campaign      practices  A federal criminal investigation was ultimately      commenced of the extent of high ranking Republican officials       involvement in the deliberate phone jamming tactic  Guilty pleas      were entered by GOP political consultant Alan Raymond  and the      former Executive Director of the New Hampshire Republican State      Committee  Charles McGee  who both admitted their participation in      the phone jamming conspiracy  In December  2005  James Tobin  the      former New England Regional Director of the Republican National      Committee  was convicted for his involvement in the phone jamming      scheme  Current media reports are raising the      possibility that involvement in the phone jamming scandal reaches      higher than Mr  Tobin  and that others  including Jack Abramoff and      his Indian tribe clients    possibly were involved in this scandal       These reports indicate that the Senate Majority Project  after      examining the phone records produced in Mr  Tobin s case  discovered      that at the same time he was implementing the phone jamming scheme       Mr  Tobin also made dozens of calls to the office of political      affairs in the White House  Ken Mehlman  the Republican National      Committee chairman who also was the White House political director      at the time  insists that close contact of this kind between      political operatives is the norm on Election Day  and that none of      the calls mentioned the jamming scheme   We believe that the public has a      right to know all that happened and who else was involved in the      scheme to disenfranchise New Hampshire voters  Please let us know no      later than May 1  2006   1  whether the latest allegations      involving Mr  Abramoff and Mr  Mehlman are being investigated  and      if so  by whom   2  whether you or anyone in the White House      Counsels Office made any inquiry or investigation into this      incident while you were the White House Counsel  or was otherwise      involved in it    3  whether you are currently involved in any      aspect of this investigation  or have recused yourself  and  if the      latter  who is in charge of the matter  and  4  whether the Office      of the Inspector General or the Office of Professional      Responsibility has been asked to investigate or has otherwise opened      a file on the matter and  if so  whether either office has issued an      informal or formal report to you on any aspect of the New Hampshire      phone jamming scheme  and what the disposition of any such report      was  If there are any documents      reflecting or relating to any of the answers to these questions  we      request that we be provided with copies of them by May 1  With respect and appreciation  we      look forward to hearing from you   Sincerely  Patrick Leahy       Edward M  Kennedy     UNITED STATES SENATOR  UNITED STATES SENATOR
