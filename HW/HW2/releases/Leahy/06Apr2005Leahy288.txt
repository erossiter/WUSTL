       Leahy And Snowe Offer Bill To Cut Mercury Pollution  Children And   Pregnant Women At Highest Risk                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Leahy And Snowe Offer Bill     To Cut Mercury Pollution  Children     And Pregnant Women At Highest Risk WASHINGTON  Wednesday  April 6   On the heels of     recent revelations of EPAs hiding information about the health effects     of mercury exposure  Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Olympia Snowe      R Maine  Wednesday introduced a comprehensive bill to control mercury     emissions from coal fired power plants and other sources  Leahy highlighted the gap between the tougher     standards of his Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act and the     Administrations mercury proposal that was finalized by the     Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  on March 15   The Administration persists in siding with big     polluters against the health interests of the American people  said     Leahy  It is clear that the Administration is not going to follow the     Clean Air Act and protect women and children from this toxic pollutant      Our bill offers the protection the public expects and deserves  both     from the mercury spewing out of power plants  and also from other major     sources  Mercury is among the least controlled and most     dangerous toxins threatening pregnant women and children in America     today  said Snowe  Because mercury pollution knows no borders  we     must institute a sensible national approach to better control its use      Our bill takes action where EPAs new mercury rule does not  it     requires every coal fired power plant to reduce its emissions  which is     the only way to reduce dangerously high concentrations of mercury in     Maine and other parts of the country  The Leahy Snowe bill would reduce the annual 48     tons of mercury emissions from coal fired power plants by 90 percent by     2010  The Administrations mercury proposal would only reduce mercury     emissions by 22 percent by 2010  The Vermont senator said that falls     far short of the Leahy Snowe proposal  of current law and even of the     Administrations previous position  The Leahy Snowe bill would reduce mercury releases     from all sources  including commercial and industrial boilers  chlor alkali     plants and cement plants  It also would require labeling of     mercury containing products to reduce mercury in the waste stream                      See     following summary for more information        Overview Of S 730    The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act Of 2005    Sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy And Olympia Snowe  What will the Omnibus     Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 do   The Omnibus Mercury     Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 mandates substantial reductions in     mercury emissions from all major sources in the United States  It is     the only comprehensive legislation to control mercury emissions from all     major sources  It directs EPA to issue new standards for unregulated     sources and to monitor and report on the progress of currently regulated     sources  It sets an aggressive timetable for these reductions so that     mercury emissions are reduced as soon as possible  With these emissions     reductions  the bill requires the safe disposal of mercury recovered     from pollution control systems  so that the hazards of mercury are not     merely transferred from one environmental medium to another  It     requires annual public reporting    in both paper and electronic form        of facility specific mercury emissions  It phases out mercury use in     consumer products  requires product labeling  and mandates international     cooperation  It supports research into the retirement of excess mercury      the handling of mercury waste  the effectiveness of fish consumption     advisories  and the magnitude of previously uninventoried sources   Section 3  Mercury emission standards for fossil     fuel fired electric utility steam generating units  The EPAs Mercury Study     Report to Congress estimated 52 tons of mercury emissions occur per year     from coal  and oil fired electric utility steam generating units  More     recently  an EPA inventory estimated 48 tons of mercury from coal fired     power plants  Collectively  these power plants constitute the largest     source of mercury emissions in the United States  In December 2000  the     EPA issued a positive determination to regulate these mercury     emissions  But these rules will take years to write and implement  and     there is already vigorous industry opposition  It is uncertain what     form these rules will take or how long they may be delayed  This     section requires EPA to set a    Amaximum     achievable control technology  MACT  standard for these emissions  such     that nationwide emissions decrease by at least 90 percent   Section 4  Mercury emission standards for coal      and oil fired commercial and industrial boiler units  The EPAs report on its study estimates that 29     tons of mercury is emitted per year from coal  and oil fired commercial     and industrial boiler units  This section requires EPA to set a MACT     standard for these mercury emissions  such that nationwide emissions     decrease by at least 90 percent    Section 5  Reduction of mercury emissions from     solid waste incineration units  The EPA study estimates     that 30 tons of mercury emissions are released each year from municipal     waste combustors  These emissions result from the presence of     mercury containing items such as fluorescent lamps  fever thermometers      thermostats and switches  in municipal solid waste streams  In 1995      EPA promulgated final rules for these emissions  and these rules took     effect in 2000  This section reaffirms those rules and requires     stricter rules for units that do not comply  The most effective way to     reduce mercury emissions from incinerators is to reduce the volume of     mercury containing items before they reach the incinerator  That is why     this section also requires the separation of mercury containing items     from the waste stream  the labeling of mercury containing items to     facilitate this separation  and the phase out of mercury in consumer     products within three years  allowing for the possibility of exceptions     for essential uses   Section 6  Mercury emission standards for chlor alkali     plants  The EPA study estimates     that 7 tons of mercury emissions are released per year from chlor alkali     plants that use the mercury cell process to produce chlorine  EPA has     not issued rules to regulate these emissions  This section requires     each chlor alkali plant that uses the mercury cell process to reduce its     mercury emissions by 95 percent  The most effective way to meet this     standard would be to switch to the more energy efficient membrane cell     process  which many plants already use   Section 7  Mercury emission standards for Portland     cement plants  The EPA study estimates     that 5 tons of mercury emissions are released each year from Portland     cement plants  In 1999 EPA promulgated final rules for emissions from     cement plants  but these rules did not include mercury  This section     requires each Portland cement plant to reduce its mercury emissions by     95 percent   Section 8  Report on implementation of mercury     emission standards for medical waste incinerators  The EPA study estimates     that 16 tons of mercury emissions are released per year from medical     waste incinerators  In 1997 EPA issued final rules for emissions from     hospital medical infectious waste incinerators  This section requires     EPA to report on the success of these rules in reducing these mercury     emissions   Section 9  Report on implementation of mercury     emission standards for hazardous waste combustors  The EPA study estimates     that 7 tons of mercury emissions are released each year from hazardous     waste incinerators  In 1999 EPA promulgated final rules for these     emissions  This section requires EPA to report on the success of these     rules in reducing these mercury emissions   Section 10  Defense activities  This section requires the     Department of Defense to report on its use of mercury  including the     steps it is taking to reduce mercury emissions and to stabilize and     recycle discarded mercury  This section also prohibits the Department     of Defense from returning the nearly 5 000 tons of mercury in the     National Defense Stockpile to the global market   Section 11  International activities  This section directs EPA     to work with Canada and Mexico to study mercury pollution in North     America  including the sources of mercury pollution  the pathways of the     pollution  and options for reducing the pollution   Section 12  Mercury research  This section supports a     variety of mercury research projects  First  it promotes accountability     by mandating an interagency report on the effectiveness of this act in     reducing mercury pollution  Second  it mandates an EPA study on mercury     sedimentation trends in major bodies of water  Third  it directs EPA to     evaluate and improve state level mercury data and fish consumption     advisories  Fourth  it mandates a National Academy of Sciences report     on the retirement of excess mercury  such as stockpiled industrial     mercury that is no longer needed due to plant closures or process     changes  Fifth  it mandates an EPA study of mercury emissions from     electric arc furnaces  a source not studied in the EPA s     study report  Finally  it authorizes  2 000 000 for modernization and     expansion of the Mercury Deposition Network  plus  10 000 000 over ten     years for operational support of that network
