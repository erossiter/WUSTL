       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The White House Letter Regarding   Executive Privilege Claim                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On White House Letter Regarding Executive Privilege Claim     July 9  2007  WASHINGTON  Monday  July      9   The White House      today to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt        reiterating its assertion of executive privilege in response to      congressional subpoenas  but declining to provide a complete basis      for its assertion  Below is Chairman Leahys comment on the      letter   This is more      stonewalling from a White House that believes it can unilaterally      control the other co equal branches of government What is the White      House trying to hide by refusing to turn over evidence it was      willing to provide months ago as long as that information was shared      in secret with no opportunity for Congress to pursue the matter      further  The White Houses      refusal to properly justify its basis for this executive privilege      claim raises questions about the validity of its assertion  There is      sworn testimony from the Attorney General  the Deputy Attorney      General and other senior Justice Department officials that the      President was not involved in the decision making that led to the      unprecedented firings of several well performing prosecutors  which      is the subject of our congressional inquiries  It is unfortunate      that the White House is trying to interfere with Ms  Taylors      testimony before the Senate and with Congresss responsibility to      get to the truth behind the unprecedented firings of several U S       Attorneys  There is clear evidence that Ms  Taylor was one of      several White House officials who played a key role in these firings      and the Administrations response to cover up the reasons behind      them when questions first arose  There is also clear evidence that      Ms  Taylor was part of more than 66 000 RNC e mails that have been      kept hidden from the public as part of a White House wide effort to      avoid oversight by ignoring the laws meant to ensure a public record      of official government business   The White House      continues to try to have it both ways  to block Congress from      talking with witnesses and accessing documents and other evidence      while saying nothing improper occurred  I hope the White House      stops this stonewalling and accepts my offer to negotiate a workable      solution to the Committees oversight requests  as so many previous      White Houses have done throughout history
