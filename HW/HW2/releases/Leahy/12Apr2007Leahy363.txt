Investigation Of Lost White House E Mails WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 12   Senator Patrick Leahy     D Vt    Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and the panels Ranking    Member  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    Thursday sent a letter to White House    counsel Fred Fielding seeking a swift investigation into missing e mails of    several White House officials   The Senate and House Judiciary Committees have sought    e mails from the White House as part of ongoing investigations into the    firing and replacement of U S  Attorneys last year   According to White House officials  some of the    unaccounted for e mails could include those relating to the congressional    investigations  The text of the letter is below  A    is also available   April 12  2007  Fred Fielding  Esq    Counsel to the President   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  Fielding   We are troubled to learn through the press    that the White House cannot account for the e mails of almost two dozen    people at the White House  including some the Senate Judiciary has asked to    question in connection with our ongoing investigation  Apparently these    officials utilized e mail accounts  addresses and equipment provided by the    Republican National Committee and political campaigns to communicate about    the plan to replace a number of United States Attorneys  As you know  by    letter dated March 28  2007  the Chairmen of both the House and Senate    Judiciary Committees wrote to you asking that you collect and produce    e mails and documents sent from all e mail accounts  addresses and domains    relevant to these investigations  and made specific reference to the use of    such political e mail addresses  The    comments of two White House officials  which were cited in todays edition    of the Washington Post  raise    questions about whether the White House will be able to comply with the    March 28 letter  White House spokesman Scott Stanzel reportedly stated      t he White House has not at this point done a good enough job at    overseeing the practices of staff with political e mail accounts  and    confirmed that  s ome officials  e mails have potentially been lost and    that is a mistake that the White House is aggressively working to fix     The second official who was cited  a White House lawyer who spoke on    condition of anonymity  told the press at a briefing that White House staff    is now being advised that if they question whether an e mail is political or    official  the staff should use their private accounts  but also preserve a    copy to be sent to White House lawyers for a determination of whether the    e mail needs to be saved under the Presidential Records Act  In    light of these comments by White House officials  we would like to know what    is being done to investigate and remedy this situation  For example  we    would like to know if the process described above by the anonymous White    House lawyer is intended to apply prospectively only or if staff is also    being advised that they should forward past e mails from their private    accounts to White House lawyers for review  Additionally  in reference to    the statement that the White House has not       done a good enough job at    overseeing practices regarding e mail accounts  we would like to know what    was done in the past and whether any private e mail retention policies were    in place  We would also like to know how and when the White House first    learned of the problem with private e mail account usage and when it first    came to light that e mails may have been lost    We recognize that the White House must and    should investigate this matter in a timely fashion  We also recognize that    the congressional committees of jurisdiction have a separate obligation to    investigate  To accommodate our separate obligations without slowing down    or otherwise complicating the others efforts  we suggest that the White    House consult with us and the other congressional committees engaged in    affected investigations and that we jointly agree upon a fair and objective    process for investigating this matter  including the use of a mutually    trusted computer forensic expert  Such a process would help to restore    public confidence in the White Houses desire to comply with the    Presidential Records Act  Moreover  it would ensure your office and the    Congress that this matter is being taken seriously and that an objective    process is employed to investigate  retrieve and reconstruct the information    that is reportedly missing due to deleted or otherwise unretained e mails      Sincerely   PATRICK    LEAHY  ARLEN SPECTER   Chairman    Ranking Member
