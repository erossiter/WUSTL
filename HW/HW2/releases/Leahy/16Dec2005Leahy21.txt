       Reaction Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The Senate Vote Against   Cloture On The PATRIOT Act Conference Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Reaction Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      To The Senate Vote Against Cloture      On The PATRIOT Act Conference Report      News Conference  Senate Radio TV Gallery      Friday  December 16  2005  I thank my colleagues on this       platform and others who have been part of this effort  and I       salute their courage    Few members of the Senate have       believed more strongly than I that a consensus  bipartisan       PATRIOT Act would be good for the country and for our security        I have worked hard toward that goal  In 2001 I headed the       Senates negotiations on the original PATRIOT Act  I was the       bills chief Senate sponsor and floor manager  Though it was       not the bill I would have written  I was proud of the checks and       balances that we included in the bill    The sunset provisions  the very       reason we are having this debate and this re evaluation of the       PATRIOT Act  are in there because Dick Armey and I fought for       them and included them in the final bill    I also worked hard for the       bipartisan bill we produced in the Senate  and even after       Democratic conferees were excluded from the writing of the       conference report  I worked hard to make it again into a       consensus  bipartisan bill  Several of the changes I fought for       were included since Thanksgiving week  when a so called final       agreement was first announced  and I appreciate especially       Chairman Specter for working with me for those changes   Checks and balances  judicial       review and congressional oversight are vital ingredients in       ensuring that new powers given to government are used  and never       abused  It is all the more understandable why the American       people have increasingly seen it this way too  when you pick up       the paper on a day like today and read about eavesdropping on       Americans without court approval   Our goal has been to mend the       PATRIOT Act  not to end it  The best solution is to just fix       the bill  We can do that before we adjourn next week  if       theyll let us  I am ready at this moment  and as long as it       takes  to work to make this a better bill  and a consensus bill   Why NOT go the extra mile for a       fully bipartisan  consensus bill   The tension between security and       liberty is always present in a free society  and all the more so       after 9 11  It is our job to strike the right balance  and to       help maintain the American peoples trust in their government in       using the new powers that we give to our government     We have inherited a sacred trust       of freedom  bought with the courage of the Founders and secured       by the blood of countless Americans since then  Ben Franklin       spoke for us and for the ages when he said that those who would       trade their liberty  for security  deserve neither  It is up to       each new generation to defend those hard won liberties        Striking the right balance in this bill will not be difficult to       do  if we will only make it a priority to do it
