       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On ABA Task Force s Initial Report On   Presidential Bill Signing Statements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   D Vt        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On The ABA Task Forces Initial Report      On Presidential Bill Signing Statements     July 24  2006 The      Presidents signing statements are not the law  and Congress  even      a Republican controlled Congress    should not allow them to be the      last word  The Presidents constitutional duty is to faithfully      execute the laws as written by the Congress  not cherry pick the      laws he deems fit to follow  For several      years now  this President has been systematically abusing      after the fact statements to rewrite laws and expand and remove      checks on his authority  This surreptitious power grab is an      unacceptable threat to our constitutional system of checks and      balances  and the ABAs initial review lends support to the very      real concerns that I  and others in Congress  have expressed for      some time
