       Department Of Justice Official Schlozman Reverses Testimony Before   Judiciary Panel  Corrects Role In Voter Fraud Case                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Department Of Justice     Official Schlozman    Reverses Testimony Before Judiciary Panel     Corrects Role In Voter Fraud Case   WASHINGTON  Tuesday  June 12         Bradley Schlozman  former interim U S  Attorney for the Western     District of Missouri  and former Acting Assistant Attorney General for     the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice      to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt      correcting his testimony before the panel during a hearing last week on     issues relating to the politicization of the Department of Justice and     the firing and replacement of several federal prosecutors     Comment of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On Bradley Schlozmans Letter     Clarifying His Congressional Testimony     June 12  2007  It is deeply     troubling that after weeks of preparation Mr  Schlozman appears to have     misled the Committee and the public about his decision to file an     election eve lawsuit in direct conflict with longstanding Justice     Department policy  I asked him repeatedly about this case at the     hearing because of concerns that it was done to use law enforcement     power improperly to affect the outcome of the election  which is the     reason the Department instituted the policy as a safeguard against such     manipulation   This Justice     Department and this Administration already suffer from a severe     credibility crisis  and learning that yet another senior official was     less than forthcoming during his testimony before Congress does little     to restore any of the lost trust or eroding confidence in their     leadership  It is difficult to get to the facts when Administration     officials fail to come clean  but the Committee will continue to pursue     the truth behind this matter                  Excerpts     from CQ Transcript of 6 5 07 Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing  LEAHY  What about a role in the     timing of the filing or prosecution of any lawsuit  Did you ever talk to     anybody that this may affect an election one way or the other     SCHLOZMAN  I don t recall making any     comment    And  again  I did what I did at the     direction of the Public Integrity Section    LEAHY  Well  and at your     instigation  You could have also just followed the manual and waited a     couple weeks  could you not have    SCHLOZMAN  Well  I       LEAHY  Would it have affected the     prosecution  would it have affected your ability to bring the     prosecution if you had just waited a few weeks until the election was     over    SCHLOZMAN  The Department of Justice does     not time prosecutions to elections    LEAHY  Well  yes  they do  That s     what the manual says  And you  rather reluctantly  I felt  admitted you     actually did read it when you became the interim U S  attorney     The fact is  would it have changed the     outcome of your prosecution had you waited a few weeks to bring it       SCHLOZMAN  I don t know  I doubt there     would have been any impact on the actual prosecution    Again  I acted at the direction of the     Public Integrity                   FEINSTEIN  OK    I wanted to ask a few follow up question     on the ACORN indictments  Senator Leahy asked you about them     As you know  the four workers voluntarily     turned over evidence to investigators and they were cooperating fully     with the investigation  And yet you went ahead and shortly before that     election  you brought these indictments    FEINSTEIN  And on page 61 of this book      it is rather clear that that is effectively a no no    Why did you do that    SCHLOZMAN  Senator  I acted at the     direction of the director of the Election Crimes Branch in the Public     Integrity Section    We asked whether he wanted us to go     forward or delay until after the election  and he said  Go forward  in     e mail traffic    FEINSTEIN  And who was that that ordered     you to go forward    SCHLOZMAN  Craig Donsanto  the head     of the Elections Crime Branch                    SCHUMER  Wait a minute     He didn t even read the document  All he     had to do was see that this was a few weeks before the election  and you     don t do it    Those of us    I m not a U S  attorney      But those of us who are around elections and the system of justice know     that those are the rules    And no one before I heard has come up with     the tortured explanation that you did to Senator Leahy that this isn t     going to deter a voter from voting  That s not the point of this  The     point of it is it might influence an election  Isn t that right   SCHLOZMAN  Senator  I did not think     it was going to influence the election at all  And I contacted       SCHUMER  But that s not your judgment      You used your own judgment  being 35 years of age  not having a wide     range of experience here  and you overruled something that is very     explicit in the book  in the manual  Right  Isn t that what you did       SCHLOZMAN  I got my    I got my     direction from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of     Justice                    FEINSTEIN  Of course  you can     understand how some of us might feel that it s politically directed   SCHLOZMAN  Senator  I m not aware     that the state was ever    I mean  these are violations of a federal     statute  the anti fraud provision of the National Voter Registration     Act  So I m not aware that the county prosecutor s office was ever even     looking at this    ACORN certainly did send a letter to the     county prosecutor  And then the next day  the Kansas City Board of     Elections commissioner sent a letter to the FBI  to the U S  attorney s     office and I think also to the county prosecutor    But I m not aware that the county was ever     even looking at this    FEINSTEIN  So you re saying  then      the only decision you made was the decision to file an indictment prior     to the election    SCHLOZMAN  At the direction of the     Public Integrity Section  yes
