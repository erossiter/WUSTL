       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Republican Filibuster Of Amendment To   Restore Habeas Protections                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comments Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Republican Filibuster Of Amendment To Restore Habeas Protections     September 19  2007   The vote today showed that a majority      of the Senate supports our efforts to correct the historic mistake      made in last years Military Commissions Act  but there is still      more work to be done to overcome the Republican filibuster  Like      the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II  the      elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear  and it      was a stain on Americas reputation in the world    This bipartisan initiative has      brought together Americans who call themselves conservatives       Americans who call themselves liberals  or libertarians  or      evangelicals  or independents  and I am proud to be associated with      them in this effort  We will continue to work for what is right and      what is just    Senator Specter and I came to this      Floor to offer this amendment back on July 10  when this bill was      initially being considered  and thereafter  I thank him for his      work in this effort  I also want to express my appreciation to      Majority Leader Reid  Chairman Carl Levin  Senator Dodd  Senator      Menendez  Senator Bingaman  and others who have participated in or      facilitated this debate   We have brought this to the Senate      Floor not because it is politically easy or popular  but because it      is the right thing to do  This has been a debate that has invoked      constitutional principles  legal precepts  Latin phrases  and      historical precedents  This is an issue that lends itself to      politically provocative distortions  Constitutional principles need      our defense not so much when it is popular to do so  as when it may      not be popular or easy to do   It is difficult to defend the higher      ground by taking the lower road  The world knows what our enemies      stand for  The world also knows what this country has tried to      stand for and live up to  in the best of times  and the worst of      times   It is from strength that America      should defend our values and our way of life  It is from the      strength of our freedoms  our Constitution  and the rule of law that      we shall prevail  I thank and commend Senators who joined with us      to stand up for a stronger America  for the America we believe in       by voting to invoke cloture on the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of      2007  We will not give up on this important effort
