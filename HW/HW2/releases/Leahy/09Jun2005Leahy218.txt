       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On the Nomination Of Terrance Boyle   To The U S  Court Of Appeals For The Fourth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Executive Business Meeting  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Terrence Boyle     To The U S  Court Of Appeals For The Fourth      Circuit June 9  2005  The history of filling vacancies on      the Fourth Circuit has been a difficult one these last several      years  This circuit  which includes the states of  Maryland  Virginia  West Virginia       South Carolina and North Carolina  has been the subject of so much      controversy  Numerous qualified nominees from North Carolina and      even from Virginia were blocked by the former Senator from North      Carolina  Republican Senators would not cooperate in elevating any      of the outstanding African American nominees to the Fourth Circuit      throughout President Clintons two terms  Our former colleague       Senator John Edwards  was mindful of that as he tried to work with      this White House to fill the North Carolina vacancies on the Fourth      Circuit  working hard to bring diverse and qualified nominees such      as Judge Allyson Duncan to fill one of the many seats from North      Carolina that Republicans had intentionally kept vacant    Senator Edwards cooperation on the     Duncan nomination was      just one part of the Democrats work to help fill the Fourth      Circuits vacancies  President Clinton tried hard to do so  and was      thwarted at every turn  Not only did he have trouble with nominees      to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina  he also was unsuccessful      in getting Roger Gregory appointed to the court from Virginia  even      though he was supported by his home state Senators  one of whom was      the very well respected Republican Senator John Warner       Fortunately  with the help of Senator Warner and Senator George      Allen  we were able to get Judge Gregory confirmed to a lifetime      appointment to the Fourth Circuit  the first African American to      serve on that circuit    During my 17 months as Chairman  we      were able to break through some more of logjam on the Fourth Circuit      that Republicans had constructed  In addition to Judge Gregory  I      proceeded with the controversial nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd      from South Carolina  He       too  was given a hearing  Committee consideration and Senate      consideration and  although he was a divisive nominee with an uneven      record  he was confirmed by the Senate   Democratic progress on Fourth Circuit      nominees stand in stark contrast to the way the Republican Senate      obstructed President Clintons nominees to this court  Six of his      Fourth Circuit nominees were blocked by Republicans  That is six      nominees to a single circuit  Judge James Beaty did not get a      hearing or a vote from the Judiciary Committee in 1995  1996  1997      or 1998  Judge James Wynn did not get a hearing or a vote in 1995 or      1996  Judge James Wynn did not get a hearing or a vote in 1999       2000  or the beginning of 2001  Judge Roger Gregory did not get a      hearing or a vote in 2000 or the beginning of 2001  when he was a     Clinton nominee  Neither      Judge Andre Davis nor Elizabeth Gibson got hearings or votes in      2000  Not one of these six circuit court nominees ever got a hearing      or a vote in this Committee when the Republican majority stalled so      many outstanding  qualified judicial nominees during the last six      years of the Clinton Administration        Others may recite partisan talking points seeking to rewrite Senate      history on its treatment of judicial nominations  but these are the      facts and the background that bring us to todays consideration of      Judge Boyles nomination  I hope we will not have to endure the      erroneous claim that Judge Boyle has been denied a hearing for 14      years  Those who make the charge know full well that Republicans      have been in charge of this Committee for the most recent years  and      for a majority of those 14 years no nomination was pending for this      controversial nominee        That brings us to this difficult and controversial nomination  Over      the last several weeks we have heard from opponents of Judge Boyles      nomination that include groups and citizens from North Carolina      concerned about his record on the District Court  and by people who      have followed his career or been affected by his rulings  I have a      number of letters from groups representing police officers       firefighters and law enforcement personnel  for example    many       from North Carolina    who are emphatically opposed to Judge Boyles      confirmation to the Fourth Circuit  There is a letter from the North      Carolina Police Benevolent Association  the North Carolina Troopers      Association  Police Benevolent Associations from South Carolina       Virginia and Alabama  the National Association of Police      Organizations  and the Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics of      North Carolina  These are not the typical opponents of judicial      nominees  They have come forward to oppose this nomination     In addition  there is deep opposition      from those interested in civil rights  disability rights  womens      rights  the environment and many other issues  Just recently  North      Carolina Congressman Mel Watt  together with Keith Sutton  President      and Chief Executive of the Triangle Urban League in  Raleigh  led a group of local and      national African American leaders opposed to this nomination        As I examined Judge Boyles record       heard him at his hearing and read his answers to our written      questions  I came to see why so many of these people and      organizations joined Senator Edwards in his opposition to this      nomination  Today  I join them too  As I look at cases he has      decided  opinions he has written  and the way he has conducted      himself as a district court judge  I cannot vote to approve his      promotion to an even more powerful position on the Fourth Circuit      Court of Appeals   Judge Boyles testimony before this      Committee  both in person and in writing did not help improve my      impression of him or his suitability for a higher court  His      answers  particularly those in writing  were evasive and coy  He      missed every opportunity to give straightforward answers to serious      questions about his numerous inflammatory statements about sex      discrimination law and the  ADA  and he brushed off my inquiry      about his service as a founding board member of a corporation found      to have violated FEC rules during the time he was there  I      understand that Judge Boyle may feel confident in his eventual      confirmation  I dont know if he will or wont be confirmed  but I      still believe the questions of a U S  Senator charged with approving      his life tenured position are due more respect than mine were      given    I also believe we are entitled to see      a more complete picture of his record on the U S  District Court by      seeing more of the thousands of his opinions that are not readily      available in official reporters and electronic databases  By his      own count  he has decided between 10 000 and 12 000 cases over his      career  but we have only seen hundreds of the decisions from those      cases  District Court judges choose which of their opinions and      orders will eventually be published  so a judges unpublished      opinions can tell as much or more about him as his public record       Judge Boyle had already produced some of his unpublished opinions       those that underlie reversals by the appellate court  and he later      gave us about 300 or so more  But  by his own calculation there are      over 2 500 more that we wont be receiving because it is too      inconvenient to try and retrieve them  We should not play games with      this request  We deserve better than we have gotten so far  and I      believe my friends on the other side of the aisle know it    Judge Boyles      Reversals  The reason we feel it is important to      review his record in detail is because of what perhaps may be the      most distinctive aspect of Judge Boyles record as a district court      judge    the sheer number of times his decisions have been reversed      by the Fourth Circuit  I know that the way the Administrative      Office of the Courts counts reversals makes Judge Boyles record      look more reasonable  but a look at the actual cases that make up      those counts tells another story  It shows a judge who has been      reversed nearly eight times a year  This is more than twice as      often as the next most reversed district court judge President Bush      has presented for elevation to the appellate court  It shows a judge      who in an effort to explain his large number of reversals tried to      revise history  and report many fewer reversals than he first told      us about  It shows numerous reversals for getting the sentencing      laws wrong  numbers of times he made mistakes in procedure  and      other simple mistakes he should not have made    In trying to explain his high number      of reversals  I found it curious that Judge Boyle could not simply      take responsibility for his many errors  First he tried to change      the list of reversals he had originally given the Senate in 2001  by      shaving off about 80 cases  Then  when asked why he did not      consider those cases    each of which cites a legal error serious      enough to be sent back for redecision    to be other than      affirmances by the circuit court  Judge Boyle could not give me a      straight answer  Finally  he added to his written answers the      curious assertion that the statement by the appellate court of the      standard of review in an opinion is simply that  and is not       standing alone  a substantial criticism  I think he means to say      that when an appellate court reverses him for an abuse of      discretion that is only a standard of review  not their thoughts      about his opinion  But he is mistaken  Appellate judges must take      the standard of review seriously and literally  abuse of discretion      means abuse of discretion  A reversal for plain error means just      that  the judge has committed a plain error  Language has meaning       and these precise legal terms are especially meaningful  Judge      Boyle cannot strip them of their content just by denying they have      any     Judge Boyle Has      Difficulty With Settled Law  Looking at the substance of the cases      we have been able to examine  if there is a hallmark to Judge      Boyles record on the district court  it would be the difficulty he      has with settled law  whether as written by the legislature or      interpreted by higher courts  It is not clear to me whether he has      difficulty accepting settled law  finding it or articulating it  but      whatever the source of the problem  his failures ought to disqualify      him for a promotion to the Fourth Circuit  We see his difficulty      with settled law in the cases where he was reversed more than once      on the same point of law  We see it where he was reversed 9 0 by the      Supreme Court and then      5 4 in the same case for not following the Courts direction  We      see it dramatically in his statements and poor judgment on the      Americans with Disabilities Act  We see it in his outrageous      opinion in an employment discrimination case where he has such      difficulty accepting both federal anti discrimination law and his      role as a district court judge  that he ignored 25 years of      precedent on the 11th Amendment  That ruling was      reversed by the Fourth Circuit  Finally  while there may be      differences in how we count and categorize Judge Boyles reversals       I think by any measure his difficulty with following settled law      reflected in those reversals  their sheer number and frequency      demonstrating a problem on their face     Reversed More Than      Once on Same Point of Law  I want to be clear that I am not      saying judges cannot make mistakes  Each of us is human  and the      law can be difficult to determine sometimes  but once a circuit      court reverses a trial judge  that judge should consider him or      herself corrected and should not commit the same legal error twice       let alone three or four times  Judges who cannot absorb the rulings      of a controlling court are not doing their jobs properly  Judge      Boyle is that sort of judge  In a couple of different contexts he      has been reversed more than once on the same point of law     In 1993  the Fourth Circuit decided a      case called U S  v  Peak  which addressed the problem of a      criminal defendant receiving ineffective assistance of counsel  and      concluded that if a defendants attorney fails to file an appeal as      requested by his client  the defendant is deprived of his      constitutional rights no matter what the likelihood of the success      of that appeal is  U S       v  Peak was not a case in which Judge Boyle was involved  but three      years later  in U S  v  Alston  eight years later in U S       v  Robards  and nine years later in U S  v  Privott       Judge Boyle s      rulings were vacated based on his failure to follow this Fourth      Circuit precedent  In Alston  the Fourth Circuit remanded to      Boyle to determine whether a convicted defendant had asked his      attorney to file an appeal  since  Aa      criminal defense attorney s      failure to file a notice of appeal when requested by his client      deprives the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to the      assistance of counsel  notwithstanding that the lost appeal may not      have had a reasonable probability of success        In Robards  Boyle again denied an ineffective assistance of      counsel claim by a defendant whose lawyer failed to file a notice of      appeal  finding that claimant had failed to show prejudice  The      Fourth Circuit vacated the ruling based on Peak  Not long      thereafter  in Privott  Boyle again denied an ineffective      assistance of counsel claim by another defendant whose lawyer failed      to file a notice of appeal  Once again  the Fourth Circuit      reversed  based on Peak  Three times  three errors  one      precedent  and no explanation from Judge Boyle about how he could      have missed this simple point of law so often    Cromartie  Being      Reversed By a Conservative Supreme Court  The Cromartie cases are another      example of Judge Boyle having difficulty with settled law  Judge      Boyle was twice reversed by the Supreme Court of the  United States  once by a vote of 9 0      with an opinion written by Clarence Thomas  and the second time 5 4         for not doing what the first opinion told him to do  Judge Boyle      has tried to hide behind having been part of a three judge panel in      the original cases  and while that is true  he cant escape the fact      that he wrote the opinions  He was the author of the decisions in      favor of white voters       constitutional challenges to North Carolina s      1997 redistricting plan    U S       v  North Carolina  Rejecting Settled Anti Discrimination Statute  Judge Boyles holding against women      alleging employment discrimination by the North Carolina Department      of Corrections is a prime example of his discomfort with so much      settled law that comes before him  In this case  United States      v  North Carolina  he writes one of the most sarcastic opinions      as has been written by a federal judge  and contains states      rights language more fitting for a defiant governor in the 1960s      South than a neutral arbiter of fact and law    Like the Cromartie cases  this      case represents another example where Judge Boyles blatant      disregard for applicable precedent  had it been left to stand  would      have resulted in the frustration of years of effort to achieve      redress for serious past discrimination  As it is  redress was      delayed for many years  His sympathy for states rights at the      expense of the vindication of civil rights is exactly the reason      Senator Edwards refused to consent to his elevation for so many      years  and is evidence of his trouble accepting the state of the law      as he finds it    Ellis  One of the most blatant examples of      Judge Boyles failure to even find proper precedent is a case called     Ellis v  North Carolina  Here  an African American woman      named Betty Ellis worked at a state run hospital  and sued the      hospital  the state  and the state health agency after being      dismissed from her job  alleging racial discrimination  As Judge      Boyle stated in his order dismissing the case  the underlying      claims  were  for discriminatory treatment pursuant to Title VII of      the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and other constitutional and state law      causes of action  In other words  this was a case brought under      the federal civil rights law passed by Congress that prohibits      discrimination in employment decisions because of race     In a short  baffling opinion  Judge      Boyle dismissed Ms  Ellis claims  saying that the state and its      agencies were entitled to sovereign immunity under the 11th      Amendment to the Constitution  that they could not be sued in      federal court under a federal anti discrimination statute  Well  it      is true that unless the Congress specifically waives the immunity      given the states by the 11th Amendment  states cannot be      sued in federal court  But in 1972 Congress specifically amended      Title VII in order to waive that immunity and make states and their      agencies  including state hospitals and health departments  liable      to suit in federal court  It is easy black letter law that any law      student in a civil rights class would learn  and certainly that any      district court judge should know  But Judge Boyle didnt know it       He didnt find the law  he didnt write the law  he didnt follow      the law  It is really a breathtaking order he has written  It is      brief  to the point  and it could not be more wrong   Also brief and to the point was the      Fourth Circuit opinion reversing him  In three paragraphs  the      panel  which included Judge Michael Luttig  a well known      conservative  vacated Boyles order  citing the primary case on      point  a then 26 year old U S  Supreme Court case called      Fitzpatrick v  Bitzer  This was not a hard case      Americans with      Disabilities Act  Another area of great concern to me is      Judge Boyles attitude toward the Americans with Disabilities Act       as passed by the Congress by a clear  bipartisan majority  This was      a case where Judge Boyle did not get precedent wrong  but he when      the Supreme Court was faced with the same issue  decided so      differently that Boyles decision was vacated  In Pierce v  King       Judge Boyle ruled that the  ADA could not constitutionally apply      to state prisons  and questioned its general constitutionality  He      made no effort to analyze the text of the statute  instead moving      directly to his opinion that Congress could not regulate prison      labor  The language he used in the course of his opinion evinced a      clear disrespect for the intent of Congress in passing this      legislation that has done so much to improve the lives of people      with disabilities  and makes his conclusion against the disabled      plaintiff no surprise  Discussing the ADA  Boyle wrote that      A a lthough      framed in terms of addressing discrimination  the Act s      operative remedial provisions demand not equal treatment  but      special treatment tailored to the claimed disability         Judge Boyle contrasted the  ADA unfavorably with Title VII      and other civil rights laws  saying       Aunlike      traditional anti discrimination laws  the ADA  demandsentitlement in      order to achieve its goals        In addition  he wrote that it was an open question whether employers      forced to make accommodations under the ADA were thereby entitled to      compensation under the Takings Clause    When I asked Judge Boyle about these      statements on the ADA in      my written questions  he answered only in platitudes  telling me      that the ADA demands equality of access for those who are disabled       it is the law of the land  and I do my best in every case to apply      it properly  He did not address his previous statements head on  he      did not explain how we could believe he understood the law and would      apply it  or how any plaintiff with an ADA case in front of him      could feel assured he would rule fairly     Free Speech Cases  There are more cases where Judge      Boyles opinions make me think he has difficulty with settled law       where he displayed hostility to the free speech rights of public      employees  In the case of Piver v  Pender County Board of      Education  he ruled against a high school teacher who was      retaliated against for voicing his support for tenure for the      principal at his school    A few years later in Edwards v       City of Goldsboro  he made a similar ruling  finding that a      police officer who suspended for teaching a class on firearm safety      had not stated a claim for the infringement of his free speech      rights because his speech was not on a matter of public concern        A year later  in Godon v  North      Carolina  Judge Boyle did it again  In that case  an employee      of a state run boot camp for young people sued the state  saying she      was fired for complaining about discriminatory treatment of the      female and black young people at the boot camp    Again  three cases  three reversals       one point of law  no sufficient explanation  Perhaps this is why      the National Association of Police Organizations  a group made up of      hundreds of law enforcement associations around the country  is      worried what these sorts of cases say about his concern for civil      liberties and free speech    Unanswered      Questions About the Educational Support Foundation  Another issue which Judge Boyle tried      mightily to avoid in the written questions and answers that followed      his hearing was his involvement in the Educational Support      Foundation  Inc  In every version of his Judiciary Committee      questionnaire responses Judge Boyle listed a membership on the board      of directors of an organization called the Educational Foundation       Inc   a sort of booster club for some of the athletic teams at the     University of North      Carolina  It turns out that was an error  and he was not on the      board of that organization  Instead he was a founding board member      of something called the Educational Support Foundation  Inc   a      partisan political group whose activities  including during his time      on its board  were the subject of a investigation by the Federal      Election Commission and were found to violate federal election law       The main complaint was that a political marketing firm owned      entirely by the Educational Support Foundation was making illegal      campaign contributions to political candidates and political      organizations  I asked Judge Boyle to tell us what he knew about      the Educational Support Foundation  its founding  its ownership of      Jefferson Marketing  his activities as a Board Member  its improper      campaign activities and his involvement in any improper activities       His answer  that he was  listed as a director  but  had nothing      to do with its founding or activities  is hard to swallow  The      organization had a total of three directors  One of the others was      his father in law  the third another strong political ally of      Senator Jesse Helms  Did Judge Boyle just wake up one day and find      himself listed as a director of this organization with no idea how      he it happened or what the group did  He was not aware that it was      the sole owner of one of the notorious Congressional Clubs direct      mail companies  He didnt know there was no particular education      being supported by this foundation other than the education of      conservative Republican donors  Has he no knowledge of the      organizations troubles with the FEC  He doesnt say that  and it      is hard to believe  Just as we deserve a more complete picture of      Judge Boyles record on the district court through his unpublished      opinions  this Committee deserves a better answer to the outstanding      questions about his involvement in the Educational Support      Foundation     Conclusion  From the slice of his record that we      have been allowed to see  it appears that Terrence Boyle is not a      very good District Court judge  He has difficulty with settled law       he is frequently reversed  and he is hostile to some of the most      important pieces of legislation that Congress has ever passed  His      testimony before this Committee was incomplete and less than      respectful of the duty each of us has to ensure that those we      confirm to lifetime appointments deserve them  The Constitution      gives the Senate a responsibility in the process of filling the      federal bench equal to that of the President  and therefore each      Senator has the obligation to vote his or her conscience on each      nominee as he or she comes to us  As I look today at Judge Boyle  I      cannot in good conscience vote to recommend that he be confirmed to      the Fourth Circuit
