       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy After Meeting With Prospective Attorney   General Nominee Judge Michael Mukasey                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     After Meeting With    Prospective Attorney General Nominee Judge Michael Mukasey    September 18  2007    I just met with Judge Mukasey briefly  so that we     could introduce ourselves to each other  We have the common bond of     having both come from law enforcement backgrounds  I have publicly praised the President  and do so     again  for not choosing to nominate individuals from that publicized     list of contenders whose records of partisanship would have led to     immediate difficulties  I begin this process of Senate review of the     Presidents nomination with hope and with optimism  The last thing I or     any of us want is to be disappointed in those hopes   Replacing an Attorney General is part but not all     of what needs to be done to restore trust in the Justice Department      The confirmation process can be a catalyst for resolving outstanding     issues between the Senate and the Administration  I hope that will     happen now   There are a number of issues that arise from that     dark period that still need resolution  Cooperation from the     Administration in making progress on our longstanding oversight requests     is still needed and will be helpful in moving forward  I am pleased to report that recent discussions that     I have had with Mr  Fielding  the White House Counsel  have been     encouraging on that score  I take him at his word that he will work to     provide the Judiciary Committee with information and documents that we     need  This is relevant to the next nominee and future Attorneys General     so that past excesses and mistakes are not repeated   I met with Judge Mukasey today hoping that after we     get cooperation from the Administration and are able to conduct a fair     and thorough review process  all Senators will be able to vote in favor     of his confirmation  I want to avoid the kind of witch hunt from the     Right that scuttled the Presidents nomination of Harriet Miers  I see Judge Mukaseys nomination as another chance     to clear the decks of some important unfinished business that goes to     the heart of accountability in government  It is also another chance     for a fresh start in the relationship between Congress and the Justice     Department headed by a new Attorney General   The big job of Attorney General of the United     States has gotten bigger  with the erosion of public trust and sagging     morale throughout the Department of Justice  The next Attorney General     will need to begin the process of restoring the Department of Justice to     its proper mission so that it is worthy of its name
