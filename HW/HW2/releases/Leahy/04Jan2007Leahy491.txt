       Leahy Introduces Bills To Combat War Profiteering  Public Corruption                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Incoming Judiciary Chairman Leahy     Targets Corruption     In First Bills Of 110th Congress  Leahy Introduces Bills To Combat War     Profiteering  Public Corruption WASHINGTON  Thursday  January 4   Signaling a     renewed emphasis on combating corruption at home and abroad  incoming     Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    introduced a     package of bills Thursday targeting corrupt officials and private     companies seeking to defraud American taxpayers and troops   Americans want the culture of corruption to end      From war profiteers and corrupt officials in Iraq  to convicted     Administration officials  to influence peddling lobbyists and      regrettably  even members of Congress  too many supposed public servants     have been serving their own interests  rather than the public interest      said Leahy   Many Democratic Senators joined Leahy in     reintroducing a bill creating criminal penalties for war profiteers and     cheats who would exploit taxpayer funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere     around the world  The War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007 builds     on earlier efforts by Leahy  who is also a senior member of the     Appropriations Committee  to crack down on this type of rampant fraud     and abuse  It is similar to legislation Leahy introduced in 2003  that     was subsequently passed by the Senate as part of an appropriations bill     but later torpedoed by the White House and the House Republican     leadership  which stripped out the Leahy provision   Also on Thursday  Leahy joined with Senator Mark     Pryor  D Ark    on another anti corruption measure aimed at     strengthening the tools available to federal prosecutors in combating     public corruption  This bill gives investigators and prosecutors the     statutory tools and the resources that they need to ensure that serious     and insidious public corruption is detected and punished  including     extending the statute of limitations on some of the worst crimes   The American people staged an intervention during     the November elections and made it clear that they would not stand for     it any longer  They expect the Congress to take action  and these bills     are a good first step toward meeting that call  Leahy said  We need     to restore the peoples trust by acting to clean up the peoples     government             Below are Senator Leahys statements on the     and the         and  as well as summaries of the two bills and background information     detailing a few examples of the fraud and war profiteering that have     already occurred in Iraq and elsewhere   Statement of Senator     Patrick Leahy    On Introduction of the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007    January 4  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today I am reintroducing     a bill that creates criminal penalties for war profiteers and cheats who     would exploit taxpayer funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the     world  Last year  despite the mounting evidence of widespread     contractor fraud and abuse in Iraq  the Republicancontrolled Senate     would not act on it  Instead  the Congress took a terrible misstep in     seeking to end the work of the Special Inspector General for Iraq     Reconstruction  I have been proposing versions of this bill since 2003      when it did pass the Senate  Unfortunately  this crucial provision was     stripped out of the final version of a bill by a Republican controlled     conference committee   There is growing evidence of widespread contractor     fraud in Iraq  yet prosecuting criminal cases against these war     profiteers is difficult under current law  We must crack down on this     rampant fraud and abuse that squanders American taxpayers dollars and     jeopardizes the safety of our troops abroad  That is why I renew my     efforts for accountability and action with the introduction of the War     Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007  I am pleased to join with     Senators Bingaman  Kerry  Harkin  Rockefeller  Dorgan  Wyden  Schumer      Cantwell  Bill Nelson  Clinton  Lautenberg and Menendez to introduce     this legislation      Widespread Fraud and War Profiteering in Iraq Congress has sent billions upon billions of dollars     to Iraq with too little accountability and too few financial controls      More than  50 billion of this money has gone to private contractors     hired to guard bases  drive trucks  feed and shelter the troops and     rebuild the country  This is more than the annual budget of the     Department of Homeland Security   Instead of results from these companies  we are     seeing penalties levied for allegations of fraud and abuse  At least 10     companies with billions of dollars in U S  contracts for Iraq     reconstruction have paid more than  300 million in penalties since 2000      to resolve allegations of bid rigging  fraud  delivery of faulty     military parts and environmental damage  Seven other companies with     Iraq reconstruction contracts have agreed to pay financial penalties     without admitting wrongdoing   In 2005  Halliburton took in approximately  3 6     billion from contracts to serve U S  troops and rebuild the oil industry     in Iraq  Halliburton executives say that the company received about  1     billion a month for Iraq work in 2006  In addition  last month  we     learned of new plans to spend hundreds of millions more to create jobs     in Iraq  Last year  the Special Inspector General for Iraq     Reconstruction found that millions of U S  taxpayer funds appropriated     for Iraq reconstruction have been lost and diverted  Yet we continue to     send more taxpayer funds to Iraq  without accountability  Too much of this money is unaccounted for  and many     of the facilities and services that these funds were supposed to pay for     are still nonexistent  We in Congress must ask  where did all the     money go  We need to press for more accountability over the use and     abuse of billions of taxpayers dollars sent as development aid to Iraq      not less       Accountability is Long Overdue A new law to combat war profiteering in Iraq and     elsewhere is sorely needed and long overdue  Although there are     anti fraud laws to protect against the waste of U S  tax dollars at     home  no law expressly prohibits war profiteering or expressly confers     jurisdiction on U S  federal courts to hear fraud cases involving war     profiteering committed overseas   The bill I introduced today would criminalize Awar     profiteering   overcharging taxpayers in order to defraud and to profit     excessively from a war  military action  or reconstruction efforts  It     would also prohibit any fraud against the United States involving a     contract for the provision of goods or services in connection with a     war  military action  or for relief or reconstruction activities  This     new crime would be a felony  subject to criminal penalties of up to 20     years in prison and fines of up to  1 million  or twice the illegal     gross profits of the crime  The bill also prohibits false statements connected     with the provision of goods or services in connection with a war or     reconstruction effort  This crime would also be a felony  subject to     criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to  1     million  or twice the illegal gross profits of the crime   The measure also addresses weakness in the existing     laws used to combat war profiteering  by providing clear authority for     the Government to seek criminal penalties and to recover excessive     profits for war profiteering overseas  These are strong and focused     sanctions that are narrowly tailored to punish and deter fraud or     excessive profiteering in contracts  both at home and abroad  The message sent by this bill is clear    any act     to exploit the crisis situation in Iraq or elsewhere overseas for     exorbitant gain is unacceptable  reprehensible  and criminal  Such     deceit demeans and exploits the sacrifices that our military personnel     are making in Iraq and Afghanistan  and around the world  This bill     also builds on a strong legacy of historical efforts to stem war     profiteering  Congress implemented excessive profits taxes and contract     renegotiation laws after both World Wars  and again after the Korean     War  Advocating exactly such an approach  President Roosevelt once     declared it our duty to ensure that a few do not gain from the     sacrifices of the many  A     Fresh Start Our Government cannot in good faith ask its people     to sacrifice for reconstruction efforts that allow some to profit     unfairly  When U S  taxpayers have been called upon to bear the burden     of reconstruction contracts  where contracts are awarded in a system     that offers little competition and even less accountability  concerns     about wartime profiteering are a grave matter   Combating war profiteering is not a Democratic     issue  or a Republican issue  Rather  it is a cause that all Americans     can support  When I first introduced this bill in 2003  it came to be     cosponsored by 21 Senators  The Senate Appropriations Committee also     unanimously accepted these provisions during a Senate Appropriations     Committee markup of the  87 billion appropriations bill for Iraq and     Afghanistan for Fiscal Year 2004  and this provision passed the Senate      Passing bipartisan war profiteering prevention legislation was the right     thing to do then  and it is the right thing to do now   I am hopeful that in a new year  and with a new     Congress  we can make a fresh start and forge a bipartisan partnership     on this important issue that will result in passage of this bill  I ask     unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record             War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007    Criminalizes war profiteering  which is     defined as materially overvaluing any good or service with the specific     intent to excessively profit from the war and relief or reconstruction     activities     Statute would strengthen the tools     available to federal prosecutors to combat war profiteering by providing     clear authority for the Government to seek criminal penalties and to     recover excessive profits for war profiteering overseas     Prohibits any fraud against the United     States  Iraq  or any other foreign country involving a contract for the     provision of any goods or services in connection with a war  military     action  or relief or reconstruction activities     Subjects violators to up to 20 years     imprisonment and a fine not to exceed the greater of  1 000 000 or twice     the amount of any illegal gross profits  or both     Prohibits making a false statement in any     matter involving a contract for the provision of any goods or services     in connection with a war  military action  or relief or reconstruction     activities     Subjects violators of this provision to     up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine not to exceed the greater of      1 000 000  or twice the amount of any illegal gross profits  or both         Creates extraterritorial jurisdiction     over offenses committed overseas  and covers any person in the United     States or abroad who violates its provisions       Background Information      Billions Of Taxpayer Dollars Lost    To Fraud And Waste In Iraq And Elsewhere The United States has spent more than a quarter of     a TRILLION dollars during its four years in Iraq   Over  50 BILLION    more than the annual budget of     the Department of Homeland Security    has been spent to hire private     contractors to guard bases  drive trucks  feed and shelter the troops     and rebuild the country  BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars are unaccounted for      according to a finding by the special inspector general examining the     Iraq reconstruction effort   Since 2000  10 companies with billions of dollars     in U S  contracts for Iraq reconstruction have paid more than  300     MILLION IN PENALTIES to resolve allegations of bid rigging  fraud      delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage in connection     with other projects       Examples of Fraud and Waste   Custer Battles  Halliburton and Bechtel CUSTER BATTLES is accused of bilking the government     out of  50 MILLION  Custer Battles billed the government nearly  10     MILLION when its actual costs were less than  4 MILLION  according to a     government investigation   Custer Battles over billed electricity costs by      326 000   Actual electricity charges of  74 000 were billed at      400 000   Custer Battles over billed for trucks that did not     run by  572 000  Actual purchase price of  228 000 for faulty trucks     were billed to government for  800 000   The two largest government contractors in Iraq        Bechtel Corp  and Halliburton Co     have been fined several times in     the past four years   HALLIBURTON CO  averaged about   1 BILLION A MONTH     from the government for work in Iraq in 2006  according to executives      The company took in  3 6 BILLION last year from contracts to serve U S      troops and rebuild the oil industry in Iraq   A pattern of fraud  waste  and corruption by     Halliburton in Iraq emerged through news reports between December 2003     and May 2004  In December  a Pentagon investigation found evidence that     Halliburton s Kellogg  Brown  Root  KBR  had overcharged the U S      government some  61 MILLION for fuel deliveries from Kuwait to Iraq  In     January  Halliburton admitted to the Pentagon that two of its employees     took up to  6 million in kickbacks for awarding a Kuwaiti based company     with work in Iraq  Then in early February it was reported that the     company had agreed to repay the U S  government some  27 million for     meals that were never served to American troops   Bills From Five Star  Beachfront Hotel And Drivers     Paid to Haul Empty Trucks   In May 2006  the Coalition Provisional     Authority s inspector general started raising questions about the bills     that Halliburton had racked up at a five star beachfront hotel near     Kuwait City  And 12 Halliburton truck drivers claimed they risked their     lives driving empty trucks in Iraq while their employer billed the     government for hauling absolutely nothing   Investigation of Overcharging And Potential     Connection to Nigeria Bribery Scheme   Federal authorities are also     investigating whether Halliburton broke the law by using a subsidiary to     do business in Iran  whether the company overcharged for work done for     the Pentagon in the Balkans and whether it was involved in an alleged      180 million bribery scheme in Nigeria  The company admitted in 2003     that it improperly paid  2 4 million to a Nigerian tax official   BECHTEL CORP  paid more than  110 000 to the     Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department in 2000 and     2001 to settle alleged safety and environmental violations  Bechtel has     prime construction contracts in Iraq worth more than  2 billion   Fines Exceeding  86 Million   Bechtel hired three     subcontractors in Iraq that have been fined more than  86 million in the     past four years  though none had been banned from getting new contracts  Others Punished For Waste  Fraud and Abuse Of Govt      Contracts  American International Contractors Inc   paid  4 7     million in fines in 2000 after pleading guilty to bid rigging on a     U S  funded water project in Egypt  according to published reports      AICI has part of a  325 million contract to rebuild Iraq s     transportation systems  has a share of a  500 million contract for     emergency construction needs in the Pentagon s Central Command region      which includes Iraq and Afghanistan  and is in a partnership that has a      70 million construction contract at Al Udeid air base in Qatar  used to     support troops in Iraq   Fluor Corp   paid  8 5 million to the Defense     Department in 2001 to settle charges it improperly billed the government     for work benefiting its commercial clients  according to published     reports  Fluor and AMEC created a joint venture that has  1 7 billion     in contracts to rebuild Iraq s electricity  water  sewer and trash     removal infrastructure   Great Lakes Dredge  Dock Co   paid a  969 000 fine     in 2002 for environmental damage in the Florida Keys National Marine     Sanctuary  according to published reports  Bechtel awarded the company     a subcontract to clear the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr  Northrop Grumman Corp   whose Vinnell Corp      subsidiary was awarded a  48 million contract to train the new Iraqi     Army last year  according to published reports  Northrop Grumman has     been penalized  191 7 million in the past four years  including  750 000     paid to the Pentagon in 2000 in a case involving allegations of     providing faulty replacement parts for the JSTARS airborne surveillance     system              Statement of     Senator Patrick Leahy     On Introduction of the Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007    January 4  2007 I am pleased to join with Senator Pryor today to     introduce the Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007  a bill to     strengthen the tools available to federal prosecutors in combating     public corruption  This bill gives investigators and prosecutors the     statutory tools and the resources they need to ensure that serious and     insidious public corruption is detected and punished  In November  voters sent a strong message that they     were tired of the culture of corruption  From war profiteers and     corrupt officials in Iraq to convicted Administration officials to     influence peddling lobbyists and  regrettably  even members of Congress      too many supposed public servants were serving their own interests      rather than the public interest  The American people staged an     intervention and made it clear that they would not stand for it any     longer  They expect the Congress to take action  We need to restore the     peoples trust by acting to clean up the peoples government  The Senates new leadership is introducing     important lobbying reform and ethics legislation  Similar legislation     passed the Senate last year  but stalled in the House  This is a vital     first step   But the most serious corruption cannot be prevented     only by changing our own rules  Bribery and extortion are committed by     people bent on getting around the rules and banking that they wont get     caught  These offenses can be difficult to detect and even harder to     prove  Because they attack the core of our democracy  these offenses     must be found out and punished  Congress must send a signal that it     will not tolerate this corruption by providing better tools for federal     prosecutors to combat it  This bill will do exactly that   First  the bill extends the statute of limitations     for the most serious public corruption offenses  Specifically  it     extends the statute of limitations from five years to eight years for     bribery  deprivation of honest services  and extortion by a public     official  This is an important step because public corruption cases are     among the most difficult and time consuming cases to investigate and     prosecute  They often require use of informants and electronic     monitoring  as well as review of extensive financial and electronic     records  techniques which take time to develop and implement  Bank fraud  arson  and passport fraud  among other     offenses  all have 10 year statutes of limitations  Since public     corruption offenses are so important to our democracy and these cases     are so difficult to investigate and prove  a more modest extended     statute of limitations for these offenses is a reasonable step to help     our corruption investigators and prosecutors do their jobs  Corrupt     officials should not be able to get away with their ill gotten gains     just by winning the waiting game   This bill also facilitates the investigation and     prosecution of an important offense known as federal program bribery       Title 18  United States Code  section 666   Federal program bribery is     the key federal statute for prosecuting bribery involving state and     local officials  as well as officials of the many organizations that     receive substantial federal money  This bill would allow agents and     prosecutors investigating this important offense to request authority to     conduct wiretaps and to use federal program bribery as a basis for a     racketeering charge  Wiretaps  when appropriately requested and     authorized  are an important method for agents and prosecutors to gain     evidence of corrupt activities  which can otherwise be next to     impossible to prove without an informant  The Racketeer Influenced and     Corrupt Organizations  RICO  statute is also an important tool which     helps prosecutors target organized crime and corruption   Agents and prosecutors may currently request     authority to conduct wiretaps to investigate many serious offenses      including bribery of federal officials and even sports bribery  and may     predicate RICO charges on these offenses  as well  It is only     reasonable that these important tools also be available for     investigating the similar and equally important offense of federal     program bribery   Lastly  this bill authorizes  25 million in     additional federal funds over each of the next four years to give     federal investigators and prosecutors needed resources to go after     public corruption  Last month  FBI Director Mueller in written testimony     to the Judiciary Committee called public corruption the FBIs top     criminal investigative priority  However  a September 2005 Report by     Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that  from 2000 to     2004  there was an overall reduction in public corruption matters     handled by the FBI  The report also found declines in resources     dedicated to investigating public corruption  in corruption cases     initiated  and in cases forwarded to US Attorneys Offices   I am heartened by Director Muellers assertion that     there has recently been an increase in the number of agents     investigating public corruption cases and the number of cases     investigated  but I remain concerned by the Inspector Generals     findings  I am concerned because the FBI in recent years has diverted     resources away from criminal law priorities  including corruption  into     counterterrorism  The FBI may need to divert further resources to cover     the growing costs of Sentinel  their data management system  The     Department of Justice has similarly diverted resources  particularly     from United States Attorneys Offices  Additional funding is important to compensate for     this diversion of resources and to ensure that corruption offenses are     aggressively pursued  My bill will give the FBI  the United States     Attorneys Offices  and the Public Integrity Section of the Department     of Justice new resources to hire additional public corruption     investigators and prosecutors  They can finally have the manpower they     need to track down and make these difficult cases  and root out the     corruption  If we are serious about addressing the egregious     misconduct that we have recently witnessed  Congress must enact     meaningful legislation to give investigators and prosecutors the     resources they need to enforce our public corruption laws  I strongly     urge Congress to do more to restore the public s trust in their     government  I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the     Record                Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007 Provides federal investigators and prosecutors the     statutory tools and the resources needed to ensure that serious and     insidious public corruption is detected and punished   Extends the statute of limitations for the most     serious public corruption offenses  including bribery  deprivation of     honest services  and extortion by a public official  from five years to     eight years  Facilitates the investigation and prosecution of a     key federal statute used for prosecuting bribery involving state and     local officials  as well as officials of the many organizations that     receive substantial federal money  Authorizes  25 million over each of the next four     years to give federal investigators and prosecutors needed resources to     go after public corruption
