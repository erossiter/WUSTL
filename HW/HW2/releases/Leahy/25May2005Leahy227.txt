       Senate Confirms Controversial Judge In Closely Divided Vote                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Senate Confirms Controversial      Judge In Closely Divided Vote   Democratic Senators Overwhelmingly      Oppose Owen       WASHINGTON  Wednesday  May 25   The Senate on Wednesday confirmed      the controversial nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit      Court of Appeals  56 43  Sen  Patrick Leahy   D Vt    the ranking      Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  was one of many      Democratic senators who opposed the nomination  The Senate rejected      the Owen nomination twice before in the last Congress  once  with      an unfavorable vote in the Judiciary Committee  and again    after      she was renominated  through a filibuster on the Senate Floor       Leahy and other Democratic senators opposed the Owen nomination      based on her record  which they have laid out in detail  of judicial      activism and consistent bias against consumers and victims  The      vote on Wednesday occurred days after an agreement forged by a      bipartisan group of senators that averted the Republican majoritys      bid to employ their nuclear option  which would have changed more      than 200 years of Senate tradition  precedent and rules by      destroying minority rights that are protected under the Senates      filibuster rules  Owens confirmation marks the 209th      judge of President Bushs to be confirmed by the Senate  Leahys      statement opposing the nomination follows       Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of Priscilla Owen      To The United States Court Of Appeals For The Fifth Circuit     May 25  2005 Yesterday  a number of Democratic Senators       including myself  voted to invoke cloture and end the debate on the      nomination of Priscilla Owen to the U S  Court of Appeals for the      Fifth Circuit  We did this not because we believe Priscilla Owen      ought to be confirmed  which I think the vote on her confirmation      will show  but to demonstrate our good will in light of the      agreement reached two days ago to avoid triggering the Republican      leaderships bid for one party rule  Fourteen of our colleagues came      to us with a bipartisan plan to avoid the Majority leaders nuclear      option  which was a short sighted effort to change the more than 200      years of Senate tradition  precedent and rules by destroying      minority rights   While we may not all agree with every part of      the agreement  by our votes yesterday and today  Democrats are      showing that we are prepared to move on  I urge the Republican      leader not to be captive of the narrow special interest controlling      so much of his party and  in the interests of the American people      and the Senate  join with us in implementing the steps needed to      move the Senate away from an unnecessary and divisive confrontation      and toward cooperation  We have so much we can work on  so much we      can do together  Even the partisan House of Representatives joined      together yesterday to pass legislation on embryonic stem cell      research that holds the promise of possible treatments and cures for      so many life threatening and debilitating diseases   I expect that in due course the Senate will      consider each of the three controversial nominees mentioned in Part      I  A  of that Memorandum of Understanding  I do not expect there      to be any repeat by Democrats of the extraordinary obstruction by      Republicans of President Clintons judicial nominees  For example       I do not expect any of the tactics used by Republicans during the      extensive delay in Senate consideration of the Richard Paez      nomination  Judge Paez waited more than four years before we were      able to get a vote on his confirmation  longer than the Priscilla      Owen nomination has been pending  I recall some Republicans      mounting an extraordinary motion after the filibuster of his      nomination was broken to indefinitely postpone the vote  a      last ditch  unprecedented effort that was ultimately unsuccessful       Of course  Judge Helene White never got a vote or even a hearing in      more than four years  Republicans denied her a hearing for a period      longer than the Owen nomination has been pending  Like more than 60      of President Clintons moderate and qualified judicial nominations       she was subjected to the Republican pocket filibuster   In this connection I should also note that last      night the Senate  with Democratic cooperation  entered into      unanimous consent agreement to govern the consideration and vote on      three additional circuit court nominees  Tom Griffith  Richard      Griffin  and David McKeague  Those are nominations that will be      debated and voted upon when the Senate returns from Memorial Day       The Democratic Leader deserves great credit for forging significant      progress on these matters   I have seen reports that the vote today of the      nomination of Priscilla Owen is the first of this Presidents      controversial nominees  That is not true  This Administration has      sent divisive nominee after divisive nominee to the Senate  Several      controversial judicial nominees have already been voted upon by the      Senate  Among the 208 judges already confirmed are some who were      confirmed with less than 60 votes  some with more than 40 negative      votes  The Presidents court packing efforts are not new but      continuing  Moreover  his penchant for insisting on divisive      nominations is not limited to the judiciary  as will be      demonstrated  again  when the Senate turns to the nomination of John      Bolton following the vote on the Owen nomination   The      Compelling Case Against Her Confirmation  Three years ago I first considered the      nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the United States      Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  After reviewing her record       hearing her testimony and evaluating her answers I voted against her      confirmation and explained at length the strong case against      confirmation of this nomination  Nothing about her record or the      reasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed      since then  Now that the Republican leaderships misguided      bid for one party rule  the nuclear option  has been deterred  we      have arrived at a moment when every one of the 100 of us must      examine Priscilla Owens record and decide for him or herself      whether it merits a lifetime appointment to the Fifth Circuit  I believe Justice Owen has shown herself over      the last decade on the Texas Supreme Court to be an ends oriented      judicial activist  intent on reading her own policy views into the      law  She has been the target of criticism by her conservative      Republican colleagues on the court  and not just in the context of      the parental notification cases that have been discussed so often      before  but in a variety of types of cases where the law did not fit      her personal views  including in cases where she has consistently      ruled for big business and corporate interests in cases against      worker and consumers  This sort of judging ought not to be rewarded      with such an important and permanent promotion       Committee Consideration of Justice Owens Nomination In 2001  Justice Owen was nominated to fill a      vacancy that had by that time existed for more than four years       since January 1997  In the intervening five years  President      Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel  a distinguished Hispanic attorney      from Corpus Christi  to fill that vacancy  Despite his      qualifications  and his unanimous rating of Well Qualified by the      ABA  Mr  Rangel never received a hearing from the Judiciary      Committee  and his nomination was returned to the President without      Senate action at the end of 1998  after a fruitless wait of 15      months  On September 16  1999  President Clinton      nominated Enrique Moreno  another outstanding Hispanic attorney  to      fill that same vacancy  Mr  Moreno did not receive a hearing on his      nomination either  over a span of more than 17 months  President      Bush withdrew the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit      and later sent Justice Owens name in its place  It was not until      May of 2002  at a hearing presided over by Senator Schumer  which      the Judiciary Committee heard from any of President Clintons three      unsuccessful nominees to the Fifth Circuit  At that time  Mr       Moreno and Mr  Rangel  joined by a number of other Clinton nominees       testified about their treatment by the Republican majority  Thus       Justice Owens was the third nomination to this vacancy and the      first to be accorded a hearing before the Committee   In fact  when the Judiciary Committee held its      hearing on the nomination of Judge Edith Clement to the Fifth      Circuit in 2001  during the most recent period of Democratic control      of the Senate  it was the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee      in seven years  By contrast  Justice Owen was the third nomination      to the Fifth Circuit on which the Judiciary Committee held a hearing      in less than one year  In spite of the treatment by the former      Republican majority of so many moderate judicial nominees of the      previous President  we proceeded in July of 2001    as I said that      we would    with a hearing on Justice Owen   Justice Owen is one of among 20 Texas nominees      who were considered by the Judiciary Committee while I was      Chairman  That included nine District Court judges  four United      States Attorneys  three United States Marshals  and three Executive      Branch appointees from Texas who moved swiftly through the Judiciary      Committee  When Justice Owen was initially nominated  the      President changed the confirmation process from that used by      Republican and Democratic Presidents for more than 50 years  That      resulted in her ABA peer review not being received until later that      summer  As a result of a Republican objection to the Democratic      leaderships request to retain all judicial nominations pending      before the Senate through the August recess in 2001  the initial      nomination of Justice Owen was required by Senate rules to be      returned to the President without action  The Committee nonetheless      took the unprecedented action of proceeding during the August recess      to hold two hearings involving judicial nominations  including a      nominee to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit   In my efforts to accommodate a number of      Republican Senators    including the Republican Leader  the      Judiciary Committees ranking member  and at least four other      Republican members of the Committee    I scheduled hearings for      nominees out of the order in which they were received that year  in      accordance with longstanding practice of the Committee   As I consistently indicated  and as any      Chairman can explain  less controversial nominations are easier to      consider and are  by and large  able to be scheduled sooner than      more controversial nominations  This is especially important in the      circumstances that existed at the time of the change in majority in      2001  At that time we faced what Republicans have now admitted had      become a vacancy crisis in the federal courts  From January 1995       when the Republican majority assumed control of the confirmation      process in the Senate  until the shift in majority  vacancies rose      from 65 to 110 and vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than      doubled from 16 to 33  I thought it important to make as much      progress as quickly as we could in the time available to us that      year  and we did  In fact  through the end of President Bushs      first term  we saw those 110 vacancies plummet to 27  the lowest      vacancy rate since the Reagan Administration   The responsibility to advise and consent on the      President s      nominees is one that I take seriously and that the Judiciary      Committee takes seriously  Justice Owen s      nomination to the Court of Appeals has been given a fair hearing and      a fair process before the Judiciary Committee  I thank all Members      of the Committee for being fair  Those who had concerns had the      opportunity to raise them and heard the nominees response  in      private meetings  at her public hearing and in written follow up      questions  I would particularly like to commend Senator      Feinstein  who chaired the hearing for Justice Owen  for managing      that hearing so fairly and evenhandedly  It was a long day  where      nearly every Senator who is a member of the Committee came to      question Justice Owen  and Senator Feinstein handled it with      patience and equanimity   After that hearing  I brought Justice Owens      nomination up for a vote  and following an open debate where her      opponents discussed her record and their objections on the merits       the nomination was rejected  Her nomination was fully and openly      debated  and it was rejected  That fair treatment stands in sharp      contrast to the way Republicans had treated President Clintons      nominees  including several to the Fifth Circuit   That should have ended things right there  but      it did not  Priscilla Owens nomination was the first judicial      nomination ever to be resubmitted after already being debated  voted      upon and rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee   When the Senate majority shifted  Republicans      reconsidered this nomination and sent it to the Senate on a      straight  party line vote  Never      before had a President resubmitted a circuit court      nominee already rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee  for the      same vacancy  And until Senator Hatch gave Justice Owen a second      hearing in 2003  never before had the Judiciary Committee rejected      its own decision on such a nominee and granted a second hearing       And at that second hearing we did not learn much more than the      obvious fact that  given some time  Justice Owen was able to enlist      the help of the talented lawyers working at the White House and the      Department of Justice to come up with some new justifications for      her record of activism  We learned that given six months to      reconsider the severe criticism directed at her by her Republican      colleagues  she still admitted no error  Mostly  we learned that      the objections expressed originally by the Democrats on the      Judiciary Committee were sincerely held when they were made and no      less valid after a second hearing  Nothing Justice Owen said about      her record    indeed  nothing anyone else tried to explain about her      record  was able to actually change her record  That was true      then  and that is true today   Senators who opposed this nomination did so      because Priscilla Owens record shows her to be an ends oriented      activist judge  I have previously explained my conclusions about      Justice Owens record  but I will summarize my objections again      today    The      Conservative Majoritys Criticism of Justice Owen I am not alone in my concerns about Justice      Owen  Her extremism has been evident even among a conservative      Supreme Court of Texas  The conservative Republican majority of the      Texas Supreme Court has gone out of its way to criticize Justice      Owen and the dissents she joined in ways that are highly unusual       and in ways which highlight her ends oriented activism  A number of      Texas Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from the      language of statute she strays in her attempts to push the law      beyond what the legislature intended  One example is the majority opinion in      Weiner v  Wasson  900 S W 2d 316  Tex  1995   In this case       Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a ruling against a medical      malpractice plaintiff injured while he was still a teenager  The      issue was the constitutionality of a State law requiring minors to      file medical malpractice actions before reaching the age of      majority  or risk being outside the statute of limitations  Of      interest is the majoritys discussion of the importance of abiding      by a prior Texas Supreme Court decision unanimously striking down a      previous version of the statute  In what reads as a lecture to the      dissent  then Justice John Cornyn explains on behalf of the      majority  Generally  we adhere to our precedents      for reasons of efficiency  fairness  and legitimacy  First  if we      did not follow our own decisions  no issue could ever be considered      resolved  The potential volume of speculative relitigation under      such circumstances alone ought to persuade us that stare decisis is      a sound policy  Secondly  we should give due consideration to the      settled expectations of litigants like Emmanuel Wasson  who have      justifiably relied on the principles articulated in  the previous      case         Finally  under our form of government  the legitimacy      of the judiciary rests in large part upon a stable and predictable      decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that properly      employed by the political branches of government  Id  at      12 13   Citations omitted   According to the conservative majority on the      Texas Supreme Court  Justice Owen went out of her way to ignore      precedent and would have ruled for the defendants  The conservative      Republican majority  in contrast to Justice Owen  followed precedent      and the doctrine of stare decisis  This is a clear example of      Justice Owens judicial activism  In Montgomery Independent School District v       Davis  34 S W  3d 559  Tex  2000   Justice Owen wrote another      dissent which drew fire from a conservative Republican majority       this time for her disregard for legislative language  In a      challenge by a teacher who did not receive reappointment to her      position  the majority found that the school board had exceeded its      authority when it disregarded the Texas Education Code and tried to      overrule a hearing examiners decision on the matter  Justice      Owens dissent advocated for an interpretation contrary to the      language of the applicable statute  The majority  which included      Alberto Gonzales and two other appointees of then Governor Bush  was      quite explicit about its view that Justice Owens position      disregarded the law  The dissenting opinion misconceives the      hearing examiners role in the       process by stating that the      hearing examiner refused to make findings on the evidence the      Board relies on to support its additional findings  As we explained      above  nothing in the statute requires the hearing examiner to make      findings on matters of which he is unpersuaded        Id  at      25 26   Emphasis added   The majority also noted that  The dissenting opinions misconception      of the hearing examiners role stems from its disregard of the      procedural elements the Legislature established in subchapter F to      ensure that the hearing examiner process is fair and efficient for      both teachers and school boards  The Legislature maintained local      control by giving school boards alone the option to choose the      hearing examiner process in nonrenewal proceedings        By      resolving conflicts in disputed evidence  ignoring credibility      issues  and essentially stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to      reach a specific result  the dissenting opinion not only disregards      the procedural limitations in the statute but takes a position even      more extreme than that argued for by the board        Id  at      28   Emphasis added   This is another clear example of Justice Owens      judicial activism  Collins v  Ison Newsome  73 S W 3d 178       Tex  2001   is yet another case where a dissent  joined by Justice      Owen  was roundly criticized by the Republican majority of the Texas      Supreme Court  The Court cogently stated the legal basis for its      conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to decide the matter before      it  and as in other opinions where Justice Owen was in dissent  took      time to explicitly criticize the dissents positions as contrary to      the clear letter of the law  At issue was whether the Supreme Court had the      proper conflicts jurisdiction to hear the interlocutory appeal of      school officials being sued for defamation  The majority explained      that it did not because published lower court decisions do not      create the necessary conflict between themselves  The arguments put      forth by the dissent  in which Justice Owen joined  offended the      majority  and they made their views known  writing  The dissenting opinion agrees that      because this is an interlocutory appeal       this Courts      jurisdiction is limited  but then argues for the exact opposite      proposition       This argument defies the Legislatures clear and      express limits on our jurisdiction        The author of the      dissenting opinion has written previously that we should take a      broader approach to the conflicts jurisdiction standard  But a      majority of the Court continues to abide by the Legislatures clear      limits on our interlocutory appeal jurisdiction  Id  at 182        Emphasis added   They continue   T he dissenting opinions reading of      Government Code sec  22 225 c  conflates conflicts jurisdiction with      dissent jurisdiction  thereby erasing any distinction between these      two separate bases for jurisdiction  The Legislature identified      them as distinct bases for jurisdiction in sections 22 001 a  1  and       a  2   and section 22 225 c  refers specifically to the two      separate provisionsn of section 22 001 a  providing for conflicts      and dissent jurisdiction         W e cannot simply ignore the      legislative limits on our jurisdiction  and not even Petitioners      argue that we should do so on this basis  Id  at 183        Emphasis added   Again  Justice Owen joined a dissent that the      Republican majority described as defiant of legislative intent and      in disregard of legislatively drawn limits  This is yet another      clear example of Justice Owens judicial activism  Some of the most striking examples of criticism      of Justice Owens writings  or the dissents and concurrences she      joins  come in a series of parental notification cases heard in      2000  They include  In In re Jane Doe 1 19 S W 3d 346  Tex       2000   where the majority included an extremely unusual section      explaining its view of the proper role of judges  admonishing the      dissent  joined by Justice Owen  for going beyond its duty to      interpret the law in an attempt to fashion policy   Giving a pointed critique of the dissenters       the majority explained that  In reaching the decision to grant Jane      Does application  we have put aside our personal viewpoints and      endeavored to do our job as judges  that is  to interpret and apply      the Legislatures will as it has been expressed in the statute      Id  at 350   In a separate concurrence  Justice Alberto      Gonzales wrote that to construe the law as the dissent did  would      be an unconscionable act of judicial activism   A conservative Republican colleague of Justice      Owens points squarely to her judicial activism  I know that the Attorney General now says that      when he wrote that he was not referring to her  and I dont blame      him for taking that position  After all  he is the Attorney General      charged with defending her nomination  But there is no way to read      his concurring opinion as anything other than a criticism of the      dissenters  Owen included  Listen to the words he wrote  The dissenting opinions suggest that the      exceptions to the general rule of notification should be very rare      and require a high standard of proof  I respectfully submit that      these are policy decisions for the Legislature  And I find nothing      in this statute to directly show that the Legislature intended such      a narrow construction  As the Court demonstrates  the Legislature      certainly could have written  the law  to make it harder to by pass      a parents right to be involved      But it did not        Thus  to      construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate      bypasses or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the      words of the statute  would be an unconscionable act of judicial      activism  In re Jane Doe 1  19 S W  3d 346  366  Tex  2000       Gonzales  J  concurring  Owen is one of two justices who wrote a      dissent  so she is naturally included in the dissenting opinions      to which he refers  It doesnt get much clearer than this  But you      dont have to take my word for it  Mr  Gonzales himself has      acknowledged as much   Twice before Justice Owens first hearing in      the Judiciary Committee  he and his spokesperson admitted that his      comments referred to a disagreement between justices  The New      York Times of April 7  2002  reported that  a     spokesman for Mr  Gonzales  minimized the      significance of the disagreement   saying  Judge Gonzales s opinion      and Justice Owen s dissent reflect an honest and legitimate      difference of how to interpret a difficult and vague statute  On      July 22  2003  Neil Lewis of The New York Times reports that      in an interview he had with the then White House Counsel  Mr       Gonzales sought to minimize the impact of his remarks  He      acknowledged that calling someone a judicial activist was a      serious accusation  especially among Republicans who have used that      term as an imprecation against liberals   Of course  Mr  Gonzales went on to tell the      reporter that he still supported Justice Owen for the Fifth Circuit       and I expect he would  He works for the President and supports his      efforts to fill the federal courts with ideologues and activists       and I appreciate his honesty  It was only years later  when he was      before the Judiciary Committee for his own confirmation to be      Attorney General that he told us his comments did not refer to      Justice Owen  rather to himself  and what he would be doing if he      expressed an opinion like that of the dissent  So  I will take the      Attorney General at his word  but I will take his original writing      and his earliest statements as the best evidence of his view of      Justice Owens opinion in Doe 1  and leave his later  more      politically influenced statements  to others  Jane Doe 1 was not the only one of the      parental consent cases where Justice Owens position was criticized      by her Republican colleagues  In In re Jane Doe 3  19 S W       3d 300  Tex  2000   Justice Enoch writes specifically to rebuke      Justice Owen and her follow dissenters for misconstruing the      legislatures definition of the sort of abuse that may occur when      parents are notified of a minors intent to have an abortion       saying  abuse is abuse  it is neither to be trifled with nor its      severity to be second guessed  Id  at 307  In one case that is perhaps the exception that      proves the rule  Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion that was      bitterly criticized by the dissent for its activism  In In re      City of Georgetown  53 S W  3d 328   Tex  2001   Justice Owen      wrote a majority opinion finding that the city did not have to give      The Austin American Statesman a report prepared by a consulting      expert in connection with pending and anticipated litigation because      such information was expressly made confidential under other law       namely  the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure   The dissent is extremely critical of Justice      Owens opinion  citing the Texas law s strong preference for      disclosure and liberal construction  Accusing her of activism       Justice Abbott  joined by Chief Justice Phillips and Justice Baker       notes that the legislature  expressly identified eighteen      categories of information that are public information and that      must be disclosed upon request        sec   a   The Legislature      attempted to safeguard its policy of open records by adding      subsection  b   which limits courts encroachment on its      legislatively established policy decisions  Id  at 338  The      dissent further protests   b ut if this Court has the power to      broaden by judicial rule the categories of information that are      confidential under other law  then subsection  b  is eviscerated      from the statute  By determining what information falls outside      subsection  a s scope  this Court may evade the mandates of      subsection  b  and order information withheld whenever it sees fit       This not only contradicts the spirit and language of subsection  b        it guts it  Id   Finally  the opinion concluded by asserting      that Justice Owens interpretation  abandons strict construction      and rewrites the statute to eliminate subsection  b  s      restrictions  Id  at 343  Yet again  her colleagues on the Texas court       cite Justice Owens judicial activism  These examples  together with the unusually      harsh language directed at Justice Owens position by the majority      in the Doe cases  show a judge out of step with the conservative      Republican majority of the Texas Supreme Court  a majority not      afraid to explain the danger of her activist views A      Judicial Activist Showing Bias against Consumers  Victims  Ordinary      People Justice Owen makes bad decisions even when she      is not being criticized by her colleagues  Among these decisions      are those where she skews her decisions to show bias against      consumers  victims and just plain ordinary people in favor of big      business and corporations  As one reads case after case       particularly those in which she was the sole dissenter or dissented      with the extreme right wing of the Court  her pattern of activism      becomes clear  Her legal views in so many cases involving statutory      interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning of      the statute  the legislative intent  or the majoritys      interpretation  leading to the conclusion that she sets out to      justify some pre conceived idea of what the law ought to mean  This      is not an appropriate way for a judge to make decisions  This is a      judge whose record reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager      to make law from the bench   Justice Owens activism and extremism is      noteworthy in a variety of cases  including those dealing with      business interests  malpractice  access to public information       employment discrimination and Texas Supreme Court jurisdiction  in      which she writes against individual plaintiffs time and time again       in seeming contradiction of the law as written  In fact  according      to a study conducted last year by the Texas Watch Foundation  a      non profit consumer protection organization in Texas  in the last      six years  Owen has not dissented once from a majority decision      favoring business interests over victims  but has managed to differ      from the majority and dissent in 22 of the 68 cases where the      majority opinion was for the consumer  One of the cases where this trend is evident in     FM Properties v  City of Austin  22 S W  3d 868  Tex  1998        I asked Justice Owen about this 1998 environmental case at her      hearing  In her  dissent from a 6 3 ruling  in which Justice      Alberto Gonzales was among the majority  Justice Owen showed her      willingness to rule in favor of large private landowners against the      clear public interest in maintaining a fair regulatory process and      clean water  Her dissent  which the majority characterized as      nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric  was an attempt to favor      big landowners   In this case  the Texas Supreme Court found      that a section of the Texas Water Code allowing certain private      owners of large tracts of land to create water quality zones  and      write their own water quality regulations and plans  violated the      Texas Constitution because it improperly delegated legislative power      to private entities  The Court found that the Water Code section      gave the private landowners  legislative duties and powers  the      exercise of which may adversely affect public interests  including      the constitutionally protected public interest in water quality      Id  at 876 77  The Court also found that certain aspects of      the Code and the factors surrounding its implementation weighed      against the delegation of power  including the lack of meaningful      government review  the lack of adequate representation of citizens      affected by the private owners actions  the breadth of the      delegation  and the big landowners obvious interest in maximizing      their own profits and minimizing their own costs  The majority offered a strong opinion       detailing its legal reasoning and explaining the dangers of offering      too much legislative power to private entities  By contrast  in her      dissent  Justice Owen argued that   w hile the Constitution      certainly permits the Legislature to enact laws that preserve and      conserve the States natural resources  there is nothing in the      Constitution that requires the Legislature to exercise that power in      any particular manner  ignoring entirely the possibility of an      unconstitutional delegation of power  Id  at 889  Her view      strongly favored large business interests to the clear detriment of      the public interest  and against the persuasive legal arguments of a      majority of the Court   When I asked her about this case at her      hearing  I found her answer perplexing  In a way that she did not      argue in her written dissent  at her hearing Justice Owen attempted      to cast the FM Properties case not as  a fight between and City of      Austin and big business  but in all honesty        really a fight      about       the State of Texas versus the City of Austin        Transcript at 69   In the written dissent however  she began by      stating the  importance of this case to private property rights and      the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative      branches       and went on to decry the Courts decision as one      that  will impair all manner of property rights  22 S W  3d at      889  At the time she wrote her dissent  Justice Owen was certainly      clear about the meaning of this case  property rights for      corporations  Another case that concerned me is GTE      Southwest  Inc  v  Bruce  990 S W 2d 605  where Justice Owen      wrote in favor of GTE in a lawsuit by employees for intentional      infliction of emotional distress  The rest of the Court held that      three employees subjected to what the majority characterized as      constant humiliating and abusive behavior of their supervisor were      entitled to the jury verdict in their favor  Despite the Courts      recitation of an exhaustive list of sickening behavior by the      supervisor  and its clear application of Texas law to those facts       Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to explain her difference of      opinion on the key legal issue in the case  whether the behavior in      evidence met the legal standard for intentional infliction of      emotional distress   Justice Owen contended that the conduct was      not  as the standard requires  so outrageous in character  and so      extreme in degree  as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency     Id  at 621  The majority opinion shows Justice Owens      concurrence advocating an inexplicable point of view that ignores      the facts in evidence in order to reach a predetermined outcome in      the corporations favor  Justice      Owens recitation of facts in her concurrence significantly      minimizes the evidence as presented by the majority  Among the      kinds of behavior to which the employees were subjected  according      to the majority opinion  are  Upon his arrival the supervisor       began regularly using the harshest vulgarity      continued to use      the word f___ and motherf    r frequently when speaking with the      employees      repeatedly physically and verbally threatened and      terrorized them      would frequently assault each of the employees      by physically charging at them       come up fast       and get up      over  the employee        and yell and scream in her face            called  an employee  into his office every day and       have her      stand in from of him  sometimes for as long as thirty minutes  while       the supervisor  simply stared at her       made  an employee  get      on her hands and knees and clean the spots  on the carpet  while he      stood over her yelling  Id  at 613 614  Justice Owen did      not believe that such conduct was outrageous or outside the bounds      of decency under state law  At her hearing  in answer to Senator Edwardss      questions about this case  Justice Owen again gave an explanation      not to be found in her written views  She told him that she agreed      with the majoritys holding  and wrote separately only to make sure      that future litigants would not be confused and think that out of      context  any one of the outrages suffered by the plaintiffs would      not support a judgment  Looking again at her dissent  I do not see      why  if that was what she truly intended  she did not say so in      language plain enough to be understood  or why she thought it      necessary to write and say it in the first place  It is a somewhat      curious distinction to make  to advocate that in a tort case a      judge should write a separate concurrence to explain which part of      the plaintiffs case  standing alone  would not support a finding of      liability  Neither her written concurrence  nor her answers in      explanation after the fact  is satisfactory explanation of her      position in this case  In City of Garland v  Dallas Morning News       22 S W  3d 351  Tex  2000   Justice Owen dissented from a majority      opinion and  again  it is difficult to justify her views other than      as being based on a desire to reach a particular outcome  The      majority upheld a decision giving the newspaper access to a document      outlining the reasons why the citys finance director was going to      be fired  Justice Owen made two arguments  that because the      document was considered a draft it was not subject to disclosure       and that the document was exempt from disclosure because it was part      of policy making  Both of these exceptions were so large as to      swallow the rule requiring disclosure  The majority rightly points      out that if Justice Owens views prevailed  almost any document      could be labeled draft to shield it from public view  Moreover  to      call a personnel decision a part of policy making is such an      expansive interpretation it would leave little that would not be      policy  Quantum Chemical v  Toennies  47 S W  3d      473  Tex  2001   is another troubling case where Justice Owen joined      a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a clearly written      statute  In this age discrimination suit brought under the Texas      civil rights statute  the relevant parts of which were modeled on      Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act  and its amendments   the      appeal to the Texas Supreme Court centered on the standard of      causation necessary for a finding for the plaintiff  The plaintiff      argued  and the five justices in the majority agreed  that the plain      meaning of the statute must be followed  and that the plaintiff      could prove an unlawful employment practice by showing that      discrimination was a motivating factor  The employer corporation      argued  and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed  that the plain meaning      could be discarded in favor of a more tortured and unnecessary      reading of the statute  and that the plaintiff must show that      discrimination was the motivating factor  in order to recover      damages  The portion of Title VII on which the majority      relies for its interpretation was part of Congresss 1991 fix to the      United States Supreme Courts opinion in the Price Waterhouse case       which held that an employer could avoid liability if the plaintiff      could not show discrimination was the motivating factor       Congresss fix  in Section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991  does      not specify whether the motivating factor standard applies to both      sorts of discrimination cases  the so called mixed motive cases as      well as the pretext cases   The Texas majority concluded that they must      rely on the plain language of the statute as amended  which could      not be any clearer that under Title VII discrimination can be shown      to be a motivating factor  Justice Owen joined Justice Hecht in      claiming that federal case law is clear  in favor of their view        and opted for a reading of the statute that would turn it into its      polar opposite  forcing plaintiffs into just the situation      legislators were trying to avoid  This example of Justice Owens      desire to change the law from the bench  instead of interpret it       fits President Bushs definition of activism to a T       Notification Cases Justice Owen has also demonstrated her tendency      toward ends oriented decision making quite clearly in a series of      dissents and concurrences in cases involving a Texas law providing      for a judicial bypass of parental notification requirements for      minors seeking abortions   A striking example is Justice Owens expression      of disagreement with the majoritys decision on key legal issues in     Doe 1  which I discussed earlier in a different context       She strongly disagreed with the majoritys holding on what a minor      would have to show in order to establish that she was  as the      statute requires  sufficiently well informed to make the decision      on her own  While the conservative Republican majority laid out a      well reasoned test for this element of the law  based on the plain      meaning of the statute and well cited case law  Justice Owen      inserted elements found in neither authority  Specifically  Justice      Owen insisted that the majoritys requirement that the minor be      aware of the emotional and psychological aspects of undergoing an      abortion was not sufficient and that among other requirements with      no basis in the law  she  would require       that the minor       should       indicate to the court that she is aware of and has      considered that there are philosophic  social  moral  and religious      arguments that can be brought to bear when considering abortion      In re Jane Doe 1  19 S W 3d 249  256  Tex  2000   In her written concurrence  Justice Owen      indicated  through legal citation  that support for this proposition      could be found in a particular page of the Supreme Courts opinion      in Planned Parenthood v  Casey  However  when one looks at      that portion of the Casey decision  one finds no mention of      requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or moral arguments  The      passage talks instead about the ability of a State to enact rules      and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are      philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought      to bear  Casey at 872  Justice Owens reliance on this      portion of a United States Supreme Court opinion to rewrite Texas      law was simply wrong  As she did in answer to questions about a      couple of other cases at her hearing  Justice Owen tried to explain      away this problem with an after the fact justification  She told      Senator Cantwell that the reference to religion was not to be found      in Casey after all  but in another U S  Supreme Court case  H L       v  Matheson  She explained that in Matheson they talk about      that for some people it raises profound moral and religious      concerns  and theyre talking about the desirability or the States      interest in these kinds of considerations in making an informed      decision  Transcript at 172  But again  on reading Matheson       one sees that the only mention of religion comes in a quotation      meant to explain why the parents of the minor are due notification       not about the contours of what the government may require someone to      prove to show she was fully well informed  Her reliance on      Matheson for her proposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty      as her reliance on Casey  Neither one supports her reading      of the law  She simply tries a little bit of legal smoke and      mirrors to make it appear as if they did  This is the sort of      ends oriented decision making that destroys the belief of a citizen      in a fair legal system  And most troubling of all was her      indication to Senator Feinstein that she still views her dissents in      the Doe cases as the proper reading and construction of the      Texas statute   In these cases  Priscilla Owen tried to insert      requirements into the law that the Texas legislature had not      included in the law  Simply put  Justice Owen engaged in judicial      activism  In fact  as Ive said  it was in one of these cases that      Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  referred to Owens position in      the case as an unconscionable act of judicial activism  Senators      have criticized Justice Owens activism in the parental notification      cases  We have not criticized the laws themselves  In fact  some      Democratic Senators have noted their support for these kinds of      statutes  Republicans have strayed far from the issue  What is      relevant here is that Priscilla Owen tried to insert requirements      into the law that the Texas legislature had not included  A State      legislature can enact constitutional parental notification laws  A      judge is not supposed to rewrite the law but to apply it to the      facts and to ensure its constitutionality  If she wants to rewrite      the law  she should leave the bench and run for a seat in the state      legislature   A Second      Review By Judiciary Committee      At her second  unprecedented hearing in 2003  Justice Owen and her      defenders tried hard to recast her record and others criticism of      it  I went to that hearing  I listened to her testimony  and I read      her written answers  many newly formulated  that attempt to explain      away her very disturbing opinions in the Texas parental notification      cases  But her record is still her record  and the record is      clear  She did not satisfactorily explain why she infused the words      of the Texas legislature with so much more meaning than she can be      sure they intended  She adequately describes the precedents of the      Supreme Court of the United States  to be sure  but she simply did      not justify the leaps in logic and plain meaning she attempted in      those decisions        I read her responses to Senator Hatchs remarks at that second      hearing  where he attempted to explain away cases about which I had      expressed concern at her first hearing  For example  I heard him      explain the opinion she wrote in F M  Properties v  City of      Austin  I read how he recharacterized the dispute in an effort      to make it sound innocuous  just a struggle between two      jurisdictions over some unimportant regulations  I know how       through a choreographed exchange of leading questions and short      answers  they tried to respond to my question from the original      hearing  which was never really answered  about why Justice      Owen thought it was proper for the legislature to grant large      corporate landowners the power to regulate themselves  I remained      unconvinced  The majority in this case  which invalidated a state      statute favoring corporations  did not describe the case or the      issues as Senator Hatch and Justice Owen did  A fair reading of the      case shows no evidence of a struggle between governments  This is      all an attempt at after the fact  revisionist justification where      there really is none to be found   Justice Owen and Chairman Hatchs explanation      of the case also lacked even the weakest effort at rebutting the      criticism of her by the F M  Properties majority  In its      opinion  the six justice majority said  and I am quoting  that      Justice Owens dissent was nothing more than inflammatory      rhetoric  They explained why her legal objections were mistaken       saying that no matter what the state legislature had the power to do      on its own  it was simply unconstitutional to give the big      landowners the power they were given  No talk of the City of      Austin v  the State of Texas  Just the facts        Likewise  the few explanations offered for the many other examples      of the times her Republican colleagues criticized her were      unavailing  The tortured reading of Justice Gonzales remarks in      the Doe case were unconvincing  He clearly said that to      construe the law in the way that Justice Owens dissent construed      the law would be activism  Any other interpretation is just not      credible        And no reasons were offered for why her then colleague  now ours       Justice Cornyn  thought it necessary to explain the principle of      stare decisis to her in his opinion in Weiner v  Wasson  Or      why in Montgomery Independent School District v  Davis  the      majority criticized her for her disregard for legislative language       saying that  the dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing      examiner s role in the       process  which it said stemmed from       its disregard of the procedural elements the Legislature      established       to ensure that the hearing examiner process is      fair and efficient for both teachers and school boards  Or why  in     Collins v  Ison Newsome  a dissent joined by Justice Owen was      so roundly criticized by the Republican majority  which said the      dissent agrees with one proposition but then argues for the exact      opposite proposition        defying  the Legislatures clear and      express limits on our jurisdiction        These examples  together with the unusually harsh language directed      at Justice Owen s position by the majority in the Doe cases       show a judge out of step with the conservative Republican majority      of the Texas Supreme Court  a majority not afraid to explain the      danger of her activist views  No good explanation was offered for      these critical statements last year  and no good explanation was      offered two weeks ago  Politically motivated rationalizations do      not negate the plain language used to describe her activism at the      time       Improper Religious and Moral Accusations I also briefly set the record straight about a      number of mischaracterizations of the opposition to Justice Owens      nomination  Earlier in this debate  at least one Senator said that      opposition Senators  are discriminating against people of faith       Sadly  these statements follow a pattern of despicable accusations       made often by the radical interest groups backing these nominations      and made too frequently here by those repeated these slurs  The      assertion that any Senator opposes someone because she is a Sunday      school teacher is a new low  however  Even President Bush has      disavowed that attack   I oppose Priscilla Owen  not because of her      faith  which I respect  but because she is an ends oriented judicial      activist who is so far outside of the mainstream that she has often      been criticized harshly by the Texas Supreme Courts conservative      majority  In case after case  Justice Owens opinions make clear      that she is a judge willing to make law from the bench rather than      follow the language and intent of the legislature or judicial      precedent  While some of the clearest examples of her judicial      activism come in her dissents in cases involving the parental      notification law  there are  as I have explained  many other      examples in cases having nothing to do with abortion  Justice Owens position as a frequent dissenter      on the Texas Supreme Court shows how extreme she can be and how far      from the letter of the law she strays in her attempts to push her      own political and ideological agenda  Not only has the majority of      that conservative court criticized her dissents on numerous      occasions  but the majoritys criticisms of her opinions are unusual      for their harsh tone  Surely the Republican members of the Texas      Supreme Court criticized Priscilla Owen not because she is a person      of faith  but because she insists on impermissibly legislating from      the bench  I concur  Senators oppose Priscilla Owens confirmation      because she has attempted to substitute her own views for those of      the legislature  What is relevant is that she is writing      law  rather than interpreting law  as evidenced in the opinions in      which she would have added requirements that the Texas legislature      did not put into the law  An evaluation of Priscilla Owens decisions      shows that it is she who is results oriented  she crafts her      decisions in order to promote business interests over individuals      and to advance various social agendas  rather than simply following      the law and evaluating the facts of a given case  Justice Owen has      been broadly and repeatedly criticized by her fellow Republican      Texas Supreme Court Justices for disregarding statutes and the      intent of the legislature  instead  pursuing her own activist      results  In many cases in which she has dissented and been      criticized by the majority  her opinions were to benefit corporate      interests including numerous companies that contributed to her      campaign   For instance  in FM Properties Operating Co       v  City of Austin  which I have already discussed  where      she ruled to let a single developer dodge Austins water quality      rules  Justice Owen received  2 500 in campaign contributions from      one of the FM Properties companys partners and over  45 000 from      the companys lawyers   Opposition      to Priscilla Owen      It is worth noting that my Democratic colleagues and I do not stand      alone in opposing Priscilla Owens nominations  We are in the good      company of a broad array of newspaper editorial boards  prominent      organizations  and individuals throughout the country and in Justice      Owens home state of Texas       The groups opposing Justice Owen range from the AFL CIO and the     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights to the Endangered      Species Coalition and the National Partnership for Women and      Families  Texas opposition to the Owen nomination has come from a      wide variety of groups including the American Association of      University Women of Texas  Texas Lawyers for a Fair Judiciary  and      the Texas chapters of the National Organization for Women and the      Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund  MALDEF   just to      name a few  Among the many citizens who have written to oppose      Justice Owens nomination are dozens of attorneys from Texas and      elsewhere  as well as C L  Ray  a retired Justice of the Texas      Supreme Court  who wrote  I have rarely      seen a public servant show so much contempt for the laws of this      State   Lawyers who appear in front of Justice Owen in      Texas Supreme Court rate her poorly as well  The most recent      results of the Houston Bar Associations Judicial Evaluation Poll      shows that 45 percent of the respondents rated Justice Owen poor       more than gave that lowest rating to any other justice  She was in      last place in the acceptable category  with only 15 percent  and      in second to last place among her colleagues in receiving a rating      of outstanding  with only 39 percent giving her that review   I have heard Senator Cornyn say that Justice      Owen has been supported by major newspapers in Texas  but that      support must have been for her election to the Texas Supreme Court      because  to the contrary  a number of major newspaper editorial      boards in Texas have expressed their opposition to Justice Owens      confirmation to the federal appellate bench  The San Antonio Express News criticized      Owen because  o n the Texas Supreme Court  she always voted with a      small court minority that consistently tries to bypass the law as      written by the Legislature   The Houston Chronicle cited complaints      about Owen run from a penchant for overturning jury verdicts on      tortuous readings of the law to a distinct bias against consumers      and in favor of large corporations  and the newspaper concluded      that she has shown a clear preference for ruling to achieve a      particular result rather than impartially interpreting the law       Anyone willing to look objectively at Owen s record would be      hard pressed to deny that  The Austin American Statesman wrote that Owen is out of      the broad mainstream of jurisprudence and seems all too willing to      bend the law to fit her views  rather than the reverse  The      newspaper continued  Owen also could usually be counted upon in any      important case that pitted an individual or group of individuals      against business interests to side with business  Editorial boards throughout the country echo the opinions of      Owens home state newspapers  Newspapers from the Palm Beach      Post and the Charleston Gazette to the Los Angeles      Times and the Detroit Free Press have spoken out against      this extreme nomination  The Atlanta Journal Constitution      wrote that Owen has a lopsided record favoring large corporations       while the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote that  e ven her      court colleagues have commented on her habit of twisting law to fit      her hyperconservative political views and that Owen s ethical      compass is apparently broken  Educated observers who review      Priscilla Owens record recognize that she is an ends oriented      judicial activist who is not an appropriate nominee for a lifetime      appointment to one of the most important courts in the land       Conclusion When he nominated Priscilla Owen  President      Bush said that his standard for judging judicial nominees would be      that they Ashare      a commitment to follow and apply the law  not to make law from the      bench   He      said he is against judicial activism  Yet he has appointed judicial      activists like Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown   Under President Bushs own standards  Justice      Owen s record of ends oriented judicial activism does not qualify      her for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench   The President has often spoken of judicial      activism without acknowledging that ends oriented decision making      can come easily to extreme ideological nominees  In the case of      Priscilla Owen  we see a perfect example of such an approach to the      law  and I cannot support it  The oath taken by federal judges      affirms their commitment to     Aadminister      justice without respect to persons  and do equal right to the poor      and to the rich        No one who enters a federal courtroom should have to wonder whether      he or she will be fairly heard by the judge   Justice Priscilla Owen s record of judicial      activism and ends oriented decision making leaves me with grave      doubt about her ability to be a fair judge  The President says he      opposes putting judicial activists on the federal bench  yet Justice      Priscilla Owen unquestionably is a judicial activist  I cannot vote      to confirm her for this appointment to one of the highest courts in      the land  I have said time and time again that if      somebody walks into a federal court  they should not have to wonder      whether they will be treated fairly based on whether they are a      Republican or a Democrat  a defendant or a plaintiff  rich or poor       They should know that they are going to be treated fairly no matter      who they are and that their case will be determined on the merits       In Priscilla Owens case  her record shows that litigants cannot be      sure of that  The President may well get the votes to put Priscilla      Owen on the Fifth Circuit today  but
