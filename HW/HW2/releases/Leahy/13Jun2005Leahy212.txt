       Floor Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Guantanamo Bay Has Become A   Blot And A Black Hole                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Floor Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy     Guantanamo Bay Has Become A Blot And A Black Hole     June 13  2005  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  it has been      well over three years since the Administration began to hold      detainees at the U S  Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  The first      batch of 20 detainees arrived in January 2002  There are now more      than 500 detainees at Guantanamo  although the exact number is      unclear   In fact  there is much that we do not      know about our governments activities at Guantanamo  From the      start  the Administrations answer to every question regarding this      secret detention facility has been  Trust us  Trust us that we      know the law  and that we will comply with it  Trust us to treat      detainees humanely and in accordance with our laws and treaties       Trust us that Guantanamo will make Americans safer  More than three      years later  the one thing we know for sure about Guantanamo is that      any trust we may have had was misplaced   First  the Administration did not know      or follow the law  The list of reversals of this Administrations      policies and practices is long  From the Supreme Courts rejection      of the claim that Guantanamo Bay is a land of legal limbo  or  as      one Administration official has said  the legal equivalent of outer      space    to a recent district court holding that the current      military commission regulations are unlawful  there is much that      needs attention and correction   Second  the Administration has not      lived up to its promise to treat detainees humanely  Even with the      Administrations continued stonewalling against any independent      investigation into the mistreatment of detainees  we continue to      learn of more abuses on almost a daily basis  If American POWs were      treated in this way  the Administration would be up in arms  Yet      when these actions take place at Guantanamo  the Administration      refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing  The dangerous implications      that this posture has for our own troops and citizens are obvious        Third  and this brings us to the      bottom line  Guantanamo has not made our country safer  It is      increasingly clear that the Administrations policies have seriously      damaged our reputation in the world and that they are making us less      safe  The stain of Guantanamo has become the primary recruiting      tool for our enemies  President Bush often speaks of spreading      democratic values across the Middle East  but Guantanamo is not a      reflection of the values that he encourages other nations to adopt       The United States has often criticized other nations for operating      secret prisons  where detainees are hidden away and denied any      meaningful opportunity to contest their detention  Now we have our      own such prisons  Even if the Administration fails to see the      hypocrisy in this situation  I can assure you that the rest of the      world does not    Guantanamo Bay  in addition to Abu      Ghraib    is a national disgrace  an international embarrassment to      us and to our ideals  and a festering threat to our security  It is      a legal black hole that dishonors our principles  America was once      viewed as a leader in human rights and the rule of law  but      Guantanamo has drained our leadership  our credibility and the      worlds goodwill for America at alarming rates  Even our closest      allies cannot condone the policies embraced by this government  not      to mention the significant damage that has been caused by      allegations and proven incidents of detainee abuse in Iraq       Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  These are not the policies of a great      and good nation like ours  and this is not the American system of      justice   The 9 11 Commission understood that      military strength alone is not sufficient to defend our nation      against terrorism  there must also be a role for working      cooperatively with the rest of the world  In its report  the      Commission said that the U S  government must define what the      message is  what it stands for  We should offer an example of moral      leadership in the world  committed to treat people humanely  abide      by the rule of law  and be generous and caring to our neighbors       Guantanamo Bay is not the way to do this   The Administration got itself into      this mess because it refused to accept Congress as a partner in its      so called war on terror and insisted on acting unilaterally       Following the start of combat in Afghanistan in October 2001  I      urged President Bush to work with Congress to fashion appropriate      rules and procedures for detaining and punishing suspected      terrorists  As I noted at the time  our government is at its      strongest when the Executive and Legislative branches of government      act in concert  Unfortunately  the President was determined to go      it alone   Up until now  this Republican led      Congress has been content to go along for the ride  As the      Administration dug itself deeper and deeper into a hole  we stood      idly by  Instead of providing checks and balances  we wrote one      blank check after another   This must change  The Constitution      provides that Congress  not the President  has the power to make      Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water  Congress  not the      President  has the power to define and punish Offenses against the      Law of Nations  And perhaps most importantly  Congress  not the      President  has the power of the purse   What is the Administrations plan for      Guantanamo Bay  assuming there is one  What does the Administration      intend to do with the more than 500 detainees still imprisoned      there  How many will be released  and when  How many will be      charged and tried  and when    The Administration consistently      insists that these detainees pose a threat to the safety of      Americans  Vice President Cheney said that the other day  If that      is true  there must be credible evidence to support it  If there is      such evidence  then they should prosecute these people     But we also know that some of the      detainees have been wrongly detained  And I suspect there are      others who have not yet been released  against whom the evidence is      weak at best  It is one thing if they are being detained in      accordance with the Geneva Conventions  But if not  they do not      belong there    Guantanamo Bay is causing immeasurable      damage to our reputation as a defender of democracy and a beacon of      human rights around the world  It has become a legal black hole and      a rallying cry for our enemies  fueling hostility against us and      against our policies  The Administration has yet to articulate a      coherent plan to repair the damage  The Congress has abdicated its      oversight responsibilities for far too long  The Administration has      placed this nation in an untenable situation  and it is time for      Congress to demand a way out
