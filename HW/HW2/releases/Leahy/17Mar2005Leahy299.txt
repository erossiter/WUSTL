Blocking Bush s Raid On Crime Victims Fund  The Senate on Thursday           night by voice vote adopted Senator Patrick Leahys Sense of the Senate           amendment rejecting the rescission of more than  1 billion from the           Crime Victims Fund during consideration of the FY 2006 Budget           Resolution  Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Senate           Judiciary Committee  offered his amendment to block the zeroing out of           the fund at the end of fiscal year 2006  The fund serves           roughly 4 million crime victims a year including victims of domestic           violence  sexual assault  child abuse  elder abuse  and drunk driving            as well as survivors of homicide victims  The fund does not depend on           taxpayer revenues  it is supported from federal criminal fines            penalties  bonds and private donations  Below is Leahys statement on           the amendment             _________________             Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy          On Leahy Amendment  203 to the Budget Resolution  S Con  Res  18           Regarding Rescission of the Crime Victims Fund          March 17  2005 Mr  LEAHY  Mr            President  I offer a Sense of the Senate amendment intended to head off           the Administrations plans to raid the Crime Victims Fund of more than            1 2 billion  I am joined by Senators Kennedy  Mikulski  Feingold            Biden and Durbin  Obama and Dodd  and I thank them for their support as           well as their work on behalf of crime victims  The Crime Victims Fund           was created under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984  VOCA  as a separate           account  meaning that the revenues in the Fund are intended to be used           solely for financial support of victim services  The Fund is derived           from federal criminal fines  forfeitures  and special assessments  it           does not depend upon taxpayer revenues  Since its inception  amounts           deposited into the Fund in a given fiscal year have remained available           to support victim services in subsequent fiscal years  Following a proposal           in the Presidents budget  the Budget Resolution would rescind all           amounts remaining in the Fund at the end of FY 2006  an estimated            1 267 billion  That would leave the Fund with a balance of zero going           into FY 2007 to support vital victim services   This is shameful and           unacceptable  If the budget is a statement of our nations priorities            and it is  then we are saying to crime victims  Sorry  but your           suffering is no longer our concern  The Senate must not  through its           silence and compliance with the Presidents budget request  tell crime           victims that their concerns and suffering do not rise to the level of           being a national priority   My amendment expresses           the sense of the Senate that we reject the proposed rescission  It           assumes that all amounts that have been and will be deposited into the           Crime Victims Fund  including all amounts to be deposited in FY 2006 and           thereafter  will remain in the Fund for use as authorized by the Victims           of Crime Act  The Crime Victims Fund           is the nations premier vehicle for the support of victims services            Nearly 90 percent of the Fund is used to award State crime victim           compensation and victim assistance formula grants  VOCA funded victim           assistance programs serve nearly 4 million crime victims each year            including victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  child abuse            elder abuse  and drunk driving  as well as survivors of homicide           victims  VOCA funded compensation programs have helped hundreds of           thousands of victims of violent crime   The Crime Victims Fund           also serves victims of federal crimes  VOCA funding supports victim           assistance services provided by U S  Attorneys Offices and the FBI  as           well as the federal victim notification system  It is used for child           abuse prevention and treatment grants  and it is also used to provide           emergency relief to victims of terrorism and mass violence  Since FY 2000            Congress has set a cap on annual Fund obligations expressly for the           purpose of ensuring that a stable level of funding will remain           available for these programs in future years  The rainy day fund           created by this spending cap has been used to make up the difference           between annual deposits and distributions three times during the past           six years   When Congress began           considering caps on Fund obligations  I proposed and Congress enacted an           amendment to the Victims of Crime Act to clarify our intent to stabilize           and preserve the Fund for the benefit of victims  The amendment  now           codified at section 10601 c  of title 42  requires that all sums           deposited in the Fund in any fiscal year that are not made available for           obligation by Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall remain in the           Fund for obligation in future fiscal years  without fiscal year           limitation  Thus  in both the authorization and the appropriations           processes  Congress has clearly and emphatically stated its intent to           maintain a stable source of federal support for essential victim           services  Over the past four           years  the Bush Administration and this Republican Congress have           squandered record surpluses and racked up  7 6 trillion in Federal debt           as a result of reckless spending and budget busting tax cuts  Now the           Bush Administration proposes to reduce the deficit by siphoning off           resources that we set aside to assist victims of crime   The entire crime victims community stands           united in opposition to the proposed rescission  I ask unanimous           consent to put in the record a letter dated March 12  2005  from a           number of victims organizations  including the National Center for           Victims of Crime  the National Network to End Domestic Violence  the           National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children  the National           Childrens Alliance  and Mothers Against Drunk Driving  These           organizations represent the millions of Americans who become victims of           crime every year  They wrote that rescinding the Fund at the end of FY           2006 would create a disastrous situation for victim service providers           and their clients  In every State and           every community across the country  the Crime Victims Fund plays an           essential role in helping crime victims and their families meet critical           expenses  recover from the horrific crimes they endured  and move           forward with their lives  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment           and preserve the Fund  as we promised we would  for the benefit of           victims
