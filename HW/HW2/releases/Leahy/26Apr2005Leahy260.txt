       Leahy  Crapo Organize Bipartisan Coalition To Protect Crime Victims Fund   From Bush Raid                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy  Crapo Organize Bipartisan Coalition     To Protect Crime Victims Fund From Bush Raid   WASHINGTON  Tuesday  April 26   Senators      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Mike Crapo  R Idaho  assembled a      bipartisan group of 29 senators in an effort to protect the Crime      Victims Fund from a proposed raid by the Bush Administration  In a      letter sent Monday  the bipartisan coalition requested that the      chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice      and Science of the Committee on Appropriations reject any proposals      to zero out or reduce the amount of the Fund  The Bush      Administration has proposed draining the Fund at the end of fiscal      year 2006  The Senate  last month  adopted an amendment sponsored by      Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  to head off the rescission of more than an estimated  1      billion from the Fund during consideration of the FY 2006 Budget      Resolution   The Fund serves roughly 4 million crime victims      a year including victims of domestic violence  sexual assault  child      abuse  elder abuse  and drunk driving  as well as survivors of      homicide victims  The Fund does not depend on taxpayer revenues  it      is supported from federal criminal fines  penalties  bonds and      private donations  Below and attached is the signed letter from the      bipartisan group  Background material on the fund and the Bush      Administrations proposal to drain it follows               VOCA      Myths vs Facts The Crime Victims Fund was created in 1984 as      part of the Victims of Crime Act  VOCA  as a separate account      dedicated to supporting services for victims of crime  All monies      deposited into the Fund come from Federal criminal fines  bail      forfeitures and special assessments and not from taxpayer revenues       Because of fluctuations in Fund deposits  beginning in 2000       Congress has delayed obligating a certain amount of Fund deposits in      order to ensure stable funding in future years  As a result  a      rainy day balance has been established and used to make up the      difference between the annual deposits and the cap  The      Administration is now proposing to remove that rainy day balance      plus all amounts projected to be deposited into the Fund during FY      2006  leaving the Fund with no money at the start of FY 2007  The      following examines Administration statements regarding this      proposal  Myth  The Administration is not      eliminating the Crime Victims Fund   Fact  While the Crime Victims Fund would      statutorily still exist  it would be an empty Fund at the beginning      of Fiscal Year 2007  thus rendering it virtually nonexistent to      support critical crime victim compensation  victim assistance      services  Federal employees who serve crime victims in the Federal      criminal justice system and emergency funding in the event of a      terrorist or mass violence incident  Myth  The Administration is proposing an      increase of  30 million in victim services in FY 2006   Fact  The Administration is proposing a      VOCA cap of  650 million for FY 2006  That amount is actually  25      million less than the amount the Administration recommended spending      for FY 2005  although Congress ultimately set the cap at  620      million   Myth  The Administration refers to the      amounts to be taken out of the Fund as surplus  unneeded  and      excess   Fact  This is false for two reasons       First  had Congress not put a cap on the annual amounts that could      be obligated from the Fund  all these funds would have already been      distributed and used for victim services  And second  the amounts      retained in the Fund have  in fact  been used as planned in three of      the past six years when deposits were less than the annual cap  and       according to the Administrations own projections  the same need      will arise in FY 2006  Myth  Because Congress failed to use      these funds  they ought to go back to taxpayers   Fact  Congress failed at nothing  It      succeeded in establishing stable funding for victim services and to      make up any deficit between its annual cap and current revenue       Thus  that strategy of establishing a rainy day reserve has met its      two intended purposes  Moreover  to suggest that any of these funds      ought to be returned to taxpayers overlooks the genius of President      Reagans core plan  it was not innocent taxpayers he asked to assist      crime victims in need but the criminal victimizers who had been      found guilty in the Federal courts  Myth  The money can be paid out of the      Fund as victims need it  Fact  VOCA funds are not paid directly      to crime victims  Rather  VOCA requires the U S  Department of      Justice to make annual grants to States for crime victim      compensation to pay benefits to victims and to support programs that      provide personal services to victims  The two state grants are      calculated through a statutory formula applied to the amount      available each year  If  as the Administration proposes  there is no      money in the Fund at the beginning of fiscal year 2007  then there      can be no money by which the State grants can be calculated and      distributed that year
