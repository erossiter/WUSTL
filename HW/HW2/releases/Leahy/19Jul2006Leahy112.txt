Republican       supported the bill  The House passed its bill last week       Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the ranking Democratic member of      the panel  is an original co sponsor of the Senate bill  The      bill now moves to the Senate floor for action  which could occur      as early as this week  Leahys statement follows       Opening      Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Executive Business Meeting     July 19  2006   I thank the Chairman      for agreeing to my suggestion to meet today in a special session      to consider our bipartisan  bicameral legislation to reauthorize      the Voting Rights Act  Our bill is cosponsored by the      Republican and Democratic leaders  by a bipartisan majority of      this Committee and by a bipartisan majority of the Senate         Our bill  S  2703 is      named for three civil rights leaders  Fannie Lou Hamer was a      courageous advocate for the right to vote  She nearly gave her      life to secure the right to vote for all Americans  Coretta      Scott King was a tenacious fighter for equality through the      Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and up to her recent passing      earlier this year  Everyone on this Committee can remember when      less than a year ago  the body of Rosa Parks lay in state in the      Capitol across the street  the first African American woman so      honored  Rosa Parks dignified refusal to be treated as a      second class citizen sparked the  Montgomery bus      boycotts that is often cited as the symbolic beginning of the      modern civil rights movement     Senator Salzar made      what I believe is a good suggestion that I hope will be      universally accepted  He suggested that we include an Hispanic      civil rights leader in the naming of the bill  as well  On his      behalf I will be prepared to ask that the name of Cesar Chavez      be added to the name of our Senate bill     The Voting Rights      Act is the cornerstone of our civil rights laws  We honor these      leaders  people of vision and strength  and those who died      fighting with them by ensuring that their struggles are not      forsaken  and not forgotten  We honor their legacy by      reaffirming our commitment to protect the right to vote for all      Americans     Reauthorizing and      restoring the Voting Rights Act is the right thing to do  not      only for those who came before us  the brave people who fought      for equality during the second reconstruction  but also for      those who come after us  our children and our grandchildren  No      ones right to vote should be abridged  suppressed or denied in      the  United States of America     Last week  after      months of work  the House of Representatives  led by Congressmen      John Conyers  Mel Watt  John Lewis and Chairman Sensenbrenner       rejected all efforts to reduce the sweep and effect of the      Voting Rights Act  We are fortunate to have on this Committee      both Senators from the  Badger State  both strong cosponsors      of the bill  I commend the senior Senator  Senator Kohl  for      his active support and leadership  He is a Senator universally      known and respected as a man of ultimate fairness  I also thank      Senator Feingold  the Ranking Member of the      Constitution Subcommittee  for his characteristic diligence and      principled action     As Congressman John      Lewis said  When historians pick up their pens and write about      this period  let it be said that those of us in the Congress in      2006  we did the right thing  And our forefathers and our      foremothers would be very proud of us  Let us pass a clean bill      without any amendments  Our bill passed the House of      Representatives with 390 votes in favor after it rejected all      four amendments offered there  I congratulate our House      cosponsors on their successful efforts and hope that we can      repeat them here in the Senate     On May 2nd       our congressional leadership joined together on the steps of the      Capitol to announce a bipartisan and bicameral introduction of      the Voting Rights Act  it was an historic announcement and an      occasion almost unprecedented during the last  5 years of      partisanship     Over the last four      months this Committee has held 9 hearings into aspects of these      matters and on the bill itself  In another indication of      bipartisanship  those hearings have been chaired by a large      number of Members of this Committee  including both Republicans      and Democrats  No one can say that they hearings were not      fairly conducted    After almost a month to prepare      for this markup  it is time for us to act  We have less than      two dozen legislative days left in this session of Congress       The House of Representatives delayed consideration of the Voting      Rights Act for a month due to Republican recalcitrance  We hope      not to suffer the same delay  It is time for us to debate       consider and vote on this important legislation  We should pass      the bill in the same form as the House so it will go directly to      the Presidents desk by the August recess     We cannot relent in      our fight for the fundamental civil rights of all Americans       Working together  we should report out a clean  bipartisan      voting rights bill  Congress has reauthorized and revitalized      the Act four times  each time with overwhelmingly bipartisan      support pursuant to its constitutional powers  This is no time      for backsliding  this is the time to move forward together
