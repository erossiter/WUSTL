       Judiciary Panel Says  NOPEC  to OPEC  Approves Bipartisan Bill To Permit   Legal Action Against Oil Cartel                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Judiciary Panel Says NOPEC To OPEC     Approves Bipartisan Bill To Permit Legal Action Against Oil Cartel         WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 14   The Senate Judiciary Committee on     Thursday unanimously passed bipartisan legislation by Sen  Patrick Leahy     and others that for the first time would open the worlds oil cartel to     U S  antitrust enforcement  The bill would allow the     U S  Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to file     antitrust lawsuits against foreign states  such as members of the Oil     Producing and Exporting Countries  OPEC   for price fixing and other     anticompetitive activities  said Leahy  who co sponsored the bill with     Sens  Mike DeWine  R Ohio  and Herb Kohl  D Wisc    High oil import costs this     year have affected all Americans in the form of record high gasoline     prices that continue to soar  Leahy  D Vt    the ranking     Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  joined DeWine and Kohl      the chairman and the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary     Committee s Subcommittee on Antitrust  Business Rights and Competition      in introducing the bill last month in response to skyrocketing gas     prices across the nation  which can be partially attributed to     price fixing activities of the OPEC countries  Leahy also is a senior     member of the antitrust panel and has sponsored similar bills in     previous years   We are one step closer to     getting this bill on the books and available for use against the oil     cartel  said Leahy  OPEC nations openly conspire to violate the norms     of our antitrust laws  yet they expect to do business with us and reap     the benefits  It is past time for Congress to approve these antitrust     tools as a check on OPECs abuses    The bill  The No Oil     Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  NOPEC   drops OPEC and other     nations from the protections of Foreign Services Immunity Act   FSIA       to the extent that those governments are engaged in price fixing or     other anticompetitive activities with regard to pricing  production and     distribution of petroleum products  NOPEC would make OPEC s activities     actionable under antitrust laws  The bill also authorizes lawsuits in     U S  federal court against oil cartel members by the Justice Department     and the Federal Trade Commission   Leahy has raised concerns     that oil companies are profiting at the expense of American consumers      On average  gas prices have reached  2 29 per gallon and could climb to      2 50 by Labor Day  according to experts  This price gouging by     overseas oil cartels has already put a strain on Vermonters and others     who have endured months of skyrocketing gas prices and soaring home     heating oil prices this winter  said Leahy  Our economy  our farmers      and our families need relief from this artificial pricing scheme  Under current law      antitrust actions may be filed against private companies  but OPEC     nations are currently protected by the FSIA  which allows for the     prosecution of foreign governments who are engaged in commercial     activity   but prohibits prosecution in those states are engaged in     governmental activity   A federal court has ruled that the actions of     OPEC are governmental actions and thus not commercial activity  Leahy has also pushed for     tighter regulation of oil  natural gas  and other futures transactions     by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC   He said it is     critical to protect the integrity of oil and natural gas markets in     addressing Americas energy needs and has encouraged stronger     congressional oversight of anti fraud and anti manipulation of these     sometimes volatile markets

 Ranking Democrat  Senate Judiciary Committee    On Committee Markup of the NOPEC Bill    April 14  2005 We     should quickly report this NOPEC bill to the full Senate  We have done     so before  but this time I hope that it will actually become law  The     production quotas set by OPEC continue to take a debilitating toll on     our economy  our families  and our farmers  Unless this bill becomes     law  consumers across the nation will continue to suffer  The White     House refuses to work on righting this wrong  so Congress must provide     law enforcement with the tools necessary to fight OPECs anticompetitive     practices   This     week  the average price for regular gasoline reached  2 29 per gallon      And last Friday  the Department of Energy predicted that consumers may     be paying  2 50 per gallon by Labor Day  It is past time to act on     several fronts  In addition to my support of the NOPEC bill  I am     working to give the Commodities Futures Trading Commission new powers      The Agriculture Committee is taking up legislation this year to     reauthorize the Commission  and I believe we will be successful in     adding anti fraud  anti market manipulation  and energy futures     oversight powers to the CFTC  There have been significant swings in the     energy futures market recently  and this allows for the possibility of     manipulation  the CFTC should have the authority it needs  I also     think the CFTC needs a stronger oversight role in over the counter     foreign exchange and option contacts   The     artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us  The     hardworking farmers of Vermont exemplify this crisis      Increasing energy costs can add thousands of dollars to the costs of     operating a 100 head dairy operation in the Northeast  And while that     fact is hitting home  quite literally for me  these soaring prices     affect American industries in every state  Moreover  summer is coming      and many families are going to find that OPEC has put an expensive crimp     in their plans  Some are likely to stay home  others will pay more to     drive or to fly so that they can visit their families or take their     well deserved vacations   I     repeat myself when I say this  but it grows ever more true  Americans     deserve better  and it is time for Congress to act
