       Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary   Committee  Executive Business Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting     May 4  2006  Gas Prices and Legislation Last week we were      able to join together without a single dissent to report to the      Senate the Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006   S 2557        This is timely and important legislation that follows our hearing on      March 14  I had hoped that following completion of the emergency      supplemental appropriations bill  the Senate would turn its      attention to legislation like ours that seeks to help alleviate the      burdens on ordinary  hardworking Americans by the record high prices      for gas  Regrettably  that is not happening in this      Republican controlled Senate   Although the bill      that the Republican leadership is promoting has been termed silly      and stupid by other Republicans  there are proposals that do make      sense and can make a difference  I wish the Senate were considering      those proposals  Unfortunately  we will waste the rest of this week      and a good part of next week in a repeat of a futile attempt to      restrict those injured by medical malpractice from seeking redress       Senator Kennedy and I have circulated a dear colleague on that      matter that I ask be made part of the record  Instead of      undermining peoples rights  I wish we would take up our proposal to      end the special interest protection for big insurance and make them      subject to our antitrust laws and competition  This Committee had a      hearing scheduled on our proposal  and ending misguided antitrust      exemption  that I hope will be rescheduled        When President Bush took office  Americans could fill their cars on      gasoline that cost  1 45 per gallon  In less than six years  fuel      prices have skyrocketed more than100 percent  more than doubled       The end is nowhere in sight  unless we do something to help keep      costs down  Over the years I have warned about a gallon of gasoline      costing  2 50 or  3  I fear  4 a gallon gasoline will be upon us      all by summer   Regrettably  the      tens of millions of dollars that big oil companies have reportedly      committed to their lobbying campaigns is apparently having the      effect of stalling congressional action  Those of us committed to      meaningful change on behalf of the American people have our work cut      out for us    Voting Rights and      Immigration On Tuesday some      of us on this Committee participated in an extraordinary bipartisan       bicameral event a display of unity in our government that we have      not seen in the last 6 years   Of course Senator      Dashcle and Democrats reached out to the President and congressional      Republicans after 9 11  but it was not long before our good will was      taken advantage of and good men and women like Max Cleland were      under partisan assault    Tuesday afternoon      was different  The Democratic and Republican leadership of the      Senate  the Democratic and Republican leadership of the House  the      bipartisan leadership of the House Judiciary Committee and the      bipartisan leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee were all      together  and all appeared united in our determination to protect      the right to vote for every American  regardless of economic      circumstances  geography  race  or language ability  That      extraordinary bipartisan  bicameral coalition came together to      demonstrate our agreement on legislation reauthorizing the expiring      provisions of the historic Voting Rights Act   We have proceeded      to introduce companion bills  The Senate bill is cosponsored by      both leaders  Senator Frist and Senator Reid  as well as many      Members of this Committee  I mention these      important developments because they were not a partisan election      year stunt  but a meaningful joining together of Republicans and      Democrats  Maybe because it was not a fight it did not generate      much in the way of media attention  which is really too bad    Last week we      opened our hearings on this fundamental matter and next week they      will continue  Chairman Sensenbrenner has an ambitious schedule for      marking up the House companion bill next week and having the House      pass it without delay  He is leading the way  Enactment of this      measure will be a significant portion of his legacy as Chairman of      the House Judiciary Committee  I hope that we can match his effort      and conclude our hearings  as Chairman Specter has said  by May 17      and our Committee markup before Memorial Day   It is my hope      that we can  through the same sort of bipartisan coalition  return      to and enact fair and comprehensive immigration legislation that      strengthens our border enforcement while providing a path to earned      citizenship for so many who work hard and want to contribute to our      diversity and productivity as a nation    Oversight The Committee      held a hearing this week with the FBI Director in which Republicans      and Democrats asked questions and raised concerns  We need to do      more of that  Thinking back to some of the comments of the Chairman      last Thursday at our meeting and thereafter  I was again struck by      how unresponsive the Bush Cheney Administration has been when we      seek to fulfill our constitutional role as a check and conduct      oversight  We will have an opportunity for more thorough discussion      of this when we turn to how little we know about the Presidents      program for warrantless wiretapping of Americans contrary to the      provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  At this      juncture I simply wish to note that I will support  and I think the      Democratic Members of the Committee  will support more concerted      efforts to get answers to our questions  Joining together       Republican and Democratic Members could insist upon responsive      answers and needed information  I hope that we will follow through      in that regard on these important matters
