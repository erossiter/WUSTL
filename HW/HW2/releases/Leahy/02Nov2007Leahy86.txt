       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Nomination Of Michael Mukasey To Be   Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK     LEAHY            VERMONT                 Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee    On The Nomination Of       Michael B  Mukasey  To Be Attorney General Of       The United States  Burlington  Vermont  Friday  November 2  2007             Nothing is more fundamental to our constitutional democracy than       our basic tenet that no one is above the law       This Administration has undercut       that precept time and time again  We have seen this       Administration promote immunity over accountability  secrecy       over responsiveness to congressional oversight  and unilateral       power over the checks and balances that have defined this Nation       and protected Americans rights and freedom for more than two       centuries      This Administrations corrosive       view that the President is above the law and may override the       law as he chooses is about as extreme a view of executive power       as I have witnessed  That not only is dead wrong in       constitutional terms  but it is extremely dangerous to our       republic  The cost to American liberty  to our standing in the       world and to the security of our soldiers and citizens is       staggering  even more than the trillion dollar cost of the war       in Iraq  The Administration has compounded its lawlessness by       cloaking its policies and miscalculations under a veil of       secrecy  leaving Congress  the courts and the American people in       the dark about what they are doing        It is the duty of the Attorney       General to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law  not to       try to bend the law to a Presidents agenda  When the infamous       Bybee Memo came to light  even this Administration had to       formally withdraw it  Yet I am concerned that the defining down       of torture  of the rule of law and of American values continues       in this Administration       The United States and its Attorney       General must stand for the rule of law  and stand in the       breach  if need be  There is no question in my mind that       waterboarding is torture and is illegal under our laws and       treaty obligations       This issue is not new  It was an       important factor in my vote against the previous nomination of       Alberto Gonzales  At that time I noted that when we came into       Iraqi prisons and found torture  Americas standing to object       was sorely compromised  This week we hear reports of the       militia of Muqtada al Sadr       showcasing torture victims   The searing photographs from Abu       Ghraib have made it harder to create and maintain the alliances       we need to prevail against those who threaten us  Those abuses       serve as recruiting posters for the terrorists  When the United       States cannot declare clearly that waterboarding is torture        that it is illegal  and that it will not be tolerated  what does       that mean to other governments  and what comfort does that       provide the worlds most repressive regimes      To be true to       Americas purpose and values  we need a government that leads       the way in upholding human rights    not one secretly developing       legalistic rationalizations for circumventing them      I am       proud that Congress years ago passed and has stood by the Leahy       Law  It is a law that requires our government to end assistance       to any foreign security force unit if the Secretary of State has       credible evidence that it has committed a gross violation of       human rights  unless that government is taking effective       measures to bring the responsible individuals to justice  What       kind of double standard does America set if we cannot declare       waterboarding to be illegal         If an American was captured and waterboarded  would we consider       it torture and want to raise bloody hell about it  Of course we       would      There are fundamental issues that       require moral and legal clarity  and the willingness to act on       our convictions    and this is one of them  The United States       does not torture  The United States does not inflict cruel        inhuman  and degrading treatment  This is part of the moral       fiber of our country and our historical place as a world leader       on human rights  and it has long been fixed in our laws  our       constitution  and our values      It was true when General George       Washington insisted that Americas troops treat British soldiers       humanely  It was true when President Theodore Roosevelt acted       in 1902 to first court martial and then dismiss an American       general for allowing his troops to engage in water torture in       the Philippines  Teddy Roosevelt  the former Rough Rider and       war hero  wrote  Great as the provocation has been in dealing       with foes who habitually resort to treachery  murder and torture       against our men  nothing can justify the use of torture or       inhuman conduct of any kind on the part of the American Army        He was right  No one acting on behalf of the United States       should stoop to the level of those in human history who have       resorted to torture      There may be interrogation       techniques that require close examination and extensive       briefings  Waterboarding is not among them  No American should       need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is       torture  Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the       Spanish Inquisition  We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for       waterboarding after World War II           As Rear Admiral John Hutson        former Judge Advocate General of the Navy  testified this year       before the Judiciary Committee  Other than perhaps the rack       and thumbscrews  water boarding is the most iconic example of       torture in history  It has been repudiated for centuries        Its a little disconcerting to hear now that were not quite       sure where water boarding fits in the scheme of things  I think       we have to be very sure where it fits in the scheme of things        Unquote      Judge Mukasey was not asked to       evaluate any secret facts and circumstances  He was asked       whether waterboarding is illegal  Our law makes torture       illegal  and waterboarding is torture  and it is illegal  It is       frankly not dependent on any  quote  relevant facts and       circumstances of the techniques past or proposed use         When it comes to our core values        the things that make our country great and that define Americas       place in the world  these values do not waver from president to       president  America should continue to stand against torture            I agree with Senator John McCain        who sadly knows too much about the issue of torture  He said       recently  Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be       unsure  It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and       being used on Buddhist monks as we speak   No presidential signing statement or       secret Administration memo can be allowed to change our laws       prohibitions against waterboarding      The America I grew up in has been       a beacon to the world  standing for human rights and calling out       the tyrants and despots who abuse them  Like Americans across       the land  when we were growing up  Vermonters knew instinctively       that it is hard to defend the moral high ground by taking the       low road      I am eager to restore strong       leadership and independence to the Department of Justice  I       like Michael Mukasey  I wish that I could support his       nomination  But I cannot  America needs to be certain and       confident of the bedrock principle  deeply embedded in our laws       and our values  that no one  not even the President  is above       the law       Accordingly  when the Judiciary       Committee considers this nomination on Tuesday  I must vote no       on this nomination
