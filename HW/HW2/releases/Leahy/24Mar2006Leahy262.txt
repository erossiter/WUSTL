       Vermont Congressional Delegation And Governor Send Letter To Associated   Press About Graff Dismissal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           BREAKING   Vermont Congressional Delegation And      Governor      Send Letter To Associated Press About Graff Dismissal   Below is      the text of a letter sent to the Associated Press by Sens  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt  and Jim Jeffords  I Vt    Cong  Bernie Sanders  I Vt         and Gov  Jim Douglas  R Vt    On the dismissal of Chris Graff as      head of the APs Vermont Bureau              March 24  2006 Mr  Thomas A       Curley President and      Chief Executive Officer     The Associated Press     450  W  33rd      Street    New York  N Y       10001      Dear Mr  Curley  Along with our      Vermont constituents  we are stunned  outraged      and saddened by the summary dismissal this week of the longtime head of      APs Vermont Bureau  Chris Graff       We send this      letter without Mr  Graffs consent or even his knowledge  and he      probably would have asked us not to send it if we had asked  But      the prominence of this position  the importance of AP to our state      and its communities  and the poor treatment of a prominent and      respected Vermont      journalist of Chris Graffs caliber make this a matter that we      cannot ignore or passively accept  We realize that The Associated      Press is a private  member owned newsgathering service  but APs      vital presence in Vermont       as across the nation  clearly propels this decision into the realm      of public interest and concern  The public has placed its trust in      AP and  in turn  the public expects a degree of openness from AP      that has not been forthcoming  Accordingly  we expect a substantive      response to our requests  As news      subjects ourselves  we have not always enjoyed or agreed with APs      coverage decisions    the same can be said by any frequent news      subjects about the news organizations that regularly cover them         but we agree that  by any appropriate measure   Mr  Graff has      been fair  objective  public spirited  courageous and dedicated to      the publics right to know the truth  He has been a tremendous      credit to AP in Vermont      and beyond  It was completely      natural  for instance  when Vermont Public Television selected Mr       Graff more than a decade ago to be the permanent moderator of public      televisions two leading Vermont wide public affairs programs       There have been      many reports suggesting the reasons for Mr  Graffs abrupt      termination  Although we choose not to fuel speculation  we believe      that if any of these reports were founded  it would represent a      serious breach of trust by AP with its loyal      Vermont readership  If AP wants to repair      this rift  it must work to clear the air    to let the sunshine in         on this most unfortunate conclusion  We support      Chris Graffs immediate reinstatement  if that is what he would      want  Beyond that  we also ask for answers to questions that      continue to proliferate in the wake of this decision   Chris Graff is      the personification of the great attributes of good journalism       professionalism  courage  steadiness  and public service by honoring      the publics right to know  We would like to believe that      attributes like these  lived day to day by devoted reporters like      Chris Graff  will never go out of style   Sincerely   The      Vermont Congressional Delegation       JIM DOUGLAS  Governor     PATRICK LEAHY       U S  Senate     JIM JEFFORDS       U S  Senate     BERNIE SANDERS       U S  House of Representatives  Please reply      to  Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Governor Jim Douglas     433 Russell Senate      Building 109 State      Street  Pavilion     Washington  D C       20510      Montpelier  Vt  05609 0101 Sen  Jim      Jeffords     413 Dirksen Senate Building     Washington  D C       20510 Rep  Bernie      Sanders     2233 Rayburn House Office Building     Washington  D C       20515
