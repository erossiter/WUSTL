       Vermont Editor Testifies Before Leahy Panel On Need For Stronger Open   Government Laws                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Vermont Editor Testifies Before Leahy     Panel    On Need For Stronger Open Government Laws    WASHINGTON  Wednesday  March 14   A Vermont     newspaper editor and President of the Vermont Press Association     testified Wednesday before Senator Patrick Leahys Judiciary Committee     about the importance of transparency in government and the need to     strengthen federal open government laws   Leahy invited Sabina Haskell  editor of the     Brattleboro Reformer and President of the Vermont Press Association      to serve on a witness panel of leading media and FOIA experts who     testified before the committee at its hearing  Open Government      Reinvigorating the Freedom of Information Act  The Freedom of Information Act is clear in its     charge  We are a country where we do the peoples business  said     Haskell  who is also a founding member of the Vermont Coalition for Open     Government  And the people have the right to know what local  state     and federal officials are doing  The hearing focused on bipartisan legislation     introduced this week by Leahy and Senator John Cornyn  R Texas   also a     member of the committee  They introduced the Openness Promotes     Effectiveness in our National Government Act  OPEN Government Act of     2007   which would create more concrete deadlines for agencies to     respond to requests for information and ensure the public has easier     access to government records and information  From human rights abuses in Iraq  Afghanistan and     Guantanamo Bay  to environmental violations at home  to public     corruption at the highest levels of our government  information about     many of the important issues of our time have been obtained through FOIA      said Leahy  who introduced a similar bill in the last Congress  But     sadly  today FOIA also faces challenges like never before   The committees hearing coincides with the third     annual national Sunshine Week  a week devoted to creating a dialogue     about government transparency and the publics ability to access     information             Below     are Leahys statement from the hearing  and Haskells testimony       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Committee Of The Judiciary    Hearing On Open Government  Reinvigorating The Freedom Of Information     Act    March 14  2007 Today  the Committee holds an important hearing on     reinvigorating the Freedom of Information Act  The enactment of the     FOIA forty years ago was a watershed moment for our democracy  FOIA     guarantees the right of all Americans to obtain information from their     government and to know what their government is doing  Now in its fourth decade  FOIA has become an     indispensable tool in protecting the peoples right to know and in     shedding light on bad government policies and government waste  fraud     and abuse  Just this week    amid the growing scandal regarding the     firing of several of the Nations U S  Attorneys    we witnessed the     importance of openness in our government  We have also witnessed the     importance in Sunshine laws with the Justice Departments Inspector     Generals report on the FBIs abuse of National Security Letters  a     report required by the Sunshine provisions that I and others in Congress     worked hard to include in the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill   Openness is a cornerstone of our democracy and open     government laws like FOIA help guarantee that the peoples right to know     what their government is doing  From human rights abuses in Iraq      Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay  to environmental violations at home  to     public corruption at the highest levels of our government  information     about many of the important issues of our time have been obtained     through FOIA  But sadly  today  FOIA also faces challenges like never     before   During the past six years  the Bush Administration     has allowed lax FOIA enforcement and a near obsession with government     secrecy to dangerously weaken FOIA and to undercut the publics right to     know  Currently  federal agencies operate under a 2001 directive from     former Attorney General John Ashcroft that reverses the presumption of     compliance with FOIA requests previously issued by former Attorney     General Janet Reno  The Administration has also sought to erode FOIA by     including a broad FOIA waiver for critical infrastructure information in     the charter for the Department of Homeland Security    B the     biggest single rollback of FOIA in its history   The troubling setbacks to FOIA are coupled with the     expanding use of government secrecy stamps to over classify government     information and the unprecedented use of presidential signing statements     and the states secrets privilege to further erode the publics right to     know  The consequence of these policies is a FOIA process that is     plagued by excessive delays and focused on secrecy rather than     transparency  Today  the oldest FOIA requests pending in federal     agencies date back to 1989  before the collapse of the Soviet Empire      And  more than a year after the Presidents directive to government     agencies to improve their FOIA services  Americans who seek information     under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it   Just recently  the Government Accountability Office     found that federal agencies had 43 percent more FOIA requests     pending and outstanding in 2006  than they had in 2002  In addition  as     the number of  FOIA requests that Americans submit to federal     agencies each year continues to rise  our federal agencies remain unable      or unwilling    to keep pace  According to a new report by     OpenTheGovernment org  the number of FOIA requests submitted annually     has increased by more than 65 thousand requests  65 543  since     2004  But  because federal agencies have not kept up with this demand      more and more pending FOIA requests are being carried over from year to     year   FOIA implementation has also been hampered by the     increasing use of exemptions under section  b  3  of FOIA  allowing FOIA     exemptions to be snuck into legislation passed by the Congress without     debate or public scrutiny I am also troubled by the findings in a new     report by the National Security Archive that  ten years after Congress     passed the Electronic Freedom of Information Act  E FOIA  Amendments      which I coauthored in 1996  federal agencies are still not complying     with the requirements of that law   Earlier this week  Senator Cornyn and I     reintroduced the OPEN Government Act to address some of the major     problems that I have outlined regarding FOIA implementation  We drafted     this bill after a long and thoughtful process of consultation with     individuals and organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain information     and I hope that the Senate will promptly pass this bill   I appreciate the strong partnership that I have     with Senator Cornyn on open government issues and thank him for his     dedication to reinvigorating FOIA  I also thank the distinguished     witnesses that are appearing before the Committee today  They each     bring valuable perspectives on the importance of FOIA in guaranteeing     the publics right to know  There is much work to be done to correct the many     problems with lax FOIA enforcement  to ensure that our federal FOIA law     is properly enforced  Congress must do its part to make sure that this     open government law not only survives  but thrives for the next forty     years  This Committee will do its part to reinvigorate the Freedom of     Information Act  so that this important open government tool will be     available to future generations  I look forward to a meaningful     exchange                Testimony Of Sabina Haskell    Before The Senate Committee On The Judiciary    Hearing On Open Government  Reinvigorating The Freedom Of Information     Act    March 14  2007 Good morning and thank     you for inviting me to talk to you about the Freedom of Information Act     and the needed reforms to protect our First Amendment rights  I am     Sabina Haskell and I am the editor of the Brattleboro Reformer  a     newspaper 10 000 circulation located in southeastern Vermont    Even at that small     size  were the third largest newspaper in Vermont  And were in good     company  about 85 percent of the daily newspapers in the United States     have circulations of 50 000 or less  Smaller newspapers generally pursue     public records from state and local officials  rather than from federal     sources  but our daily efforts to do so are a quagmire and its getting     worse   In Vermont  where I am     also president of the Vermont Press Association  were frustrated by the     de facto sentiment of secrecy that seems to be seeping down to every     level of government  and it begins at the top  where it appears the     Bush administration is unilaterally stripping Americans of their     Constitutional rights   The most recent     example of the need for the Freedom of Information Act came only last     week  when the inspector general released a report revealing that the     FBI had improperly used the USA Patriot Act to obtain information about     people and businesses  It was through the efforts of Sen  Leahy and     others that the Freedom of Information Act was amended last year  making     it possible to obtain the records needed to expose the wrongdoing at the     bureau   The fear mongering     espoused at the federal level  where questions and requests for     information are viewed as suspect  is replayed time and time again at     state and local levels  I truly believe the effort to seal off the     federal government is the primary reason that there is increased efforts     to close the doors on transparent government at the local and state     levels   The anecdotes I will     share come from the dozen dailies and more than four dozen non dailies     that are members of the Vermont Press Association  Multiply us in     Vermont by all 50 states and almost 1 500 newspapers and you can     understand the magnitude of the problem   The Freedom of     Information Act is supposed to allow any person  individual  corporate      and regardless of citizenship  to request without explanation or     justification  access to existing  identifiable executive branch agency     records of any topic  Requesters are supposed to get timely answers at     little or no cost   But when we wanted a     copy of the Brattleboro police chiefs contract and a record of the days     hes away from his job  we were rebuffed  We were asked  Why did we want     that information  What were we going to do with it  We were told the     information would be provided when we answered their questions  We still     dont have the documents   In northeastern     Vermont  a weekly newspaper wanted to do a story on the town halls new     handicapped accessible ramp  paid for  in part  by federal grant money      It was supposed to be a nice  feel good story about disabled people     having better access to their local town hall   But when the paper     requested an architects drawing of the exterior wooden ramp to     illustrate the story  the newspaper was denied because of Homeland     Security concerns  Its hard to understand how a wooden ramp and     railings  built of pressure treated lumber  could be viewed as a     security risk  You could wait six months  drive by and then snap the     picture   In Winooski  the     school board went behind closed doors to make a sweetheart deal to buy     out the embattled superintendents contract  The Burlington Free Press     sued to get the details of the settlement and when the newspaper finally     won 18 months later and was given the documents  the school districts     attorneys response was  You dont think we lost  do you  By stalling      the school district and its lawyer kept running up the legal bill on the     taxpayers  knowing full well it was all public information  but hoping     some of the storm would subside by the time they agreed to follow the     law and release the information   In Jamaica  Vermont  a     town official  requested the public documents about the sheriffs     department       copies of     timesheets for the sheriff  a deputy and a detective       records     showing reimbursed or partially reimbursed expenses incurred by the     three      timesheets     and other records that would identify the whereabouts and activities     of the three for three days in January 2004   Two of the three     requests were denied under subsections of Vermont public records law      The third request was denied because the sheriff was unable to recall     any instance in which the three incurred a business expense that was     reimbursed by the department  The attorney for the sheriffs department     then intimidated this local official  reminding him that there would a     45 cent charge for every minute in excess of a half hour the bookkeeper     spends searching for responsive documents   The sheriff was later     found to be misappropriating money  she resigned in disgrace and was     subsequently convicted   The town officials     assessment  So    I m kept from a public record  I take the matter to     court on my own dime  and I get falsified information back  Who picks up     the tab  Me   Keeping bad news      mistakes out of the public eye may work in the short term  but the     long term outcome is the ever increasing mistrust of government and     politicians   A survey conducted by     the American Society of Newspaper Editors confirms this  More than     two thirds of Americans polled said the federal government is somewhat     secretive or very secretive  People overwhelmingly believe their     federal leaders have become sneaky  listening to telephone conversations     or opening private mail without getting court permission  the study     found   In fact  the Coalition     of Journalists for Open Government has found that the backlog of     requests continues to grow  Its latest research found that an all time     record of 31 percent of requests went unprocessed in 2005  up 138     percent in seven years  More important was the finding that half of the     26 federal agencies in the study said they failed to comply with even     simple requests within the federally mandated 20 days   The Freedom of     Information Act is clear in its charge  We are a country where we do the     peoples business  And the people have a right to know what local  state     and federal officials doing   FOIA allows but nine     exemptions in considering whether a record is open or not  Federal     agencies are mandated to reply within 20 days to a request for     documents   But stall tactics and     legal costs to challenge officials decisions effectively closes the     doors to government  Requesters are treated as guilty until proven     innocent   In Vermont  a     legislative study last summer found that our open government laws have     been rewritten and amended to allow 207 exemptions and counting  Like     the federal law  Vermont has provisions to reimburse requesters for     their costs to obtain the public documents  Like the federal law  those     penalties are rarely enforced  State law  like the     federal act  speaks to mandates but enforcement is lax  The Vermont     attorney general believes his job is to defend the state officials     breaking the law  not protect the citizens who own the public records      The amendments     proposed by Sens  Leahy and Cornyn in S  394 and in those proposed in     the House  under H R  1309  are needed and should be passed   Starting with the     premise that records should be considered public  the amendments would     strengthen the Freedom of Information Act requiring these safeguards          Enforcing     the 20 day statutory clock on FOIA requests      Imposing     consequences on agencies that do not respond in a timely manner     Tracking     requests with individualized case numbers and providing telephone and     internet access to the status of such requests          Strengthening reporting requirements  which would identify excessive     delays     Creating a     FOIA ombudsman to mediate problems with requests without resorting to     litigation      Making it     easier for requesters to recoup costs for successful FOIA challenges         Holding     agencies accountable for their decisions by giving the Office of Special     Counsel the ability to take disciplinary action against officials who     deny disclosure  These amendments will     go a long way to enhancing the Freedom of Information Act and will set     higher standard of conduct for state and local officials to follow
