       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On FISA For The 21st Century                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Hearing On FISA For The 21st Century     July 26  2006    I thank the Chairman for convening      this hearing  We are especially glad to welcome General Hayden      to his first appearance before this Committee since he assumed      his new duties  The CIA has been in desperate need of the      professionalism that he brings to this difficult job   Independence and competence were the two watchwords that      led me to believe that he would serve well as Director of the      CIA  and we need straight talk today in navigating the issues      that we will be discussing at this hearing   There are two sets of issues      relating to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are      now before this Committee  First  what is the extent of the      Administrations warrantless wiretapping in violation of FISA       and how should we in Congress react  After seven months and      four hearings  we remain largely in the dark about what the      Administration has been doing and continues to do  because the      Administration has stonewalled this Committees bipartisan      efforts at oversight  But the answer is clear  we must demand      and ensure that this Administration  and future Administrations       follow the law   Second  does the FISA law itself      need to be revised  Although it has been amended six times at      this Administrations request in the five years since 9 11  the      Administration is now telling us that it needs modernization       The call for modernization is the focus of todays hearing  I      appreciate Chairman Specters agreement to the request that I      and my fellow Democratic members of the Committee made to hold      this hearing on the so called modernization provisions contained      in Section 9 of the Chairmans bill  Those proposals make      substantial changes that require careful review   It is important to emphasize at      the outset that the issues of compliance and modernization are      entirely separate  Whether or not FISA is in need of      fine tuning is a legitimate consideration  but FISAs possible      imperfections provide no excuse for the Administrations      flouting of existing law  By the same token  the Bush Cheney      Administrations outrageous disregard for existing law does not      mean that we in Congress should shirk our responsibility to      improve the law if there is room for improvement      SECTION 9      MODERNIZATION PROVISIONS  So I am ready to consider Section      9 of the Chairmans bill on its merits  But I see serious      grounds for skepticism  and I have some serious questions about      those provisions  to which I think we need some candid answers        First  if Section 9s provisions      are  as claimed  needed to bring FISA up to date with 21st      Century technology  why havent we heard about them until now       Not only have we amended FISA six times in the past five years       In July 2002  former Attorney General Ashcroft testified that      the 2001 PATRIOT Act had modernized our surveillance tools to      keep pace with technological changes  In March of this year       in the Reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act  Congress made all the      amendments to FISA that the Administration requested  and the      President took credit for updating the law further     If FISA as amended is too quaint      to meet the challenges of the 21st Century  the      Bush Cheney Administration owes the Congress and the American      people an explanation for its failure to speak up before now       This Administration is not shy about seeking expansions of      Executive power  so I am naturally skeptical of a supposed need      for modernization that it has been so slow to discover   Second  FISA is a very complex and      finely calibrated statute  In order to evaluate the merits of      technical sounding proposed changes and definitional provisions       we need to understand their purpose and likely practical effect       not just take the Administrations word that they make sense       We need to know what obstacles to the government s ability to      protect the nations security the proposed amendments would      remove  and what dangers to Americans liberties and privacy      they would present    To the extent that I have been      able to figure out the highly complex language of Section 9 of      the Chairmans bill  it seems to me to permit vast new amounts      of warrantless surveillance of telephone calls involving      American citizens  It would appear to authorize unrestricted       unregulated government surveillance of American citizens talking      to relatives  colleagues and trading partners overseas  without      any showing that that surveillance is likely to protect our      national security  It would also allow limitless delegation of      the Attorney Generals authority  down to the lowest level      government employee  But to the extent that the Administrations      witnesses can explain to us today  in practical and concrete      terms  why they make sense  I will listen    OTHER      PROVISIONS  I will have some hard questions      about Section 9  But let me turn for a minute to the rest of      the Chairmans bill  It has been called a compromise  This      Vermonter does not believe that we should ever compromise on      requiring the Executive to submit to the rule of law  I am sad      to say that I see this bill as less of a compromise and more a      concession  It would abandon our oversight role and confine      oversight to a single judge on a secret court  whose decision on      the one program the Bush Cheney Administration has agreed to      submit for review is appealable only by the Government  And      even that oversight would not be required by the bill itself  I      expect that Senator Specter got the best deal that he thought he      could  The President  Vice President and their legions can be      hard headed rather than flexible bargainers to be sure  I make      these observations respectfully  not to criticize Senator      Specter  who has reached his own judgment about how he is wiling      to proceed  but to express my reluctance to compromise FISA and      the minimal protections it provides for Americans     Section 8 would repeal FISA s      exclusivity provision and affirmatively embrace the      Presidents claim of sweeping inherent authority  The result is      to make FISA optional  The President may use it or not  at his      discretion   It is astounding to me that we are      considering this proposal  FISA was never intended to give      Presidents choices  it was enacted to prevent abuses of      Executive power and protect Americans liberties by prohibiting      the Government from spying on its citizens without court      approval  The Bush Cheney Administration has chosen to simply      ignore it  Are we now going to reward its flouting of the rule      of law by saying  in effect  Oh  please excuse us for passing      that law  we didnt mean it and we wont do it again   Defenders of the bill have argued      that Section 8 is meaningless because the President has whatever      constitutional authority the Constitution says  and Congress      cannot limit that authority through legislation  If the best      thing we can say on behalf of proposed legislation is that it is      a waste of ink  we should not be enacting it  But I do not for      one minute believe that  when it goes before the secret FISA      court  the Administration will adhere to the position that      Section 8 is meaningless  The Administration is insisting on it      for a reason   As the Supreme Court recently      explained in its Hamdan      decision  the constitutional scope of presidential power depends      on the legislation that Congress has enacted  even in times of      war  The Constitution grants Congress the express power to set      rules for the military  and the express power To make all laws      which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution      all the powers vested by the Constitution in the federal      government  including those of the President     In the absence of congressional      action  the President may well have some measure of unilateral      authority to gather intelligence  including through electronic      surveillance  That is what the precedents the Administration      always cites suggest  But once Congress has acted  as it did in      FISA  the President is no longer free to do whatever he wants       As the Court explained in      Hamdan  Whether or not the President has independent      power  absent congressional authorization  Congress may  in      proper exercise of its own       powers  place limitations on      the Presidents powers   That was the whole point of FISA       to limit the Presidents power to spy on ordinary Americans by      making FISA the sole means by which foreign intelligence      wiretaps may be conducted in the United States       Waiving FISAs exclusivity provision would not be meaningless       it would completely gut FISA and give the President a blank      check to carry out warrantless wiretapping whenever he chooses       I could not in good conscience acquiesce in such a sweeping      signing away of Americans liberties in any circumstances  I      certainly shall not do so at the behest of an Administration      that has repeatedly broken the law
