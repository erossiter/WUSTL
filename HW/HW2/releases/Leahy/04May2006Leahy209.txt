       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh      May 4  2006  I am pleased that finally we will       be having another hearing on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh        which the Democratic members of this Committee have asked for       dating back a year now  The Senate Republican leadership has       been all too willing in the past to answer the siren call from       the right wing special interest groups trying to prevent this       Committee from doing its job on judicial nominations  This is       a nomination for the second highest federal court in the       country  the Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  If we had       considered this nomination today  we would have done so without       answers to many critical questions about this nominees record        The seven Democratic members of the Gang of 14  the bipartisan       group of 14 Senators who worked together a year ago to avert the       nuclear option agree  They sent a letter asking for a new       hearing so that they may learn enough about this nominee to make       an informed decision  I ask that this letter be made part of       the record  I am concerned that this Committee not fall short       in applying the kind of scrutiny it should to such an important       nomination  especially in light of the many recent failures in       the White Houses vetting of nominations    Our job in this Committee should       not be to score points or advance partisan agendas  Our job is       to fulfill our duty under the Constitution for the American       people so that we can assure them that the judges confirmed to       lifetime appointments to the highest courts in this country are       fair to those who enter their courtrooms and to the law  rather       than to advance a political agenda  The Senate Republican       leadership is ready to cater to the extreme right wing factions       agitating for a fight over judicial nominations   Rather than address the priorities       of Americans by focusing on proposals to end the subsidies to       big oil and rein in gas prices  rather than devote our time to       passing comprehensive immigration reform legislation  rather       than completing a budget  the Republican leader came to the       floor last week to signal a fight over two controversial       judicial nominations  The first of these nominations is that of       Judge Terrence Boyle to the United States Court of Appeals for       the Fourth Circuit  We have learned from recent news reports       that  as a sitting United States District Judge and while a       circuit court nominee  Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases       involving corporations in which he held investments  In at       least one instance  he is alleged to have bought General       Electric stock while presiding over a lawsuit in which General       Electric was accused of illegally denying disability benefits to       a long time employee  Two months later  he ruled in favor of GE       and denied the employees claim for long term and pension       disability benefits  Whether or not it turns out that Judge       Boyle broke federal law or canons of judicial ethics  these       types of conflicts of interest have no place on the federal       bench  Certainly  they should not be rewarded with a promotion       to the Fourth Circuit  Certainly they should be investigated   It is not as if we have not been       victimized before by the White Houses poor vetting of important       nominations  If the White House had its way  we would already       have confirmed Claude Allen to the Fourth Circuit  He is the       former Bush Administration official who recently resigned his       position as a top domestic policy adviser to the President        Last month we learned why he resigned when he was arrested for       fraudulent conduct over an extended period of time  Had we       Democrats not objected to the White House attempt to shift a       circuit judgeship from Maryland to Virginia  someone now the       subject of a criminal prosecution for the equivalent of stealing       from retail stores would be a sitting judge on the Fourth       Circuit confirmed with a Republican rubberstamp     Less than two months ago  the       President withdrew the nomination of Judge James Payne to the       Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit after       information became public about that nominees rulings in a       number of cases in which he appears to have had conflicts of       interest  Those conflicts were pointed out not by the       Administrations screening process or by the ABA  but by online       journalists    Judge Payne joins a long list of       nominations by this President that have been withdrawn  Among       the more well known are Bernard Kerik to head the Department of       Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court  It       was  as I recall  reporting in a national magazine that doomed       the Kerik nomination  It was opposition within the Presidents       own party that doomed the Miers nomination  I find it       interesting that the same Republicans who demanded answers from       Ms  Miers now seem to be lowering the bar for Mr  Kavanaugh        During the last few months  President Bush also withdrew the       nominations of Judge Henry Saad to the Court of Appeals for the       6th Circuit and Judge Daniel P  Ryan to the Eastern       District of Michigan after his ABA rating was downgraded         The Senates job as a check is so       important  As these nominees have failed to withstand scrutiny       for one reason or another  there are those who have slipped       through as a result of a complicit Republican controlled Senate        all too eager to act as a rubberstamp for the Bush Cheney       Administration  It was only after Jay Bybee was confirmed to a       lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit that we learned of his       involvement with the infamous Bybee memo seeking to justify       torture  I had asked him what he had worked on while head of       the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel  but he had       refused to respond  We should not repeat that mistake and       proceed with the Mr  Kavanaughs nomination without knowing what       his involvement has been in the scandals that plague this White       House  where he has been a member of the inner circle for the       last six years   We asked for another hearing       because Mr  Kavanaugh failed to provide meaningful and       substantive responses to many of the questions posed to him at       his first hearing and he delayed for seven months before       providing evasive and incomplete answers to written questions        In addition  a new hearing is warranted because several       troubling issues have come to light since his initial       nomination  As Associate White House Counsel and staff       secretary  Mr  Kavanaugh has served as an influential member of       the White House staff at a time when many controversial policies       and decisions were being considered  We still do not have       answers to the questions I posed last week  and which the       Democratic members have raised in letters about his role in       connection with such matters  For example  what was Mr        Kavanaughs role in connection with the warrantless spying on       Americans  What was his involvement in the policies affecting       detainee treatment and interrogation  What was his involvement       in connection with military tribunals  torture  and rendition of       prisoners to other countries  What was his involvement in the       scandals now plaguing the White House  it is important to know       whether Mr  Kavanaugh has had a role in connection with the       actions of Jack Abramoff  Michael Scanlon  David Safavian  the       matters being investigated in connection with the Plame matter        and many other matters    The Democratic members of the       Gang of 14 asked for a new hearing  All Democratic Members of       this Committee initially made a request for a new hearing in a       letter on May 11  200 5 and followed up after his re nomination       with a letter on March 3  2006  I ask that both these letters       be made part of the record    If we are going to have a complete       picture of this nominees record and a thorough understanding of       the matters in which he has been involved  the right thing to do       is to have another hearing and pose these questions to Mr        Kavanaugh  I can only hope that Mr  Kavanaugh is more       responsive than he has been in the past  He waited four months       to send this Committee his paperwork  and then another seven       months to answer our questions  which once received were vague        If Mr  Kavanaugh really wants this job  I hope hell be more       responsive to this Committee  The Senate Judiciary Committee is       not a rubberstamp for rewarding this Administrations cronies       with a lifetime appointment to a high federal court  The       American people deserve better
