       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Landmines In Colombia                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Landmines In Colombia    July 26  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  the people of Colombia     have endured decades of civil conflict characterized by widespread     killings and disappearances of civilians perpetrated by rebel groups and     paramilitary death squads  sometimes with the active participation of     government security forces  In recent years  both rebels and     paramilitaries have financed their illegal activities through the sale     of cocaine  which has also corrupted government institutions  Each year since the inception of Plan Colombia  the     United States has provided Colombia with more than half a billion     dollars in mostly military and counter drug assistance  totaling more     than  5 billion   The primary goal of Plan Colombia  at least as sold     to the Congress  was to decrease by half the amount of coca produced      resulting in commensurate reductions in the income derived from cocaine     to the rebels and paramilitaries and the amount of cocaine entering the     United States  While there is no reliable evidence that Plan     Colombia has affected either the price or availability of cocaine in the     United States  the Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that     profits from illegal drugs to the FARC rebels declined by about     one third between 2003 and 2005  This is welcome news  But whether     this trend has continued since then or has ebbed and flowed like most     other statistics relating to drug cultivation and trafficking in     Colombia  is unknown  Unfortunately  it is also not yet apparent that     this reported reduction in profits has affected the FARCs ability to     operate  While the majority of killings of civilians during     the seven years of Plan Colombia are attributed to paramilitaries      sometimes with the active or tacit support of government forces  the     FARC has engaged in many atrocities  including attacks against civilian     targets and kidnapping  But perhaps the most insidious of their crimes     is the widespread use of landmines  According to a report released yesterday by Human     Rights Watch  casualties from landmines used by the FARC  as well as by     another rebel group known as the ELN  have risen steadily in recent     years  As is so often the case with landmines which are triggered     indiscriminately by the victim  most of the casualties in Colombia have     been civilians   While the number of casualties did not exceed 148 a     year in the 1990s  Human Rights Watch reports that last year the number     was 1 107  This increase contrasts sharply with the worldwide decline     in the use of these insidious weapons  In fact  Colombia is among the     more than 150 nations that have signed or ratified the international     treaty banning antipersonnel mines   According to press reports  the FARC defends its     use of mines by claiming that they are used only against government     security forces  not civilians  That  however  is a specious claim      since mines are inherently indiscriminate  They will kill or maim     whoever comes into contact with them  often months or years after they     are laid  I have seen photographs of the horrific injuries suffered by     both government soldiers and innocent civilians from rebel mines   While the FARC  like others who continue to use     landmines  would undoubtedly claim that their military utility justifies     their continued use  I reject that argument  The harm to civilians and     the contamination of the countryside caused by mines cannot be     justified   While there are programs to assist Colombias mine     victims with rehabilitation and vocational training  they are far from     adequate  I have supported efforts to increase U S  assistance  We are     looking at ways to use the Leahy War Victims Fund to assist Colombian     civilians who have been injured by mines  and we are supporting United     for Colombias efforts to obtain surgery in the U S  for Colombian     soldiers who have suffered grievous mine injuries   Mr  President  I have been a consistent critic of     human rights violations in Colombia where impunity remains a persistent     problem  There have been thousands of killings of civilians  including     of human rights defenders  union members  journalists  and others who     have been targeted by one armed group or another  Hardly any of these     crimes have resulted in convictions and punishment  But none of that     excuses the continued use of landmines by the FARC and ELN  As I have     said many times before  the use of landmines should be a war crime  It     is barbaric  it is inhumane  it is indefensible
