       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  The War In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      The War In Iraq      Senate Floor      October 25  2005    Following        is Sen  Patrick Leahys address on Iraq  delivered Tuesday        morning on the Senate Floor  Leahy  D Vt   is the ranking        member of the Appropriations panel that handles the Senates        work in funding the State Department and U S  foreign        operations and aid  and he also is a senior member of the        Appropriations panel with jurisdiction over the annual        defense budget bill  Leahy was one of 23 senators who voted        against the resolution that authorized the invasion of        Iraq    MR  LEAHY  Three years ago when       the Congress and the country debated the resolution to give       President Bush the authority to launch a preemptive war against       Iraq  reference was often made to the lessons of Vietnam          Unheeded Lessons  There are many lessons  both of       that war and of the efforts to end it  But one that made a deep       impression on me came from former Secretary of Defense Robert       McNamara  the architect of that war  who said our greatest       mistake was not understanding our enemy   Vietnam       was a relatively simple country that had changed little in the       preceding 3 000 years  It was  for the most part  racially        ethnically  linguistically and religiously homogenous  One       would have thought it would have been easy for U S  military and       political leaders to understand    Apparently it was not  The White       House and the Pentagon  convinced that no country  particularly       not a tiny impoverished land of rice farmers  could withstand       the military might of the United States  never bothered to study       and understand the history or culture of Vietnam  and they made       tragic miscalculations  They lacked the most basic knowledge of       the motivation  the capabilities and the resolve of the people       they were fighting   At the start of the Iraq war        those who drew some analogies to Vietnam were ridiculed by the       Pentagon and the White House  Iraq is not Vietnam  they       insisted  Our troops would be greeted as liberators  Troop       strength was not a concern  Our mission would be quickly       accomplished  Democracy would spread throughout the Middle       East  Freedom was on the march    It is true that Vietnam and Iraq       are vastly different societies  But the point was not that they       are similar  but that some of the same lessons apply  We did       not understand Vietnam    a simple country    and we paid a huge       price for our ignorance and our arrogance    Iraq    a complex country       comprised of rival clans  tribes and ethic and religious       factions who have fought each other for centuries    we       understand even less    If this were not apparent to many       at the start of this ill conceived and politically motivated war          a war I opposed from the beginning    it should be obvious       today  Yet to listen to the Secretary of Defense  or to the       President or the Vice President  one would never know it    Misled Into War  We know today that President Bush       decided to invade Iraq without evidence to support the use of       force and well before Congress passed the resolution giving him       the authority to do so    authority he did not even believe he       needed    despite the Constitution which invests in the Congress       the power to declare war  Twenty three Senators voted against       that resolution  and I was proud to be one of them     We know today that the motivation       for a plan to attack Iraq  hatched by a handful of political       operatives  had taken hold within the White House even before       9 11  and without any connection to the war on terrorism that       came later    We know that the key public       justifications for the war    to stop Saddam Hussein from       developing nuclear weapons and supporting al Qaeda    were based       on faulty intelligence and outright distortions and have been       thoroughly discredited  United Nations weapons inspectors  who       were dismissed by the White House as na  ve and ineffective        turned out to have gathered far better information with a tiny       fraction of the budget than our own intelligence agencies   And we know that the insurgency is       continuing to grow along with American casualties    1 999       killed and at least 15 220 wounded  as of yesterday    despite       the same old light at the end of the tunnel assertions and       clich  s by the White House and top officials in the Pentagon   The sad but inescapable truth        which the President either does not see or refuses to believe or       admit  is that the Iraqi insurgency has steadily grown  in part       because of our presence there    Bring Them On  After baiting the insurgents to       bring them on  we got what the President asked for  More than       two years later  the pendulum swung against us  and the question       is no longer whether we can stop the insurgency  but how to       extricate ourselves   According to soldiers who       volunteered for duty in Iraq believing in the mission and who       have returned home  many Iraqis who detest the barbaric tactics       of the insurgents have grown to despise us  They blame us for       the lack of water and electricity  for the lack of jobs and       health care  for the hardships and violence they are suffering       day in and day out    Unlike our troops and their       families who make great sacrifices  most Americans have been       asked to sacrifice nothing for this war  The bills are being       sent to our children and grandchildren  by way of our rapidly       escalating national debt and annual deficits  Yet as the       hundreds of billions dollars to pay for the war continue to pile       up and domestic programs like Medicaid  job training and       programs for needy students are cut  the sacrifices will be felt       today as well    Slogans have become little more       than political rallying cries for the White House  Slogans as       empty and unfulfilled as mission accomplished  Our troops       were sent to fight an unnecessary war without sufficient armor       against these ruthless and barbaric bombing attacks  without       adequate reinforcements  without a plan to win the peace  and       without adequate medical care and other services when they       return home on stretchers or crutches or with eye patches        unable to walk  to work  to pay their mortgages  or to support       their families    Many of our veterans have been       treated shamefully by their government when it sent them into       harms way under false pretences  and again after they returned       home   Today I worry about places like       Ramadi  where more than 300 members of the Army National Guard       from my State of Vermont are currently serving valiantly       alongside their comrades in the Marine Corps and the       Pennsylvania National Guard  Dozens of other citizen soldiers       from the Vermont Guard are serving across Iraq  while hundreds       are deployed throughout the Persian Gulf region     Many Vermonters have been killed       in Ramadi and elsewhere by roadside bombs and all too accurate       sniper attacks    The insurgents too often seem to       attack and then escape with impunity  You can open a newspaper       and see photos of armed insurgents walking the streets in broad       daylight  Many of these cold blooded attacks are by people who       are willing to trade their own lives to kill civilians  security       guards  and our soldiers who have no way of knowing who they can       trust among the general population     More Of The Same Is Not Working  The President has no plan to deal       with Ramadi  let alone the rest of Iraq  except doing more of       what we have been doing for more than two years  at a cost of  5       billion a month    money we do not have and that future       generations of Americans will have to repay  Nor has he       proposed a practical alternative to our wasteful energy policy       that guarantees our continued dependence on Persian Gulf oil for       decades to come   I am sure that what our military       is doing to train the Iraqi Army and what our billions of       dollars are doing to help rebuild Iraq    whatever is not stolen       or wasted by profiteering contractors    are making a       difference  Iraq is no longer governed by a corrupt  ruthless       dictator  and there have been halting but important steps toward       representative government    I applaud the Iraqis who       courageously stood in long lines and cast their ballots for a       new constitution  despite the insurgents threats  There are       many profiles in courage among the Iraqi people  just as there       are in the heroic daily endeavors of U S  soldiers there   But this progress masks deeper       troubles and may be short lived  threatened by a widening       insurgency and a divisive political process that is increasingly       seen as leading to a Shiite dominated theocracy governed by       Islamic law and aligned with Iran  or the dissolution of Iraq       into separate Kurdish  Sunni and Shiite states      Escalating Toll  Escalating Costs  Mr  President  this war has been a       costly disaster for our country  More than half of the American       people now say they have lost confidence in the Presidents       handling of it    Far from making us safer from       terrorists  in fact it has turned Iraq into a haven and       recruiting ground for terrorists and deflected our attention and       resources away from the fight against terrorism  If anything        it has emboldened our enemies  as it has become increasingly       apparent that the most powerful army in the world cannot stop a       determined insurgency   Regrettably  it is no longer a       secret how vulnerable we are  and Hurricane Katrina showed how       tragically unprepared we are to respond to a major disaster          four years after 9 11 and after wasting billions on an       unnecessary war    Our cities are little further than       the drawing board when it comes to developing workable       evacuation plans for a terrorist attack or other emergency  not       to mention how to feed  house and provide for millions of       displaced people    This war has caused immense damage       to our relations with the worlds Muslims  a religion practiced       by some 1 2 billion people and about which most Americans know       virtually nothing  We cannot possibly mount an effective       campaign against terrorism without the trust  the respect and       the active support of Muslims  particularly in the Middle East       where our image has been so badly damaged  Our weakened       international reputation is another heavy price that our country       has paid for this war   Each day  as more and more Iraqi       civilians  often children  lose their lives and limbs from       suicide bombers and also from our bombs  the resentment and       anger toward us intensifies    And every week  the number of U S        service men and women who are killed or wounded creeps higher        will soon pass 2000  and shows no sign of diminishing     This war has isolated us from our       allies  most of whom want no part of it  and if we continue on       the course the President has set it could also divide our       country    Course Correction  Other Senators and       Representatives  Republicans and Democrats  have expressed       frustration and alarm with the Presidents failure to       acknowledge that this war has been a costly mistake  that more       of the same is not a workable policy  and that we need to change       course  My friend Senator Hagel  a Vietnam veteran  has pointed       out the increasing similarities with Vietnam  We learned this       week that the Administration has even resumed the discredited       Vietnam era practice of measuring progress by reporting body       counts   White House and Pentagon       officials  and their staunchest supporters in Congress  warn of       a wider civil war if we pull our troops out  They could be       right  In fact  it could be the first thing they are right       about since the beginning of this reckless adventure     My question to them is  when and       how then do we extract ourselves from this mess  What does the       President believe needs to happen before our troops can come       home  and what is his plan for getting to that point     If we cannot overcome the       insurgency  what can we realistically expect to accomplish in       Iraq  and at what cost  that requires the continued deployment       of our troops    What is it that compels us to       spend billions of dollars to rebuild the Iraqi military  when       our own National Guard is stretched to the breaking point and       cant even get the equipment it needs    Unfortunately I doubt that the       President or the Secretary of Defense will answer these       questions  Instead of answers  we get rhetoric that conflicts       with just about everything we hear or read  including from some       of this countrys most distinguished retired military officers       who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents         Six months ago the Vice President       said the insurgency was in its last throes  That was just the       latest in a long string of grossly inaccurate statements and       predictions and false expectations about Iraq   Secretary Rice  when asked       recently when U S  forces could begin to come home assuming the       Administrations rosy predictions come true  could not  or would       not  even venture a guess    Without answers    real answers        honest answers    to these questions  I will not support the       open ended deployment of our troops in a war that was based on       falsehoods and justified with hubris   Even though I opposed this war  I       have prayed  like other Americans  that it would weaken the       threat of terrorism and make the world safer  that our troops       sacrifices would prove to have been justified and that the       President had a plan for completing the mission   Instead  it has turned Iraq into a       training ground for terrorists  it is fueling the insurgency  it       is causing severe damage to the reputation and readiness of the       U S  military  and it is preventing us from addressing the       inexcusable weaknesses in our homeland security           The Iraqi people  at least the Shiites and Kurds  have voted for       a new constitution  as hastily drafted  flawed and potentially       divisive as it may be         Saddam Hussein  whose capacity for cruelty was seemingly       limitless  is finally facing trial for his heinous crimes               And elections for a new national government are due by the end       of the year          By then  it will be more than two and a half years since       Saddams overthrow  and we will have given the Iraqi people a       chance to chart their own course  The sooner we reduce our       presence there  the sooner they will have to make the difficult       decisions necessary to solve their own problems         Our military commanders say that Iraqs problems increasingly       need to be solved through the political process  not through       military force  We must show Iraq and the world that we are       not an occupying force  and that we have no designs on their       country or their oil  The American people need to know that the       President has a plan that will bring our troops home           Once a new Iraqi government is in place  I believe the President       should consult with Congress on a flexible plan that includes       pulling our troops back from the densely populated areas where       they are suffering the worst casualties and to bring them home        Those consultations should begin in earnest as soon as Iraqs       new government is in place   It is also long overdue for the       White House and the Congress to reassess our policy towards the       region  The President has declared that democracy is taking       root throughout the Middle East  and there have been small        positive steps  But they are dwarfed by the ongoing threat       posed by Iran  Syrias continued meddling in Iraq and Lebanon        repression and corruption in Saudi Arabia and Egypt  the danger       that the momentum for peace from Israels withdrawal from Gaza       will be lost as settlement construction accelerates in the West       Bank  and the widespread    albeit mistaken    belief among       Muslims that the United States wants to destroy Islam itself   Just as the White Houses       obsession with Iraq has diverted our resources and impeded our       efforts to strengthen our defenses against terrorism at home  so       has it made it more difficult to work constructively with our       allies to address these regional threats    Mr  President  as I have said  I       did not support this war  and I believe that history will not       judge kindly those who got us into this debacle by attacking a       country that did not threaten us  after deceiving the American       people and ridiculing those who appealed for caution and for       instead mobilizing our resources directly against the threat of       terrorism    I worry that many of our young       veterans who have gone to Iraq       and experienced the brutality and trauma of war and who may       already feel guilty for having survived  will increasingly       question its purpose  As the architects of this war move on to       other jobs  I fear that we are going to see another generation of       veterans  many of them physically and psychologically scarred       for life  who feel a deep sense of betrayal by their       government     Mounting Trade Offs  If President Bush will not say       what remains to be done before he can declare victory and bring       our troops home  then the Congress should start voting on what       this war is really costing this Nation    We should vote on paying for the       war versus cutting Medicaid  as some of those across the aisle       are proposing    Or versus cutting VA programs that       are already unable to pay the staggering costs of treatment and       rehabilitation for our injured veterans    Or versus rebuilding our National       Guard    Or rebuilding FEMA     Or securing our ports and our       borders    Or investing in our intelligence       so we can finally capture Osama bin Laden    Or investing in health care for       the tens of millions of Americans who can not afford to get       sick    Or fixing our troubled schools  so       our children can learn to do a better job than we have of making       the world a safer place for all people    Mr  President  these  and the       tarnished reputation of a country that so many once admired as       not only powerful but also good and just  are the real costs of       this war
