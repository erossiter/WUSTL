Committee  Okays Bipartisan Leahy Cornyn Bill  To Strengthen FOIA        Legislation Fosters More Open  Accountable   Government WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 12   The Senate Judiciary   Committee Thursday overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation to create a more   open  accountable and responsive government for all Americans   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the committee    and John Cornyn  R Texas   a member of the panel  introducedThe Openness   Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007  OPEN Government   Act  earlier this year  The bill contains key reforms to update and strengthen   the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA   Last year  this committee favorably reported an   essentially identical bill but the full Senate did not consider this legislation   before it adjourned last year  This year  I hope that the Senate will do its   part to reinvigorate FOIA by promptly passing this bill  said Leahy  a longtime   champion of open government laws  Open government is not a Democratic issue or   a Republican issue  It is an American issue  The OPEN Government bill is also cosponsored by Senators   Arlen Specter  R Pa    the committees ranking member  Russ Feingold  D Wisc      John Kerry  D Mass    Johnny Isakson  R Ga    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio  and Ben   Cardin  D Md    The OPEN Government Act would   Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action under    FOIA   Impose real consequences on federal agencies for    missing statutory deadlines   Clarify that FOIA applies to agency records held by    outside private contractors   Establish a FOIA hotline service for all federal    agencies  and  Create a FOIA Ombudsman as an alternative to costly    litigation    The OPEN Government Act was first introduced in 2005 by   Senators Leahy and Cornyn as part of the first ever National Sunshine week    This bill  if enacted into law  would be the first update to FOIA since the   1990s  The House of Representatives passed a similar bipartisan FOIA reform   bill  the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007  H R  1309  in   March   Below is Sen  Leahys statement from the business meeting   earlier today  Statement Of   Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On Consideration Of The Leahy Cornyn OPEN Government Act  April 12  2007 I am pleased that the   Committee will consider the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National   Government Act  the OPEN Government Act   S  849    today  This bipartisan bill contains commonsense reforms to  update and strengthen the Freedom of Information Act    FOIA  for all Americans   I thank Senator Cornyn for   his strong leadership as the chief cosponsor of this bill  I also thank the   Committees Ranking Member  Senator Specter  and Senator Feingold for   cosponsoring this legislation  Last year  this Committee   favorably reported an essentially identical bill  Sadly  the full Senate did   not consider this legislation before it adjourned last year  But  I hope that   the Senate will do its part to reinvigorate FOIA this   year  by promptly passing this bill  During the Committees   hearing on this legislation  we learned that the Freedom of Information Act   remains an indispensable tool in shedding light on bad policies and government   abuses  But  today  FOIA also faces challenges like never before   According to   a report by the National Security Archive  an   independent non governmental research institute  the   oldest outstanding FOIA requests date back to 1989    before the collapse   of the Soviet Union  Yesterday    the Washington Post reported that the FBI recently said that it will need  six years  until 2013    to respond to a FOIA request seeking   information about the Bureaus Information Data Warehouse database   And  more than a year after   the Presidents directive to government agencies to improve their FOIA services    Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than   during any other time in FOIAs 40 year history The OPEN Government Act  takes several important steps to reverse this trend   and to restore openness to our government  Among other things  our bill      Restores meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA      Imposes real consequences on federal agencies for missing statutory    deadlines      Clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records held by outside private    contractors      Establishes a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies  and      Creates a FOIA Ombudsman as an alternative to costly litigation     Senator   Cornyn and I drafted this legislation after a long and thoughtful process of   consultation with individuals and organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain   information   This   legislation is endorsed by more than 25 different organizations representing all   facets of the political spectrum  including the news media  librarians  and   public interest groups  I submit letters of support for this bill that I   recently received from the Sunshine in Government Initiative  the League of   Women Voters and the American Library Association for the record  Senator   Cornyn and I know that open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican   issue  It is an American issue  In that spirit  I urge all Members of the   Committee to join us in supporting this important open government legislation
