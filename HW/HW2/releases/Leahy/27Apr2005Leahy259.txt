       Senate Confirms 206th Bush Judge In Bipartisan Vote                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Senate     Confirms 206th Bush Judge In Bipartisan Vote    Seabright Wins Unanimous Support  Republican Leaders Slow To Act On     Consensus Nominees    WASHINGTON  Wednesday  April 27   The Senate on     Wednesday  in a 98 0 vote  confirmed J  Michael Seabright to be U S      District Court Judge for the District of Hawaii  Mr  Seabrights     confirmation marks the 206th judicial nominee of President     Bushs to be confirmed by the Senate  Sen  Patrick Leahy   D Vt    the     ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  has been urging a     vote on Mr  Seabrights nomination since last year  Leahy described Mr      Seabright as a consensus nominee and an example of how the judicial     nominations process can work smoothly and successfully when there is     meaningful bipartisan consultation  Leahys statement is below         Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Judicial Nominations and the Nomination of J  Michael Seabright     To Be United States District Court Judge     For the District of Hawaii    April 27  2005    It has taken some time but the Senate Republican     leadership will finally allow the Senate to consider the nomination of     J  Michael Seabright to be a United States District Court Judge for     Hawaii  I commend the distinguished Senators from Hawaii for their     effort if identifying this consensus nominee  When Mr  Seabright is     confirmed by an overwhelming  bipartisan vote of the Senate  he will be     the 206th nominees of this President confirmed to a lifetime     appointment to our federal courts   This is only the second judicial nomination Senate     Republicans have been willing to consider all year  There has been no     filibuster of judicial nominees this year  Instead  it is the Senate     Republican leadership that  through its deliberate inaction  is keeping     judgeships unnecessarily vacant for months  With this nomination and     with the nomination of Judge Crotty  I was the one asking for months for     the nomination to be considered  debated  voted on and confirmed  For     the last several weeks I have been calling upon the Republican     leadership to proceed to the confirmation of Michael Seabright to the     District Court of Hawaii   All Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had been     prepared to vote favorably on this nomination for some time  We were     prepared to report the nomination last year but it was not listed by the     then Chairman on a Committee agenda  I thank Chairman Specter for     including Mr  Seabright at our meeting on March 17  The nomination was     unanimously reported and has been on the Senate Executive Calendar for     more than a month  It is Senate Republicans who resisted a vote on this     judicial nominee  not Democrats  In their fashion  they did so without     any explanation akin to the anonymous holds that doomed more than 60     of President Clintons judicial nominees not so long ago   Once confirmed  Mr  Seabright will be the 206th of     216 nominees brought before the full Senate for a vote to be confirmed      That means that 829 of the 875 authorized judgeships in the federal     judiciary  or 95 percent  will be filled  It is regrettable that     Republican delay has now pushed the Senate behind even the pace set by     the Republican majority in 1999  when President Clinton was in the White     House  That year  the Senate Republican leadership did not allow the     Senate to consider any circuit court nominees for the entire session and     only 17 district court nominees were confirmed  The Republican Senate     has fallen behind that pace   Of the 47 judicial vacancies now existing      President Bush has not even sent nominees for 29 of those vacancies      more than half  I have been encouraging the Bush Administration to work     with Senators to identify qualified and consensus judicial nominees and     do so  again  today  The Democratic leader and I sent the President a     letter in this regard on April 5  but we have received no response   It is now the last week in April  we are almost     one third through the year and so far the President has sent only one     new nominee for a federal court vacancy all year  only one  Instead of     sending back divisive nominees  would it not be better for the country      the courts  the American people  the Senate and the Administration if     the White House would work with us to identify  and for the President to     nominate  more consensus nominees like Michael Seabright who can be     confirmed quickly with strong  bipartisan votes  I commend the Senators from Hawaii for their     efforts to work cooperatively to fill judicial vacancies  I only wish     Republicans had treated President Clintons nominees to vacancies in     Hawaii with similar courtesy  Had they  there would not have been the     vacancies on the 9th Circuit and on the District Court  The     work of the Senators from Hawaii is indicative of the type of bipartisan     efforts Senate Democrats have made with this President and remain     willing to make  We can work together to fill judicial vacancies with     qualified  consensus nominees  The vast majority of the more than 200     judges confirmed during the last three and one half years were confirmed     with bipartisan support   The truth is that in President Bushs first term      the 204 judges confirmed were more than were confirmed in either of     President Clinton two terms  more than during the term of this     Presidents father  and more than in Ronald Reagans first term when he     was being assisted by a Republican majority in the Senate  By last     December  we had reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I     inherited in the summer of 2001 to the lowest level  lowest rate and     lowest number in decades  since Ronald Reagan was in office   The Hawaii judgeship at issue here has been vacant     for more than four years  since December of 2000 when Judge Alan Kay     took senior status  President Clinton made a nomination to that seat in     advance of the vacancy  but the Republicans in control of the Senate     refused to act on it  They preserved the vacancy for a Republican     President   In 2002  President Bush nominated James Rohlfing to     the vacancy  That nomination failed  however  because in the view of     his home state Senators and the American Bar Association  he was not     qualified for the position  It took the White House more than two     additional years to agree  Finally  in May 2004 that nomination was     withdrawn by President Bush   The Administration finally got it right after     consultation with the Hawaii Senators  The President sent Michael     Seabrights name to the Senate last September  An outstanding attorney     who has experience in private practice as well as a sterling reputation     as an Assistant United States Attorney  Mr  Seabright merited     consideration and swift confirmation  Despite his reputation as a     law and order Republican  Republicans would not move on Mr  Seabrights     nomination last Congress  The President took his time renominating Mr      Seabright and even then it took repeated requests to get his nomination     included on the agenda of the Committee  When he was considered on     March 17 he was reported with unanimous support  Senate Democrats have     long supported and requested action on this nomination   I have been urging this President and Senate     Republicans for years to work with all Senators and engage in genuine      bipartisan consultation  That process leads to the nomination      confirmation and appointment of consensus nominees with reputations for     fairness  The Seabright nomination  the bipartisan support of his     home state Senators and the Committees action by a unanimous bipartisan     vote is a perfect example of what I have been urging   I have noted that there are currently 29 judicial     vacancies for which the President has delayed sending a nominee  In     fact  he has sent the Senate only one new judicial nominee all year  I     wish he would work with all Senators to fill those remaining vacancies     rather than through his inaction and unnecessarily confrontational     approach manufacture longstanding vacancies  It is as if the President     and his most partisan supporters want to create a crisis   Over the last weeks we have heard some extremists     call for mass impeachments of judges  court stripping and punishing     judges by reducing court budgets  Now we are seeing an effort at     religious McCarthyism by which Republican partisans inject religion into     these matters  Rather than promote crisis and confrontation  I urge the     President to disavow the divisive campaign and  instead  do what most     others have and work with us to identify outstanding consensus     nominees  It ill serves the country  the courts and most importantly     the American people for this Administration and the Senate Republican     leadership to continue down the road to conflict   The Seabright nomination shows how unnecessary that     conflict really is  Let us join together to debate and confirm     consensus nominees to these important lifetime posts on the federal     judiciary   It is the federal judiciary that is called upon to     rein in the political branches when their actions contravene the     Constitution limits on governmental authority and restrict individual     rights  It is the federal judiciary that has stood up to the     overreaching of this Administration in the aftermath of the September 11     attacks   It is more and more the federal judiciary that is     being called upon to protect Americans rights and liberties  our     environment and to uphold the rule of law as the political branches     under the control of one party have overreached  Federal judges should     protect the rights of all Americans  not be selected to advance a     partisan or personal agenda  Once the judiciary is filled with     partisans beholden to the Administration and willing to reinterpret the     Constitution in line with the Administrations demands  who will be left     to protect American values and the rights of the American people   The Constitution establishes the Senate as a check     and a balance on the choices of a powerful President who might seek to     make the federal judiciary an extension of his Administration or a     wholly owned subsidiary of his political party  Today  Republicans are     threatening to take away one of the few remaining checks on the power of     the Executive branch by their use of what has become knows as the     nuclear option  This assault on our tradition of checks and balances     and on the protection of minority rights in the Senate and in our     democracy should be abandoned  Eliminating the filibuster by the     nuclear option would destroy the Constitutions design of the Senate as     an effective check on the Executive  The elimination of the filibuster     would reduce any incentive for a President to consult with home state     Senators or seek the advice of the Senate on lifetime appointments to     the federal judiciary  It is a leap not only toward one party rule but     to an unchecked executive  Rather than blowing up the Senate  let us honor the     constitutional design of our system of checks and balances and work     together to fill judicial vacancies with consensus nominees  The     nuclear option is unnecessary  What is needed is a return to     consultation and for the White House to recognize and respect the role     of the Senate appointments process   The American people have begun to see this     threatened partisan power grab for what it is and to realize that the     threat and the potential harm are aimed at our democracy  at an     independent and strong federal judiciary and  ultimately  at their     rights and freedoms
