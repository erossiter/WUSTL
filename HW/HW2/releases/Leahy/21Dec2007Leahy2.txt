       Congress Eases Aslyum Rules That Shut Out Terror Victims And U S  Allies   Like The Hmong  The Montagnards  And Refugees From Iraq And Afghanistan                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Congress Eases     Asylum Rules    That Shut Out Terror Victims And U S  Allies Like The Hmong  The     Montagnards  And Refugees From Iraq And Afghanistan  WASHINGTON  Friday  Dec  21   Reforms to allow     thousands of persecuted refugees to seek U S  asylum    refugees who     have been barred because they were members of armed groups that were     allied with or supported by the United States or who were forced to     offer food  shelter or other services to designated terrorist groups        are headed to the President for signing   The changes were included in the annual budget     bill for the State Department and for foreign operations  which is part     of the omnibus appropriations bill approved this week by the Senate and     the House  The material support reforms were authored by Sen  Patrick     Leahy  D Vt    who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that     wrote the State Department budget sections of the bill  Leahy s reforms     initially passed the Senate in September  The Leahy provisions were     modified by an amendment negotiated earlier by Leahy and Sen  Jon Kyl      R Ariz    The reforms include a carve out for Vietnam era allies such     as the Hmong tribesman of Laos and the Montagnards of Vietnam  and for     child soldiers and others whose affiliation with proscribed     organizations was involuntary   The illogical rules that now apply are an     affront to our values and our honor  said Leahy  Many of these people     were our allies  They were there for us when we needed them  and we     should not turn our backs when they need the safety of our shores  This     reform is a step in the right direction  to bring our law more in line     with our values  Overbroad changes in the law made in the PATRIOT     and REAL ID Acts have been used to bar refugees and asylum seekers who     were either members of groups that fought on the side of the United     States    such as the Hmong  the Montagnards  and the Northern Alliance     in Afghanistan    or who were the victims of terrorist groups and forced     to provide goods or services  Leahy said  It is unconscionable that a     woman  forced at knifepoint to cook or carry water for a terrorist     group  is then denied entry to the United States as a refugee for having     provided material support  That is not what the law intended  and my     amendment will fix it  Leahy noted that these overly broad restrictions     have kept thousands of refugees and hundreds of asylum seekers in     limbo  Bush Administration officials belatedly have acknowledged that     they have been slow to deal with this problem and that the law needs to     be changed  Meanwhile an additional problem has been looming  Iraqi     refugees  thousands of whom the President agrees should be admitted to     the United States  but many of whom have been barred from admission     until the law was fixed   Leahy s reforms themselves will not raise the     number of refugees admitted to the United States  which is determined by     the numerical limit the President sets each year and by the amount     Congress appropriates for refugee admissions
