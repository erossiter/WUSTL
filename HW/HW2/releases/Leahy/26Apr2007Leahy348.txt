       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Federal Bureau Of   Investigation Fiscal Year 2008 Budget                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Hearing On The Federal Bureau Of Investigation Fiscal Year 2008 Budget    Subcommittee On Commerce  Justice  Science And Related Agencies   Committee On Appropriations   April 26  2007   Director Mueller  welcome and thank you for joining us    today to testify before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice    and Science regarding the FY 2008 budget request for the Federal Bureau of    Investigation  You and I get to see each other from time to time when you    come before the Judiciary Committee for oversight hearings  Today  however     I am here wearing my appropriators cap and I look forward to hearing you    make the case for the budget the President has proposed for the FBI in the    coming year  I also want to thank the chair of our subcommittee     Senator Mikulski  for allowing me to open this hearing on her behalf  She    will be joining us shortly  but is on her way back from the formal send off    of the 1 300 Maryland National Guardsmen who will be deployed to Iraq in the    next few months  Having attended several such events in my own home state    of Vermont  I know how hard this sendoff must be for the Guardsmen  their    families and friends  Senator Mikulski and all those attending  Our hearts    and prayers are with those brave Maryland soldiers  and all of our brave    men and women preparing to leave   and their families during this difficult    time  We hope they will be returning home soon  During recent years  the FBI has confronted the    daunting challenge of protecting our nation against international terrorism    in the wake of the attacks of September 11  2001  the subsequent anthrax    attacks and other threats  Director Mueller  you deserve credit for your    efforts to assure the safety of the American people  In the wake of terrorist attacks  I recognize that the    Justice Department focused much of its attention on the prevention of    terrorism and the promotion of national security  Its top priorities    continue to be the prevention  investigation and prosecution of terrorist    activities against U S  citizens and interests  which is evident in the    request for more than  417 million in new investments for the FBI  including    counterintelligence activities and justice information systems technology  Nonetheless  I am concerned that this budget proposal     if enacted  would divert critical resources and staffing from traditional    law enforcement matters  such as reducing the spike in violent crime  to    support the Bureaus counterterrorism work  The FY08 budget requests the    realignment of one hundred criminal agents to counterterrorism work  This    would leave traditional criminal law enforcement significantly understaffed    at the Bureau  Realigning these agents may further erode the FBIs ability    to combat violent crime and has been cited by the Office of Inspector    General  OIG  as one of the top management challenges at the Justice    Department  We must not allow daily responsibilities that keep our citizens    safe to fall aside  It has been over two years since the FBI announced it    would scrap the three year  170 million effort to develop a modern case    management system  known as the Virtual Case File  or VCF  I have    repeatedly expressed to you  Director Mueller  my deep frustration over the    millions of dollars wasted on lessons learned  and the fact that more than    three years have passed since the original deadline while these technology    goals are not met  Since the FBI announced the VCFs successor  the    Sentinel program  I have seen nothing to boost my confidence in the Bureaus    ability to manage the status and cost of this project  While the FBI    estimates that Sentinel will ultimately cost the American taxpayers  425    million  a December 2006 OIG audit report questioned the reliability of the    total estimated costs for the program  It was originally expected that the    full Sentinel system would be deployed in 2009  Just recently  however  we    learned a familiar piece of news regarding the FBIs computer upgrade    project  Apparently there will be delays in the deployment of Phase I of    the Sentinel upgrade  which jeopardizes the schedule for this much needed    computer system  This latest setback is one of a string of costly delays    in the FBIs efforts to upgrade its computers  Sentinel was launched after    the FBI wasted five years and millions of taxpayer dollars on the failed    Trilogy program  By my calculations  at least  253 million has been    invested in Sentinel alone from FY05 to FY07 between reprogramming dollars    and Congressional appropriations  The Presidents FY08 Budget proposes no    funding for the project  The first of four program upgrade phases has yet    to be completed  although we expected the entire Sentinel program to be up    and running by 2009  Director Mueller  this committee has to ask  Is this    d  j   vu all over again  You tried Trilogy and scrapped that  You told us    that Virtual Case File would meet your needs and you scrapped that  Now    that delays in Sentinel have been announced its not clear at all that the    third time will be the charm  This has been an expensive series of lessons     costing nearly  423 million for these three programs so far  learned on    the backs of American taxpayers  We must ensure that the FBIs technological    capabilities keep pace  and to do so requires not only an emphasis on    providing funds but also effective use and implementation  I hope the    latter is not neglected and I remain seriously concerned about this project  The pattern of incompetence and lack of accountability    within the Bureau is also on display with its treatment of its own equipment    and weapons  Another recent report by the DOJ OIG found that the FBI cannot    account for 160 laptop computers and an equal number of weapons that    were lost or stolen over a three and a half year period  This finding comes    four years after the Inspector General recommended that the FBI take steps    to ensure the security of this equipment  Even more troubling  in many    cases it was found that the FBI could not even determine whether its lost or    stolen computers contained classified or sensitive information  putting    Bureau employees and other individuals at risk of becoming victims of    identity theft and potentially compromising national security information  I am deeply troubled by the DOJ OIGs report finding    widespread illegal and improper use of National Security Letters  NSLs  to    obtain Americans phone and financial records   As Chairman of the Senate    Judiciary Committee  I convened a hearing on NSL abuse several weeks ago     Inspector General Fine testified that his office found 22 separate    instances where the FBI improperly abused NSLs in the review of just 77    FBI files  Not a single one of these violations had been reported by the    FBI  On top of that  because the FBI still lacks the information technology    that it needs to function efficiently in the Information Age  OJG found that    the FBI database used to track NSLs malfunctioned  making it impossible to    keep track of these letters  I fear that the violations the Inspector    General uncovered are probably just the tip of the iceberg and that there    could be thousands of additional violations among the tens of thousands of    NSLs that the FBI is now using each year  The FBI finds itself again at a crossroads     Acknowledging shortcomings is well and good  but the Bureau  and the    Justice Department as a whole  must also learn from its mistakes if    progress is to be made  The time has come for demonstrable progress by the    Bureau on a learning curve that has gone on and on for far too long  Much    work remains to be done and I have no doubt that the leaders and members of    this Subcommittee will fulfill their obligation to the American people to    carefully examine all of these issues  Questions
