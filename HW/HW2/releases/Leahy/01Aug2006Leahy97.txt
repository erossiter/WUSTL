       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Victim Activated Landmine   Abolition Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On The Victim Activated Landmine Abolition Act Of 2006      August 1  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am       today introducing  with my friend from Pennsylvania  Senator       Specter  and Senators Dorgan and Harkin  The Victim Activated       Landmine Abolition Act of 2006   This legislation would prohibit       the procurement of victim activated landmines and other weapons       that are designed to be victim activated  It builds on a long       history of leadership by the Congress on the issue of landmines        which indiscriminately kill and maim innocent people  as well as       United States troops  around the world    I will have another statement on       this subject when we return from the August recess  but I want       to make a couple of points today   First  Senators should know that       since 1997    when an international treaty banning the       manufacture  use  export and stockpiling of anti personnel       landmines was initialed at Ottawa    154 nations have signed and       151 have ratified the treaty    This is an extraordinary       achievement  for which Lloyd Axworthy  Canadas Foreign Minister       at the time  and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines       deserve enormous credit  Unfortunately  the United States is       not a signatory to the treaty and at one time even worked       against it   Thanks to the treaty  the       manufacture and export of anti personnel landmines has decreased       significantly  and the number of victims has also declined  But       mines continue to be a weapon of choice  especially for rebel       groups such as the FARC in Colombia and Hezbollah in Lebanon   Second  the United States has not       exported anti personnel mines since 1992  produced       anti personnel mines since 1997  or used anti personnel mines       since 1991  This is not a weapon we need   Moreover  for the past decade the       Department of Defense has been developing alternatives to       landmines  The goal has been to replace mines that cannot       distinguish between an enemy combatant and a U S  soldier  an       innocent child  a farmer or a refugee   That program has produced       man in the loop technology that is ready to be deployed in a new       generation of mines that are not victim activated     I have long supported this program       and I commend the Department of Defense for its support for the       development of this technology  I believe it will provide the       United States military with the force multiplier and protection       afforded by conventional landmines without impeding the mobility       of our troops or endangering innocent civilians  It will enable       the military to finally stop using or stockpiling       victim activated landmines that have no place in the arsenal of       a civilized nation  much less the worlds only super power   As we see daily in Iraq        Afghanistan and Lebanon  civilians bear the brunt of wars       today  They do not have body armor or armored vehicles  They       are routinely caught in the cross fire  At any moment they are       at risk of being killed or maimed by a landmine or other       improvised explosive that lies in wait until triggered by       whoever steps on it or drives over it   I want to emphasize that the need       for this legislation is not because the United States is causing       the mine problem  It is not  As I mentioned  we have not used       or exported anti personnel mines for 15 years  despite fighting       wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  We are also the largest       contributor to humanitarian demining in countries that have been       severely affected by mines  and we support programs to assist       mine survivors    But just as a solution to the       Middle East conflict depends on the active  sustained engagement       and leadership of the United States  so does the problem of       landmines   As was the case with poison gas       more than half a century ago  the solution to the mine problem       is the stigmatization of these indiscriminate weapons so the       political price of using them serves as a deterrent  Will some       rebel groups or rouge nations continue to defy the international       norm  Undoubtedly  But by setting an example and using our       influence we can reduce their numbers significantly to the       benefit of our troops and the innocent   I again want to thank my friend       Senator Specter  who has supported legislation to ban landmines       for more than a decade                109th CONGRESS      2D Session  S ___________  To prohibit the procurement of       victim activated landmines and other weapons that are designed       to be victim activated   _______________________  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  Mr  Leahy        for himself  Mr  Specter  Mr  Dorgan  and Mr  Harkin        introduced the following bill  which was read twice and referred       to the Committee on   _______________________  A BILL  To prohibit       the procurement of victim activated landmines and other weapons       that are designed to be victim activated          Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled   SECTION 1        SHORT TITLE    This       Act may be cited as the Victim activated Landmine Abolition Act       of 2006   SEC  2        FINDINGS   Congress       makes the following findings    1  Victim activated landmines and       other weapons that are designed to be victim activated       indiscriminately threaten lives in more than 80 countries        Civilians  including tens of thousands of children  have been       the primary victims of these weapons     2  Victim activated landmines and       other weapons that are designed to be victim activated have       killed and maimed United States and coalition troops in       Afghanistan  Iraq  and elsewhere    3  The United States was the first       nation to call for a comprehensive ban on antipersonnel       landmines in 1994 and has not exported antipersonnel mines since       1992  produced antipersonnel landmines since 1997  or used       antipersonnel landmines since 1991     4  The United States sets an       example for the world by remaining a global leader in funding       for mine clearance  mine risk education  and mine survivor       assistance    5  The United States has acquired       reliable technology that enables all weapons to be equipped with       man in the loop targeting and triggering capabilities  meaning       that the device can be activated only in response to an       intentional act by a person   SEC  3  SENSE       OF CONGRESS   The United States Government should       continue to set an example for other countries by banning       procurement of victim activated landmines and other weapons that       are designed to be victim activated  SEC  4        PROHIBITION   Notwithstanding any other provision       of law  the Federal Government may not procure victim activated       landmines or any other weapon designed to be victim activated in       any circumstance    COLLOQUY   Entered       into the Congressional Record  Mr  SPECTER        The Victim activated Landmine Abolition Act of 2006  which I       am joining my friend from Vermont  Senator Leahy  in introducing       today would end the use of these indiscriminate weapons by the       United States  We neither need these weapons not is it in our       interest to continue to insist on the right to use them  They       cannot distinguish between civilians and combatants  and as long       as we stockpile them we cannot credibly urge others to stop       using them against our troops  Does my friend from Vermont       agree with me that our goal in sponsoring this legislation is to       reaffirm United States leadership on this crucial humanitarian       issue and to encourage other nations to follow our example  Mr  LEAHY        That is correct and I thank the senior Senator from       Pennsylvania  I have been pleased to have him as a partner over       the years on legislation to eliminate these inhumane weapons        and I welcome the opportunity to do so again today  We want to       send a message to the world that victim activated landmines and       other weapons designed to be victim activated are beyond the       pale  We have seen what they can do to our troops  We have       seen what they do to a child who picks up one of these seemingly       harmless objects  only to have it blow off an arm or worse        These weapons do not belong in the arsenals of civilized       nations  Mr  SPECTER        I thank my friend  who has led this campaign for so many years        Landmines and other munitions that are designed to be       victim activated are inherently indiscriminate  In that sense        they are no different from poison gas  They should be abolished       and replaced with weapons that have a man in the loop who can       distinguish between an enemy combatant and a civilian  The       Department of Defense has this technology  It is time for the       United States to adopt a policy that is consistent with the       force protection needs of our troops and with the moral values       of the American people
