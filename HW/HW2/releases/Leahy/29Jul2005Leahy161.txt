       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Iraq Reconstruction                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Iraq Reconstruction     July 29  2005  Mr  President  I want to bring to the      attention of Senators the troubling reality in Iraq that is      described in two recent government reports  one by the Government      Accountability Office and the other by the Office of the Special      Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction   Documented in      these reports are assessments of the precarious security situation      on the ground  which has dramatically slowed the pace of      reconstruction and resulted in significant additional costs  This      picture is in stark contrast to the rhetoric coming from the      Administration that we are in the last throes of the insurgency and      that reconstruction is moving forward at a rapid pace   The reality is      that because of the security problems in Iraq  the results of      reconstruction are falling far short of what the Administration      predicted and we were told to expect  While there has been      important progress in building schools and hospitals and providing      clean drinking water  meeting high security costs is forcing the      scale back or cancellation of reconstruction projects       Unfortunately  there is little reason to be optimistic that the      situation will improve in the short term   According to      todays Washington Post  the GAO reported that in March  the      U S  Agency for International Development canceled two electric      power generation programs to provide  15 million in additional      security elsewhere  On another project to rehabilitate electric      substations  the Army Corps of Engineers decided that securing 14 of      the 23 facilities would be too expensive and limited the entire      project to nine stations  And in February  USAID added  33 million      to cover higher security costs on one project  which left it short      of money to pay for construction oversight  quality assurance and      administrative costs  Furthermore  the      Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction      reported that after reviewing several reconstruction contracts  it      was determined that more money was going to government contractors      involved in the rebuilding process than was necessary  The formula      used for disbursing special monetary awards  which are above and      beyond basic fees  was producing excessively high awards  In some      instances  contractors were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars      despite not winning a contract or delivering a single service  Once      again  these reports shed light on the lack of oversight and      accountability given to contracts in Iraq   For the amount of      money the United States is spending in Iraq and particularly when      the Administration is requesting additional funds for reconstruction      in the FY 2006 budget  it is incumbent on the Administration to      respond to these reports in a forthright manner so that Congress can      make informed decisions about the direction of reconstruction      programs
