       ASBESTOS  Medical Criteria Amendment Fails Victims And Businesses                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          ASBESTOS   Medical Criteria Amendment      Fails Victims And Businesses  Senator Cornyn today offered an      amendment to S  852  The Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution  or      FAIR Act  that would replace the trust fund bill with a medical      criteria bill  A medical criteria alternative has been widely      rejected for its detrimental effects on both businesses trying to      avoid bankruptcy and victims seeking fair and efficient relief       Below is some background information on the medical criteria option       and an excerpt from the Senate Judiciary Committees report on the      FAIR Act  rejecting a medical criteria proposal    Below is background information from      the Senator Leahys Judiciary Committee staff on the medical      criteria amendment  Also available is a      of an excerpt from the      Committees report on S  852 detailing the drawbacks of a medical      criteria bill    Backgrounder On Medical Criteria      Amendment  The Judiciary Committee received      significant testimony establishing that the current system for      compensating asbestos victims is broken  Victims are dying while      they wait for their day in court  When they finally receive their      day in court  victims often receive only a small percentage of the      costs involved in our tort system  or if the defendant has been      forced to file for bankruptcy  then victims receive little or no      compensation  This dire situation cries out for a solution outside      of the court system that streamlines the claims process for victims       ensures that they receive timely and fair compensation relative to      the severity of their injuries  and protects compensation they      receive from subrogation by insurance companies    Medical Criteria Fails To Lower      Transaction Costs    According to the most recent RAND      study  asbestos victims receive an average of only 42 cents for      every dollar spent on asbestos litigation  Thirty one cents of every      dollar have gone to defense costs  and 27 cents have gone to      plaintiffs  attorneys and other related costs  Enactment of a      medical criteria bill  such as Senator Cornyns amendment  for      asbestos would fail to reduce the high transaction costs of the      asbestos tort system    Medical Criteria Fails To Protect      Businesses From Bankruptcy    Medical criteria bills do little to      protect businesses from going bankrupt or victims who were injured      by bankrupt companies from receiving fair compensation  Many      asbestos manufacturers are in bankruptcy proceedings and therefore      are immune from suit  Victims  like our nations veterans  are      unable to recover for asbestos exposure they received while serving      the country in the current tort system  The Judiciary Committee      recently received the following testimony from Hershel W  Gober       National Legislative Director  Military Order of the Purple Heart       The avenues open to veterans to      seek compensation through the tort system  however  are very      limited  The Federal government  as the members of this Committee      know  has sovereign immunity  thereby restricting veterans ability      to recover from the government  and most of the companies that      supplied asbestos to the Federal government have either disappeared      or are bankrupt and  therefore  are only able to provide a fraction      of the compensation that should be paid to asbestos victims  if      anything at all  Even if there is a solvent defendant company for a      veteran or his her family to pursue  there remains the lengthy       costly  and uncertain ordeal of filing a civil lawsuit and going      through discovery and trial  where the plaintiff bears a heavy      burden of proof and often has the very difficult to impossible task      of establishing which defendants product caused their injuries   Medical Criteria Fails To Effectively      Compensate Victims      Criteria bills  such as Senator      Cornyns amendment  would do nothing to compensate victims like our      nations veterans who were injured by bankrupt companies during      their service to our country  Legislation imposing medical criteria      in the tort system is inherently unfair to victims  Such measures      do not alleviate the delays victims face when confronted with      overwhelmed court dockets  Criteria bills  such as Senator Cornyns      amendment  allow defendants and insurers to enjoy the delays of      litigation and maintain all of their defenses in the tort system       Yet  they impose new hurdles for plaintiffs and continue to require      the identification and proof of the manufacturer or entity      responsible for exposing them to asbestos decades ago    FAIR Act is Fairer to Victims          In contrast  the FAIR Act Fund will      not require victims to identify and prove the manufacturer or entity      that exposed them to asbestos  Under the FAIR Act Fund  victims      will not have to hope that the entity responsible for their exposure      is financially solvent  They will recover compensation under the      Fund in proportion to their impairment or disease  The current      system for compensating victims of asbestos exposure is inefficient      and inequitable  Senator Cornyns medical criteria amendment is not      a solution because it operates within the same broken tort system       A true alternative will avoid the problems with the current asbestos      tort system and bankruptcy compensation process    FAIR Act Provides Timely Compensation      to Victims      The Trust Fund created by the FAIR      Act will provide fair and timely compensation to all victims      impaired by asbestos exposure and would bring financial certainty to      defendant companies and insurers  Senator Cornyns medical criteria      amendment that would operate within the existing tort system simply      would not   In addition  Senator Cornyns      amendment would pre empt the silica claims of thousands of victims       This is not fair to victims of silica exposure  which generally      produces a much different disease than asbestos exposure
