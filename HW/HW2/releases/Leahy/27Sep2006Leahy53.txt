       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Levin Amendment To Military Tribunal   Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Levin Amendment To Military Tribunal Legislation    September 27  2006   This Administration has yet to come clean     to the Congress or the American people in connection with the secret     legal justifications it has generated and secret practices it has     employed in detaining and interrogating hundreds if not thousands of     people in the war on terror  Even they cannot dismiss the practices at     Guantanamo as the actions of a few bad apples  With Senate adoption     of the anti torture amendment last year and the recent adoption of the     Army Field Manual  I had hoped that five years of Administration     resistance to the rule of law and to the U S  military abiding by its     Geneva obligations might be drawing to a close  Despite the resistance     of the Vice President and the Administration  the new Army Field Manual     appears to outlaw several of what the Administration euphemistically     calls aggressive tactics and that much of the world regards as torture     and cruel and degrading treatment  Of course  the President in his     signing statement undermined enactment of the anti torture law  and now     the Administration is seeking still greater license to engage in harsh     techniques in connection with the military tribunal legislation before     us now    What is being lost in this debate is any     notion of accountability  Where are the facts of what has been done in     the name of the United States  Where are the legal justifications and     technicalities the Administrations lawyers have been seeking to     exploit  Senator Levins amendment  which restores the bipartisan     legislation passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  would     maintain some accountability for this Administrations actions and some     standards of justice and decency  The Republican leaderships     legislation which is before us now strips away all accountability and     erodes our most basic national values   If the Administration had answered me when     I asked over and over about the Convention Against Torture and about     rendition  we could have come to grips with those matters before they     degenerated  as they have  into international embarrassment for the     United States  As Secretary Colin Powell wrote recently  The world is     beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism  It     did not need to come to that   If     FBI Director Mueller had been more forthcoming with me at or after the     May 2004 hearing in which I asked him about what the FBI had observed at     Guantanamo  we could have gotten to a detention and interrogation policy     befitting the U S  years sooner than we have    If the Administration would have responded     to my many inquiries over the years regarding the rendition of Maher     Arar  I would not have had to send yet another demand for information to     the Attorney General this week  and we would not have been embarrassed     by the Canadian commission report about his being sent by U S      authorities to Syria where he was tortured    Mr  Arar is the Canadian citizen who was     returning to Canada through New York when he was arrested by American     authorities at JFK airport and held for 12 days without access to a     Canadian consular official or lawyer  He was then rendered  not to     Canada  but to Syria  without the knowledge or approval of Canadian     officials  where he was tortured  Last week  a Canadian commission     inquiry determined that Mr  Arar had no ties to terrorists  he was     arrested on bad intelligence  and his forced confessions in Syria     reflected torture  not the truth  Sadly  the Administration is still     seeking to avoid accountability by hiding behind legal doctrines  The     Administration continues to thwart every effort to get to the facts  to     get to the truth and to be accountable  I am worried that the     legislation before us is one more example of that trend   Unfortunately  Senator Levins amendment      like the Armed Services Committees bill  retains the extremely     troubling habeas provision  I will be submitting an amendment to strip     that provision   We are rushing through legislation that     would have a devastating effect on our security and on our values  and     we need to step back and think about what we are doing  The President     recently said that time is of the essence to pass legislation     authorizing military commissions  Time was of the essence when this     Administration took control and did not act on the dire warnings of     terrorist action  Time was of the essence in August and early September     2001 when the 9 11 attacks could still have been prevented  This     Administration ignored warnings of a coming attack and even proposed     cutting the anti terror budget  It focused on Star Wars  not     terrorism  Time was of the essence when Osama bin Laden was trapped in     Tora Bora    After five years of unilateral actions by     this Administration that have left us less safe  time is now of the     essence to take real steps to keep us safe from terrorism like those in     the Real Security Act  S  3875  Instead  the President and the     Republican Senate leadership call for rubberstamping more flawed White     House proposals in the run up to another election  I hope that this     time the United States Senate will act as an independent branch of the     government and finally serve as a check on this Administration     We need to pursue the war on terror with     strength and intelligence  but also to do so consistent with American     values  The President says he wants clarity as to the meaning of the     Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act  Of course  he did not want     clarity when his Administration was using its twisted interpretation of     the law to authorize torture  cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees     and spying on Americans without warrants and keeping those rationales     and programs secret from Congress  The Administration does not seem to     want clarity when it refuses even to tell Congress what its     understanding of the law is following the withdrawal of a memo that said     the President could authorize and immunize torture  That memo was     withdrawn because it could not stand up in the light of day     It seems that the only clarity this     Administration wants is a clear green light from Congress to do whatever     it wants  That is not clarity  it is immunity  That is what the     current legislation would give to the President on interrogation     techniques and on military commissions  Justice OConnor reminded the     nation before her retirement that even war is not a blank check when     it comes to the rights of Americans  The Senate should not be a     rubberstamp for policies that undercut American values and make     Americans around the world less safe    In reality  we already have clarity      Senior military officers tell us they know what the Geneva Conventions     require  and the military trains its personnel according to these     standards  We have never had trouble urging other countries around the     world to accept and enforce the provisions of the Geneva Conventions      There was enough clarity for that  What the Administration appears to     want  instead  is to use new legislative language to create loopholes     and to narrow our obligations not to engage in cruel  degrading  and     inhuman treatment    In fact  the new legislation muddies the     waters  It saddles the War Crimes Act with a definition of cruel or     inhuman treatment so oblique that it appears to permit all manner of     cruel and extreme interrogation techniques  Senator McCain said this     weekend that some techniques like waterboarding and induced hypothermia     would be banned by the proposed law  But Senator Frist and the White     House disavowed his statements  saying that they preferred not to say     what techniques would or would not be allowed  That is hardly clarity      it is deliberate confusion    Into that breach  this legislation throws     the Administrations solution to all problems  more Presidential     power  It allows the Administration to promulgate regulations about     what conduct would and would not comport with the Geneva Conventions      though it does not require the President to specify which particular     techniques can and cannot be used  This is a formula for still fewer     checks and balances and for more abuse  secrecy  and power grabbing  It     is a formula for immunity for past and future abuses by the Executive   I worked hard  along with many others of     both parties  to pass the current version of the War Crimes Act  I     think the current law is a good law  and the concerns that have been     raised about it could best be addressed with minor adjustments  rather     than with sweeping changes   In 1996  working with the Department of     Defense  Congress passed the War Crimes Act to provide criminal     penalties for certain war crimes committed by and against Americans      The next year  again with the Pentagons support  Congress extended the     War Crimes Act to violations of the baseline humanitarian protections     afforded by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions  Both measures     were supported by a broad bipartisan consensus  and I was proud to     sponsor the 1997 amendments    The legislation was uncontroversial for a     good reason  As I explained at the time  the purpose and effect of the     War Crimes Act as amended was to provide for the implementation of     Americas commitment to the basic international standards we subscribed     to when we ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1955  Those standards are     truly universal  They condemn war criminals whoever and wherever they     are    That is a critically important aspect of     the Geneva Conventions and our own War Crimes Act  When we are dealing     with fundamental norms that define the commitments of the civilized     world  we cannot have one rule for us and one for them  however we     define us and them  As Justice Jackson said at the Nuremberg     tribunals  We are not prepared to lay     down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be     willing to have invoked against us    In that regard  I am disturbed     that the legislation before us narrows the scope of the War Crimes Act     to exclude certain violations of the Geneva Conventions and  perhaps     more disturbingly  to retroactively immunize past violations  Neither     the Congress nor the Department of Defense had any problem with the War     Crimes Act as it now stands when we were focused on using it to     prosecute foreign perpetrators of war crimes  I am concerned that this     is yet another example of this Administration overreaching  disregarding     the law and our international obligations  and seeking to immunize     others to break the law  It also could well prevent us from     prosecuting rogues who we all agree were out of line  like the soldiers     who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib    The President said on May 5  2004 about     prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib  I view those practices as     abhorrent  He continued  But in a democracy  as well  those mistakes     will be investigated  and people will be brought to justice  The     Republican leader of the Senate said on the same day  I rise to express     my shock and condemnation of these despicable acts  The persons who     carried them must face justice   Many of the despicable tactics used in Abu     Ghraib  the use of dogs  forced nudity  humiliation of various kinds      do not appear to be covered by the narrow definitions this legislation     would graft into the War Crimes Act  of course  despite the Presidents     calls for clarity  the new provisions are so purposefully ambiguous that     we cannot know for sure  If the Abu Ghraib abuses had come to light     after the perpetrators left the military  they might not have been able     to be brought to justice under the Administrations formulation       The President and the Congress should not     be in the business of immunizing people who have broken the law  making     us less safe  turning world opinion against us  and undercutting our     treaty obligations in ways that encourage others to ignore the     protections those treaties provide to Americans  We should be very     careful about any changes we make    If we lower our standards of domestic law     to allow outrageous conduct  we can do nothing to stop other countries     from doing the same  This change in our law does not prevent other     countries from prosecuting our troops and personnel for violations of     the Geneva Convention if they choose  it only changes our domestic law      But it could give other countries a green light to change their own law     to allow them to treat our personnel in cruel and inhuman ways   Let me be clear  There is no problem     facing us about overzealous use of the War Crimes Act by prosecutors      In fact  as far as I can tell  the Ashcroft Justice Department and the     Gonzales Justice Department have yet to file a single charge against     anyone for violation of the War Crimes Act  Not only have they never     charged American personnel under the Act  they have never used it to     charge terrorists either    We can address any concerns about the War     Crimes Act with reasonable amendments  as the Warner Levin bill did      without gutting the Act in a way that undermines our moral authority and     makes us less safe  Senator Levins amendment goes back to the     Warner Levin bills formulation  and I urge Senators of both parties to     support it    The proposed legislation would also allow     the admission into military commission proceedings of evidence obtained     through cruel and inhuman treatment  This provision would once again     allow this administration to avoid all accountability for its misguided     policies which have contributed to the rise of a new generation of     terrorists who threaten us  Not only would the military commission     legislation before us immunize those who violated international law and     stomped on basic American values  but it would allow them then to use     the evidence gotten in violation of basic principles of fairness and     justice    Allowing in this evidence would violate     our basic standards of fairness without increasing our security  Maher     Arar  the Canadian citizen sent by our government to Syria to be     tortured  confessed to attending terrorist training camps  A Canadian     commission investigating the case found that his confessions had no     basis in fact  They merely reflected that he was being tortured  and he     told his torturers what they wanted to hear  It is only one of many     such documented cases of bad information resulting from torture  We     gain nothing from allowing such information  The Armed Services     Committee bill  which the Levin amendment restores  would not allow the     use of this tainted evidence   The military commissions legislation     departs in other unfortunate ways from the Warner Levin bill  Early     this week  apparently at the White Houses request  Republican drafters     added a breathtakingly broad definition of unlawful enemy combatant     which includes people  citizens and non citizens alike  who have     purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United     States or its allies  It also includes people determined to be unlawful     enemy combatants by any competent tribunal established by the     President or the Secretary of Defense  So the government can select any     person  including a United States citizen  whom it suspects of     supporting hostilities  whatever that means  and begin denying that     person the rights and processes guaranteed in our country  The     implications are chilling  We should go back to the reasonable     definition the Senate Armed Services Committee came up with  That is     what the Levin amendment does   I hope that we will take the opportunity     before us to consider and pass bipartisan legislation that will make us     safer and help our fight on terrorism  both by giving us the tools we     need and by showing the world the values we cherish and defend  the same     values that make us a target  We should amend the legislation before us     to keep the War Crimes Act strong and to require some accountability     from the Administration  The Levin amendment does just that  and I urge     all senators to vote for it  Let us join together on behalf of real     security for Americans
