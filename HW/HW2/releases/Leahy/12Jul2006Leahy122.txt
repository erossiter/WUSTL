       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Examining The Need For   Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick        Leahy        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee         Hearing On Examining The Need For Comprehensive Immigration        Reform  Part II       July 12  2006  I am disappointed that in        recent weeks we have seen election year politics diminish        the hard work the Senate has done to find a comprehensive        solution to the nations immigration problem  The Senate        worked hard to create a bipartisan bill that delivered fair        and comprehensive reforms  Since its passage we have seen        the Republican Congress reject efforts to move forward and        make progress  despite the efforts of the Senate Democratic        leader to get the matter to conference  Instead of progress        toward legislation we see a series of after the fact        hearings  A few  like the one held by the Senate Armed        Services Committee this week and the Chairmans field        hearing last week contribute to the record supporting the        Senate bill  Others seem intended to do nothing more than        inflame the passions of anti immigrant activists and attempt        to doom any chance of progress towards a comprehensive        solution    The lines that have been drawn        by opponents to comprehensive legislation are clear  The        anti immigrant faction opposes a fair and comprehensive        approach  They abhor establishing a pathway to earned        citizenship  Apparently they believe this anti immigrant        position will help them in the upcoming elections  I hope        not  I think we reject the best of America        and our values when we refuse to recognize all that        immigrants bring and mean to this country  I hope that fear        and intolerance are not a winning political strategy    It is unrealistic to think        that we can apprehend and deport every undocumented        individual the Bush Cheney Administration has allowed into        the United States  The reality is that our        economy depends upon the labor of foreign workers  Small        and large business owners have told us this  the Mayor of        the one of the largest cities in the worldwho is no        stranger to economic successhas told us this  and labor        unions have told us this     The Wall        Street Journal editorial board recently        wrote that the choiceframed by immigration opponents as a        choice between amnesty or border securityis a false one         It is false because we can have border security at the same        time we bring out of the shadows and assimilate individuals        who are hard working  honest people contributing to our        economy    I do not often agree with  The Wall Street Journal       editorial board  but in this case we do agree         When border patrol agents are not spending time and        resources apprehending people coming here to work  they can        focus on preventing the true threats to our national        security  I believe there is real merit to the Presidents        argument that if we increase the opportunity to come to the       United States legally  we will reduce the        demand for illegal entry    It is disheartening to watch        this debate devolve into a discourse with tinges of        intolerance for those who come as immigrants  We are a        welcoming  diverse country built and enriched by        immigrants  Isolating ourselves  and turning this country        into a police state is not the way our Nation will remain        the beacon of freedom and prosperity it has always been          Many decry a realistic        immigration policy as the downfall of our unique American        culture and way of life  In these arguments  I hear the        echoes of those who resisted women finally obtaining the        right to vote and when the modern civil rights movement        helped end Jim Crowism  We are an inclusive society that        draws strength from diversity and believes in equality          The opposition to providing        bilingual ballots to bilingual American citizens  who are        vested with the right to vote  is a particularly troubling        aspect of this debate  A recent  Washington Post        editorial pointed out the obvious  when more eligible voters        can make an informed and intelligent choice in voting  our        democracy benefits from their participation  Section 203s        guarantee of equality is not just for immigrants but for        Native Americans and those who have long been citizens  The        reality is that people who come to the United        States embrace the English language along with patriotism         Immigrants do not deserve or need the legal restrictions        sought by the English only crowd  And America loses when we        discriminate on the basis of national origin or language          Let us have faith in our        traditional values and show the strength and purpose needed        to accomplish the comprehensive reform we need  Our        democracy and free markets can adapt  We should not fear        these changes  We should embrace the cultural and economic        opportunities that change will bring  Most importantly         along with a comprehensive policy will come better border        security  When government agencies can identify and account        for those who are here  and those who are crossing the        border  we will be more secure as a result of that        knowledge  We know well that no matter how much effort we        pour into locking up our border  those who desire to come to        the United States will find a way  which in        turn will lead to more people in the shadows of society         more deaths in our deserts  and more trafficking in human        beings    It is critical that President        Bush make good on his commitment to support the Senates        work  Without his active support and his steadfast        dedication  the congressional Republican efforts to derail        comprehensive reform will succeed  Many conservative        commentators have praised the President for his political        courage  I hope the President will remain true to his        pledge to support comprehensive reform our immigration        laws
