       Cornyn  Leahy Introduce Bill To Create Open Government                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     CORNYN  LEAHY INTRODUCE BILL         TO CREATE OPEN GOVERNMENT COMMISSION   Faster FOIA Act will create a 16 member         commission to recommend ways to reduce delays in response time         WASHINGTONSens  John Cornyn  R Texas   a member of the Senate Judiciary        Committee  and Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member of the        committee  introduced legislation on Thursday to establish an advisory        Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays  The 16 member        commission would be charged with reporting to Congress and the President        its recommendations for steps that should be taken to reduce delays in the        processing of requests under the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA    Im        pleased to commence another bipartisan effort with Sen  Leahy to reinforce        our national commitment to freedom of information and openness in        government  Sen  Cornyn said  This is an especially appropriate time to        promote this important cause  because starting this Sunday         America will observe the first ever national Sunshine Week  a celebration        of our nations founding principles and commitment to freedom of        information and openness in government  It is also long past due    Sen         Leahy  who has been a longtime champion of FOIA in Congress  said  Agency        delay has long been a nettlesome problem in FOIA implementation  Many FOIA        requests are processed efficiently  but others drag out inexplicably         sometimes for years  Some agencies have not filled requests from the late        1980s  before the collapse of the Soviet Union  even though        the requestors have repeated their requests for the information  The Faster        FOIA Act responds to the most common concerns of FOIA requestors by        offering ways to solve these problems for the good of agencies and        requestors   Sens         Cornyn and Leahy introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our        National Government Act of 2005  OPEN Government Act  S  394  on Feb  16         The legislation will promote accountability  accessibility  and openness in        government  principally by strengthening and enhancing the Freedom of        Information Act    Sens         Cornyn and Leahy plan a hearing on March 15 to examine the OPEN Government        Act in the Judiciary Committees subcommittee on Terrorism  Technology and        Homeland Security  Sen  Jon Kyl  R Ariz    who chairs the Terrorism        subcommittee  agreed to let Sen  Cornyn chair the hearing on the Cornyn Leahy        bill    The        last time Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade ago         and the Senate Judiciary Committee has not convened an oversight hearing on        compliance issues since April 30  1992  The Senate Homeland        Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  which shares jurisdiction over        federal government information  has not held a FOIA oversight hearing since        1980    The        hearing comes during the first ever national Sunshine Week  a dialogue        about the publics right of access to government information  which begins        on March 13  More information can be found at www sunshineweek org        Highlights of the        Cornyn Leahy Faster FOIA Act   The Faster FOIA Act of 2005 would establish          an advisory Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays           The Commission would be charged with reporting to Congress and the          President its recommendations for steps that should be taken to reduce          delays in the administration of the Freedom of Information Act      The Commission would be comprised of 16          members  Twelve of them would be appointed by members of Congress  three          by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  three by the chairman          of the House Government Reform Committee  and three each by the ranking          minority member of the two committees  These four members of Congress          would each be required to appoint at least one member to the Commission          with experience submitting FOIA requests on behalf of nonprofit research          or educational organizations or news media organizations  and at least          one member with experience in academic research in the fields of library          science  information management  or public access to Government          information  The remaining four positions on the Commission would be held          by designees of the Attorney General  the Director of the Office of          Management and Budget  the Archivist of the United States           and the Comptroller General      The Commission would be responsible for          producing a study to identify methods to reduce delays in the processing          of FOIA requests and to ensure the efficient and equitable administration          of FOIA throughout the federal government  The Commission would also be          charged with examining whether the system for charging fees and granting          fee waivers under FOIA should be reformed in order to reduce delays in          processing fee requests  The report would be due no later than one year          after the date of enactment of this Act  and would include          recommendations for legislative and administrative action to enhance FOIA          performance  The Commission would expire thirty days after the submission          of the report      Cornyn was presented with        the James Madison Award in 2001 for his efforts as Texas Attorney General        to promote open government by the Freedom of Information Foundation of       Texas  Sen  Cornyn served        previously as Texas Attorney General  Texas Supreme Court Justice  and        Bexar County District Judge    Leahy sponsored the        Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments  which updated FOIA for        the Internet age  and in 1996 he was installed in the Freedom of        Information Act Hall of Fame    30           Below is Leahys Statement on the Introduction of the Bill          Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy       On Introduction of the Faster FOIA Act of 2005       March 10  2005  MR         LEAHY  I am pleased to join my colleague from Texas  Senator        John Cornyn  in introducing what is our second cooperative action in this        Congress to improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act         or FOIA  This bill  called the Faster FOIA Act of 2005  responds to        commonly voiced concerns of FOIA requestors over agency delay in processing        requests    I want        to express my appreciation to all of the FOIA officers and other Federal        employees who work hard to process FOIA requests quickly and efficiently         I know that many simple requests are filled within a few days  and I        understand that complex requests dealing with national security issues can        take time for declassification  redaction  or release  as appropriate          There        are  nonetheless  significant delays at many agencies  In 2003  a        non governmental organization  the National Security Archive  looked into        just how long some FOIA requests are left unfulfilled  The group found        that the oldest requests dated back to the late 1980s  before the collapse        of the Soviet Union  The oldest of these was a request to        the FBI for information on the Bureaus activities at the University of        California  First filed in November 1987  this request was partially        fulfilled in 1996 after extensive litigation  According to the National        Security Archive  the documents that were released revealed unlawful FBI        intelligence activities and the efforts to cover up such conduct  After a        2002 article in the San Francisco        Chronicle  and inquiries from Senator Feinstein  the Bureau        acknowledged that there were at least 17 000 pages of records that still        had not been produced  Since then  some data has been released  but the        requestor recently told me that he believes more than 15 000 pages remain        outstanding    This is        an extreme case  but delays are commonplace  Sometimes slowdowns are        caused by poorly managed or decentralized data systems that result in an        agency not knowing what documents are located where  Other times         components within a single agency do not effectively communicate with one        another  so that no one can say whether a request has been filled or not         Finally  we have heard anecdotal evidence of certain agencies engaging in        protracted disputes over fee waivers sought by FOIA requestors  I have        worked closely with the Government Accountability Office over the past few        years to obtain detailed analysis of how fees are collected and how fee        waiver requests are processed  The analysts at GAO have looked long and        hard at these issues  I am grateful for their efforts and look forward to        the results of their study later this year    One of        the problems faced by GAO  and anyone else who has looked into agency        delay  is the lack of comprehensive reporting data  We address this        problem in our companion bill  S 394  the Open Government Act  by calling        for more detailed reporting from agencies on FOIA processing     These        issues deserve a closer look in the short term  however  In this bill  we        propose to establish a commission to review agency delay and to make        recommendations for reducing impediments to the efficient processing of        requests  The Commission would also examine whether the system for        charging fees and granting waivers should be modified    The        Commission would be made up of government and non governmental        representatives with a broad range of experience in both submitting and        handling FOIA requests  in information science  and in the development of        government information policy    I        understand that many requests are complex and that the resources devoted to        agency FOIA processing are often lacking  Our companion bill  S 394  the        Open Government Act  addresses this issue by establishing a FOIA ombudsman        requiring the Office of Personnel Management to examine how FOIA can be        better implemented at the agency level  If the Commission finds that        limited resources are a significant factor in slowing down the fulfillment        of requests  then Congress should address the issue by increasing funding        levels for FOIA processing    I want        to thank the Senator from Texas for his diligent work and        flexibility in crafting a Commission structure that is balanced and fair         and that will bring extraordinary expertise to solving these nettlesome        problems  I urge all of our colleagues to support the Faster FOIA Act         which has the potential to help agencies and requestors alike in the        service of open government
