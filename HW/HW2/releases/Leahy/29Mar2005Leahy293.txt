       Comments of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   On GAO s Report On Development   Issues In TSA s Secure Flight Passenger Screening Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         On GAOs Report On Development Issues       In TSAs Secure Flight Passenger Screening Program       Monday  March 28  2005  The development of Secure Flight appears to be off         to a better start than earlier versions of the passenger screening         program  The process has started with greater transparency  and this         audit shows that some progress has been made in addressing the concerns         outlined by Congress  But the GAO report also clearly shows that there is         more work to do before Secure Flight should be deployed  The problems GAO has identified strongly suggest that        Secure Flight will not be ready for prime time when TSA plans to deploy the        system in August  Congress was clear that TSA needs to meet several        requirements before implementation  including providing due process for        passengers wrongly delayed or denied boarding and correcting data errors         preventing large numbers of false positives  and ensuring that there are no        specific privacy concerns with the technological architecture  Congress        was also clear that during the testing phase  no information gathered from        passengers  airlines and reservation systems should be used to screen         delay or deny boarding  except when an individual ison a government        watchlist   GAOs report shows that we are still a long way from        assurances in these critical areas  There are still many unknowns and        uncompleted tasks  including thorough evaluation of test results and the        use and accuracy of commercial data  TSA needs to work the bugs out of        this system before inflicting unnecessary difficulties on the traveling        public  These critical concerns should be addressed thoroughly and        effectively before proceeding to the next phase  Premature implementation        would undermine the publics trust and confidence in the screening system        and limit its overall effectiveness  We need screening for safety  but we        must take the time and effort needed to do it right  We also need to scrutinize TSAs plans for using        commercial data brokers  A report released on Friday by the DHS Inspector        General assessed TSAs role in facilitating the transfer of more than 12        million private sector records on airline passengers  The report concluded        that TSA officials gave inaccurate statements about those data transfers        and failed to ensure privacy protections  TSA must do better when it comes        to the issue of commercial data and Secure Flight  We should know what        kind of information these data brokers will be supplying and whether it is        reliably accurate and readily correctable  and we should establish to what        extent such data will actually improve safety and security  The role of        commercial data companies in government efforts has been expanding for far        too long without sufficient oversight
