  Authored By Leahy After The Drega Shootout                         That The Bush Budget Would Cut By 63 Percent                               Leahys Program By Now Has Equipped           1400            Vermont Police Officers With Body Armor  WASHINGTON             Thursday  March 16   The U S  Senate            Thursday night approved an amendment by Sen             Patrick Leahy to fully fund a program he            authored that helps local and state police            departments afford bulletproof vests and            body armor for their officers    Leahys            amendment now is part of the Senates            version of the budget resolution for the            next federal fiscal year  which will be the            blueprint for appropriations bills for all            federal agencies  including the Justice            Department  which administers the Leahy vest            partnership program    The budget            proposed by President Bush would cut the            Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program            by 63 percent  leaving just  9 million to be            allocated nationwide  Leahys amendment            proposes  41 million more  to fully fund the            program at  50 million     Since 1998             when Leahys program was enacted  Vermonts            police and sheriffs offices have used the            grants to buy 1400 vests for their officers    Leahys            Congressional Record statement about his            amendment follows               Statement Of            Sen  Patrick Leahy           On Amendment  3154 To            The Budget Resolution           To Restore Funds For            The Bulletproof Vests Partnership Program              March 16  2006   Mr  LEAHY             Mr  President  I offer an amendment to the            budget resolution that would restore            much needed funding to the Bulletproof Vest            Partnership Program  The Administrations            budget slashes this program by  20 million             which amounts to a 63 percent cut to a            program that helps save the lives of law            enforcement officers nationwide by providing            state and local law enforcement agencies            with the resources to help buy body armor            for their officers     My amendment            supports the allocation of  41 million in            additional funding for Bulletproof Vest            Partnership Grants to fully fund the program            at its authorized level of  50 million in            Fiscal Year 2007  The increase in funds is            offset by discretionary spending reductions    Our former            colleague Senator Campbell and I authored            the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act            of 1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega            shootout in 1997 on the Vermont New            Hampshire border  in which two state            troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were            killed  The federal officers who responded            to the scenes of the shooting spree were            equipped with life saving body armor  but            the state and local law enforcement officers            lacked protective vests because of the cost    Grant Act of            2000  in the State Justice Institute            Reauthorization Act of 2004  and most            recently as part of the Violence Against            Women and Department of Justice            Reauthorization Act of 2005  It is now            authorized at  50 million per year through            FY 2009    Year after            year  the Bulletproof Vest Partnership            Program saves the lives and spares injuries            of law enforcement officers nationwide by            providing more help to state and local law            enforcement agencies to purchase body            armor  Since its inception in 1999  this            highly successful DOJ program has provided            law enforcement officers in 16 000            jurisdictions nationwide with nearly 350 000            new bulletproof vests  In Vermont  more            than 150 municipalities have used this            partnership help to purchase 1 400 vests             Without the assistance this program offers             I daresay there would be close to that            number of police officers without vests in            Vermont today    Compounding            the ongoing funding needs to help purchase            vests  concerns from the law enforcement            community over the effectiveness of body            armor surfaced nearly two years ago when a            Pennsylvania police officer was shot and            critically wounded through his relatively            new Zylon based body armor vest  In August            2005  the Justice Department announced that            test results indicated that used Zylon based            vests may not provide the intended level of            ballistic resistance  Unfortunately  an            estimated 200 000 of these faulty vests have            been purchased  many with Vest Partnership            funds  and now need to be replaced    We know that            body armor saves lives  but the cost has put            these vests out of the reach of many of the            officers who need them  This program makes            it more affordable for police departments of            all sizes  Few things mean more to me than            when I meet Vermont police officers and they            tell me that the protective vests they wear            were made possible because of this program             This is the least we should do for the            officers on the front lines who put            themselves in danger for us every day    I want to make            sure that every police officer who needs a            bulletproof vest gets one  If the Senate            approves this amendment to fully fund this            program at  50 million  then we will be on            our way to helping ease the burden faced by            officers and their families and to further            our mission to provide every police officer            who needs a safe vest with the means to            purchase one
