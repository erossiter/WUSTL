       Specter  Leahy Introduce Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Specter  Leahy      Introduce     Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2005  WASHINGTON  D C   Wednesday  June 29         Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    Chairman of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  and Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the panels ranking      member  introduced Wednesday the Personal Data Privacy and Security      Act of 2005  legislation that would help consumers better protect      the privacy of their personal information in the face of recurrent      data security breaches across the country   Their bill draws from testimony      earlier this year  April      13  2005  at the Judiciary Committees hearing on electronic data      security after serious data breaches at ChoicePoint and LexisNexis       Since then breaches at several other firms have also exposed      millions of Americans to identity theft by leaking or losing their      personal data  which included names  addresses  and sometimes Social      Security numbers  In the most recent case  CardSystems  a company      that services credit cards for MasterCard International  Visa and      other brands  acknowledged that its databases had been compromised       potentially exposing information about more than 40 million      cardholders    We are in a field of      phenomenal electronic advances  Senator Specter said  We are now      seeing breaches in the security of those advances  and it has become      a matter of serious consequence for our individual privacy and law      enforcement  which rely upon these electronic mechanisms to identify      suspects and pursue legitimate law enforcement interests   Our laws need to keep pace with      technology  said Leahy  Insecure databases have become low hanging      fruit for hackers looking to steal identities and commit fraud      during a time when we are seeing a troubling rise in organized rings      that target personal data to sell in online  virtual bazaars       Leahy also testified before the Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs      Committee earlier this year on the issue         Key features of the Specter Leahy legislation include            Increasing criminal penalties for identity theft involving      electronic personal data by  1  increasing penalties for computer      fraud when such fraud involves personal data   2  adding fraud      involving unauthorized access to personal information as a predicate      offense for RICO and  3  making it a crime to intentionally or      willfully conceal a security breach involving personal data            Giving individuals access to  and the opportunity to correct  any      personal information held by data brokers            Requiring entities that maintain personal data to establish internal      policies that protect such data and vet third parties they hire to      process that data            Requiring entities that maintain personal data to give notice to      individuals and law enforcement when they experience a breach      involving sensitive personal data            Limits the buying  selling or displaying of a social security number      without consent from the individual whose number it is  prohibits      companies from requiring individuals to use social security numbers      as their account numbers and places limits on when companies can      force individuals to turn over those numbers in order to obtain      goods or services  and bars government agencies from posting public      records that contain Social Security numbers on the Internet  and           Requiring the government to establish rules protecting privacy and      security when it uses data broker information  to conduct audits of      government contracts with data brokers and impose penalties on      government contractors that fail to meet data privacy and security      requirements                        Leahys Statement on the Introduction of the Bill   Statement of Senator Patrick      Leahy     On The Introduction Of     The Specter Leahy Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005     June 29  2005  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today we      introduce the Specter Leahy Personal Data Privacy and Security Act      of 2005  Reforms are urgently needed to protect      Americans privacy and to secure their personal data  There have      been steady waves of security breaches over the past six months       with the latest involving a database containing 40 million credit      card numbers at a company that most Americans never knew existed        These security breaches are a window      on a broader  more challenging trend  Advanced technologies have      improved our lives and can help make us safer  Private data about      Americans has become a hot commodity  This personal and financial     information about each of us suddenly is a treasure      trove  valuable and vulnerable  but our privacy and security laws      have not kept pace  The reality is that in the digital era  a      robust market has developed for collecting and selling personal      information  Today  all types of corporate and governmental      entities routinely traffic in billions of digitized personal records      about Americans    The data broker market has exploded in      size to meet this demand  Insecure databases are now low hanging      fruit for hackers looking to steal identities and commit fraud  We      are seeing a rise in organized rings that target personal data to      sell in online  virtual bazaars    In this information saturated age  the      use of personal data has significant consequences for every      American  People have lost jobs  mortgages and control over their      credit and identities because personal information has been      mishandled or listed incorrectly  This trend raises new threats to      our personal security as well as to our privacy  In one disturbing      case  a stalker purchased the Social Security number of a woman with      whom he was obsessed  used that information to track her down  He      killed her  and then shot himself    Americans everywhere are wondering       Why do all these companies have my personal      information  What are they doing with it  Why arent they      protecting it better  And they are right to wonder  It is time      for Congress to catch up with the data market and to show the      American people that we      are aware of these threats and will protect the privacy and security      of their personal information    Chairman Specter and I have worked      closely together over many months to craft comprehensive legislation      to fix key vulnerabilities in our information      economy  We thought through these issues carefully and took the      time needed to develop well balanced  focused legislation that      provides strong protections where necessary  We also provide tough      penalties and consequences for failing to protect Americans most      personal information  Reforms like these are long overdue  This      issue and our legislation deserve to become a key part of this      years domestic agenda so that we can achieve some positive changes      in areas that affect the everyday lives of Americans    First  our bill      requires data brokers to let people know what information they have      about them  and to allow people to correct inaccurate information       These principles have precedent from the credit report context  and      we have adapted them in a way that makes sense for the data      brokering industry  Its a simple matter of fairness   Second  we would      require companies that have databases with personal information on      Americans to establish and implement data privacy and security      programs  Any company that wants to be trusted by the public in      this day and age must vigilantly protect databases housing      Americans private data  They also have a responsibility in the      next link in the security chain  to make sure that contractors hired      to process data are on the up and up and secure  This is critical      as Americans personal information is increasingly processed      overseas    Third  our bill      requires notice when sensitive personal information has been      compromised  The American people have a right to know when they are      at risk because of corporate failures to protect their data  or when      a criminal has infiltrated data systems  The notice rules in our      bill were crafted carefully to ensure that the trigger for notice is      tied to risk and to recognize important fraud prevention techniques      that already exist  But our priority was making sure that victims      have that critical information as a roadmap providing the assistance      necessary to protect themselves  their families and their financial      well being   Fourth  our bill      provides tough new protections for Social Security numbers  which      are the keys to unlocking so much of our financial and personal      lives  The use of Social Security numbers has expanded well beyond      the intended purposes  Some uses provide important benefits  but      others have made Americans vulnerable  Social Security numbers are      for sale online for small fees  Earlier this year  it was reported      that a payroll and benefits company put the Social Security numbers      of 1 000 workers on postcards       on postcards    brazenly visible      for anyone to see  Worse still  those postcards described in detail      how those Social Security numbers could be used to access employee      benefits online  This is unacceptable  and this bill would make      that kind of disregard and sloppiness illegal    Finally  our bill      addresses the governments use of personal data  We are living in a      world where the government is increasingly looking to the private      sector to get personal data that it could not legally collect on its      own without oversight and appropriate protections  So ingrained has      the data broker government partnership become that a ChoicePoint      executive stated  We do act as an intelligence agency  gathering      data  applying analytics  While these relationships can help      protect us  there must be oversight and appropriate protections        The recent decision to award      Choicepoint an IRS contract highlights this tension  It is      especially galling right now to be rewarding firms that have been so      careless with the publics confidential information       The dust has not yet settled and the investigations are incomplete      on ChoicePoints lax security practices  We should at least take a      pause before rewarding such missteps with even more government      contracts  This bill would place privacy and security front and      center in evaluating whether data brokers can be trusted with      government contracts that involve sensitive information about the      American people  It would require contract reviews that include      these considerations  audits to ensure good practice  and contract      penalties for failure to protect data privacy and security   The Specter Leahy legislation meets      other key goals  It provides tough monetary and criminal penalties      for compromising personal data or failing to provide necessary      protections  This creates an incentive for companies to protect      personal information  especially when there is no      commercial relationship between individuals and companies using      their data   Our legislation also carefully      balances the need for federal uniformity and state leadership       States are often on the forefront of protecting privacy and spurring      change  The California security breach law has been      an important lesson  My state of Vermont was among the first  if      not the first  to require individual consent before sharing      financial information with third parties  and to require a person or      business to obtain consent from individuals before reviewing their      credit reports  The role of states is important  and our bill      identifies areas that require uniformity while leaving the states      free to act elsewhere as they see fit  We also would authorize an      additional  100 million over 4 years to help state law enforcement      fight misuse of personal information   This is a solid bill         a comprehensive bill          that not only deals with providing Americans notice when they have      already been hurt  but also deals with the underlying problem of lax      security and lack of accountability in dealing with their most      personal and private information   I commend Senator Specter for his      leadership on this emerging problem  A number of us have been      working on these issues    Senator Feinstein  Senator Nelson       Senator Cantwell and Senator Schumer  among others  I appreciate      and recognize their hard work and look forward to making progress      together  I am pleased to work closely with Senator Specter on this      and believe that we have a bill that significantly advances the ball      in protecting Americans                        Summary of the Key Features of the Bill   Summary Of The     Specter Leahy Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2005     June 29  2005   Provides Americans notice when       they have been harmed  and also addresses the underlying problem       of lax security and lack of accountability in dealing with       personal data      Requires data brokers to let       individuals know what information they have about       them  and where appropriate  allow individuals to correct       inaccurate information      Requires companies that have       databases with personal information on more than       10 000 Americans to establish and implement data privacy and       security programs  and vet third party contractors hired to       process data      Requires notice to law       enforcement  consumers and credit reporting agencies when       digitized sensitive personal information has been       compromised  The trigger for notice is tied to risk of harm        and there are exemptions for notice where the risk is  de minimis or where       fraud prevention techniques prevent harm to consumers  Also       requires that companies provide victim protection assistance        specifically free access to credit reports and credit monitoring       services  to individuals notified that their personal data has       been breached      Prohibits the display and sale of       Social Security numbers  SSNs  without consent  with exceptions       for law enforcement and other authorized purposes  and prohibits       companies from requiring individuals to use their SSNs as       account numbers  Also  prohibits companies from requiring       individuals to turn over SSNs as a prerequisite for receiving       goods and services  with exceptions for background checks        consumer reports and law enforcement      Addresses the governments use of       personal data by requiring   1  the General Services       Administration to evaluate the privacy and security practices of       potential government contractors handling personal data  and       include penalties in government contracts for failure to protect       data privacy and security   2  Federal departments and agencies       to audit the information security practices of       commercial data brokers hired for projects involving personal       data   3  Federal departments and agencies to conduct privacy       impact assessments on their use of commercial databases with       personal data  to adopt regulations to ensure the security and       privacy of data obtained through commercial data brokers and to       include protections and penalties in contracts with data brokers       to protect data privacy and security  and  4  federal       departments and agencies to seek Congressional approval before       establishing programs that rely on commercial data brokers to       screen individuals and to establish security and privacy       measures for such uses      Provides tough monetary penalties       for failing to provide privacy and security protections and       notices of security breaches  and toughens criminal penalties       for those who infiltrate systems to compromise personal data or       attempt to cover up security breaches      Balances the need for federal       uniformity and state leadership by identifying areas that       require uniformity while leaving the states free to act       elsewhere as they see fit      Authorizes an additional  100       million over 4 years to help state law enforcement fight misuse       of personal information                          Section by Section of the Bill    Section By Section Summary     Of The Personal Data Privacy And Security Act of 2005     June 29  2005   TITLE I  ENHANCING      PUNISHMENT FOR IDENTITY THEFT     AND OTHER VIOLATIONS OF DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY   Section 101  Fraud      and Related Criminal Activity in Connection with Unauthorized Access      to Personally Identifiable Information  Section 101 extends the criminal      computer fraud statute to cover unauthorized access of  information contained in the databases or systems of a data      broker  or in other personal electronic records  The statute      already covers unauthorized access of information contained in a      financial record of a financial institution or card issuer in a      consumer reporting agency file on a consumer    Section 102         Organized Criminal Activity in Connection with Unauthorized Access      to Personally Identifiable Information  Section 102 amends the Racketeer      Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  RICO  statute to address the      emergence of sophisticated criminal organizations trafficking in      large amounts of personally identifiable information       Specifically  this section amends the definition of racketeering      activity in 18 U S C     1961 to include fraud and related activity      in connection with unauthorized access to personally identifiable      information  The definition currently includes similar provisions       such as fraud and related activities in connection with      identification documents and financial institution fraud    Section 103       Concealment of Security Breaches Involving Personally Identifiable      Information   Section 103 makes it a crime for a      person who knows of a security breach requiring notice to      individuals under Title IV of this Act to intentionally and      willfully conceal the fact of  or information related      to  that security breach  Punishment is either a fine under Title      18  or imprisonment of up to 5 years  or both     Section 104  Aggravated Fraud in      Connection with Computers  Section 104 creates a new crime of      aggravated fraud in connection with computers  Any person who       during and in relation to a felony violation of the computer fraud      law  knowingly obtains  accesses or transmits a means of      identification of another person without lawful authority  may be      imprisoned for up to 2 years in addition to the punishment provided      for such felony     Section 105       Review and Amendment of Federal Sentencing Guidelines Related to      Fraudulent Access to or Misuse of Digitized or Electronic Personally      Identifiable Information  Section 105 directs the United States      Sentencing Commission to review  and if necessary  amend the federal      sentencing guidelines  including its policy statements  to ensure      that they appropriately reflect the serious nature of  and deter      crimes related to  the use of fraud to access or misuse digitized      personally identifiable information    TITLE II   ASSISTANCE FOR STATE AND      LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT    Section 201  Grants for State and      Local Enforcement  Section 201 establishes a program      within the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice      to award funds to state and local law enforcement in combating      activities related to fraudulent  unauthorized or other criminal use      of personally identifiable information      Section 202  Authorization of      Appropriations  Section 202 authorizes appropriations      in the amount of  25 million for each of fiscal years 2006 through      2009 for this program    TITLE III   DATA      BROKERS  Title III addresses the data brokering      industry that has come of age prompted by technology developments      and changes in marketplace incentives  Data brokers collect and      sell billions of private and public records containing individuals      personal information  Many of these companies also      provide products and services  including identity verification       background screening  risk assessments  individual digital dossiers       and tools for analyzing data    Although some of the products and      services provided by data brokers are currently subject to privacy      and security protections aimed at credit reporting agencies and the      financial industry under the Fair Credit Reporting Act  FCRA  and      Gramm Leach Bliley Act  GLB   many are not subject to such      protections  In addition  there has been insufficient oversight of      the industrys practices  including the accuracy and handling of      sensitive data  These concerns have been highlighted by the      security breaches at ChoicePoint  LexisNexis  Acxiom and many      others  as well as reports on harm caused by inaccurate data      records    Title III draws from the principles in      FCRA to close these loopholes  provide additional oversight  and      ensure privacy and security protections for all data broker products      and services involving personally identifiable      information   For the purposes of this Act  the term      data broker is defined as a business entity which for monetary      fees  dues  or on a cooperative nonprofit basis  regularly engages       in whole or in part  in the practice of collecting  transmitting  or      otherwise providing personally identifiable      information on a nationwide basis on more than 5 000 individuals who      are not the customers or employees of the business entity or      affiliate     Section 301  Transparency and      Accuracy of Data Collection  Section 301 applies disclosure and      accuracy requirements to data brokers that engage in interstate      commerce and offer any product or service to third parties that      allows access  use  compilation  distribution  processing  analyzing      or evaluating of personally identifiable information       Section 301 requirements are not applicable to products and services      already subject to similar disclosure and accuracy provisions under      FCRA and GLB  and implementing regulations   Access to Personal Electronic Records       Section 301 b  1  requires data brokers to disclose to individuals      upon their request and for a reasonable fee the individuals      personal electronic records that the data broker maintains and      provides to third parties    Process for Correcting Inaccurate      Personal Electronic Records  Sections 301 b  2       and 301 c  require data brokers to establish and disclose a fair      process for individuals to dispute  flag or correct any inaccuracies      in their personal electronic records maintained by the data broker       In addition  Section 301 d  sets minimum requirements for addressing      inaccurate information obtained from both public and non public      record sources of information    Public record and non public record      information are treated differently on the theory that data brokers      have less leeway in addressing and resolving claims of inaccuracy      for information gathered from public record sources  For public      record information  Section 301 d  1  requires data      brokers to verify that they have accurately and completely recorded      the information from the public record source  and to correct      information that does not accurately and completely reflect public      record information  If the data broker determines that it has      accurately recorded information from the public record source  the      data brokers may simply identify and direct individuals to the      public record source to address any further claims of inaccuracies        Section 301 d  2  outlines procedures      for correcting non public record information  Modeled      after Section 611of FCRA  this provision requires data brokers to        1  investigate disputed non public record information within 30      days   2  identify the source of the disputed information   3       notify individuals about dispute procedures   4  allow individuals      to include a statement of dispute in the electronic records      containing the disputed personal information for up to 90 days   5       notify individuals of the results of the accuracy investigation  and       6  delete or correct inaccurate information  and provide      notification of such changes to users or customers of data broker      services in the previous 90 days  Section 301 d  also allows data      brokers to skip certain procedures in instances where disputes can      be resolved within 3 days    Section 302       Enforcement  A data broker in violation of Section      301 is subject to penalties of  1 000 per violation per day with a      maximum of  15 000 per day  A data broker that intentionally or      willfully violates the provisions of Section 301 is subject to      additional penalties of  1 000 per violation per day  with a maximum      of an additional  15 000 per day    The U S  Attorney General may bring a      civil action in U S  district court for violations of      Section 301  This section also authorizes the attorney general of a      State to bring a civil action on behalf of the residents of that      State  upon advance notice to the U S  Attorney General where      practicable  The U S  Attorney General has the right to stay state      actions pending disposition of federal actions  intervene or file      petitions for appeal     Section 303          Relation to State Laws  Modeled after the preemption provision      in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act  FACT Act   Section      303 preempts state laws only to the extent they are   1       inconsistent with Title III  or  2  address areas specifically      subject to preemption by Section 303  Specifically  Section 303      preempts state laws on subject matters regulated by Section 301     Section      304         Effective Date       Title III takes effect 180 days after the date of enactment    TITLE IV PRIVACY      AND SECURITY OF    PERSONALLY      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION   Subtitle A  Data      Privacy and Security Program   Section 401       Purpose and Applicability of Data Privacy and Security Program  Section 401 applies data privacy and      security requirements to businesses entities engaging in interstate      commerce that involves collecting  accessing  transmitting  using       storing or disposing of personally identifiable      information in electronic or digital form on 10 000 or more U S       persons  Section 401 exempts from the data privacy and security      requirements of Section 502   1  financial institutions subject to      similar data privacy and security requirements under the Gramm Leach Bliley      Act  GLB  and implementing regulations  and  2  covered entities      subject to data security requirements pursuant to the Health      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPPA  and      implementing regulations     Section 402  Requirements for a      Data Privacy and Security Program  Section 402 requires covered business      entities to create a data privacy and security program  The      requirements in this section are partly modeled after those      established by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for      financial institutions in its      Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding      Customer Information  12 C F R     30 6 Appendix B       2005     A data privacy and security program      must be designed to ensure security and confidentiality of personal      electronic records  protect against vulnerabilities to the security      and integrity of personal electronic records  and protect against      unauthorized access and use of personally identifiable  information contained in electronic records  Section 402      requires a covered business entity to   1  regularly assess  manage      and control risks to data privacy and security consistent with the      size  complexity and scope of its business   2  publish or otherwise      make available the terms of its program to the extent that such      terms do not reveal information that comprise data security or      privacy   3  provide employee training to implement its data privacy      and security program   4  conduct tests to identify system      vulnerabilities   5  ensure that if service providers not also      subject to these laws are retained  those service providers are      capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards for personally      identifiable information and are subject to contract requirements      consistent with this Act  and  6  periodically assess its data      privacy and security program to ensure that the program addresses      current threats    Finally  business entities subject      subtitle A must implement a data privacy and security program no      later than 1 year after the date of enactment      Section 403  Enforcement  Business entities that violate the      data privacy and security program requirements in Sections 401 to      402 are subject to civil penalties of not more than  5 000 per      violation per day  with a maximum of  35 000 per day  while such      violations persist  In addition  business entities that      intentionally or willfully violate Sections 401 to 402 are subject      to additional penalties of  5 000 per violation per day  with a
