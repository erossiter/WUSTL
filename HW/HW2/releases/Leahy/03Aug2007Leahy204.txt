       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Changes To The Foreign Intellignce   Surveillance Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Changes To The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act    U S  Senate    August 3  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  the Rockefeller Levin bill might not be     precisely the bill I would have written to fix the problem  but it is a     responsible and targeted fix to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance     Act  FISA  problem that has been identified  It is an appropriate     response to the need expressed by Director of National Intelligence     McConnell regarding our foreign intelligence collection overseas  In     addition  it tries to preserve some balance and some protections for the     civil liberties of Americans by keeping the FISA Court involved when     there are significant communications to and from the United States   I have been briefed by the DNI and his staff and met with him several     times recently about a problem that our intelligence agencies are having     in collecting information from overseas  I have said that I am willing     to fix this problem  and I am  I have proposed ways to fix this     identified problem  It might not be everything he would like  his wish     list  but it solves his problem  The Congress has shown that it is     willing and able to reform FISA when changes are needed  We have done so     many times since FISA was first passed in 1978 and at least half a dozen     times since September 11  2001  I believe such a targeted  responsible     fix is justified   To achieve that fix  I would vote for Rockefeller Levin  We could     enact the needed change immediately  As I have indicated  it is not     everything that I would have wanted or drafted precisely as I would have     written it  But it does the job and achieves a better balance than any     viable alternative  I have worked with Senator ROCKEFELLER for     weeks on this matter and appreciate his leadership on this matter  as     well as that of Senator LEVIN   The problem our intelligence agencies are having is with targeting     communications overseas  We want them to be able to intercept calls     between two people overseas with a minimum of difficulty  Obviously  the     situation is complicated when people overseas might be talking to people     here in the United States  These calls could be innocent conversations     of businesspeople  tourists  our troops overseas to their families  or     to other friends or family in the United States  We should want to give     the Government great flexibility to listen to foreign to foreign calls      while still protecting privacy of innocent Americans by making sure the     Government gets warrants when they are involved   The Rockefeller Levin bill accomplishes both of these things  It     provides a very flexible standard up front for the Government  it is     only required to go to the court for approval of procedures for how it     will know that the targets are  in fact  overseas  There is no     case by case application and approval of warrants for these overseas     targets  There is even an initial emergency provision that would allow     the Government to start these interceptions before the court has done     anything   To protect Americans  the House bill requires the Government to have     guidelines  and show them to the Congress  for how it will determine     when a target is having regular communications with the United States      Then they need to go back to the regular FISA procedures and show     probable cause  Also  the Department of Justice inspector general must     do an audit of the conduct under this bill to see how much information     about people in the United States is being collected and must provide     that audit to the court and Congress  Because this process has been so     expedited and the issues involved are so significant  the bill would     sunset in 180 days  so the Congress and the administration will have an     opportunity to review it and act in a more deliberative way on these     important issues   Some things were added here that I might not have done  It now     applies to all foreign intelligence targets  not just those involving     international terrorism  It also does not require the court to review     and approve the guidelines for handling significant communications     with the United States  only the Congress sees this  These aspects     trouble me  They are significant  The Director of National Intelligence     has said that with these changes  the bill solves his problems and would     significantly enhance our national security  This bill should resolve     the matter  but this administration does not know how to take   yes       for an answer   Regrettably  what has come over from the administration and has been     introduced here by Senator BOND and Senator MCCONNELL goes     far beyond what the DNI said he needs and I fear would be very harmful     to the civil liberties of Americans  The bill the administration has     proposed is a vast rewrite of the FISA law that undercuts the purposes     of that act in significant ways  What the administration has done is     leverage a fixable problem into passage of a wish list of ways to give     the Attorney General and through him the White House virtual unfettered     authority to conduct surveillance  It would take away any meaningful     role for the FISA Court for calls between overseas and the United     States  In fact  because it is not restricted to terrorism but involves     any foreign intelligence  the administration s bill gives them far     greater authority than they had claimed in their secret  warrantless     surveillance program   This bill allows Attorney General Gonzales to order surveillance      This Attorney General is in charge of decisions about when to conduct     surveillance and can instruct the court to enforce those decisions  In     effect  the only role for the court under this bill is as an enforcement     agent  it is to rubberstamp the Attorney General s decisions and use its     authority to order telephone companies to comply  The court would be     stripped of its authority to serve as a check and to protect the privacy     of people within the United States  Their bill likewise requires no     review or audit by the Justice Department or anyone else about the     number of U S  communications that are being gathered by these orders      I believe it is important to solve the problem our intelligence     agencies are having right now  It is also essential to preserve the     critical role of the FISA Court in protecting civil liberties of     Americans  The House bill will do both of these things better than its     alternatives
