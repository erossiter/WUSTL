       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S 214  Preserving United States   Attorney Independence Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            WASHINGTON       Thursday  February 8   The Senate Judiciary Committee today      approved a bipartisan bill that would prevent the Bush      Administration from circumventing the Senate s constitutional role      in confirming U S  Attorneys  In a bipartisan vote of 13 6  the      Committee approved a measure that would restore the previous system      of checks and balances that had been in place until the Bush      Administration quietly slipped in a change to the law in the last      Republican controlled Congress  The bill  which now moves to the      full Senate for its consideration  would limit the time interim U S       Attorneys could be appointed without Senate confirmation    Below is Chairman Leahys statement      from todays executive business meeting           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On S  214  Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act Of      2007     February 8  2007  We have learned over the last few      months of an apparent abuse of power by this Administration that      threatens to undermine the effectiveness and professionalism of U S       Attorneys offices around the country  I support Senator Feinsteins      efforts to combat these abuses  I thank Senator Schumer for      chairing our hearing into this matter this week  and Senator Specter      for his active involvement  I urge the Committee to approve the      Specter  Feinstein  Leahy substitute to S  214  the Preserving      United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007  which would roll      back changes to the law that invited the abuses   During the Patriot Act Reauthorization      last year  curbs on the authority of the Attorney General to appoint      interim United States Attorneys to fill a vacancy temporarily were      removed  The change to the law removed the 120 day limit for such      appointments and removed the district courts role in making any      subsequent interim appoints  This change in law  accomplished over      my objection  allowed the Attorney General for the first time to      make so called interim appointments that could last indefinitely    Regrettably  we do not have to imagine      the effects of this unfettered authority  We learned recently that      the Department of Justice has asked several outstanding U S       Attorneys from around the country to resign their positions  Some      are engaged in difficult and complex public corruption cases  We      also understand the Attorney General has or is planning to appoint      interim replacements  raising a potential of avoiding the Senate      confirmation process altogether  This is a clear end run around our      system of checks and balances   Many Senators have raised concern      about this practice and several have asked the Attorney General      about the reasons for the interim appointments  The situation in      Arkansas highlights the troubling nature of this new authority and      its abuse  The Attorney General removed respected U S  Attorney Bud      Cummins and replaced him with the interim appointment of Tim      Griffin  a former political operative      for Karl Rove  This appointment was not made pursuant to an      agreement with the two home state Senators    In our hearing this week   Paul McNulty  the second in command at the      Department of Justice  testified that Mr  Cummins dismissal was not      related to how well he did his job  In fact  Mr  McNulty said he      had no performance problems  but was removed merely to give an      opportunity to Mr  Griffin  a person whom he admitted was not the      best person possible for the job and who is reported to      have been involved in an effort during the 2004 election to      challenge voting by primarily African American voters serving in the      Armed Forces overseas  This was not a vacancy      created by necessity or emergency  This was a vacancy created by      choice to advance a political crony    Since this Administration has been      creating these vacancies by removing U S  Attorneys as it chooses      for whatever reason  or no good reason  on a timeline it dictates       how can it now claim not to have had time to fill spots with Senate      confirmed nominees  Why were agreed upon replacements not lined up      before creating these vacancies  Why were home state Senators not      consulted in advance  I would note that every one of the U S       Attorneys who was asked to resign was someone chosen by this      Administration  while the Attorney General served as White House      Counsel  nominated by this President  approved by the home state      Senators and confirmed by the Senate  This is a problem of the      Administrations imagination and choosing  like so many others        With respect to the law that has      governed for the last decades  the authority given to the Attorney      General to make a time limited interim appointment has not proven to      be a problem  For example  last Congress  the time from nomination      to confirmation of U S  Attorney nominations took an average of 71      days  with only three taking longer than 120 days and two of those      only a few days longer   The Department opposes the district      courts role in the law that existed prior to the changes enacted in      a Patriot Act Reauthorization conference  This was a conference in      which Democratic members were excluded  The Department claims the      District Courts role in filling vacancies beyond 120 days to be      inconsistent with sound separation of powers principles  That is      contrary to the Constitution  our history and our practices  In      fact  the practice of judicial officers appointing officers of the      court is well established in our history and from the earliest      days  Morrison v  Olson      should have laid to rest the so called separation of powers concern      now being trumpeted to justify these political maneuvers within the      Justice Department  It is not just a red hearing but a bright red      herring  Certainly no Republicans now defending this Administration      voiced concern when a panel of judges appointed Ken Starr to spend      millions in taxpayer dollars on going after President Clinton as a      court appointed prosecutor    I have heard not a word from the      apologists who seek to use the Constitution as a shield for these      activities about what the Constitution says  The Constitution      provides congressional power to direct the appointment power  In      Article II  the part of the Constitution that this Administration      reads as if it says that all power resides with the President  the      Presidents appointment power is limited by the power of Congress       Indeed  between its provisions calling for appointments with the      advice and consent of the Senate and for the Presidents limited      power to make recess appointments  the Constitution provides  But      the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior      officers  as they think proper  in the President alone  in the      courts of law  or in the Heads of Departments  Thus  the      Constitution contemplates exactly what our statutes and practices      have always provided  Congress is well within its authority when it      vests in the courts a share of the appointment power for those who      appear before them    Regrettably  this latest abuse of      power follows this Administrations politicization of U S  Attorneys      offices  A recent study of federal investigations of elected      officials and candidates shows that the Bush Justice Department has      pursued Democrats far more than Republicans  The study by Dr       Donald C  Shields  Professor Emeritus from the Department of      Communication  University of Missouri St  Louis  and Dr  John F       Cragan  Professor Emeritus from the Department of Communication       Illinois State University  found that between 2001 and 2006  79      percent of the elected officials and candidates who have faced a      federal investigation were Democrats and only 18 percent      Republicans  The Administrations track record is not good and it      again appears caught with its hand in the cookie jar   Before 1986  28 U S C  546  the law      governing the appointment of United States Attorneys  authorized the      district court where a vacancy exists to appoint a person to serve      until the President appointed a person to fill that vacancy with the      advice and consent of the Senate  When Congress changed the law in      1986 to allow the Attorney General to appoint an interim U S       Attorney  it carefully circumscribed that authority by limiting it      to 120 days  after which the district court would make any further      interim appointment needed  The substitute to S  214 that we      consider today would reinstate these vital limits on the Attorney      Generals authority and bring back incentives for the Administration      to fill vacancies with Senate confirmable nominees   United States Attorneys around the      country are the chief federal law enforcement officers in their      states  and they have an enormous responsibility for implementing      anti terrorism efforts  bringing important and often difficult      cases  and taking the lead to fight public corruption  It is vital      that those holding these critical positions be free from any      inappropriate influence and subject to the check and balance of the      confirmation process  I support Senator Feinsteins effort to      restore that process  I join with her and Senator Specter in their      substitute amendment
