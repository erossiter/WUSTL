       Judiciary Panel Holds Second Hearing On Habeas Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Judiciary Panel Holds Second       Hearing On Habeas Bill   WASHINGTON  Wednesday        Nov  16     The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday held a       second hearing on Habeas Reform  The Streamlined Procedures       Act or  S 1088   The bill has raised significant concerns       among several lawmakers and some in the legal community for the       unprecedented restrictions it would impose on habeas rights         Ranking       Democratic Member Patrick Leahy   D Vt    and the American Bar       Association are among those who have expressed concern about the       legislation  The bill would likely confuse settled law and       increase litigation time  said Leahy  He has also taken issue       with the bills elimination of essential protections against       wrongful convictions without making adequate provision for       claims of innocence    A former       prosecutor  Leahy has been a longtime proponent of death penalty       reform in Congress  Last year  he led efforts to secure passage       of the Innocence Protection Act  a measure aimed at reducing the       errors in capital cases     Below is       Senator Leahys statement from todays hearing      Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On Habeas Legislation  S 1088       November 16  2005  I thank the Chairman for agreeing       to hold this hearing on S 1088  the so called Streamlined       Procedures Act  or SPA  This is our second hearing on the       bill  Since our first hearing  back on July 13  the bill has       been strongly opposed by a wide range of experts and       practitioners  and it has twice been rewritten   I am thankful that we are at least       holding hearings on this bill  Yesterday the Senate voted to       strip federal courts of the authority to consider habeas       petitions from detainees being held in  U S  custody as enemy combatants        At no time before in our Nations history have habeas rights       been permanently cut off from a group of prisoners  yet we did       it without even holding a committee hearing on an issue so       fundamental to the basic precepts and basic rights under our       system of government that it predates our Constitution   We have a distinguished panel of       witnesses today  and I welcome them all and thank them for       coming  I am especially pleased that we are joined once again       by former Solicitor General Seth Waxman  When the Committee       adopted the current version of the bill in October  it was       claimed that this version addressed  or at least substantially       addressed  all the concerns that Mr  Waxman and others had       raised about earlier versions  In fact  it does not come close       to doing so  I am glad he could be here to set the record       straight   The current version of the bill       suffers from nearly all of the same infirmities as its       predecessors  Like its predecessors  this bill seeks to impose       radical and unprecedented restrictions on the Great Writ of       habeas corpus  It would inject confusion into settled law        which can only increase litigation time  not decrease it  And       it would eliminate essential protections against wrongful       convictions without making adequate provision for claims of       innocence   One thing is clear about this       bill  If it passed  it would preclude federal courts from       enforcing federal constitutional rights   The legal community recognizes       this  The American Bar Association calls the bill before us a       significant setback for justice  Both the U S  Judicial       Conference and the Conference of Chief Justices have expressed       grave concerns with the bill and urged further study and       analysis before we start tearing apart the complex edifice that       is federal habeas law  The state chief justices cautioned us       against passing a bill with unknown consequences for the state       courts and for the administration of justice  The Judicial       Conference reported that the vast majority of habeas cases are       already moving expeditiously through the system  We will hear       more from the Judicial Conference this morning   I know the bill has its       defenders  But not one defender of the bill has offered  systemic evidence of       a real national       problem with federal  habeas corpus under the current  post AEDPA regime  This       bill remains a solution to an unproven and largely non existent       problem  and no amount of tinkering will solve that   If we are serious about reforming       the system to improve the quality  efficiency and finality of       criminal justice  there is a different solution we should focus       on  Unlike the SPA  it is a solution that would solve problems       in the criminal justice system before they arise  rather than       complicating the process of responding to problems via habeas        Unlike the SPA  it is a solution supported by the legal       community and the public at large  And unlike the SPA  it is a       solution to which the President and both House of Congress have       previously committed on a bipartisan basis  It is a promise we       made to the American people  and we have a duty not to renege on       it   I speak  of course  of the       Innocence Protection Act  We passed that Act one year ago  in       response to the shameful  widespread evidence of hopelessly       underfunded  too often incompetent  and even drunk and sleeping       defense counsel in state capital trials  We did so because we       saw only too well the costs of that systemic failure  Innocent       men on death row  and repeated  fundamental violations of       constitutional rights   The Innocence Protection Act       established a new grant program to improve the quality of legal       representation provided to indigent defendants in state capital       cases  This program would  greatly reduce the risk of error in       these cases  It would also reduce the frequency of the most       expensive and drawn out post conviction proceedings  the       potentially meritorious ones  It would  that is  if we funded       this program at or near the modest levels we authorized  If we       are truly committed to improving the criminal justice system  we       should not let Congresss check bounce   We all agree that the trial should       be the main event and abuses of habeas corpus should not be       tolerated  But let us remember that the trial process itself is       flawed and that it will remain flawed if we continue to skimp on       essential funding  Let us remember that wrongful convictions do       occur  and many innocent people have been sentenced to death        Let us remember what Justice OConnor has told us  The death       penalty system is so flawed in  America today that we have       probably already executed an innocent person  And let us not       pass ill conceived  unnecessary legislation that would only make       an unacceptable situation far worse
