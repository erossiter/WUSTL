       Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Oil And Gas Industry Antitrust   Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Opening Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy Ranking      Member  Judiciary Committee     On Oil And Gas      Industry Antitrust Act Of 2006 Executive      Business Meeting      April 27  2006 I am pleased the      Committee is moving today to act on the Oil and Gas Industry      Antitrust Act of 2006  S 2557  This is timely and important      legislation which follows our hearing on March 14  I commend the      Chairman Specter  and thank all who support our bill   The centerpiece      of this bill is a provision that should be familiar to all Members      of the Committee  It is our NOPEC legislation which has been      previously reported by this Committee three times  and was passed by      the Senate  Unfortunately  during the years that we have been      seeking action to make the OPEC oil cartels anti competitive      behavior accountable  the House has refused to act   These provisions      will allow the Justice Department to crack down on illegal price      manipulation by oil cartels  I do not think anyone doubts that the      price of a gallon of gas on Main Street in any of the communities we      represent is affected by such conduct  Our bill will allow the      Federal Government to take legal action against any foreign state       including members of OPEC  for price fixing and other      anti competitive activities  This is a tangible  meaningful step      that we can take  today  that can help deter OPEC from withholding      oil supplies  That would mean lower prices at the pump across      America        When President Bush took office  Americans could fill their cars       heat their homes  and run their businesses on gasoline that cost       1 45 per gallon  In less than six years  fuel prices have      skyrocketed 100 percent  they have doubled  The end is nowhere in      sight  unless we do something to help keep costs down  Over the      years I have warned about a gallon of gasoline costing  2 50 or  3       I fear  4 a gallon gasoline will be upon us all by summer  I hope      we can enact this bill without further delay   Earlier this      week  Senator Kohl and I sent the President a letter  urging him to      join with us to enact the NOPEC bill and      curtail anti competitive behavior by the oil cartels  It is      time to join in a bipartisan coalition to say NO to OPEC       President Bush promised back in the 2000 election to jawbone      OPEC  but we need more than friendly talk  we need action   I ask that a copy of our      letter be made a part of the record   In addition to      passing this bill out of this Committee today  I hope that we will      see it joined on the Senate floor and enacted along with Senator      Cantwells bill against price gouging and Senator Dorgans bill      regarding a windfall profits tax  Senator Menendez also made an      effort this week to provide a federal gas tax holiday for Americans      and to cut back the obscene royalty relief and tax breaks that these      super profitable oil and gas companies continue to receive from      federal taxpayers  I support all of these initiatives to provide      relief to Americas families  farmers and small businesses   The overall      increase in fuel costs for an average Vermont farmer last year was      43 percent  meaning that each farmer is estimated to pay an      additional  700 in fuel surcharges in 2006 alone  That may seem      like pennies compared to the profit sums we will be discussing      today  but to me  and to all Vermonters  we know what the terrible      consequences can be        Vermonts dairy farmers  who get up every morning  well before the      sun rises    whether it is minus 15 degrees or pouring rain or      pelting snow    cannot continue to farm without fuel  It is not      just farmers in my home state of Vermont  Farmers in Wisconsin       Pennsylvania  Idaho  California  and other key states that provide      our domestic milk supply are affected  That is how we get the cream      for our morning coffee each day  So as we sip our coffee this      morning  I hope we will each think about what our actions mean for      farmers and hospitals and small businesses across the nation        At  36 7 billion in profit last year  Exxon Mobil turned the highest      yearly profit in U S  history for any business  Since 1999  oil      refiners have seen a 334 percent increase in profit on each gallon      of gasoline refined because of prices they set  the lack of      transparency  and the lack of effective regulation  Industry giants      like Exxon Mobil are awarding  400 million retirement packages to      individual executives  while hard working Americans are struggling      to buy gas to drive their children to school  Just yesterday      ConocoPhillips  the nation s third largest oil and gas producer       announced their net income jumped to  3 29 billion in the first      quarter  The American      people deserve better  When the oil and gas industry is breaking      profit records  the American taxpayers should not be asked to      subsidize them  Hardworking American families  farmers and small      businesses are paying them at both ends  as taxpayers and as      consumers   We now read in      the papers that the oil companies are committing tens of millions of      dollars to a lobbying campaign against legislative action like      this  Those of us who believe America needs a more aggressive      national energy policy that would deliver affordable  clean energy      now  not whenever the oil company CEOs decide the time is right       have our work cut out for us
