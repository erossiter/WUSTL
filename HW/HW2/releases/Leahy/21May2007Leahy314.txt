       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Comprehensive Immigration Reform On The   Motion To Proceed                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Comprehensive Immigration Reform    On The Motion To Proceed    Senate Floor    May 21  2007    As the Senate prepares to vote on the     Majority Leaders motion to proceed to a comprehensive immigration     reform bill  I continue to have concerns about the proposal announced     last week   I commend Senator Kennedy for working so     hard over the last several months to revive a bipartisan bill  He     worked closely behind the scenes with Senator McCain for several     months  When those efforts did not lead to success  he did not give     up  On the contrary  he spoke to a number of Republican Senators who     had actively worked with us last year  When they would not join him in     a bipartisan effort  he joined the process that Secretary Chertoff had     begun with opponents of last years bill  In extended discussions he     and others have now come forward with a proposal  I commend his     commitment and his efforts  as well as those who have participated in     the difficult discussions    I would also like thank the Majority     Leader  He had intended to set aside two full weeks this month for     Senate consideration of comprehensive immigration reform  When the     informal discussions were not completed on time  he gave those     discussions more time  He was right that this issue warrants a     significant commitment of the Senates time and I am glad to work with     him to make sure that consideration is fair and comprehensive   I will support the motion to proceed and     the Majority Leaders cloture petition to go to the bill in order to     allow the Senate the opportunity to work its will on this matter  Many     of us have said that the bipartisan proposal    the Kennedy Kyl Chertoff     proposal    represents a starting point for consideration     As the authors of the proposal know  this     Senator feels very strongly about the provisions that affect dairy     workers and the circumstances of that important industry  I also take a     particular interest in the provisions that affect seasonal workers for     the many Vermont businesses that require them  and in the needs of our     leading high technology companies  I had thought the proposal announced     last week included    as I had been assured it did    the dairy     provisions essential to the AGJOBS bill  I hope that assurance is     ultimately fulfilled    Beyond these provisions  I have a number     of fundamental concerns that I hope the Senate will address in the days      and perhaps weeks  ahead  In his radio address of May 12  President     Bush restated that comprehensive reform must treat people with     dignity  He said we must honor the great American tradition of the     melting pot  and that we must help immigrants embrace our common     identity as Americans  I agree  I believe that part of that common     heritage is our welcoming of immigrants and their families  America is     a land in which families matter  in which our values call for us to     provide not just for ourselves at the cost of severing family ties  but     for our families    As the Statue of Liberty proclaims      America is a country that welcomes the poor and those yearning to     breathe free  not just the well educated and those who already speak     English  We never know who among those immigrating to our shores will     turn out to be the next great military leader  the next great     entrepreneur  the next great inventor  the next to lift this Nation to     greater heights    I want the bill we pass to recognize the     best of America and our values and the best of our traditions as a land     of immigrants  I also want it to be practical and workable  The     so called triggers in the White House proposal do two things  First      they appear to put off implementation of most of immigration reform to     the next Presidency and the next Congress  Second  they require     absolute faith in the Department of Homeland Security and the Bush     Administration  Given the record of this Administration  I see little     basis for such faith    When this Administrations representatives     say to us that in the next 18 months they will secure the borders and     devise and implement identification verification measures without fail      I remember the last 24 months in which they have failed the victims of     Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf States  I see an Administration that has     ignored immigration enforcement for years  I see an Administration that     does not deal realistically with the northern border  I see an     Administration that has all but destroyed the Justice Department and     severely undermined its traditions as a neutral law enforcement agency     above politics  I see an Administration that denied global warming      disregarded science and most egregiously  has disregarded the realities     of its current disastrous engagement in Iraq    I have urged the President to invest     himself in the process and work with Congress  I did so on the first     day of this Congress and at the one Senate hearing held on this matter     in February  The path chosen by the Administration was not the one I     recommended  however  Instead  the Administration remained on the far     right of the immigration debate and has pushed the bill and the debate     in that direction    We have before     us a measure that was the product of closed door meetings between the     Administration and Republican Senators  which was then put to Democratic     Senators as the framework from which any further negotiations could     proceed  Senator Kennedy has done his best and has made improvements in     the proposal  He deserves our thanks  Whether the proposal is where it     should be is what this debate will begin to determine    The substitute bill the Administration     endorses creates a temporary worker program with no opportunity to     pursue the American dream  This bill risks the creation of a permanent      revolving underclass of workers with limited rights to participation in     our society and with no opportunity to advance through hard work and     diligence  A temporary worker program with no opportunity to share in     the promise of America creates an incentive for overstays and risks     creating a new population of undocumented individuals just as we work so     hard to bring millions of people out of the shadows of society     I also worry     that the temporary worker program included in the bill does not     effectively serve the needs of American employers  I worry that it is     unrealistic  This part of the proposal is opposed by a wide array of     interests and constituencies  including organized labor  business  and     advocates for immigrants  I hope we listen carefully to their concerns     as we proceed    The substitute bill also erodes our     traditional commitment to family unity by removing whole segments of     family based immigration  No longer will certain family members be     allowed to be sponsored by their loved ones in the United States      Instead  proponents seek to create a supposedly merit based green card     system subject to a point system  where family ties are de emphasized      and immediate contributions through education and job skills already     attained are valued  I recognize that we may benefit in the short run     from a more highly skilled foreign labor pool  but I have grave concerns     about doing so at the expense of our traditional commitment to family     unity and fostering strong families  Where are the family values here        The substitute bill also will require all     Americans  not just foreign workers  to verify their citizenship     before obtaining a job  Like the REAL ID Act that was forced on the     American people outside the normal legislative process  this requirement     is yet another example of the Administrations consistent denigration of     Americans rights  including the right to privacy  The Administration     is telling all Americans that we can no longer trust youthat Big     Brother will control hiring for all jobs in American  From Americas     country stores to our largest corporations  employers will now be de     facto immigration officials  and potential employees will be presumed     illegal until they prove themselves citizens  I hope we can reconsider     this ill conceived program  which cuts so hard against the presumptive     decency and honesty of American citizens  Americas democracy works     because law abiding Americans chose to comply with our laws  pay their     taxes  and participate in our civil society    I am pleased that significant parts of     AGJOBS have been included in this bill  The legalization provisions for     currently undocumented farm workers will go a long way toward helping     farmers and removing the cloud of fear from so many workers  I commend     Senator Feinstein and Senator Craig for their work in this regard  But     the bill also rejects parts of the monumental compromise reached between     farm workers and agricultural employers in the AGJOBS bill  which     provides much needed reforms for Americas farmers  dairy operators  and     farm workers  I am extremely disappointed that American dairy farmers     who want to hire future legal foreign workers end up losing out to the     talking point that temporary means temporary  The diverse coalition     that put the AGJOBS bill together recognized that certain sectors of     agriculture require special circumstances  It is too bad that the     AGJOBS legislation we worked so hard to produce will not be fully     respected  I will fight throughout this process to support our     countrys dairy farmers who work hard to sustain all of us  I trust     that the dairy provisions that had been agreed to will be restored    The bill also neglects the real needs of     the high tech community  which has been vigilant in seeking a reliable     source of high skilled workers  Instead of adding sufficient H 1B visa     numbers to allow companies to stay competitive in the global     marketplace  and remain the worlds leaders in innovation and     problem solving  the bill creates a green card system that does not     truly address the technology industrys needs  removes hiring decisions     from the company  and places them with the Federal Government  Does     that make any sense  It is unfortunate that the proponents of the     compromise have been unwilling to listen carefully to our high tech     leaders but have insisted on the purity of an ideological framework    There are some good aspects to the bill      It incorporates the Dream Act  a bill I have long supported  It has     provisions that can move millions of undocumented people in this country     on a path to citizenship  if not unrealistically delayed by the     so called triggers  Regrettably  it currently includes a provision to     require immigrants to return to their home country before applying      That is  in my view  unrealistic in many circumstances and inflexibly     harsh in others  Those who struggled to get here  who escaped     oppressive and dysfunctional governments  should not be required to     repeat that journey to share in the promise of America  It is driven by     ideology  not fairness  and should be revisited in this legislative     process    I am also encouraged that we may be past     the anti immigrant opposition that stalled our efforts last year  I     hope that we are past trying to make criminals out of undocumented     immigrants  I hope that we are past trying to make criminals out of the     clergy and advocates that try to help hard working immigrants seeking a     better life for their children  I hope we are past trying to build     fences and walls around America and the American dream  I hope that we     are past the anti immigrant rhetoric and the anti Hispanic slurs that     accompanied the debate and electioneering last year    We need to keep working to make our     legislation one that takes a commonsense  realistic approach to this     situation  I will continue working to produce legislation that treats     people with dignity  and respects our great tradition as a welcoming     nation  We have much work to do before this bill becomes worthy of the     Senate  and of our great history and tradition as a nation of     immigrants   I will vote to support the Majority     Leaders effort to proceed to debate on comprehensive immigration     reform  I hope that as we move through amendments and debate  the     Senate will work toward making this a better bill  We all know that had     we insisted on taking up the Senate passed bill of last year  we would     not have the votes to proceed  Many who voted for last years Senates     bill were prepared to abandon their support  The Majority Leader has     demonstrated his good faith  I hope that Senators will join together     and work together to produce a bill of which we can be proud and that     will honor our parents and grandparents as well as our neighbors and     grandchildren
