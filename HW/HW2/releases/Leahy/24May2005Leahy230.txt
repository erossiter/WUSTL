       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Priscilla Owen   And Whether To Invoke Cloture                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     On The Nomination Of Priscilla Owen And Whether To Invoke Cloture          Delivered On The Senate Floor      May 24  2005   This President  with the compliance of      the Republican majority  has tried to push the Senate across an      unprecedented threshold that would forever change and weaken this      body  This move would have stripped the minority of the crucial      rights that have been a hallmark of this chamber  and it would have      fundamentally altered the brilliant system of checks and balances      designed by the Founders   This misguided bid for one party rule       the nuclear option  has been deterred for now  This ill advised      power grab was thwarted through the work and commitment of a      bipartisan group of 14 Senators who have prevented the Republican      majority leader from pulling this potentially devastating trigger       Pursuant to that agreement  I expect a few Democrats who had      previously voted against cloture on the Priscilla Owen nomination in the last Congress to vote in favor      of cloture today  I understand that they are taking this action to      save the Senate from the nuclear option and to preserve the      filibuster    This Republican tactic put the      protection of the rights of the minority in this chamber in serious      risk  That protection is fundamental to the Senate and to the      Senates ability to act as a check and balance in our national      government  That protection is essential if we are to protect the      independence of the Judiciary and the Judiciary is to remain a      protector of the rights of all Americans against the overreaching of      the political branches    I will continue to work in good faith       as I have always done  to fulfill the Senates      constitutionally mandated role as a partner with the Executive      branch in determining who will serve in the Judiciary  I urge all      Senators to take these matters to heart and to redouble our efforts      to invest our advice and consent responsibility with the seriousness      and scrutiny it deserves  Just as Democratic Senators alone could      not avert the nuclear option  Democratic Senators alone cannot      ensure that the Senate fulfilled its constitutional role as a check      on the Executive  Republican Senators will need to evaluate  with      clear eyes  each of the Presidents nominees for fitness  If they      have doubts about the suitability of a nominee to a lifetime      judicial appointment  they can no longer look the other way and wait      for Democratic Senators to save them from a difficult vote  There      are a number of difficult votes on the horizon on a number of      problematic nominees    This process starts with the      President  I have served with six Presidents  Five of them have      consulted with the Senate and worked with the Senate  If this      President would work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to      identify and nominate consensus choices  we will easily add to the      tally of 208 confirmations  If he will consult with us on important      vacancies we can make significant progress  and I hope we can      achieve that    The design of checks and balances      envisioned by the Founders that has served us so well for over 200      years has been preserved  Judicial nominations are for lifetime      appointments to what has always been revered as an independent third      branch of government   one that  while reliant on a balance between      the Executive and Legislative branches  was controlled by neither       For more than two centuries years  these checks and balances have      been the source of our governments stability and its hedge against      tyranny  We must preserve those checks and balances in the      interests of the American people so that the courts will be      independent and fair  The courts are the backstop to protect the      rights of all Americans against encroachment by the government   The Senate remains available as a      rudder that checks against abuse of power  and as a keel that      defends the independence of the judiciary  As Senator Byrd noted      last night  the Senate has answered the call sounded by Benjamin      Franklin at the conclusion of the constitutional convention by      preserving our democracy and our republic    Priscilla Owen  Let me say a few words about the      controversial nomination of Priscilla Owen  I expect that I will      have an opportunity to speak to this nomination more fully after the      cloture vote  Three years ago after reviewing her record  hearing      her testimony and evaluating her answers I voted against her      confirmation and explained at length the strong case against      confirmation of this nomination  Nothing about her record or the      reasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed      since then    Justice Owen has shown herself over      the last decade on the Texas Supreme Court to be an ends oriented      judicial activist  intent on reading her own policy views into the      law  She has been the target of criticism by her conservative      Republican colleagues on the court  in a variety of types of cases      where the law did not fit her personal views  including in cases      where she has consistently ruled for big business and corporate      interests in cases against worker and consumers   The conservative Republican majority      of the Texas Supreme Court has gone out of its way to criticize      Justice Owen and the dissents she joined in ways that are highly      unusual  and in ways which highlight her ends oriented activism  A      number of Texas Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from      the language of statute she strays in her attempts to push the law      beyond what the legislature intended   In FM Properties v  City of Austin       the majority called her dissent  nothing more than inflammatory      rhetoric   In Montgomery Independent School      District v  Davis  the majority  which included Alberto Gonzales      and two other appointees of Governor Bush  is quite explicit in its      view that Justice Owens position disregards the law and that  the      dissenting opinions misconception       stems from its disregard of      the procedural elements the Legislature established  and that the      dissenting opinion not only disregards the procedural limitations      in the statute but takes a position even more extreme than that      argued for by the board         In the case of In re Jane Doe       the majority includes an extremely unusual section explaining its      view of the proper role of judges  admonishing the dissenters       including Justice Owen  for going beyond their duty to interpret the      law in an attempt to fashion policy  In a separate concurrence       Justice Alberto Gonzales says that to construe the law as the      dissent did would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism       I understand that he now says that when he wrote that opinion he      was not referring to her  I recognize why he is saying that now       After all  he is the Attorney General charged with defending her      nomination  Still  a fair reading of his concurring opinion leads      me to see it as criticism of the dissenters  Justice Owen included       He admitted as much in published statements in The New York Times      before Justice Owens first hearing before the Judiciary Committee        In the case of In re Jane Doe 3       Justice Enoch writes specifically to rebuke Justice Owen and her      fellow dissenters for misconstruing the legislatures definition of      the sort of abuse that may occur when parents are notified of a      minors intent to have an abortion  saying  abuse is abuse  it is      neither to be trifled with nor its severity to be second guessed        In Weiner v  Wasson  Priscilla      Owen went out of her way to ignore Texas Supreme Court precedent to      vote against a young man injured by a doctors negligence when he      was only 15 years old  Her conservative Republican colleagues on      the Court  led by then Justice John Cornyn  lectured her about the      importance of following that 12 year old case and ruling in the      boys favor  calling the legal standard she proposed unworkable             In Collins v  Ison Newsome  yet another case where Justice      Owen joined a dissent criticized by the majority  the court was      offended by the dissenters arguments  The majority says the      dissenters agree the courts jurisdiction is limited  but then      argues for the exact opposite proposition        This argument      defies the Legislatures clear and express limits on our      jurisdiction    These examples show a judge out of      step with the conservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme      Court  a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her activist      views    A Judicial Activist      Showing Bias Against Consumers  Victims  Ordinary People  Justice Owen has made other bad      decisions where she skews her decisions to show bias against      consumers  victims and just plain ordinary people in favor of big      business and corporations  In fact  according to a study conducted      last year by the Texas Watch Foundation  a non profit consumer      protection organization in Texas  in the last six years  Justice      Owen has not dissented once from a majority decision favoring      business interests over victims  but has managed to differ from the      majority and dissent in 22 of the 68 cases where the majority      opinion was for the consumer   As one reads case after case  her      legal views in so many cases involving statutory interpretation      simply cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning of the statute       the legislative intent  or the majoritys interpretation  This all      leads to the conclusion that she sets out to justify some      preconceived idea of what the law ought to mean  This is not an      appropriate way for a judge to make decisions  This is a judge      whose record reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager to      make law from the bench    Justice Owens activism and extremism      is noteworthy in a variety of cases  including those dealing with      business interests  malpractice  access to public information       employment discrimination and Texas Supreme Court jurisdiction  in      which she writes against individual plaintiffs time and time again       in seeming contradiction of the law as written  A few examples of      this include   FM Properties v  City of Austin       where Justice Owen showed her willingness to rule in favor of large      private landowners against the clear public interest in maintaining      a fair regulatory process and clean water  Her dissent  which the      majority characterized as   Anothing      more than inflammatory rhetoric        was an attempt to favor big landowners  At her first hearing  and      since  Justice Owen and her supporters on the Committee have tried      to recast this case as something more innocent  but at the time she      wrote her dissent  Justice Owen was certainly clear about the      meaning of this case    property rights for corporations   GTE Southwest  Inc  v  Bruce       is another example where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a      lawsuit by employees for intentional infliction of emotional      distress  Despite the majoritys recitation of an exhaustive list      of sickening behavior by the supervisor  and its clear application      of Texas law to those facts  Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion      to explain that the conduct was not  as the standard requires       Aso      outrageous in character  and so extreme in degree  as to go beyond      all possible bounds of decencyY       Id  at 621  The majority opinion shows Justice Owen s concurrence      advocating a point of view that ignores the facts in evidence in      order to reach a predetermined outcome in the corporation s favor   In City of Garland v  Dallas      Morning News  22 S W  3d 351  Tex  2000   Justice Owen dissented      from a majority opinion and  again  it is difficult to justify her      views other than as based on a desire to reach a particular      outcome  In this case  she seeks to shield government      decision making from public view    Quantum Chemical v  Toennies       47 S W  3d 473  Tex  2001   is another troubling case where Justice      Owen joined a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a      clearly written statute  this time in the context of employment      discrimination  The majority concluded that they must rely on the      plain language of the statute as amended  which could not be any      clearer that under Title VII discrimination can be shown to be      Aa       motivating factor  contrary to Justice Owens more activist view         Conclusion  When he nominated Priscilla Owen       President Bush said that his standard for judging judicial nominees      would be that they  Ashare      a commitment to follow and apply the law  not to make law from the      bench        Priscilla Owen s record  as I have described it today and over the      last three years  does not qualify her under that standard for a      lifetime appointment to the federal bench    The President has often spoken of      judicial activism without acknowledging that ends oriented decision      making can come easily to ideological conservative nominees  In the      case of Priscilla Owen  we see a perfect example of such an approach      to the law  and I cannot support it  The oath taken by federal      judges affirms their commitment to   Aadminister      justice without respect to persons  and do equal right to the poor      and to the rich        No one who enters a federal courtroom should have to wonder whether      he or she will be fairly heard by the judge  Justice Priscilla      Owen s record shows me that she has not fulfilled that commitment on      the Supreme Court of Texas  and I cannot support her confirmation      for life to a federal court
