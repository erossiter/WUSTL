       Leahy Pushes For Action On PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Pushes For Action On PATRIOT Act  With Friday Deadline Looming  Leahy      Urges Action To Mend It  Not End It  WASHINGTON  Tues   Jan  31          Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   urged Senate leaders and the White      House to stop delaying bipartisan improvements to the USA PATRIOT      Act  Key provisions of the law are set to expire at the end of this      week  though most of the law is unaffected by the sunset provisions      that were extended by Congress in December    Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee and a co author of the PATRIOT Act  in      recent weeks has been urging House and Senate leaders and the White      House to meet to work out the remaining unresolved issues on renewal      of the law  The extension of the law comes sooner than it would      have under the original 3 month extension proposed by Leahy and Sen       John Sununu  R N H      Below is Leahys statement Tuesday on      the need to fix the remaining controversial provisions of the      conference report on the USA PATRIOT Act renewal bill   Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Improving The PATRIOT Act     Senate Floor Statement     January 31  2006 Those of us working constructively and in a      bipartisan way to extend the USA PATRIOT Act with improvements have      repeatedly offered to meet to work out the remaining differences       Sadly  the Senate leadership has not made the effort to work through      the remaining concerns or brought us together   I have continued meeting and talking with      interested Republican and Democratic Senators  Senate staff has      finally gotten together this week in a bipartisan meeting  I urge      the Majority leader to bring together key interested Senators to      work out a bipartisan compromise that improves the failed conference      report   A majority of Senators  Republicans and      Democrats  those who voted against cloture on the conference report      that failed to pass the Senate and those who voted for it  urged      the Republican leader to act on a short term  3 month extension      before the end of the last session  Instead  he chose to proceed      with a 6 month extension that Republicans in the House found      objectionable  That led to the short extension that is about to      expire this week  The President had said that he would not approve      a short term extension  House Republicans had said that they would      not allow a short term extension  But just before Christmas they      demanded and enacted a shorter extension than anyone else had      proposed   As soon as it became apparent that the      conference report filed by the Republican leadership would be      unacceptable to the Senate  I joined on Thursday  December 8  in      urging a 3 month extension to work out a better bill  On the first      day the Senate was next in session  Monday  December 12  Senator      Sununu and I introduced such a bill  S 2082  We sent out a Dear      Colleague letter to others Senators on December 13 and that      bipartisan bill was cosponsored by 46 other Senators  That bill      would have extended the PATRIOT Act until March 31  2006  to allow      us all to work out the remaining differences and improve this      reauthorization legislation in ways to better protect the rights of      ordinary Americans  It proposed a commonsense solution to allow us      to take a few more weeks to get this right for all Americans   Contrary to the false claims and      misrepresentations by some  there was no effort on either side of      the aisle to do away with the PATRIOT Act  That is just not true       Along with others here in the Senate I am seeking to mend and extend      the PATRIOT Act  not to end it  There is no reason why the American      people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both effective and that      adequately protects their rights and their privacy  The only      people who were threatening an expiration of the PATRIOT Act were      the President and House Republicans  As I noted on December 21  the      Administration and the Republican congressional leadership were the      ones who were objecting to extending the Act and threatening to have      it expire  That was wrong  That made no sense  They came to their      senses in the days that followed  But now  as we approach the      expiration of the current extension this Friday  the Republican      congressional leadership has taken no further action and we risk      sections of the PATRIOT Act expiring  again   Republican and Democratic Senators joined      together last month to say we can do better to protect Americans      liberties while ensuring our national security is as strong as it      can be  In the days after 9 11 we acted as Americans  not      Democrats  not Republicans  The Presidents political adviser Karl      Rove and the rest of those who are seeking to make the PATRIOT Act a      partisan political issue should instead join with our bipartisan      coalition and work with us to provide a better balance to protect      the rights of Americans   Every single Senator    Republican and      Democratic    voted last July to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act       That bipartisan solution was cast aside by the Bush Administration      and Republican congressional leaders when they hijacked the      conference report  rewrote the bill in ways that fell short in      protecting basic civil liberties and then tried to ram it through      Congress as an all or nothing proposition I have joined with      Senators of both parties in an effort to work to improve the bill       Some of us are working hard to protect the security and liberty of      Americans  What is wrong is for the White House to manipulate this      into a partisan fight for its partisan political advantage  Instead      of playing partisan politics  the Bush Administration and Republican      congressional leadership should join in trying to improve the law   This is a vital debate  The terrorist threat      to Americas security is very real  and it is vital that we be armed      with the tools needed to protect Americans security  At the same      time  however  the threat to civil liberties is also very real in      America today  The question is not whether the Government should      have the tools it needs to protect the American people  Of course      it should  That is why I co authored the PATRIOT Act five years      ago  and that is why that Act passed with broad bipartisan support       When I voted for the PATRIOT Act  I did not think it was an ideal      piece of legislation  and I knew that it would need careful      oversight and  in due course  reform  None of us wants the PATRIOT      Act to expire  and those who threatened to let it expire rather than      fix it play a dangerous game  This is about how to reconcile two shared and      fundamental goals    ensuring the safety of the American people and protecting their liberty by means of a system of checks and      balances that keeps the Government    their Government         accountable  Those goals are not the goals of any particular party      or ideology  they are shared American goals  How to balance      security with liberty and Government accountability was the most      fundamental dilemma with which the Framers of our Constitution      wrestled  and how to adjust that balance in the post 9 11 world is a      fundamental dilemma before this Congress   Our nation is a democracy  founded on the      principles of balanced government  We need to restore checks and      balances in this country to protect us all and all that we hold      dear  Our Congress and our courts provide checks on the abuse of      executive authority and should protect our liberties  Congress      must write the law so it provides not just a check on Presidential      power but also a clear role for the courts  All Americans need to      take notice and need to demand that their liberties be maintained       We can do better and must do better for the American people
