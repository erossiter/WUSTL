       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel Alito                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr        To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United       States      Thursday  January 26  2006  I began my discussion of Judge       Alitos nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Nations       highest court with the same issue I began my questions to Judge       Alito and  before that  to Chief Justice Roberts  the issue of       checks and balances on government power  We are at a pivotal       point in our Nations history  a time of unprecedented       governmental intrusion into the lives of ordinary Americans        The President has attempted to justify secret  warrantless       wiretapping of Americans  the evasion of legal bans against       torture  and the detention of American citizens with no due       process of law  The Bush Administration is making extraordinary       claims of essentially unlimited power  There are troubling       signs that this nomination is part of that effort by this       President and Vice President to uphold presidential claims to       unchecked power and upset the careful balance of our system of       government as carefully crafted by the Framers in our national       charter  the Constitution  Because I do not believe that he       would serve as an effective check on presidential overreaching        I cannot support Judge Alitos nomination   More broadly  Judge Alitos record       and his missed opportunities during the hearing to answer       concerns about his record leave me wondering whether he       appreciates the role of the Supreme Court as a protector of       Americans fundamental rights and liberties  He has failed the       test  The Supreme Court must be a source of justice  It must       be an institution where the Bill of Rights and human dignity are       honored  It must be an institution dedicated to the mission       embodied in the words etched in Vermont marble       above its entrance  Equal Justice Under Law  And it must be       an institution which carries on the spirit that was enshrined in       our Constitution  refined following the Civil War and realized       further with the Courts landmark decisions such as Brown v        Board of Education and Baker v  Carr  Judge Alitos record and       testimony demonstrate that he does not understand the vital role       of the courts in implementing the constitutional guarantees of       equal protection and equal dignity for all Americans    Court Stripping  A stark example of Judge Alito       failing the test took place during his confirmation hearing when       I asked him a question that Senator Specter had asked       then Justice Rehnquist during his hearing to become the Chief       Justice  The question was a basic one  whether the Supreme       Court can be stripped of jurisdiction to protect fundamental       constitutional rights  Specifically  I asked Judge Alito       whether the Supreme Court could be stripped of jurisdiction to       hear First Amendment cases involving freedom of speech or       religion or the press  I told him that Senator Specter had       previously insisted on an answer from Justice Rehnquist and that       Justice Rehnquist had answered that it would not be       constitutional to strip the court of its jurisdiction and vital       function to protect fundamental rights  Yet Judge Alito       responded as if it were merely an academic question  He said       that there were scholars on both sides and refused to state his       view  This was a basic and fundamental question for someone       aspiring to be a Supreme Court justice  Justice Rehnquist got       it right  For that matter  Judge Bork got it right  Judge       Alito got it wrong    When Judge Alito failed to respond       to my question  Senator Specter revisited it but Judge Alito       still failed this straightforward test  I asked this same       question with respect to Fourth Amendment  Fifth Amendment and       Sixth Amendment rights  as well  These constitutional       amendments guarantee our privacy rights  our protection against       unreasonable searches and seizures  our right to due process        our right against self incrimination  our protection against       government takings  and our right to public trial and to       counsel  These are basic American rights that help to define us       as a free people and to control the intrusiveness of government       power  Judge Alito showed in his answers that he does not       appreciate the constitutional role of the Supreme Court as the       protector of Americans fundamental rights  In fact  in our       system of checks and balances  the Supreme Court is the ultimate       defender of Americans constitutional rights  Judge Alitos       refusal to acknowledge that in his answers to these questions is       stunning  and it is deeply troubling   I even gave Judge Alito a concrete       example  I asked whether in the early 1950s       Congress could have stripped the courts  including the Supreme       Court  of jurisdiction to hear cases involving racial       segregation in schools  This historical hypothetical raised the       question whether the Supreme Court could have been prevented       from deciding Brown v  Board       of Education  enforcing the Equal Protection Clause       of the Constitution and calling an end to unconstitutional       racial segregation  His answer was no better  He was frankly       stumped    No Senator who truly cares about       civil rights  equal rights  freedom of religion and speech and       the press can have any confidence that Judge Alito understands       the critical role of the Supreme Court in protecting those       rights     Reapportionment  Judge Alito missed opportunities       during the hearings on a number of issues  I am left with a       deep and abiding concern about Judge Alitos understanding of       the role of the courts and their responsibility to protect the       constitutional rights of individuals  especially the less       powerful and especially where the political system has failed to       do so    Despite Judge Alitos attempts to       retreat from several of the more outrageous statements in his       1985 job application for a political position in       Edwin Meeses Justice Department  his testimony at the hearing       has done little to dispel my concerns  The consequences for all       Americans of Judge Alito putting the beliefs he expressed in       that job application into practice on the Supreme Court are too       great    In his job application  Samuel       Alito wrote  as a 35 year old  practicing lawyer        that  In college  I developed a deep interest in       constitutional law  motivated in large part by disagreement with       Warren Court decisions  particularly in the area   of             reapportionment   This was a startling statement to       make in 1985  just two decades ago  He was 35       years old and had been practicing law for almost a decade when       he wrote that statement about his disagreement with Warren Court       decisions on reapportionment  Even after being asked about this       statement several times at the hearing  Judge Alito failed to       adequately answer why he would seek to highlight a disagreement       with the landmark equal protection cases by which the Supreme       Court made elections fairer for all Americans and established       the principle of one person  one vote    The Warren Courts       reapportionment decisions were among the central achievements of       the civil rights era  They ensured that voting districts which       had been grossly mal apportioned  often to the detriment of       minority voters  would be fairly revised so that everyones vote       was weighed equally  It is clear from looking at the       Republicans partisan redistricting in Texas that these cases       did not solve all the problems  However  reapportionment cases       like Baker v  Carr        1962  and Reynolds v  Sims        1964  are landmarks because they established that courts have a       responsibility to make certain that voting districts meet       constitutional standards    It was Justice William Brennan of      New Jersey who wrote the Courts opinion in  Baker  Two years       later  in Reynolds        the Court established the one person  one vote standard       because  as stated by Chief Justice Warren in his opinion in       that case  As long as ours is a representative form of       government  and our legislatures are those instruments of       government elected directly by and directly representative of       the people  the right to elect legislators in a free and       unimpaired fashion is a bedrock of our political system    At his hearing  Judge Alito was in       retreat and had to concede that the concept of one person  one       vote is well settled and should not be re examined  It was       equally well settled in 1985 when he made the       statement in his job application  More importantly  Judge       Alitos testimony calls into question whether he truly       understands that the courts have a responsibility in our       constitutional system to intervene to ensure that constitutional       guarantees of equal access to the political system are met        This is important in situations where the political system is       corrupt or where the political branches lack the will to fight       against entrenched power or to reform themselves    In response to a question from       Senator Kohl  Judge Alito sought to retreat from the unqualified       disagreement with the reapportionment cases expressed in his 1985       application  He told the Committee that his disagreement was       based only on certain details of later Warren Court decisions       like the 1969 case        Kirkpatrick v  Preisler  Not only is this narrow       objection to certain Warren Court decisions not a credible       explanation for why he made his sweeping assertions of       disagreement in 1985  but Judge Alito also contradicted it       later in his testimony when he suggested that his disagreement       with the Warren Courts reapportionment decisions was based on       Alexander Bickels ideas about judicial self restraint        Professor Bickel was not concerned merely with later       applications of one person  one vote  Rather  his theory was       critical of the courts having any role at all in helping       to guarantee that access to the political system is fair and       equal   In fact  one of the justices whom       Judge Alito described as among his favorites  Justice Harlan        applied Bickels theories in dissenting from every landmark      Warren Court reapportionment case establishing one       person  one vote  starting with  Baker v  Carr  In       Justice Harlans dissenting opinion in  Reynolds v  Sims  as       in all of Justice Harlans reapportionment dissents  he argued       that there is no constitutional basis for one person  one vote       and that courts should restrain themselves from usurping the       state legislatures self serving apportionment decisions  In       his dissent in Reynolds        Justice Harlan wrote  It is difficult to imagine a more       intolerable and inappropriate interference by the judiciary with       the independent legislatures of the States  and  w hat is       done today deepens my conviction that judicial entry into this       realm is profoundly ill advised and constitutionally       impermissible  This dissent  described as one of Judge Alitos       favorites  hardly sounds like a disagreement only with certain       aspects of later reapportionment decisions    The effects of the Courts       decisions to intervene were dramatic  Were the Supreme Court to       have followed the dissents of Justice Harlan or the theories of       Alexander Bickel that Judge Alito embraced in 1985        the massive disparities in the size of voting districts would       not have been corrected in the 1960s  Nor would the       under representation of voters from urban areas  minority       voters  have been corrected  Had the Court not acted we might       still have poll taxes and other barriers to the ability of       minorities to vote   At the hearing we heard testimony       from pioneering civil rights attorney Fred Gray  who spent a       lifetime fighting for those who were denied the rights to equal       protection and equal dignity under the law guaranteed by our       Constitution  After he graduated from law school  Mr  Gray       immediately went to work defending Rosa Parks and Dr  Martin       Luther King  Jr   in the Montgomery bus boycott        He has a real life appreciation for the role of courts as       providing a check to protect individual rights and liberties        In the late 1950s  after the Alabama legislature changed the       city limits of Tuskegee  excluding all but three or four African       Americans who were registered to vote in the city  Mr  Gray       brought before the Supreme Court the case of  Gomillion v  Lightfoot   This unanimous decision securing the right to vote for       African Americans laid the foundation for  Baker v  Carr and       the cases establishing one person  one vote    I asked Mr  Gray what the       consequences would have been had the courts followed the lead of       Justice Harlan and Alexander Bickel  views with which Samuel       Alito apparently agreed  and not involved itself in       reapportionment  He testified     The difference is then  prior to       these decisions  and even prior to  Brown v  Board of Education        and prior to Gomillion v        Lightfoot and       Browder v  Gayle  the case that desegregated the       buses  we had very few African Americans and other minorities       registered  We had little or no African Americans in public       office  For example  in my state  in 1957 we had       none  Now my State has approximately the same number of persons       in our State legislature  It mirrors the population  We now       have thousands of African Americans and other minorities who are       holding public office  and an additional thousand that those       public office holders have appointed to elected office   Judge Alito did not adequately       explain his disagreement with the Warren Court       reapportionment decisions  He refused to say that he changed       his views  He did not repeat what he had suggested in some       private meetings    that he was merely saying what he thought       people in the Reagan White House wanted to hear and that it was       just a job application  Candidly  his testimony on this       critical point makes no sense  This is too fundamental a matter       to be left without a solid  credible explanation  The equal       protection rights and voting rights of all Americans are the       fulcrum for realizing the promises of our democratic republic    Supremacy Of       Elected Branches  Judge Alitos sweeping       disagreement with the Warren Courts       reapportionment decisions is not the only part of his 1985 job       application which has caused me to doubt his understanding of       the responsibility for the courts to intervene where the       political process is broken down  corrupt or entrenched  Judge       Alito also stated in that application that he believes in the       supremacy of the elected branches of government  In the       hearing  Judge Alito tried to retreat from this statement        describing it as inapt and very misleading and incorrect        However  he refused to disavow it  telling Senator Kennedy  I       haven t changed my mind    The Supreme Courts decisions to       intervene in the reapportionment cases in the 1960s had a       tremendous effect on the ability of millions of Americans to       participate in the political process  Yet I am concerned that       his 1985 written statement reveals that he will be       too deferential to the President as supreme even when needed       to be a check on the Government    The elected branches have no claim       to being legitimate  let alone supreme  if they are controlled       by entrenched political corruption  After listening to several       days of his testimony  I am left with serious questions and       concerns about Judge Alitos appreciation for this critical role       of the courts  These concerns are heightened by his apparent       adherence to the so called doctrine of the Unitary Executive           Discrimination       Cases  Judge Alito has failed to grasp       the importance of the courts in providing a venue for all       Americans to assert their rights  One of the clearest examples       of this is Judge Alitos distressing record in cases in which       individuals allege discrimination based on race  gender  or       disability  Judge Alito has consistently found ways to keep the       little guy from having a day in court  For example  he has       held individuals trying to prove discrimination to an       excessively high standard of proof  rendering their cases almost       un winnable  From the bench  he has favored the government and       big companies accused of discrimination  He seems to view these       cases not as examples of regular Americans struggling for equal       treatment but  instead  as technical legal exercises   Judge Alitos supporters  and       many on the other side of the aisle were lined up to support him       well before the hearings  have cherry picked individual cases       to try to show that Judge Alito was fair to average Americans        Judge Alito told us to look at his whole record and we did  In       fact  a study of Judge Alitos decisions by Knight Ridder       newspapers found that Judge Alito was consistently skeptical of       discrimination plaintiffs  generally setting high standards of       proof and finding that the plaintiffs before him did not meet       those standards  The study found that he was similarly       dismissive of criminal defendants alleging discrimination by the       government and of immigrants fighting deportation  Noted law       professors Cass Sunstein and Goodwin Liu studied the cases where       Judge Alito dissented from his colleagues and reached the same       conclusion   In several cases  the Third       Circuit criticized Judge Alito for taking positions which would       make it almost impossible for people to prove discrimination        In Bray v  Marriott Hotels        Judge Alito would have denied an African American worker the       chance to show that her employers denied her a promotion based       on race  The majority criticized Judge Alitos dissent saying       that a key discrimination statute would be eviscerated if our       analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests     The case of  Pirolli v World Flavors  Inc         is a particularly poignant example of the kind of case that       gives me great concern about whether Judge Alito would uphold       the rights of ordinary Americans seeking equal treatment  In       that case  Kenneth Pirolli  a mentally retarded employee        brought a claim for hostile work environment based on sex and       disability  alleging a pattern of sexual abuse and harassment       that can only be described as disgusting  Judge Alito dissented       from the Third Circuits decision that Mr  Pirollis case should       go to a jury  not based on the merits of the claim  but       essentially because he thought Mr  Pirollis lawyers legal       brief was poorly drafted  Senator Durbin asked Judge Alito       about this matter and gave him every opportunity to explain  It       remains another example of Judge Alito focusing on technical       details rather than on the rights of real people   As a former prosecutor  I am       sensitive to the need for a fair process and a fair jury in all       criminal cases  particularly the most serious ones  I am       troubled that in Riley v        Taylor  Judge Alito dissented from an  en banc decision in       a capital case in which the Third Circuit granted a new trial       because the prosecutor had improperly dismissed black jurors        Judge Alito denigrated the defendants use of statistical       evidence to show improper exclusion of black jurors  comparing       it to a statistical analysis of the disproportionate number of       recent left handed U S  Presidents  The majority       criticized Judge Alitos inappropriate analogy  writing  To       suggest any comparability to the striking of jurors based on       their race is to minimize the history of discrimination against       prospective black jurors and black defendants    The Little       Guy  In response to the many cases in       Judge Alitos record in which he has ruled against victims of       discrimination  victims of government intrusion  and immigrants        Judge Alitos Republican supporters searched hard to find a       small set of cases to show Judge Alito has not always ruled       against the little guy  What is notable about these efforts       is that even in the cases they have trumpeted  Judge Alito often       denied any meaningful relief to the average American   Several Republicans have raised       the case of United States v        Kithcart  They incorrectly suggest that in  Kithcart  Judge       Alito ruled in favor of an African American in a racial       profiling case  Mr  Kithcart was pulled over by the police       because he was African American and searched and arrested  When       the case came before Judge Alito  he sent it back to the trial       court to give the government a second chance to prove that the       stop and search of an African American were constitutional and       were not motivated by race  Judge McKee dissented from the       remand saying  just as this record fails to establish that       Officer Nelson had probable cause to arrest any Black male who       happened to drive by in a black sports car  it fails to       establish reasonable suspicion to justify stopping any and all       such cars that happened to contain a Black male  When the       case came back to Judge Alito on appeal  Judge Alito upheld the       search and affirmed the conviction  So while he remanded the       case back to the trial court  he then upheld the search and       conviction in his final decision and afforded Mr  Kithcart no       relief    Judge Alitos supporters have       pointed to Fatin v  INS       as an example of a case in which Judge Alito sided with       powerless immigrants and did not defer to the Government  This       is another bad example because he ultimately ruled against the       immigrant  Parastoo Fatin  and she was deported   Ms  Fatin was an Iranian woman       whose family had opposed the Ayatollah Khomeini and who had come       to the United States as a student  She was       fighting deportation and requested asylum  arguing that she       would be subjected to harsh treatment as a former opponent of       Iranian regime  as someone who did not practice a strict form of       Islam  and as a woman  who would have to wear a veil and live       under great restrictions in Iran  As his supporters have noted        Judge Alito ruled in the case that gender based persecution       could be a basis for asylum  But Judge Alito went on to rule       against Ms  Fatin anyway  So he denied her petition for review       and sent her on to be deported   Judge Alito and Republican       Senators seeking to bolster Judge Alitos record cited  Leveto v  Lapina as       an example of a case in which he protected the rights of       individuals against government intrusion  It is telling about       Judge Alitos record in the area of individual rights protection       that in a case he trumpeted for his protection of the rights of       individuals  he threw the Levetos out of court and denied them       any remedy    The facts of this case are       egregious  In the course of an IRS tax fraud investigation of       the Levetos  armed agents rushed Dr  Leveto at the veterinary       hospital where he worked when he arrived at 6 30 a m   patted       him down  and then held him in a small room for over an hour        not allowing him to speak to anyone or make any calls  They       then accompanied Dr  Leveto to his home where they patted down       Mrs  Leveto  who was still in her nightgown  and then detained       and interrogated her for six hours    Meanwhile  other agents took Dr        Leveto back to the hospital where they held him in a closed room       for six more hours  During this six hours  he was not permitted       external communications  was accompanied on bathroom breaks  and       was interrogated without       Miranda warnings  while other agents searched the       hospital  During the course of the search IRS agents sent       hospital employees home and turned away clients in the parking       lot  informing them that the hospital was closed until further       notice   Despite acknowledging numerous       violations  Judge Alito dismissed the Levetos appeal and their       case based on uncertainty in the case law  and threw them out       of court    Supporters of Judge Alito have       cited the case of Brinson v        Vaughn as an example of a case in which Judge Alito       sided with a victim of discrimination  reversing a conviction       because black jurors had been improperly excluded from the jury       pool  This was an easy case given the extraordinary facts       involved  In Brinson        the prosecutor dismissed 13 of 14 prospective black jurors and       had previously made a training video in which he urged       prosecutors to dismiss black prospective jurors from the jury       pool  This does not reassure me about my concern that Judge       Alito will only give credence to claims of discrimination in       extreme cases  Indeed  in       Riley v  Taylor  when an  en banc majority of       the Third Circuit found that black jurors had been improperly       dismissed from the jury pool  Judge Alito disagreed and       denigrated the defendants use of statistical evidence to show       improper exclusion of black jurors  comparing it  as has been       previously noted  to a statistical analysis of the       disproportionate number of recent left handed U S  Presidents   The role of courts should be to       protect make sure there is a fair forum for the powerless and       even the unpopular  This is the reason the courts are the one       undemocratic branch  I am concerned that rather than       demonstrating an understanding of the effect of the law on the       lives of real Americans as Justice OConnor has shown  Judge       Alito would close the courthouse doors to those Americans most       in need of the courts to protect their rights    Conclusion  In the next few years  the Supreme       Court will hear many challenges to political entrenchment        Critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act  VRA   Congress       part in guaranteeing equal access to voting  the fundamental       machinery of democracy  were upheld by the Warren       Court in South Carolina v        Katzenbach  1966  by an 8 1 vote  The VRA will need       to be reauthorized before it expires in 2007  Subsequent court       challenges will be critical to fairness to minority voters    The Supreme Court will soon hear a       challenge to Texas Republicans partisan mid Census redrawing of       congressional districts  There are questions before the Supreme       Court this term about campaign finance laws  We are seeing       exposed in the news every day a culture of corruption through       money and access that has taken root in       Washington  by which one political party has sought to entrench       itself as a permanent majority    The cost to Americans is high if       we in the Senate get it wrong  I go back to the central       question I asked at the outset of Judge Alitos hearing  Will       this nominee serve to protect the fundamental rights and       liberties of all Americans  Based on Judge Alitos record  I       have no confidence that he will provide a check against either       an overreaching President or entrenched political power  nor       that he will serve to protect Americans fundamental rights and       liberties
