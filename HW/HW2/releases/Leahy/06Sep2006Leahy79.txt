       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Feinstein Leahy Cluster Munitions   Amendment To The FY 2007 Defesne Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Feinstein Leahy Cluster Munitions Amendment     To The FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Bill     September 6  2006 MR  LEAHY  I commend my friend from      California  Senator Feinstein  for this very important and long      overdue amendment  I am proud to have worked with her on it and to      be a cosponsor  The problem of cluster munitions  which      overwhelmingly maim and kill the innocent  has been known for many      years  Perhaps the most egregious example is Laos  where millions      of these tiny explosives were dropped by U S  planes during the      Vietnam War  Over three decades later they continue to cause      horrific civilian casualties   I have urged the Pentagon to address this      problem for nearly a decade  While they have acknowledged the problem  they      have not yet taken effective steps to solve it  We used massive      numbers of cluster munitions in the invasion of Iraq  including in      densely inhabited areas  and innocent civilians paid and continue to      pay a terrible price  Israel used these weapons in Lebanon  and      again it has been innocent civilians who have suffered      disproportionately  Cluster munitions  like any weapon  have      military utility  They can be effective against armor or military      infrastructure  But they are  in effect  indiscriminate because      they scatter thousands of lethal bomblets over wide areas  Many of      them  between 1 and 40 percent depending on the type and the      condition of the terrain  fail to explode on contact and remain as      hazardous duds indefinitely  no different from landmines   The duds are activated by whoever comes into      contact with them  and often it is an unsuspecting child who naively      believes it is a toy  The consequences are disastrous  lifelong      disfigurement and disability  or death  No one argues that it is possible to completely      avoid civilian casualties in war  Innocent casualties are an      inevitable  tragic consequence of all wars  But this amendment      should not be necessary  Weapons that are so disproportionately      hazardous to civilians should of course be subject to strict rules      of engagement   The Feinstein Leahy amendment is fully      consistent with the laws of war and international humanitarian law       It uses the same standard as for incendiary weapons  which are also      notoriously hazardous to civilians  Rather than prohibit cluster      munitions  the amendment says only that they should not be used      where there are concentrations of civilians   Mr  President  this is a moral issue and it is      an issue of our own self interest  Using or selling weapons that      are so indiscriminate  without strict rules of engagement  is      immoral  It is immoral  Anyone who has seen the horrific      consequences of children with an arm or a leg blown off  or a part      of their face  or their lifeless body cut to pieces by the shrapnel       knows that  But it is also contrary to our own interest to      be using or selling weapons which  without strict controls on their      use  cause such appalling casualties of innocent people who are not      the enemy  It fuels anger and resentment we can ill afford among      the very people whose support we need  So again I commend the Senator from California      and strongly support the amendment  I ask unanimous consent that a      December 11  2003  article in USA Today entitled Cluster      bombs kill in Iraq  even after the shooting ends  be printed in the      record  I yield the floor
