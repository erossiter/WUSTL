       OIG Report  FBI Botched Probe of Whistleblowers Claims Of Problems In   Translation Unit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT       OIG Report  FBI Botched         Probe Of Whistleblowers         Claims Of Problems In Translation Unit         Reaction Of Grassley And Leahy         Who Sought Public Release of Report     FRIDAY  January 14   The Office of the         Inspector General  OIG  of the Department of Justice  DOJ  criticized the         FBI for failing to thoroughly investigate the allegations of a         whistleblower who complained of sloppy work and security lapses within the         Bureaus translation unit  according to an unclassified report released         Friday at the request of Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Charles         Grassley  R Iowa     Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the        Senate Judiciary Committee  which has jurisdiction over DOJ  and Grassley         a senior member of the panel  sought release of an unclassified version of        the report in July 2004 when the inquiry into the allegations of Sibel        Edmonds  a former contract linguist in the FBI translation program  were        completed but the results were classified by the FBI  Edmonds        claimed she was fired from her job as a contract linguist in 2002 after        making allegations against a coworker of shoddy work and security breaches        in the unit    This report confirms that the FBI failed to        treat this case as seriously as the situation demanded  It is        unacceptable  and it deeply concerns us  that in the wake of the Robert        Hanssen spy case  and in the months following September 11th  the FBI        failed to vigorously investigate these grave allegations  This report does        not determine whether the underlying claims would have ultimately been        proven accurate  but the FBIs flawed response gives me little confidence        that the bureau or its leaders have learned from decades of repeated        mistakes  said Leahy  The Bureau has reflexively ignored and punished        its whistleblowers  to the detriment of the Bureaus effectiveness and        sometimes to the detriment of the publics safety  The Bureau needs to        break that pattern and learn from its mistakes in order to be as effective        as the American people need it to be in countering terrorism and in all its        other vital missions  I commend the Inspector General for ensuring that an        unclassified version of this report was made available to the public          Time and again we hear from the FBI that        whistleblowers who raise legitimate complaints will not be retaliated        against  It s time for more than just lip service  The Inspector General s        report did not address the truthfulness of the allegations  But  the IG did        determine that if the FBI had actually looked into the allegations  they        might have found that where there s smoke there s fire  Once again the FBI        has shown that it has a long way to go in its treatment of whistleblowers         said Grassley  While this report shows only the problems encountered        during the FBI s investigation of this case  the larger issue with the        translation department remains  I plan to continue to monitor the        implementation of the recommendations made in previous reports that I        expect will help restore integrity to the translation department   Over the years Grassley and Leahy have        partnered on several legislative and oversight initiatives to protect        whistleblowers and to reform the FBI  Most recently the two senators        joined forces to amend the National Intelligence Reform Act  the so called        9 11 Bill  to ensure greater oversight of the beleaguered foreign language        translation unit  The Grassley Leahy amendment expanded the requirements        governing the Attorney Generals reporting to Congress on the translation        unit  The senators offered the amendment following an OIG audit showing        the slow pace of reforms in the translation unit in the three years since        the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  The audit also        revealed that thousands of hours of tapes of terrorist targets had not been        translated in a timely manner  security problems persisted  and systemic        difficulties had not been overcome  An unclassified version of that audit        was released at Leahys and Grassleys request in September 2004   Grassley and Leahy also have a pending request        for the release of a public version of another classified OIG report on        certain information obtained by the FBI prior to the September 11         2001  terrorist attacks
