       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Chairman s Mark On   Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On The Chairmans Mark On Comprehensive Immigration Reform     Executive Business Meeting Of The Committee On The Judiciary     March 2  2006 Today we begin a      long overdue debate on comprehensive immigration reform  I commend      the Chairman for initiating this debate   We are a nation      of immigrants  My grandparents came to this nation as immigrants       and my Irish and Italian grandfathers became stone cutters in the      stone quarries of Vermont  We all support legal immigration  but we      are also a nation of laws  and our laws must be enforced  We must      work hard to keep this nation vital  vigorous and ready to offer the      American Dream to each new generation of Americans  and that      includes ensuring that American workers can find jobs  We must      confront what we all know is a broken system  and the path to truly      fixing it will have to be paved with straight talk and honest      facts  Goodwill and bipartisanship will help get us there  and in      the lead up to these proceedings  it is encouraging that this      Committee has taken at least some baby steps down that constructive      path  There are 11 million undocumented aliens in this nation  and      we all know that it would be impossibly costly  complicated       distracting and burdensome to locate and deport those 11 million      people  Even if it were remotely feasible to do this  we all know      another stark fact    that many of our industries and the economies      of countless American communities have come to depend on immigrant      labor   No one is      suggesting that we provide amnesty to those who are living and      working in America illegally  What we need is a realistic and      orderly process that brings illegal aliens and undocumented workers      out of the shadows  We need aliens to come forward  to register  to      pay taxes  and to learn English  If we can achieve that  we can      help eliminate the underground economy  where illegal aliens accept      lower wages than Americans and where worker safety is jeopardized       If we enact laws that are reasonable  that are fair  and that put      people on a level playing field  we can start to regularize wages      for all workers and ensure just competition   This is more than      an economic issue  it is also a security issue  Rather than talking      about having to build walls across our Northern and Southern Borders      to prevent migration  we can bring the 11 million undocumented into      the light of day  This is a basic point  knowing who is in our      nation allows us to improve our national security  Then our      security resources can be sharply focused on capturing those who      want to do us harm   The Chairman has      presented us with a proposal that draws from several existing      proposals as well as including fresh ideas of his own  There are      some worthy provisions in the bill and some that I find deeply      troubling  I expect that this bill will dominate the Committees      executive agenda for the next several weeks  so today I will discuss      just a handful of the bills provisions  I was pleased to      see the Chairman include in his bill additional border patrol      agents  inspectors  and Customs and Border Patrol officers  I have      fought for additional border agents since 2001  when I added a      Northern Border security section to the USA PATRIOT Act to authorize      tripling of the patrol staff along the border  The mark includes      some positive provisions to help math and science students study and      stay in the United States  raising the competitiveness of our work      force in these critical areas  And it picks up on a proposal to      make more H 1B visas available  an effort I strongly supported in      the budget reconciliation process last fall   The mark creates      a new visa category  H 2C  for persons coming temporarily to the      United States to perform labor or services if U S  workers cannot be      found  I believe that this provision has the potential to help our      dairy farmers legally hire foreign workers  Dairy workers often      slip through the cracks when we discuss agricultural worker visas       which are often seasonal in duration  Dairy farms need workers      year round  I hear the concerns of Vermont dairy farmers almost      daily  and they raise legitimate questions  They want to follow the      law  but they struggle to find legal dairy workers  I want to see      some relief for all of our dairy farmers  whether they are in      Vermont  Pennsylvania  New York or Wisconsin   Unfortunately       there are a number of problematic provisions in the Chairmans      mark   It contains a      provision to conduct studies on the feasibility of building barrier      systems on the Northern and Southern borders  I prepared an      amendment to strike the Northern Border barrier study  which I do      not believe will increase the security of our nation  Given all of      our protection needs  and the cost of meeting them  I cannot      understand why we would direct funds to study the feasibility of      what appears to be not only utterly infeasible  but also entirely      undesirable  especially from the perspective of the states along      what has long been the worlds longest  safest and most commercially      important international border  We should focus our efforts on      working with our friend and ally  the Canadian Government  to      continually improve security  trade  and community ties  I was      pleased to hear from the Chairmans office that this provision will      likely be stripped as we move forward  The mark also      takes what I believe are steps in the wrong direction  Several      sections give the Executive branch broad powers that are exempt from      judicial review  We have seen how this Administration acts when it      believes it is above the law  Whether it is redefining torture or      spying on Americans domestically  this Administration seems to have      little respect for court review  I know that the Chairman holds the      judiciary in high regard  and so I am  frankly  puzzled to see these      court stripping provisions in his bill   The bill also      expands the definition of aggravated felony to include minor      offenses and applies these changes retroactively  Such      modifications could have serious consequences for victims of      domestic violence  who are often charged along with their batterers      when police arrive at the scene of a domestic incident  We just      succeeded in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act  I am      dismayed to see proposals in the mark that might harm those same      victims we worked so hard to protect in VAWA   The Chairman has      tried to produce a bill that balances the interests of the many      different and strongly held points of view in the immigration      debate  I appreciate his efforts  but am sorry that we are starting      this debate with a document that does not include a path to      citizenship for immigrants who register  wait in line  pay their      fines  and follow the laws  I am dismayed that we are not starting      with commonsense and bipartisan approaches to deal with the 11      million undocumented aliens presently in this country   In addition  the      mark might have included bipartisan proposals like Ag Jobs and the      DREAM Act  It might have taken steps to help refugees  who are      sometimes forced to use fraudulent documents to escape persecution      in their home countries  Instead the mark would add to their      burdens by barring asylum in many such circumstances  These are      missed opportunities  Punitive measures  unreviewable discretion       and other restrictions on judicial review add insult to injury  We      may be able to modify the mark in positive ways in the coming weeks       and I stand ready to work with the Chairman and any member of this      committee to do so
