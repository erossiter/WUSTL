       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Canadian Government s Compensation   Package For Maher Arar                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       On The Canadian Governments Compensation Package     For Maher Arar     January 26  2007  The Canadian Government now has taken      several steps to accept responsibility for its role in sending Mr       Arar to Syria  where he was tortured  The question remains why       even if there were reasons to consider him suspicious  the U S       Government shipped him to Syria where he was tortured  instead of to      Canada for investigation or prosecution  I look forward to hearing      the Justice Department s answer to that question next week
