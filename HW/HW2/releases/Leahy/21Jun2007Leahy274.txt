      VERMONT               Senate Judiciary Committee    Authorizes Chairman Leahy To Issue Subpoenas    Related To     Administrations Domestic Surveillance Program      Bipartisan Vote For Authorization  To Compel     Justice  Dept   Admin  Officials To Provide Legal Analysis For Program      WASHINGTON  Thursday  June     21    The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday authorized Chairman     Patrick Leahy  D Vt    in consultation with Ranking Member Arlen Specter      R Pa    to issue subpoenas for documents relating to the authorization     and legal justification for the Administration s warrantless wiretapping     program    In a bipartisan vote of 13 3      the Committee authorized Chairman Leahy to issue subpoenas to the     Department of Justice and to the Executive Office of the President     relating to information the Committee has requested several times since     the program was first revealed in December 2005  Ranking Member Specter     and Senators Orrin Hatch  R Utah  and Charles Grassley  R Iowa      supported the authorization      along with all Democratic members of the Committee    This Committee has sought     information about the authorization of and legal justification for this     program time and again  in letters  at hearings  and in written     questions  Leahy said  Yet this Administration has rebuffed all requests  Last     month  Senator Specter and I wrote again to Attorney General Gonzales     requesting these documents  We have still received no documents and no     explanation   This stonewalling is unacceptable and it must end  If the     Administration will not carry out its responsibility to provide     information to this Committee without a subpoena  we will issue one       Below is the text of     the subpoena authorization as well as Chairman Leahys statement from     the Committees Executive Business Meeting earlier today      is a May 21st letter from Chairman Leahy and     Ranking Member Specter reiterating earlier requests for information     about the legal justification for the domestic surveillance program from     the Department of Justice                  Text     of Subpoena Authorization   Motion Of Senator Patrick     Leahy    Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary    June 21  2007  Be it resolved that  pursuant     to its authority under Rules 25 and 26 of the Standing Rules of the     Senate  the Senate Committee on the Judiciary hereby authorizes its     Chairman  in consultation with the    Ranking Member  to issue subpoenas to  1  the Honorable Alberto     Gonzales  Attorney General of the United States  and 2  the Custodian of     Records at the Executive Office of the President  to provide the    Committee with all documents related to the Committee s investigation     into the Administration s operation of a warrantless domestic     surveillance program outside of the provisions of the Foreign    Intelligence Surveillance Act  and its legal analysis for this program                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Authorization For Subpoenas     In Connection With The Investigation Of The Legal Basis    For The Warrantless Electronic Surveillance Program    Executive Business Meeting    June 21  2007    Today I will ask the Committee to provide     the authorization to issue subpoenas for documents relating to the     National Security Agencys warrantless domestic electronic surveillance     program  This is an authorization I first circulated two weeks ago and     that was formally held over by Senator Kyl last week   For more than five years this     Administration intercepted conversations of Americans in the United     States without obtaining court orders under the Foreign Intelligence     Surveillance Act  FISA   This program became public in December 2005     and  soon after  the President confirmed its existence  Since then      this Committee has sought information about the authorization of and     legal justification for this program time and again  in letters  at     hearings  and in written questions  Yet  this Administration has     rebuffed all requests  Last month  Senator Specter and I wrote again to     Attorney General Gonzales requesting these documents  We have still     received no documents and no explanation    This stonewalling is unacceptable and it     must end  If the Administration will not carry out its responsibility     to provide information to this Committee without a subpoena  we will     issue one  If we do not  we are letting this Administration decide     whether and how the Congress will do its job  The Judiciary Committee     is charged with overseeing and legislating on constitutional protections     and the civil liberties of Americans  and the warrantless electronic     surveillance program directly impacts these responsibilities     Instead of responses  our attempts to get     straight answers from the Administration have met with stubborn refusals     of our legitimate oversight requests  This is information we need  we     should have  and whose production is long overdue  We are asking not     for intimate operational details but for the legal justifications and     analysis underlying these programs that affect the rights of every     American    When we held our first hearing with     Attorney General Gonzales about this program  on February 6  2006  he     refused to answer simple questions or discuss anything more than those     facts the President has publicly confirmed  He defended the program as     necessary and very narrowly tailored  but he refused to back up     these self serving conclusions  He asserted that the Authorization for     the Use of Military Force passed after September 11 authorized this     warrantless wiretapping of Americans  yet would not even tell me  when the Justice Department     had come up with this particular legal justification  This pattern of     evasion has continued with every hearing  every letter  and every     written response    Last month  we heard deeply troubling     testimony from former Deputy Attorney General James Comey about a     dispute over the legality of the warrantless electronic surveillance     program  When the senior Department of Justice leadership refused to     certify the legality of the program  the White House  including the     then Counsel to the President  Mr  Gonzales  attempted to strong arm an     ailing Attorney General Ashcroft in his hospital bed  When that did not     work  they decided simply to ignore the law and authorize the program     anyway  Only the prospect of a mass resignation of virtually every     senior officer in the Department of Justice  including the FBI Director      caused the President to relent    Yet  when Attorney General Gonzales was     asked at that February 6  2006  hearing before this Committee whether     senior Justice Department officials expressed reservations about the NSA     warrantless surveillance program  he responded  I do not believe that     these DOJ officials       had concerns about this program  The     Committee and the American people deserve better    There is no legitimate argument for     withholding these materials from this Committee  There is abundant     precedent for providing Executive Branch legal analysis to the Congress      particularly to this Committee  Indeed  volumes upon volumes of     Attorney General and Office of Legal Counsel legal opinions have even     been made public  Sometimes in previous Administrations a particularly     sensitive subject has resulted in an accommodation between branches on     the manner in which it was shared  But this Administration has no     policy of accommodation  Its policy is to deny and to stonewall      Neither is the fact that the matters involve classified information a     reason to withhold these legal documents  Congress receives sensitive     classified information regularly    Why has this Administration been so     steadfast in its refusal  Deputy Attorney General Comeys account     suggests that some of these documents would reveal an Administration     perfectly willing to ignore the law  Is that what they are hiding       When the Department of Justices own     Office of Professional Responsibility  OPR  began an internal     investigation into the conduct of Department of Justice attorneys who     approved this program  Attorney General Gonzales and the White House     shut them down by denying them the necessary clearances  The head of     OPR noted when he was forced to stand down that in its 31 year history     OPR had never before been prevented from pursuing an investigation      Senators Durbin  Kennedy  Feingold  and Whitehouse have diligently     sought documents on this series of events many times  but  again  have     received no response    Finally  I will note that this     Administration is now asking Congress to make sweeping changes to FISA      a crucial national security authority over which this Committee has     jurisdiction  The White House wants us to agree to far reaching changes     to that authority  but the Administration stubbornly refuses to let us     know how it interprets the current law and the perceived flaws that led     it to operate a program outside of the process established by FISA for     more than five years  This legal analysis is information the Committee     must have in order to make informed legislative decisions  As the     Supreme Court said in McGrain v      Daugherty   a  legislative body cannot legislate wisely or     effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions     which the legislation is intended to affect or change     Whatever the reason for the stonewalling      this Committee has stumbled in the dark for too long  attempting to do     its job without the information it needs  We need this information to     carry out our responsibilities under the Constitution  Unfortunately      it has become clear that we will not get it without a subpoena  I urge     the adoption of the subpoena authorization
