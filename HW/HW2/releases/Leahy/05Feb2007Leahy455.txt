       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy And Senator Bernie Sanders To The   President s Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Reaction Of    Senator Patrick Leahy And Senator Bernie Sanders    To The Presidents Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request    Monday  February 5  2007  Senator Patrick Leahy   The Bush Administrations new budget plan     is another mismatch for the real priorities of ordinary Vermonters      This Bush budget is a direct outgrowth of the policies of recklessness     and squander that have short circuited the priorities of hard working     families  children and seniors  Health care  education  housing  law     enforcement  first responder  and home heating investments have taken a     back seat to a costly  misguided and mismanaged war in Iraq and to the     Bush Administrations disastrous fiscal policies here at home  While increasing the     size and scope of the government by more than any other White House in     history  President Bush has persisted in borrowing from our children and     grandchildren for tax cuts to benefit most of all the wealthiest     individuals and corporations  The largest surplus in our history has     been turned into the largest debt in our history  Interest on the debt     alone totaled  226 7 billion last year  nearly  4 4 billion a week      Thats almost  1 billion every working day  Meanwhile  the war in Iraq     drains the Treasury at the rate of more than  2 billion every week      This Administration     has dug the nation into a deepening hole  and changing our policies and     priorities will not be quick or easy to do  But the days of rubber     stamping the Bush budgets are over  I believe the new Congress now will     begin changing our course to a new direction  It will be a better     direction for Vermonters and for ordinary Americans everywhere              Senator Bernie Sanders  The President had an     historic opportunity to present a budget to Congress that would expand     the middle class  lower the poverty rate and reduce the gap between the     rich and the poor  Unfortunately  the budget that the President chose     to submit to Congress fails on all three of these counts  Instead  the     Presidents budget provides hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the     wealthiest one percent  while proposing harsh cutbacks in federal     investments vital to the middle class  senior citizens on fixed incomes      and low income families with children  As a Member of the Budget     Committee  I will be strongly opposing the Presidents budget  The budget that     President Bush has sent to the Congress slashes health care  nutritional     benefits  Head Start  affordable housing and educational opportunities     for millions of ordinary Americans  while imposing new copayments of up     to  750 for veterans health care  The time has come to overturn these     upside down priorities  The time has come for Congress to rescind the     Presidents tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent  eliminate     corporate welfare and tax breaks for corporate expatriates  cut back on     wasteful defense spending  and make sure that the IRS is collecting the      300 billion in taxes that go uncollected each year  These bold     initiatives will give us the resources to adequately fund middle class     priorities while slashing the federal budget deficit  During Budget     Committee deliberations  I will be offering progressive budget     alternatives that reflect these priorities
