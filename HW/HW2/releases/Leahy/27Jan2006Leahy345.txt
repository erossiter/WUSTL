       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel Alito                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr       To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United States     January 27  2006  The Constitution gives the Senate an      essential role in the confirmation of Supreme Court justices  It is      a role that I take very seriously  The Senate is not a rubber      stamp  So it was important for me to get a sense of how Judge Alito      thinks  and whether he would be a Supreme Court justice for all      Americans  before deciding whether or not I could support his      nomination   He came to his hearing with a record      he has created over the last 30 years  As a judge and before that      as a high ranking government official appointed to a succession of      posts by Republican presidents  Judge Alito seemed consistently to      defer to Executive power and to show little empathy for the plight      of ordinary Americans  His record also suggested a pattern of      saying what he needed to say to get to the next job  In the course      of this nomination he sought to retreat from his own words without      really doing so  The hearing provided him an opportunity to explain      his record  It was an opportunity he chose to squander when the      Presidents supporters and Republican Senators urged him not to be      forthcoming  He had the chance to answer some of the troubling      questions that his past words and actions raised  He had the      opportunity to demonstrate that his replacement of Harriet Miers was      not what it appeared to be  the President selecting someone he knew      he could count on to support Government power and the expansive      doctrine of the Unitary Executive and someone the extreme faction      in the Presidents party felt assured would march with Justices      Thomas and Scalia in their culture war   It was an opportunity that he did not      take  The hearings  and the whole confirmation process  left us      with more questions and greater concerns than before  I have      already discussed his failure to assure us that he would serve as an      effective check and balance on executive power  He failed to show      me  or the American people  that when he recited platitudes    no      one is above the law    that he was not just telling us what he      thought he needed to say to get this promotion    Broken Commitments      On Recusals  One question for the Senate is whether      Judge Alito takes seriously his promises to the Senate and his      obligations to avoid the appearance of impropriety  He had an      opportunity to allay concerns about his repeated failures to recuse      himself from cases during the nominations process and at the      hearing  and it was another opportunity that he missed   In 1990  when Judge Alito was before      the Senate seeking confirmation to his current job on the Third      Circuit Court of Appeals  he made a pledge  He promised the Senate      that he would recuse himself from five categories of cases  cases      involving three different financial companies with whom he had      dealings  cases in which his sisters law firm represented a party       and cases he had overseen as the United States Attorney in  New Jersey  I was disappointed to discover that  despite      making an explicit promise to disqualify himself from these cases  a      sworn commitment  he failed to disqualify himself in at least four      of the five categories of cases he had listed    He apparently failed even to put      several of the financial companies on the Third Circuits automatic      recusal list despite promising the Senate to recuse from cases      involving these companies  I am not suggesting that he gained a      financial benefit in any of the decisions he made in cases in which      he should have recused  That is beside the point  The issue is his      sworn promise to the Senate and his varying explanations for      breaking that promise  I am concerned  and would expect that other      Senators would be concerned as well  by his apparently systematic      disregard for his promise to the Senate to steer clear of certain      categories of cases    One case  involving the Vanguard      funds  in which he has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars and      which he expressly included in his 1990 pledge to the Senate  is      particularly troubling    not just because of his involvement but      because of the shifting excuses he has given us during the course of      this confirmation process  He provided a series of explanations      that conflicted with each other and with the facts  He told me and      others before the hearing that he was assigned to the Vanguard case      due to a glitch in the computer screening program that was supposed      to identify conflicts  After significant investigatory work and      pressing for answers  we found that that answer was not accurate       Vanguard was not on his computerized list to identify conflicts when      he led us to believe that a computer glitch occurred  Judge Alito      finally acknowledged at the hearings that there was no computer      glitch  At the end of the day there was no getting around the fact      that he was responsible for failing to live up to his sworn      commitment to the Senate from 1990  What was most disappointing is      that he did not own up to his responsibility or his error but sought      to evade and excuse his conduct for weeks and weeks  He acted like      the Bush Administration most often does when it errs  by blaming      others  his surrogates attacked those raising questions  while he      proffered numerous conflicting excuses    For example  one of his many      explanations was contained in a letter he wrote to Chairman      Specter  He contended that the 1990 promise he had made to the      Judiciary Committee in order to become a Circuit judge only applied      to his initial service and that he later  apparently secretly and      unilaterally  decided that his promise to this Committee had been      unduly restrictive and that he need not follow it anymore  He did      not so inform the Judiciary Committee or the Senate of these      determinations at any time before his 2005 nomination      to the Supreme Court  Moreover  it is wholly inconsistent with his      finally adding the Vanguard companies to his recusal list in      December 2003  This letter seems more like self serving       after the fact rationalizing than it does a truthful explanation for      what had happened in 2003  As we discovered through due diligence       Vanguard and Smith Barney were not on the judges automatic recusal      list even in 1993  There is no reason to think they were on there      before that  It certainly does not seem that Judge Alito tried to      live up to his sworn commitment to the Senate even during what he      would have to concede was his initial service period as a Circuit      judge    Moreover  the initial service excuse      makes no more sense with respect to his Vanguard investments than it      would with respect to his sister  She did not cease being his      sister after some initial service period of his on the bench  In      fact  his Vanguard investments significantly increased over the      period of his service on the bench  The initial service concept      in the Judiciary Committees approach to recusal applies to      transition from a law practice to the bench  Thus  for example       once the cases on which he had been involved while the U S  Attorney      in New Jersey had run their course  he was not      prohibited for all time from hearing cases from that office       Eventually  even he had to acknowledge at the hearing that this      initial service argument was not the real reason he failed to      recuse from the Vanguard case  even though that had been the      argument he made in a written response to our Committees chairman         To the end  Judge Alito has failed to      take responsibility for his action  Instead  the best he can do is      to admit at his hearing that he just didnt focus on the issue of      recusal and that no light went off  There was no remorse  no      apology  and no embarrassment for the string of conflicting and      inaccurate explanations he gave during the course of this      nomination  Accordingly there is no reason to think that if he      becomes a Supreme Court Justice he will focus any better on conflict      of interest and appearance of conflict issues  in a system without      accountability  I voted against the nomination of Justice Rehnquist      to become Chief Justice in large measure because of his involvement      in a case in which he should not have been  I take these matters      very seriously  It is apparent that this nominee does not    Concerned Alumni of     Princeton  After evaluating the record and the      testimony at the hearing  I also suspect that this nominee was less      than candid about his 1985 job application and his      inclusion of his membership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton       CAP   In a 1985 application for a political position in the      Meese Justice Department  Judge Alito emphasized his membership in      the group  which he termed a conservative alumni group  It was      one of only two group memberships that he included in his carefully      constructed personal statement  the other was the Federalist      Society  By contrast  he chose not to include his membership at the      time in the Princeton Club of Washington  He referenced CAP  a      group that had received local and national media attention for its      resistance to the admission of women and minorities to the      university and for its prolonged hostility to students who did not      fit Princetons traditional mold  My question was  why  Why would      he emphasize membership in a group like that    Concerned Alumni of Princeton      represented a view of Princeton and its clubs  a view      which excluded women  African Americans and other minorities       Surely he would have known that the same people who in the 1970s and      1980s resisted coeducation and affirmative action would have  only a      generation earlier  resisted the admission of people from Italian      immigrant families  like his and mine  and members of religious      minority groups  like Catholics and Jews  My parents often spoke      about seeing signs in Vermont saying  No Irish  and Catholics      Need Not Apply  My parents tried to instill in me the idea that      such discrimination  and all discrimination  is wrong  Knowing my      familys roots and heeding my parents teachings  I have tried my      best to promote tolerance and inclusion  It disturbed me that Judge      Alito proudly proclaimed affiliation with a group that did just the      opposite    So I asked him about it and gave him a      chance to explain  He did not  Instead  he ducked the question       He started by telling the Judiciary Committee that he could not      remember anything about his membership in the group  After the      White House first publicly suggested that the explanation for his      joining was his concern about ROTC  he adopted that self serving      rationale for why he had joined the group  in a contorted      explanation  he said he did not remember  but if he did it would      probably have been because of ROTC  The truth is that ROTC had      returned to campus long before 1985  and neither CAPs      own materials nor media accounts suggest that ROTC was a primary      focus for CAP at the time  And of course  that was not an answer to      my question  My question was why he touted his membership in 1985       He never answered my question   I will give him the benefit of the      doubt and accept that he was not very active in the group  That      makes all the more important the question of why he went out of his      way to emphasize it  a group in which he says he was not active  in      connection with his seeking political promotion in 1985        Although we do not know for certain       it appears from the hearing that Samuel Alito did not join CAP at      its founding but waited until around the time of his efforts in 1985      to get that political promotion  That leads me to wonder whether it      was part of his campaign to get the promotion  I know how partisan      and ideologically driven the Meese Justice Department was  Until      the Bush Administration it was probably the most partisan in modern      history  So it is logical to think that he proudly proclaimed his      membership in CAP and the Federalist Society  as well as his support      of Republican candidates and conservative causes and his recent      submission of articles to the      American Spectator  to establish his right wing      credentials to help win that coveted promotion  It seems apparent      that he said all this in 1985 to show those making promotion      decisions that he was not just a traditional conservative  but a      movement conservative  and that the activists in control of      political promotions at the Meese Justice Department and the White      House could rely on him   I am concerned that he was trying too      hard in 1985 and before to fit in with those in      power  In this time of Executive overreaching  illegal spying  and      expanding Government power  what the American people need is a      Supreme Court that is willing to stand up for the liberties and      rights of all Americans  not someone who curries favor with the      powerful         I am concerned  as well  about his failure to be forthcoming in      answer to my questions  I would have been more willing to give      Judge Alito the benefit of the doubt if he had taken the opportunity      the hearings provided to come clean about all this  He gave me no      adequate answers  When Senator Schumer raised the      matter of his inclusion of CAP on his job application again  on      another day  later in the hearing he hinted at what he had done in      1985 but still would not own up  He said         Y ou have to look at the question that I was responding to and the      form that I was filling out  I was applying for a position in the      Reagan Administration  and my answers were truthful statements  but      what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to      obtaining a political position  But he stopped far short of      answering because he had gotten himself into another box by his      previously saying to us that he had no recollection of CAP  He      concluded with the following  Well  Senator  since I don t      remember this organization  I can t answer your question      specifically  but I think that the answer to the question lies in      the nature of the form that I was filling out and the things that I      put   Regrettably  when he had been asked by      ABA representatives about his putting CAP in his 1985      job application and whether he was pandering  he failed to take      that opportunity to reflect on what he had done and own up to the      matter  as well  Instead  according to Marna Tuckers testimony  he      answered that he put CAP on that application because it would be      improper to not tell the truth on an application and that he was a      member of that organization  That answer says a lot    He is right that it is improper to      not tell the truth on an application  but that does not explain why      he chose to list CAP  The form does not call for him to list all      clubs and affiliations  The form used to seek political advancement      during the Reagan Administration asked for something else  a      demonstration of partisan  political commitment  It said  Please      provide any information that you regard as pertinent to your      philosophical commitment to the policies of this administration       and asked applicants whether you ever served on a political      committee or been identified in a public way with a particular      political organization  candidate or issue  That is why he      included CAP  an organization that in the mid 1980s was a place that      activists like Dinesh DSouza and other rising stars in the      conservative movement favored    Regrettably  at his hearing  and under      oath  Judge Alito evaded  He could not remember  tried to say the      right things about discrimination  stood by while his supporters      attacked the question and then watched as his supporters pushed so      hard that they made his wife break down in tears  I do not think      that the Republican Senator who pressed that awkward line of defense      intentionally meant to upset Mrs  Alito  but Republican partisans      have turned that moment that they created into a partisan weapon        Like the matters of recusal  the CAP      issue is another that Judge Alito could have put to rest by being      more forthcoming at the outset  He has never answered the question      of why he touted his membership in CAP in 1985  To me      the true answer seems obvious  Indeed  in a news account that      appeared on the last day of the hearings  his mentor at the      Department of Justice in those days admitted what was really going      on in that 1985 application  Charles Cooper  who was the Assistant      Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel and Samuel Alitos      supervisor  said  The only purpose of that essay was to satisfy      the Office of Presidential Personnel that he was simpatico with the      Reagan Administrations legal policy agenda  He went on to call      Samuel Alitos 1985 statement his essay of his political bona      fides     1985      Job Application  Judge Alitos 1985 job      application is an ideological manifesto that goes a long way to      explain why the same people on the far right who shot down the      Presidents nomination of Harriett Miers  because they were not      assured how she would rule  rushed to support Judge Alito when his      nomination was announced   Judge Alito wrote in that 1985      application that  I t has been an honor and source of personal      satisfaction for me       to help to advance legal positions in      which I personally believe very strongly  I am particularly proud      of my contributions in recent cases in which the government has      argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not      be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to an      abortion  At the age of 35  Samuel Alito was not satisfied      representing the United States through work in the office of the      Solicitor General and applied to the White House to be appointed to      be Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel      in the Meese Justice Department when Charles Cooper was the      Assistant Attorney General  He was eager to highlight his work in      the Solicitor Generals office  which should be a place where      lawyers honor the law in a nonpartisan  professional manner  rather      than seek to twist it to partisan political ends  He bragged of his      personal commitment against programs that helped to create equal      opportunities for all Americans and against the constitutional right      to privacy  including a womans right to choose  Regrettably the      Bush Administrations regime of secrecy has prevented the Judiciary      Committee  the Senate and the American people from reviewing Samuel      Alitos work product while in the Office of the Solicitor General      and Office of Legal Counsel  This was work done during a Republican      administration that litigated and lost the famous  Bob Jones University      case about tax breaks for institutions that discriminate  that lied      to Congress about the EPA and Iran Contra  that sought to overrule     Roe v  Wade  and that      sought to roll the clock back on fundamental rights to equal      protection    The hearing gave Judge Alito an      opportunity to do either of two things  He could have embraced his      statement from 1985 and his record as a judge and set      out to explain why his deferential view of presidential power and      his restrictive view of individual rights are appropriate for a      justice who is supposed to be there for all 290 million Americans       We could have had the great ideological debate that so many on the      far right seemed to want to have when the Presidents nominee was      Harriett Miers  Or he could have disavowed the 1985 job application      and much of his record as a judge and told us that he would in fact      be a check on the President and protect the fundamental      constitutional rights of all Americans  He did neither  Instead he      refused to share his views and tried to finesse his statements in      the 1985 application and limit them technically  He was so      unresponsive that commentators from across the political spectrum      have called for an end to Supreme Court confirmation hearings since      they reveal so little about the nominees thinking    For example  he said that his      statements about privacy represented his views at the time  but that      he would view the issue with an open mind as a justice with the      authority to cut back  or overrule the rights expressly recognized      in Roe v  Wade       Judge Alito never disavowed his 1985 statement that in      his legal view the Constitution does not protect a womans right to      choose  In fact  he responded to Chairman Specter that his      statement in 1985 was a true reflection of  his  views at the time      and the position that  he  held at the time    We also have his multi page memorandum      on the Thornburgh      case from his days in the Solicitor Generals office  on of the      handful that slips through the veil of secrecy that the Bush      Administration sought to construct    in which he asserts his legal      view that Roe was      wrongly decided and should be overruled  but that tactically the      better approach would be to incrementally undermine its legal      authority    This one memo is enough to demonstrate      why such material should have been produced rather than hidden by      this Administration so that the Senate and the American people would      have the nominees views and record  The Bush Administration      refuses to produce Samuel Alitos work at the Solicitor Generals      office and at the Office of Legal Counsel  Who can tell what those      other writings would reveal about the nominees legal views   The Washington Post      recently reported that Charles Cooper has now indicated that Samuel      Alito worked on defending the Reagan Administration in connection      with the Iran Contra crimes by working on legal theories so that      they would not have to inform the Congress which was investigating      in its oversight capacity  What else did Samuel Alito work on that      is being hidden from the Senate and the American people     On the issue of a womans right to      choose  we also have Judge Alitos opinion in  Casey in which he      follows the script he laid out in his memorandum to the Solicitor      General and finds no state regulation an undue burden on a womans      right to choose  Of course  the Supreme Court  including Justice      OConnor herself  were in place then to hold the line in  Casey  reaffirm  Roe and reject Judge      Alitos position    Although he would not testify what his      legal view is today  Judge Alitos answers to questions about the      precedential value of Roe  and Casey can      leave no doubt that he continues to believe that  Roe v  Wade was wrongly      decided  Even in his dry recitation of what should be routine      methodology for how a justice decides a case in which there is      precedent  he got it wrong  He left out a step  He left out the      step where the justice  knowing that there is a controlling      precedent  decides whether the precedent was correctly or      incorrectly decided  Obviously if a justice believes the preceding      case correctly decided  he has no reason to go on to make the other      calculations about weight and reliance and all the other factors      that a justice is to consider when deciding whether to overrule      past precedent  In other words  Judge Alitos testimony      presupposes that he continues to believe now what he believed in 1985       that Roe v  Wade was      wrongly decided  Otherwise his answers make no sense  A justice      does not waste time worrying about factors and weight and reliance      when he considers the precedent correctly decided  that happens only      when he is considering whether to overrule or limit that precedent         Political Issues  Similarly his contradictory testimony      at the hearing about his view were revealing about this nominee  He      went to great lengths to distance himself from his public      endorsement of Judge Borks unsuccessful nomination to the Supreme      Court  He had called Judge Bork one of the most qualified nominee      of the last century and was effusive in his praise  until asked      about it at the hearing  There he sought to backtrack  He sought      to excuse his comments as those of a political appointee supporting      his employers nominee  but had to concede that was not an accurate      explanation for his comments  Only when pressed did he concede that      he indeed thinks highly of Robert Borks candidacy     And when Senator Kohl      asked him for his views of whether the Supreme Court should have      taken the case of Bush v  Gore  his evasiveness reminded me of when I asked Clarence      Thomas whether he had ever discussed  Roe v  Wade with      anyone  Senator Kohl was not even asking his views on the holding      of that case     Conclusion   This is a pivotal constitutional      moment in our history  with a single  fundamental question  Will      the Senate serve its constitutional role and preserve the Supreme      Court as a constitutional check on the expansion of presidential      power     The reason presidential power issues      have come to dominate this confirmation process is that we have      clearly arrived now at a crucial juncture in our Nation  and on our      highest court  over the question of whether a President of the      United States is above the law  The Framers knew that unchecked      power leads to abuses and corruption  and the Supreme Court is the      ultimate check and balance in our system  Vibrant checks and      balances are instruments in protecting both the security and the      liberty of the American people    The Supreme Court is the      ultimate check and balance in our system  The independence of the      Court and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of life       The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp  and      neither should the Supreme Court     And so we owe it to the      American people of today  and the Americans of generations to come       to ask and answer several essential questions  Can this President       or any President  order illegal spying on Americans  Can this      President  or any President  authorize torture  in defiance of our      criminal statutes and our international agreements  Can this      President  or any President  defy our laws and Constitution to hold      American citizens in custody indefinitely without any court review       Can this President  or any President  choose which laws he will      follow and which he will not  by quietly writing a side statement      when he signs a bill into law  These are some of the most vital      questions of our time  and these are among the most vital questions      that confront the Senate in considering this nomination to our      highest court  Judge Alitos record  and his responses    and his      failure to adequately answer questions about these issues    are      deeply troubling    Regrettably  it seemed as if Judge      Alito approached the question of a lifetime appointment to succeed      Justice Sandra Day OConnor on the United States Supreme Court as a      job application process that resembled a political campaign with      two distinct parts  First  he had to get the nomination  which he      sought as a committed  arch conservative  and as a reliable vote in      favor of Government power  That mission was accomplished when he      was named to replace the nomination of Harriet Miers with the      support of the Presidents most extreme supporters  That was his      primary campaign  The Senate confirmation process is more the      equivalent of a general election  in which he strives to appear as      middle of the road as possible  What he did not do successfully in      my view is reconcile the two roles  I will vote against this      nominee  who I believe the President picked for his demonstrated      legal views  which are in stark contrast to the image the White      House handlers and supporters have attempted to create
