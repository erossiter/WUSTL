       Judiciary Chairman Leahy Hits Administrative Errors That Are Producing   Mounting Naturalization Application Backlogs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Judiciary Chairman Leahy       Hits Administrative Errors  That Are Producing       Mounting Naturalization Application Backlogs   Which Threaten To       Disenfranchise Many For The 2008 Elections      U S  Citizenship and       Immigration Services  USCIS  increased application fees        spurring a surge in applications which the agency was not       prepared to process  It is estimated that naturalization       applications filed after June 1  2007  will have to wait 16 to       18 months for processing  threatening the right of successful       applicants to vote in the November presidential election         PDF of letter             November 30  2007      The Honorable Michael Chertoff   Secretary   Department of Homeland Security   Washington  DC 20528      Dear Secretary Chertoff         I am concerned about the severe       backlog of naturalization applications at the U S  Citizenship       and Immigration Services  USCIS   Left unaddressed  this       backlog will likely result in thousands of applicants being       denied the right to vote in next years elections  It is       unacceptable that so many individuals  who have worked hard and       followed the law  may be disenfranchised in the upcoming       elections       It has been reported that the       agency received 1 4 million applications between October 2006       and September 2007  precipitated in part by USCIS recent fee       increase  It has also been reported that it is taking USCIS       five months or more merely to acknowledge receipt of an       application  and that legal  permanent residents who filed       naturalization applications after June 1  2007  are likely to       have to wait 16 to 18 months for their applications to be       considered  This is unacceptable  It is difficult to       understand how DHS and USCIS failed to anticipate and plan for       the applications  It is especially troubling after officials at       USCIS assured Members of Congress that your recent fee increase       was supposed to improve efficiency and customer service  Like       Hurricane Katrina and the implementation of the Western       Hemisphere Travel Initiatives  WHTI  air rule  it appears that       officials at the Department of Homeland Security have once again       been caught off guard and unprepared for foreseeable       consequences  this time due to your fee increase         I was also troubled to read that       USCIS Director Emilio Gonzalez  who expressed a desire to       resolve the backlog ahead of the national elections  has been       publicly contradicted by officials at your agency  I hope that       you share Director Gonzalezs concern and mine  There should be       an urgency to resolve the backlog now  I urge DHS to commit all       resources necessary to resolve this situation  as the State       Department did this summer to address the passport backlog       brought about by the WHTI        Please inform me of the plans you       have for resolving this backlog and provide a monthly update so       that we can measure your progress in reducing the backlog  I       would like to know the number of pending naturalization       applications and the number that have been pending for more than       six months        Sincerely              PATRICK LEAHY   Chairman
