       Leahy  Feingold Urge S E C  To Ensure Arbitration Is Voluntary                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy  Feingold Urge S E C  To     Ensure Arbitration Is Voluntary  WASHINGTON  D C   Monday  May 7   U S      Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt    and Russ Feingold  D Wisc    are urging     the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  to issue regulations to     ensure that the use of arbitration in disputes between investors and     their securities firms is voluntary    In a letter sent to SEC Chairman     Christopher Cox  Leahy  Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and     Feingold  a member of the panel  expressed concern that the SEC is not     doing enough to protect investors from contracts that strip them of     their right to litigate disputes in court  While arbitration is an     important dispute resolution alternative  Feingold and Leahy want to     make sure that investors are given a real choice in deciding whether     their cases should be resolved through arbitration or litigation  The     Senators proposed that the SEC institute a rule either banning     pre dispute  mandatory arbitration clauses or requiring that parties are     given an explicit choice between traditional judicial process and     arbitration   No consumer should be obligated to     forfeit their right to a day in court  The fact that Binding Mandatory     Arbitration clauses are pervasive in virtually all brokerage contracts     means that the rights of investors are being greatly diminished  said     Leahy  Our economys vitality is maintained in part by the availability     of competition and choice in the marketplace  I hope the SEC will take     these concerns seriously and will act to protect consumers    Investors are entitled to a real choice     when it comes to settling disputes  and the fact that there seems to be     a take it or leave it trend in brokerage contracts with investors is     very troubling  Feingold said  Arbitration can be a fair and     efficient way to handle disputes  but only when it is entered into     knowingly and voluntarily by both parties   While the SEC has taken some steps to     improve the arbitration process  it has not proactively addressed the     underlying problem that investors are being forced into arbitration      even in circumstances where the arbitration process may not be well     suited to resolve their disputes  Most large securities firms     including Fidelity  Schwab  Vanguard  Merrill Lynch  Smith Barney and     E TRADE  impose mandatory arbitration on customers as a non negotiable     term of the standard brokerage or IRA contract  On its own website  the     SEC acknowledges that investors no longer have a true choice between     arbitration or litigation  The website states   I f you have a     brokerage account  you probably signed an agreement that requires you to     settle any disputes with your broker through arbitration rather than the     courts    In light of the prevalence of mandatory     arbitration clauses in brokerage contracts  Feingold and Leahy believe     the SEC should issue regulations that will adequately protect the rights     of investors to choose whether or not to use arbitration   The Leahy Feingold letter concerning     mandatory arbitration provisions in contracts between investors and     securities firms comes on the heels of reports that SEC Chairman Cox is     considering proposals to allow publicly traded companies to change their     bylaws to require shareholders to submit disputes with management to     arbitration  House Banking Committee Chairman Barney Frank expressed     strong opposition to that proposal in a letter to Cox last week
