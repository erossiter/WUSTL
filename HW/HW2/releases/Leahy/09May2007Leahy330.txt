       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy ON National Guard Equipment Stocks                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick    Leahy    Co Chair  Senate National Guard Caucus    On National Guard Equipment Stocks   May 9  2007  Mr  President  yesterday the President of the United    States  through his spokesperson  blatantly dismissed the all too real    concerns of Governor Sebelius of Kansas about the equipment levels available    to our National Guard for dealing with such emergencies at home as the    horrible disaster that befell Greensburg  Kansas several days ago  The    White House spokesperson essentially said there was no problem  and that the    Guard has considerable equipment stocks still available  That assertion is    just absurd on a number of levels  and the reality is that Guard faces real     incontrovertible shortfalls in vital equipment   First  the Governors and their Adjutant Generals  the    heads of the National Guard in their respective states  are reporting    something quite different  State after state after state reports missing    HUMVEES  medium sized trucks  generators  dump trucks  and communications    systems  These are not just claims from any old observer on Guard issues     These are the leaders who have been elected by the people to provide for    their security and deal with these sometimes terrifying state emergencies     The governors command the Guard when operating in a State  and we have to    give special credence to what they say   The idea that there is no problem is equally ridiculous    because it has been clearly documented that there is a very real  24 billion    equipment shortfall in Army National Guard equipment alone  reports that    dont take into consideration the shortfalls within the Air National Guard     The active Army and the National Guard agree on this figure  It was    developed together with the National Guard Bureau working closely with the    Army staff  Well  the number is clear  but guess what  There no    plans to address this shortfall in the long range budget  No plans to buy    the 18 000 needed HUMVEES  no plans to obtain the 30 000 medium sized    trucks  no plans to purchase the 12 000 required generators  no plans to    purchase the 62 000 communications sets  the list goes on  Another reason that the White Houses assessment of    Guard Equipment issues is so flawed is that everyone  from the Guard    leadership to the Army leadership to members here on the Hill  knows that     very frequently  equipment slated for the Guard never actually makes it to    the Guard because it is diverted  transferred to the active force before it    gets into Guard stocks  And even when the Guard equipment makes into the Guard    stocks  it is often quickly turned around and sent right back off to Iraq     along with deploying Guard units  many of which now face their second Iraq    deployment  I wish the President and the White House would come to    fully recognize this reality  Heres the real situation when it comes to    National Guard Equipment  The Guard does not have adequate stocks to deal    with emergencies to the forces full potential  In a smaller scale    disaster  the National Guard cannot respond as quickly to support first    responders and local law enforcement  This is what we saw recently in    Kansas  In a larger scale emergency  something like another Hurricane    Katrina or  God forbid  two large simultaneous disasters  the Guard will be    hard pressed to respond as well at did along the Gulf Coast almost two years    ago  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates maintained this    morning in his appearance before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee    that the Guard has 56 percent of it equipment stocks available  That figure    contradicts everything I have heard from other responsible officials  which    puts the figure at closer to 35 percent   In the latest supplemental spending bill  which the    President seemed happy to veto  I worked with my colleague on the National    Guard Caucus Senator Bond and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to add     1 billion for Army Guard Equipment purchases  That funding would go    directly for dealing with that  24 billion shortfall  Because this is by no    means a partisan issue  we are going to work very hard to make sure that    funding remains in whatever spending bill we eventually complete  However  I will tell you this  It is going to be darn    hard  darn hard  to be able to deal with this issue if the White House    does not recognize its responsibilities and start working with Congress more    cooperatively  More importantly  it would be really helpful for the White    House to stop showing contempt for the views of our nations elected    governors  take their good input  and respect their thoughts on the Guard     given place as the commanders of the National Guard in their state  Lets turn this situation around and come up with a new    place to replenish depleted Guard equipment stocks  We cannot continue to    let our Guard down
