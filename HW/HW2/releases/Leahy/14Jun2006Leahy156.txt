       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Reconsidering Our Communications Laws    Ensuring Competition And Innovation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Hearing On      Reconsidering Our Communications Laws       Ensuring Competition And Innovation      June 14  2006  Mr  Chairman  I was one of only       five Senators to vote against the 1996 Telecom Act     Back then  I argued that the Acts       promise of promoting competition and increasing innovation was a       false promise  I argued that the Act would allow the local       regional bells to easily reunite with unregulated local monopoly       powers    I pointed out that rural consumers       would be worse off  that cable and phone rates would increase        and that mergers would reduce competition  Unfortunately  I was       right    We must not make the same mistakes       again    Today  many Americans have no       choice whatsoever in broadband service  while others have only       two options    The Internet is the ultimate       marketplace of ideas  Everyone has equal access  every voice       can speak  and be heard  Its a place where a better idea  a       better service or a better application can succeed on its merits        not because it has a special financial relationship with one       or two broadband providers    I have been enthusiastic about the       Internet and its potential to make our lives better in so many       realms  The Internet has opened windows to the world in       one room schoolhouses in  Vermont  and new doors of       knowledge and opportunity to children from Africa to Indonesia         I have worked from the start of       the Internet age to keep the governments hands off the       Internet  The Internet was largely conceived in the  United States  and when the       U S  Government seeks to regulate the Internet in any way  the       world closely watches    That gives us a special obligation       to act with care and with as much foresight as we can muster       when the Internet is involved    We have arrived at another       juncture in which Congress faces decisions on the Internets       future  The triple play of being able to offer video TV and       movies  telephone  and Internet service raises the risk that       telephone or cable companies will bundle all three services       together and not allow each service to compete on its own       merits    It is more important than ever       that the Congress focus on the best interests of consumers         This Committee must help ensure       that the Internets marketplace of ideas and commerce remains       effective and vibrant    The resolution of the issues       raised today will determine who is in control of electronic       access to our homes and small businesses  Will consumers be in       control  or will a very few large corporations control that       information link    This is not a hypothetical       problem  Corporations have legal duties to shareholders  If       they can maximize shareholder return  even if it means fewer       choices for consumers  they will    The Supreme Courts  Brand X decision       effectively permits broadband service providers to discriminate       against competing content  applications and other service       providers  One executive  the head of ATT  has made it clear       he will exercise control over that so called last mile into       each home    The discrimination may take many       forms  including slower exchange of traffic from unfavored       content providers  direct blocking of lawful websites  and added       fees for access    This would represent a dramatic       shift in the policy that has propelled the success of the       Internet    It is both enlightening and  from       a consumer perspective  frightening to review the assertions of       a White Paper issued by Cisco Systems  This White Paper made       clear that Cisco is poised to offer companies such as Verizon        ATT  ComCast  TimeWarner and others the ability in real time       to know  the identity and profile of the individual       subscriber  what the subscriber is doing  where the       subscriber resides  and their service level  either fast or       slow  Cisco can also give these giants the technology to limit       unprofitable peer to peer communications    So why wouldnt Congress just vote       to keep those pipelines into homes and small businesses open   The reason is simple  The major       telecom and cable providers are threatening to refuse to invest       in improvements or expansions unless they can reap big profits       by charging rates based on how the Internet is used     I strongly believe they will make       those investments anyway  Certainly Verizon will make those       investments  according to Vice Chairman Larry Babbio  He has       said that Verizon is in the midst of spending billions of       dollars on upgrades  with its posted revenue of  68 billion just       last year alone  He said that Verizon has the goal of bringing       fiber to every home it serves  Not to the last mile  not to       the curb  but to the home  It is fortunate for them that the       costs of investing in fiber have been reduced by a factor of 10       over the last several years   Verizon and ATT certainly have       some money to reinvest  they have each paid about  13 billion       in dividends 2003 through 2005       and bought back hundreds of millions worth of their stock  I       would like to put in the record financial data on those firms         I applaud the telephone companies       for their interest in entering the video market  but the       opportunity comes with an obligation  We cannot allow       competitors in this highly concentrated market to compete only       for affluent  urban residents  Competition should benefit       everyone    Mr  Chairman  a number of issues       raised in Chairman Stevens bill are squarely within the       jurisdiction of this Committee  Chairman Sensenbrenner ran into       a similar situation in the other body    I look forward to working with the       members of this Committee to put forward a strong bill along the       lines of Chairman Sensenbrenners effort to protect consumers        competition  and the Internet  and I look forward to hearing       from our witnesses today as our work goes forward
