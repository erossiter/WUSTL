       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Modern Enforcement Of   The Voting Rights Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On The Modern Enforcement Of The Voting Rights Act      May 10  2006  Yesterday  we held our second in a       series of hearings on reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  and       today the Committee proceeds with our third hearing  It was one       week ago that we joined in the bipartisan introduction of       S 2703  which was cosponsored by both the Majority Leader and       the Democratic Leader of the Senate  The bill already has 34       cosponsors  including a majority of the Members of this       Committee  This exemplifies the widespread support in Congress       for reauthorizing the most successful civil rights legislation       in our Nations history    This week our counterparts in the       House Judiciary Committee are proceeding to markup on the       companion legislation  H R 9  which was introduced last Tuesday       by Chairman Sensenbrenner and Representative Conyers and which       has 95 House       cosponsors  There are reports that some will attempt to       undercut our bicameral  bipartisan efforts  In particular  I       worry that some will detrimentally seek to undermine the       remedial provisions in Section 203 that help language minorities       achieve full participation in our democracy  We will hear today       from a representative of the Bush Administrations Justice       Department about how valuable those provisions are and about the       Administrations endorsement of their renewal and extension         Recently President Bush said       publicly that he wants to make sure the Voting Rights Act is       strong and capable and that it ought to be extended        Attorney General Gonzales listed extending the Voting Rights Act       as one of the Department of Justices 2006 priorities and said       we will push for reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  one       of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation in       our history  When testifying before the House  Acting       Assistant Attorney General Schlozman noted that the Department       of Justice is proud of the role it plays in enforcing this       statute and that the Bush Administration is very supportive of       reauthorization    This is an important matter on       which there is bipartisan agreement  I look forward to our       concluding our supplemental hearings next week and proceeding to       report our Voting Rights Act reauthorization bill before       Memorial Day     There are few things       as critical to the fabric of our Nation  and to American       citizenship  as voting  The right to vote and to have your vote       count is a foundational right because it secures the       effectiveness of other protections  The legitimacy of our       government is dependent on the access all Americans have to the       political process    Yesterday  we heard testimony       about the importance of the expiring provisions of the Act  The       Voting Rights Act has made substantial strides in preventing       overt discrimination but our work is far from complete  We       heard yesterday about a Section  5 case decided by the Eighth       Circuit just last week  There are still too many examples in       which covered jurisdictions would have enacted retrogressive       voting procedures if not for the preclearance provisions in       Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act    In addition  recent Section 203       lawsuits have contributed to considerable voter turnout and       voter registration increases among language minorities  The       continuing need for the expiring provisions cannot be       overstated  Although there is sharp disagreement on the other       side of the aisle concerning immigration reform legislation  I       hope that we can all agree to reauthorize Section 203 to       continue progress and inclusion of citizens from our language       minorities who add so much to American life  Their rights as       American citizens  including the right to vote  are no less       precious than anyone elses rights    We welcome Assistant Attorney       General Wan Kim  I regret that the Attorney General chose not       to appear before us on the important matter of renewing the       Voting Rights Act  but we welcome Mr  Kim back to the Committee        where he staffed Republican Senators    Today we also welcome the       testimony of several civil rights practitioners  I am       especially glad that we will be able to hear from the authors of       three state reports that cover the far reaches of this country        Robert McDuff is a well respected civil rights attorney in      Jackson        Mississippi  He has argued several times before the Supreme       Court  the most recent case involving a Mississippi       redistricting plan  Juan Cartagena has been the General Counsel       for the Community Service Society for the past 15 years where he       has directed public interest litigation on issues including       voting rights  housing and environmental issues  Finally  we       are pleased to have Natalie Landreth  an attorney for the Native       American Rights Fund  who is working on developing tribal       education departments and tribal codes in two Alaskan       localities  We thank you all for traveling to be with us today       on short notice and look forward to your testimony
