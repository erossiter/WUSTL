       Senate Panel Holds FBI Oversight Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Senate Panel Holds FBI      Oversight Hearing    Director Mueller Faces Questions      On Troubling IG Report      Showing FBIs Improper Use Of National Security Letters    WASHINGTON       Tuesday  March 27   The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing      Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation     on Tuesday with FBI Director      Robert Mueller    Senator Patrick      Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the Committee  questioned Mueller on      several issues including recent reports that the FBI submitted      inaccurate information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court to obtain secret warrants in terrorism and espionage cases  as      well as the troubling findings of a recent audit by the Justice      Departments Inspector Generals that found the FBI had improperly      and illegally used National Security Letters  NSLs     From the FBIs      illegal and improper use of NSLs  to the Bureaus failure to be      accountable for and secure its own computers and weapons  to the      politically motivated dismissal of eight of the Nations U S       Attorneys  there are growing concerns about the competence of the      FBI and the independence of the Department of Justice  said Leahy       This pattern of abuse of authority and mismanagement causes me  and      many others on both sides of the aisle  to wonder whether the FBI      and Department of Justice have been faithful trustees of the great      trust that the Congress and American people have placed in them to      keep our Nation safe  while respecting the privacy rights and civil      liberties of all Americans        Chairman Leahys hearing statement  as prepared  is below  His      statement and witness testimony can be accessed at              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On FBI Oversight     March 27  2007     The Committee      today continues its crucial oversight role of the Department of      Justice with this hearing to examine the FBIs effectiveness in      carrying out its domestic intelligence and law enforcement mission       I thank the FBI Director for appearing before us today  I look      forward to hearing his views on the Bureaus problems and progress       I also thank the hard working men and women of the FBI  who have      been working long hours  day after day  week after week  year after      year  to help keep our citizens and communities safe     Almost six years      after the September 11th attacks  it troubles all of us      that the FBI has not yet lived up to its promise to be the      world class domestic intelligence agency that the American people      expect and need it to be  This morning  we learned from a report in     The Washington Post      that the FBI has repeatedly submitted inaccurate information to the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  FISC  in its efforts to      obtain secret warrants in terrorism and espionage cases    severely      undermining the Governments credibility in the eyes of the Chief      Judge of that Court    This failure      compounds the serious concerns raised in recent months about the      management and priorities of this Department of Justice  From the      FBIs illegal and improper use of National Security Letters  NSLs        to the Bureaus failure to be accountable for and secure its own      computers and weapons  to the politically motivated dismissal of      eight of the Nations U S  Attorneys  there are growing concerns      about the competence of the FBI and the independence of the      Department of Justice  This pattern of abuse of authority and      mismanagement causes me  and many others on both sides of the aisle       to wonder whether the FBI and Department of Justice have been      faithful trustees of the great trust that the Congress and American      people have placed in them to keep our Nation safe  while respecting      the privacy rights and civil liberties of all Americans   And it is more      than just the FBI that deserves scrutiny for the abuses and lack of      competence that have come to light just in recent weeks  Last year      the Administration sought new powers in the PATRIOT Act to appoint      U S  Attorneys without Senate confirmation  and to more freely use      National Security Letters  The Administration got these powers  and      they have badly bungled both    National Security Letters  One of my      priorities in the first PATRIOT Act was to improve oversight and      accountability  Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I      insisted on  and succeeded  in adding sunset provisions to the      PATRIOT Act  which is why Congress had to review and reauthorize      several of the Acts most sweeping powers  In the recent      reauthorization of the Act  one of my priorities  working      especially with then Chairman Specter    was to retain sunset      provisions and to supplement them with new sunshine provisions  to      require the Justice Department to report to the Congress and to the      American people on how several of the Acts powers are being used       The Inspector Generals audit and report on National Security      Letters was one of these new requirements we added to the law  and      the troubling findings of that audit are why we are here today        I am deeply      disturbed by the Justice Department Inspector Generals report      finding widespread illegal and improper use of NSLs to obtain      Americans phone and financial records  The Inspector General found     22 separate instances where the FBI improperly abused NSLs in      his offices review of just 77 FBI files  Not a single one      of these violations had been reported by the FBI      Even more      troubling is that the violations the Inspector General uncovered are      probably just the tip of the iceberg  When he appeared before      Congress last week  Inspector General Glenn Fine testified that      there could be thousands of additional violations among the tens of      thousands of NSLs that the FBI is now using each year   The Inspector      General also found widespread use by the FBI of so called exigent      letters  These letters  which are not authorized by any statute       were issued at least 739 times to obtain Americans phone      records when there was often no emergency and never a follow up      subpoena  as promised in the letters  Despite these extensive      abuses  the top leadership at the FBI sat idly by for years  doing      nothing to stop this practice  In fact   The Washington Post      recently reported that FBI counterterrorism officials continued to      use the exigent letters  even though FBI lawyers and managers      expressed reservations about this practice as early as 2004   These abuses are      unacceptable  I look forward to Director Muellers explanation of      how they occurred and what the FBI is doing    now that our      oversight required a public report of these failures  to ensure      that these abuses and violations never happen again      Lack of Accountability    Lost Laptops      and Weapons  The pattern of      incompetence and lack of accountability within the Department and at      the Bureau is also on display with the FBIs treatment of its own      equipment and weapons  Another recent report by the Justice      Departments Inspector General found that the FBI cannot account      for 160 laptop computers and an equal number of weapons that      were lost or stolen over a three and a half year period  This      finding comes four years after the Inspector General recommended      that the FBI take steps to ensure the security of this equipment       Even more troubling  Inspector General Fine found that in many      cases  the FBI could not even determine whether its lost or stolen      computers contained classified or sensitive information  putting      Bureau employees and other individuals at risk of becoming victims      of identity theft and potentially compromising national security      information     Counterterrorism and Sentinel  These reports      make it clear that the FBI is still not as strong and as equipped as      it must be to fulfill its counterterrorism mission  The FBI still      lags far behind where it needs to be when it comes to the number of      agents that it has who are proficient in Arabic       Last month  the Office of Inspector General also found that the FBI      did not accurately report its terrorism related convictions and      other terrorism statistics in 2004    In addition       years after 9 11  the FBI still does not have the information      technology that it needs to function efficiently in the Information      Age  Inspector General Fine found that the database that the FBI      used to track NSLs malfunctioned  making it impossible to keep track      of these letters  And  just recently  we learned a familiar piece      of news regarding the FBIs project to upgrade its computer system       Apparently there will be delays in the deployment of Phase I of the      FBIs Sentinel computer upgrade program  possibly jeopardizing the      schedule for this much needed computer system  This latest setback      is one of a string of costly delays in the FBIs efforts to upgrade      its computers  The Sentinel project was supposed to be different       Sentinel was launched after watching the FBI waste five years and      millions of taxpayer dollars on the failed Trilogy program  I      remain seriously concerned about this project      Conclusion  The FBI is again      at a crossroads  Because of these  and other  shortcomings  some      are calling on Congress to take away the FBIs domestic intelligence      functions altogether and to create a separate domestic intelligence      agency like Britains MI5  Last week the leading Republican on this      oversight Committee questioned whether Director Mueller is up to the      job    Acknowledging      shortcomings is well and good    and Director Mueller now says that      he takes responsibility for the egregious violations that occurred      regarding the handling of NSLs  as he should  But the Bureau         and the Department as a whole    must also learn from its mistakes      if progress is to be made  The time has come for demonstrable      progress by the Bureau on a learning curve that has gone on and on      for far too long   Much work remains      to be done and this Committee intends to fulfill its obligation to      the American people to carefully examine all of these issues  Not      having answers to our questions from our last oversight hearing      three months ago is not the way to make progress  As I said to      Director Mueller in my letter to him several weeks ago  I want the      FBI to be the best that it can be  and oversight is part of the      formula that is needed for achieving the improvements we need
