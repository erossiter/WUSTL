       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Amendment 2022  The Habeas Corpus   Restoration Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Judiciary Committee      On Amendment 2022  The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act Of 2007  To      H R  1585     Senate Floor      September 19  2007     At the beginning of this debate  I      said that Congress committed a historic error when it eliminated the      Great Writ of habeas corpus not just for those detained at      Guantanamo Bay  but also for millions of permanent legal residents      here in the United States  Listening to the arguments these last      few days of those opposed to restoring habeas rights  it becomes      ever more apparent that this was a mistake the last Congress and the      administration made based on fear   Opponents make the alarmist argument      that if we permit people to challenge their detention in federal      court  we will jeopardize our national security and place ourselves      in greater danger  In fact  the opposite is true   We have heard these kinds of arguments      before during trying and turbulent times in American history  such      as when the government shamefully interned tens of thousands of      Japanese Americans during World War II  We should know by now that      it hurts this country  and especially our men and women in uniform       when we allow public policy to be guided by fear  rather than by      American values and freedoms    The critics of habeas restoration      resort to scare tactics because they know that history and the facts      are against them  The truth is that casting aside the time honored      protection of habeas corpus makes us more vulnerable as a nation      because it leads us away from our core American values and calls      into question our historic role as a defender of human rights around      the world  It also allows our enemies to accomplish something they      could never achieve on a battlefield  whittling away the liberties      that make us who we are   The need for the Great Writ has never      been stronger than it is today  We have an Administration that at      every opportunity has aggressively sought unchecked Executive power       while working to erode or eliminate constitutionally enshrined      checks on that power by the courts and by Congress  Stripping away      habeas rights  which allow people to go to court to challenge      detention by the executive  is just the latest brazen attempt in a      six year long effort to consolidate power in the Executive Branch       Congress has too often been complicit in this effort  and I hope we      will begin to reverse this trend now   The writ of habeas corpus is not some      special benefit to be honored only when it is convenient  As no      less a conservative than Justice Antonin Scalia has written   t he      very core of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of separated      powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of      the Executive  Habeas has served for centuries to protect      individuals against unlawful exercises of state power    Habeas corpus is the only common law      writ enshrined in the Constitution  Article I  section 9 provides      that the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended  unless when      in Cases of rebellion or invasion the public Safety may require      it  The Judiciary Act of 1789 specifically empowered federal      courts to issue writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an      inquiry into the cause of commitment  In more than two centuries      since then  habeas has only been suspended four times  all of them      at times of active rebellion or invasion  Even this Administration      does not claim that we are at such a point now    The Military Commissions Act of 2006      spurned centuries of tradition and empowered the Executive to detain      non citizens  potentially forever  with no meaningful check by      another branch of government  With this Act  Congress permanently      eliminated the right of habeas corpus for any non citizen determined      to be an enemy combatant  or even awaiting such a determination       So a mere accusation by the Executive is enough to keep a person in      custody indefinitely  and that detention is not subject to review       As our Founders knew well  no administration can be trusted with      that kind of power   The Specter Leahy amendment would      restore the proper balance of power between the branches of      Government by re establishing the law on habeas as it existed prior      to the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military      Commissions Act  It creates no new legal rights  The U S  Supreme      Court confirmed in the Rasul      case that American and British courts have routinely assumed      jurisdiction over habeas claims made by aliens    British courts in the 18th      Century considered habeas claims of aliens held as enemy combatants       as did the United States Supreme Court during World War Two  These      courts considered habeas claims of alien enemy combatants who had      already received military trials  meaning even before their habeas      claims  they had already received more process than most non citizen      detainees will ever get now  Our first Chief Justice  John      Marshall  in one instance granted relief to an alien enemy combatant      bringing a habeas claim  In most of these historical cases  though       habeas petitioners lost and were not granted any relief  and indeed      most habeas petitioners have their claims dismissed with a simple       one page ruling from a judge  This historical record is evidence      that habeas can be relied upon as a necessary  but entirely      reasonable  check on executive power    As in the past  non citizen detainees      alleged to be enemy combatants should at least have the right to go      into an independent court to assert that they are being held in      error  And  as in the past  a court will only grant habeas relief      if the petitioner is able to in fact establish this error  If the      detainees held at Guantanamo truly are the worst of the worst of our      enemies  surely it will be easy for the government to make a      baseline showing in court that they are lawfully detained  Of      course  senior government and military officials have told the press      a story very different from the party line  They have told the  New York Times that the      government detained many of the Guantanamo detainees in error   In any case  the sweep of the Military      Commissions Act goes well beyond the few hundred detainees currently      held at Guantanamo Bay  It threatens the civil liberties of an      estimated 12 million lawful permanent residents of the United States      who work and pay taxes in this country  Under current law  any of      these people can be detained forever  without the ability to      challenge their detention in federal court  simply on the      Executives say so  As we heard from Professor Mariano Florentino      Cuellar at the Judiciary Committees hearing on this issue  this is      of particular concern to the Latino community  which includes so      many of the hard working lawful permanent residents in this      country   The cursory review process set up by      Congress for detainees  called combatant status review tribunals or      CSRTs  is no substitute for habeas corpus because  among many other      deficiencies  it does not provide a neutral arbiter  a federal      judge  to review the factual record for error  This summer       Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Abraham  a military lawyer who      participated in the CSRT process  said in a sworn affidavit that the      evidence presented to CSRTs lack s  even the most fundamental      earmarks of objectively credible evidence  He also said that      superiors pressured the officers on review panels to find detainees      to be enemy combatants  That is neither just nor fair  and rigged      tribunals are not the way this country has ever dispensed justice       nor the way it should  Court review allowed under current law that      relies on the findings of such a flawed system falls well short of      the independent review that our system of checks and balances      demands    Restoring habeas would send a clear      message that when we promote democracy and the importance of human      rights to the rest of the world  we are practicing what we preach       We need to listen to our military leaders and foreign policy      specialists on this point  Former Navy Judge Advocate General      Donald Guter told the Judiciary Committee in May that by stripping      even our enemies of basic rights  we are providing a pretext for      those who capture our troops or civilians to deny them basic      rights  William H  Taft IV  former Deputy Secretary of Defense      under President George H  W  Bush  and a former State Department      advisor in the current administration  told us that stripping the      courts of habeas jurisdiction sacrificed an important opportunity to      enhance the credibility of our detention system  Restoring habeas      to detainees will improve our strategic and diplomatic position in      the world and remove a rallying point for our enemies    The right to habeas corpus is a      limited right  Habeas does not give a person the right to a trial       It does not give a habeas petitioner a right to personally appear in      court  and it most certainly does not mean that U S  servicemen and      women will be pulled from the battlefield to testify in such      proceedings  All the government must do to defeat a habeas claim is      demonstrate to a judge by a preponderance of the evidence that the      detainee is being lawfully held  Most habeas petitions are rejected      by the federal courts without the need to call a single witness  In      fact  habeas petitions can be  and routinely are  disposed of in      federal court based on a single affidavit by a government agent      explaining the basis for detention  Habeas simply provides an      opportunity for a detainee to argue to an independent federal judge      that he or she is being held in error  If the detainee is properly      held  this is a claim the government can easily overcome   Recent history makes clear that      restoring habeas will not invite habeas litigation from abroad  as      some have claimed  The Supreme Court found habeas jurisdiction at      Guantanamo Bay because Guantanamo is  for all intents and purposes       a U S  territory  U S  courts have found no habeas jurisdiction in      cases of detainees captured  detained  and held in Iraq  There was      no flood of international habeas petitions following the 2004  Rasul decision      validating the extension of habeas rights to Guantanamo  and there      will not be if habeas is restored now    Guantanamo detainees had      habeas rights until those rights were conclusively taken away last      year  Between 2002 and late 2006  these claims were handled by      judges in the U S  District Court in Washington  D C  The judges in      that court released no detainees  and they issued no orders      compelling the government to alter the detainees conditions of      confinement  Habeas is a necessary and appropriate check on      Executive power  but it is a far cry from a get out of jail free      card     Opponents of habeas restoration      suggest that other countries will not open their courts to petitions      from enemy aliens  But if a foreign country imprisoned an American       say  an aid worker  a nurse or a civilian contract employee  and      held that person without charge as a combatant simply because he      or she supported the U S  military  the U S  Government would surely      demand that the American have a chance to go to court  By denying      basic rights to alien detainees  we encourage other nations to do      the same to American civilians  and they will   Critics of the Specter Leahy bill also      point to released detainees who they assert went back to the      battlefield  as a reason not to restore habeas rights  But the      truth is that those Guantanamo detainees who have been released      since 9 11 have been freed by the military following its own      process  not by federal judges on habeas review    The critics assertions that habeas      proceedings in federal court will somehow lead to the sharing of      classified information with terrorists is merely fear mongering       This argument demeans our federal judiciary and ignores the      procedures established by Congress to insure that classified      information is safeguarded in federal proceedings  Federal judges      have significant discretion in determining what kinds of evidence to      consider  and what witnesses  if any  to allow for a habeas claim       Many detainee habeas claims could therefore be resolved with no      recourse to classified documents at all  Where classified evidence      is relevant  all federal judges are cleared to view such      information  and they are well equipped to deal with it without      compromising national security   We must not succumb to baseless       fear driven arguments  The sky will not fall if we vote to restore      habeas  Quite the contrary  Congress will take a positive step      toward returning to our core American values of liberty  due      process  and checks and balances  In doing so  we will increase      Americas security and bolster our place in the world  That is why      this amendment has support from across the political and ideological      spectrum   I thank Senator Dodd  Senator      Menendez  and Senator Specter for coming to the floor and eloquently      calling for a return to basic American values and the rule of law       Yesterday  41 Republicans voted to filibuster a bill that would have      given the hundreds of thousands of residents of the District of      Columbia the fundamental right to vote for Congress  I hope they      will not follow that sad day with a filibuster today of legislation      to restore the fundamental right of someone held by the government      without charge to go to court   The most daunting challenge in the age      of terrorism is to strike the proper balance between maintaining our      national security against very real threats and preserving the civil      liberties that are the proudest legacy of our Founders  More than      ever  in the wake of September 11th  we must remain      vigilant against security threats  but we must never forget that our      values are the foundation that makes our nation strong  Now is the      time to reaffirm those values by renewing this countrys      fundamental  longstanding commitment to habeas corpus review  I      urge every Senator to support the Specter Leahy amendment to restore      habeas corpus
