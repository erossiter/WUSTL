       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Hearing On Expanding Openess In   Government And Freedom Of Information                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Hearing On Expanding Openness In Government And Freedom Of Information         Subcommittee On Terrorism  Technology And Homeland Security        Tuesday  March 15  2005 I am glad that whatever the weather  the Senate        Judiciary Committee is participating in Sunshine Week by means of this        hearing and our efforts to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act  This        past weekend  in addition to the NCAA ski championships held in Vermont and        a number of NCAA basketball conference tournaments around the country  most        Americans saw in the Parade Magazine in their Sunday newspapers a reminder        that sunshine is a great disinfectant to abuses of power and wrongdoing         The weekly magazine reminded us of a story it ran in January 2004 about a        Massachusetts couple who relied on state FOIA laws to expose their towns        plans to reopen a dormant and potentially polluted landfill  The story        spotlights the power of and the need for government sunshine laws   I am delighted to join the Senator from Texas in our        efforts to strengthen and improve our open government laws  This is the        first Judiciary Committee hearing on the Freedom of Information Act  which        we call FOIA  since 1992  There has not been significant legislation        regarding FOIA since 1996  when I was the principal author of the        Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments  a set of modifications        that updated FOIA for the Internet Age  In recent years  I have fought        against the rolling back of citizens rights in this regard  and expressed        concerns in 2002 over a bipartisan agreement in the Homeland Security        legislation that was contrary to those efforts  Until this year  I have        been unable to convince a single Republican to join my effort  Senator        Cornyn and I have now cosponsored two FOIA bills together  we are building        a great bipartisan partnership  You can be sure that I will keep working        on him to join me on this third bill  the Restore FOIA Act  which I plan to        reintroduce today   The enactment of FOIA was a watershed moment for        democracy  This bulwark of open government is under assault  Liberals and        conservatives both recognize a dangerous trend toward over classification         at enormous cost to the taxpayers and risk to our citizens  On March 3         2005  J  William Leonard  the Director of Information Security Oversight         testified before a House committee that the number of classification        decisions has increased from nine million in 2001 to 16 million in 2004         In 2003 alone  the cost of classifying documents was  7 billion   Preserving our right to open government is not only        significant in the area of national security  Some of the most important        revelations discovered through FOIA requests directly impact our cities and        neighborhoods  When the public is shut out  bad things happen  That was        the subject of the Parade Magazine story I mentioned a few moments        ago  about Linda and Mike Raymond  who live in Woburn  Massachusetts         Their town is a blue collar suburb of Boston best known as the setting for        the book and film  A Civil Action  In the 1980s  after rates of        leukemia spiked upward  local industries were sued for polluting the areas        water  Four years ago the Raymonds discovered that the citys landfill         dormant for 15 years  was bustling with truck traffic  Linda Raymond        contacted Woburn officials  but they stonewalled her  The Raymonds relied        on the state FOIA law to get answers  They educated the community and held        public officials accountable  The Raymonds triumph spotlights the power        of and the need for government sunshine laws   This is a success story from the states  but there is        much work to be done to ensure that our Federal FOIA law is properly        enforced  A month ago  Senator Cornyn and I introduced S 394  the OPEN        Government Act of 2005  It is a collection of commonsense modifications        designed to update FOIA and improve the timely processing of FOIA requests        by Federal agencies  It was drafted after a long and thoughtful process of        consultation with individuals and organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain        information and share it with the public  including the news media         librarians  and public interest organizations representing all facets of        the political spectrum  Chief among the problems with FOIA implementation is        agency delay  In 2003  a non governmental organization  the National        Security Archive  looked into just how long some FOIA requests are left        unfulfilled  The group  which is represented on our panel today  found        that the oldest requests dated back to the late 1980s  before the collapse        of the Soviet Union  The oldest of these was a request to the FBI for        information on the Bureaus activities at the University of California         First filed in November 1987  this request was partially fulfilled in 1996        after extensive litigation  According to the National Security Archive         the documents that were released revealed unlawful FBI intelligence        activities and the efforts to cover up such conduct  After a 2002 article        in the San Francisco Chronicle  and inquiries from Senator        Feinstein  the Bureau acknowledged that there were at least 17 000 pages of        records that still had not been produced  Since then  some data has been        released  but the requestor recently told me that he believes more than        15 000 pages remain outstanding   This is an example of a more extreme case  but delays        are too commonplace in the system  Last week  Senator Cornyn and I        introduced a second bill  S 589  the Faster FOIA Act  which would create a        commission to study agency delay  The commission would be charged with        reviewing  among other facets  the system of processing fees and fee        waivers  which are often cited as causes of delay and are sometimes the        subject of litigation  Over the past two years  at my request  the        Government Accountability Office  GAO  has reviewed the available data on        fee issues  I am grateful for their efforts and look forward to the        results of their study later this year   One of the problems faced by GAO  and anyone else who        has looked into agency delay  is the lack of comprehensive reporting data         We address this problem in the Open Government Act  by calling for more        detailed reporting from agencies on FOIA processing  The commission        created by the Faster FOIA Act will serve to ensure all voices are heard as        we craft future modifications to strengthen the law   Earlier  I mentioned a third piece of legislation that        deserves serious consideration in this Congress  After 9 11  we saw the        single greatest rollback of FOIA in history tucked into the charter for the        Department of Homeland Security  This provision created an opportunity for        big polluters or other offenders to hide mistakes from public view just by        stamping critical infrastructure information at the top of the page when        they submit information to the Department  I am fighting to repeal this        law and replace it with a reasonable compromise called the Restore FOIA        Act  which would protect both sensitive information and the publics right        to know  The OPEN Government Act  the bill Senator Cornyn and I introduced        together in February  takes one step forward by requiring reports on the        laws use  but Restore FOIA is a more comprehensive approach and I will        continue to push for its enactment   The Constitution reflects the Founders confidence in        a government that welcomes rather than fears dissenting or offensive        views  The publics right to know  backed up by FOIA  is a cornerstone of        our democracy  guaranteeing a free flow of information that delivers        Americas promise of government by  of  and for the people   No generation can afford to take these protections for        granted  because they can quickly and easily be taken away  once gone         they are difficult to get back  The recent damage done to FOIA will take        great effort to undo  But I hope it can always be said that each        generation of Americans did all that it could to preserve the publics        right to know for the next generation of Americans
